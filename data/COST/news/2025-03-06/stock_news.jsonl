In addition to being one of the largest retailers in the world, Costco is also the most popular location to purchase just about anything in bulk, from peanut butter to clothes. Key Points If you are a true die-hard Costco brand fan, you’ll visit all of these locations in your lifetime. There is something truly special about visiting a Costco with a sinkhole in its parking lot. One Costco has a soccer field built on the building so that you can shop and play on the same day. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) From the start, Costco stands out thanks to its outstanding food court, samples, rotisserie chicken, Kirkland-branded everything, and cheap gas prices. It’s hard to argue that Costco is anything but special. Of course, this begs the question of which Costco stores must be visited in 2025 if you are truly a fan of this brand. 10. South San Francisco Location: South Airport Boulevard Store size: 170,000 square feet Highlights: Unusually large selection of tech gadgets and electronics, health and wellness center Store hours: 9:00 AM – 7:00 PM Electronics Everywhere Located in Silicon Valley, the heart of America’s tech heartbeat, Costco’s South Airport Boulevard location in San Francisco strongly emphasizes gadgets. There is a good chance you’ll find plenty of gadgets here you won’t find populating the aisles of any other Costco store since this location is said to experiment with new products to gauge a broader customer appeal. 9. Tiquilla, Mexico Location: Tiquilla, Mexico Store size: 175,000 square feet Highlights: Mexico-inspired foot court with plenty of local flavor and a terrific seafood collection Store hours: 10:00 AM – 8:30 PM Mexican Food Court It’s tough to say no to the Tiquilla, Mexico Costco food court as soon as you walk into the store. You should go to this store hungry to enjoy the local Mexican cuisines that populate the food court to promote local flavors. Better yet, this Costco location is super supportive of the local community, which is very important to Mexican culture, making it a staple of the community. 8. Vive La France Location: Villebon-sur-Yvette, France Store size: 160,000 square feet Highlights: More cheese than you could ever hope to find in one Costco store Store hours: 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM Wine And Cheese While wine and cheese are undoubtedly plentiful all over France, you’ll be hard pressed to find a single retailer near this Costco location outside Paris with a more extensive wine and cheese aisle. Who can say no to giant wheels of brie paired with French rose and then topped off with French desserts? In other words, visiting this French location will be truly mouth-watering, leaving you with an empty wallet. 7. Cumming, Georgia Highest-Rated Location Location: Cumming, Georgia Store size: 148,000 square feet Highlights: Highest rated Costco in the world Store hours: 9:30 AM – 6:00 PM Highest-Rated Location Known as the highest-rated Costco in the country, this location ranks best for inventory control, sample quantity and quality, and the friendliness of the staff. While not everyone’s experience at this Costco will go well, this location will undoubtedly win over most customers, who will return to their local Costco stores hoping to find similarly smiling employees. 6. Merida, Mexico Location: Merida, Mexico Store size: 150,000 square feet Highlights: Includes a natural sinkhole or cenote in the parking lot Store hours: 9:30 AM – 9:00 PM Discover Nature In Merida One of the more unusual aspects of a Costco location occurs in Merida, Mexico, where a natural cenote is found in the parking lot. Created by the “Chicxulub Crater,” this sinkhole is right there, illuminated by the parking lot at night. Thankfully, even after the Costco closes, visitors can visit this natural phenomenon anytime. What’s crazy about this crater is that while it was formed millions of years ago, it was only discovered in 2015, making it a relatively new discovery for Mexico. 5. Salt Lake City Location: Salt Lake City, Utah Store size: 235,000 square feet Highlights: The largest Costco location in the world and a business center Store hours: 8:00 AM – 8:30 PM Costco Giant Whereas most Costco locations are only around 150,000 square feet, the Salt Lake City Costco location is approximately 235,000 square feet, which makes it the largest in the world. If you walked the entire perimeter of the store, you would walk approximately one-third of a mile. It’s said that employees who work in this store average around 10 miles of walking per day. As a bonus, this store also has one of the biggest walk-in refrigerator sections you can find at any Costco location worldwide. 4. South Korea Prison Turned Costco Location: Gocheok, South Korea Store size: 150,000 square feet Highlights: This Costco location used to be the home of a prison Store hours: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM Prison Turned Costco Before this Costco location turned up in Gocheok, South Korea, it was a former prison. Not only is this South Korea’s largest Costco location, but it was also the home of the Yeongdeungpo prison, which was redeveloped and repurposed into the current Costco location. Interestingly enough, this was also the first Costco location to be placed in a store rather than a stand-alone building. 3. Mexico City Location: Mexico City, Mexico Store size: 150,000 square feet Highlights: Located underneath a park Store hours: 10:00 AM – 8:30 PM It’s A Park And Costco Designed to blend into the local environment, this Costco is well worth visiting to see how it’s set underneath a park. On top of the store’s roof, parking garage, and loading bay is a giant park and play area including a soccer field, walking trails, and a skate park. The store’s designer, Maribel Barba, specifically states it was built to “be hidden and merge with the natural landscape.” 2. Alaska Capital Smallest Costco Location Location: Juneau, Alaska Store size: ~square feet Highlights: Smallest Costco in the world, sells vital resources for the local community Store hours: 9:00 AM – 8:30 PM Smallest Costco Location At only 76,696 square feet, the world’s smallest Costco is almost half the size of the company’s traditional 150,000 square feet locations. However, it’s tough to argue why this Costco ranks as one of the best in the world as it’s vitally important to the community. Due to Juneau’s limited access to the rest of the United States, it brings necessary resources to help residents survive the harsh Alaskan climate. 1. Iwilei Costco Location: Oahu, Hawaii Store size: ~150,000 square feet Highlights: Busiest Costco in the world Store hours: 9:00 AM – 8:30 PM World’s Busiest Costco Currently regarded as the world’s busiest Costco location, revenue from this location is twice that of other Costco stores. In fact, this Costco is so popular and so busy that it’s said that one out of every four island residents have a membership. What’s also incredible about this location is that it achieves these sales numbers even as it’s not the only Costco on the island. If nothing else, visiting this Costco and ordering a $1.50 hot dog is a right of passage for the most die-hard brand fans.

Many retail investors have the money but are not sure how to get started in the stock market. With thousands of companies and stocks to choose from, it is natural to get confused. Fortunately, there are exchange-traded funds or ETFs that can help you with the task. These funds invest in individual stocks and help achieve diversification. All you need to do is choose an ETF that works with your risk appetite and investment goals. Growing market volatility has led several investors towards ETFs and the global ETF industry saw an inflow of $1.45 trillion in 2024. If you are ready to invest in ETFs, here are three ETFs to buy in March. Key points in this article: Investors are playing safe and looking for ETFs to park their money. Besides providing immediate diversification, ETFs also generate steady returns. If you are looking for individual stocks instead of an ETF, get your hands on our “The Next Nvidia” stocks, it has one stock with 10X potential. Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF If you want a safe way to ride the stock market, consider the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO). With a low expense ratio, it is one of the best ways to invest in the top U.S. companies. As of writing, VOO is trading at $546 and is close to the 52-week high of $563. It has generated 15% returns in a year and over 100% returns in five years. It holds 505 stocks and allocates 30% of the funds into the information technology sector, followed by 14% in the financial sector and 11% in the consumer discretionary industry. One good reason to invest in the ETF is that it follows the S&amp;P 500 and you will be able to own a piece of the top companies without having to pick them individually. Some of the fund’s top holdings include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), the four stalwarts leading the tech industry. It has an expense ratio of only 0.03% and the Assets Under Management are $498.5 billion. While it offers diversification to your portfolio, it is heavily dependent on the tech industry for majority gains. Hence, if you are optimistic about the growth of the tech sector, this is an ideal ETF to own. As long as the tech sector continues to post gains, VOO will keep soaring. Invesco QQQ The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) is ideal for investors who want higher exposure to the tech sector. It follows the Nasdaq 100 and has an expense ratio of 0.15%. At the time of writing, QQQ is up 14% in the year and 146% in the past five years. Its NAV is $508 and is lower than the 52-week high of $540. Since its launch in 1999, the fund has shown strong performance and generated +443.43% higher returns than the S&amp;P 500. The Assets Under Management (AUM) of the fund is $171.86 billion. QQQ offers high exposure to the Magnificent Seven and allows you to own some of the most popular stocks. Its biggest holdings include Microsoft Corporation, Apple Inc., and NVIDIA, the three tech giants driving the market today. Over 50% of the fund’s holdings are in the tech sector followed by the consumer discretionary. Notably, the fund also owns stocks in different industries and has some long-term winners like Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR). Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST). The solid diversification of the fund ensures that it stands strong when volatility hits the tech industry. Invesco QQQ is ideal for low-risk investors who seek steady growth and steady income. While it offers exposure to the technology sector, it maintains a strong balance in its total holdings. ARK Fintech Innovation ETF Cathie Wood’s ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NASDAQ: ARKF) focuses on companies that are transforming the financial sector through digital assets, blockchain, and mobile payments. It has an expense ratio of 0.75% and an NAV of $38.07. The fund has generated 31% returns in the year and 54% in the past five years. I believe the fintech industry is going through a solid transition and some of the biggest companies like Coinbase and Shopify will lead the change. There is optimism about the future of fintech and this ETF will help investors make the most of it. The fund allocation includes 39% in the technology sector followed by 28% in the financial services sector and 18% in communication services. The fund’s top three holdings include Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP), Coinbase Global Inc (COIN), and Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD). These three stocks are on a rally and have impressed the market with stellar financials. However, there is one risk associated with the ETF, if the financial sector falls, the returns will drop. However, the current situation suggests that the fintech sector is poised for growth. The fund has a low NAV, making it a strong buy at the current level. It is down from the 52-week high of $44. If you are someone who follows Cathie Wood’s investment decisions and is optimistic about the financial sector, this ETF is an exciting buy for the month.
