It edged out Microsoft, Toyota, Costco, and others. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The study&#8217;s methodology involved three waves of surveys. The first asked consumers to rank the best and worst companies. The second survey determined the 100 companies. The third asked about “contextual” issues, including opinions about brands and topics, including politics. These were in the field from January through mid-May. Following Trader Joe’s on the list were clothing company Patagonia, Microsoft, Toyota, and retail giant Costco. Trader Joe’s rose 12 spots from last year’s list. Trader Joe’s seems to have a cult following. It targets building local communities through grants to nonprofits, along with food and beverage donations, Trader Joe’s is known among its customers for an unusual level of transparency. This has to do with food prices, why some items are discontinued, and why prices differ from location to location. It also rarely sells products that carry another company’s brands Trader Joe’s also has several unique methods used to target customers. Its traditional direct marketing includes newsletters. Content in what it calls The Fearless Flyer is based on anecdotes and stories about products it sells. The theory behind it appears to be that it cements its relationship with shoppers. The company uses podcasts and recipes for similar reasons. Axios Harris Poll 100 produces non-traditional results. Trader Joe’s and Patagonia are niche companies. Microsoft, Toyota, and Costco are among the largest companies that do business in the United States, as well as among America’s most well-known brands. It also lists J.C. Penney, a company that is essentially out of business. Despite the quirks of the list, who would not want to finish first?

For bearish-leaning risk takers, the SPXS ETF offers powerful leverage when the S&amp;P 500 declines. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) The first quarter of this year reminded optimistic investors that stocks don&#8217;t only go up. Trade war tensions, recession worries, and other factors could spur a market crash in 2025. Instead of using fancy strategies like short-selling stocks or buying put options, there&#8217;s an easier way that doesn&#8217;t require a margin account. Bearish-leaning investors can profit from a stock market crash of 20% or more by owning inverse exchange traded funds (ETFs). These funds are specifically designed to gain value when a stock market index, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the NASDAQ 100, goes down. There are risks involved, to be sure, but the following three inverse ETFs could set you up for powerful returns if the market craters. ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 (SH) The S&amp;P 500 is a commonly cited stock index that represents a broad selection of large-cap U.S.-focused companies. Therefore, a simple way to profit from a stock market crash would be to hold an inverse ETF that gains value when the S&amp;P 500 collapses. ProShares offers an ETF that serves this exact purpose. It&#8217;s a fund called the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SH), and it seeks to move inversely to the daily performance of the S&amp;P 500. What&#8217;s good about moving inversely to the S&amp;P 500 is that it&#8217;s usually a slower-moving index than the NASDAQ 100. Therefore, the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF should carry less risk than some other inverse ETFs. Remember, the S&amp;P 500 comprises a broad range of stocks from multiple market sectors. Some S&amp;P 500 component stocks include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM). Thus, you&#8217;re actually achieving what I call &#8220;inverse diversification&#8221; with the SH ETF. Even with the somewhat de-risking effect of &#8220;inverse diversification,&#8221; the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF could gain value quickly if there&#8217;s a stock market crash. Be aware, though, that the SH ETF won&#8217;t necessarily move up at the exact same pace that the S&amp;P 500 goes down. That&#8217;s because the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF inversely tracks the S&amp;P 500 throughout the day but then resets and rebalances the next day. As ProShares explains, &#8220;For any holding period other than a day, your return may be higher or lower than the Daily Target [i.e., the S&amp;P 500]. These differences may be significant.&#8221; To put it another way, you&#8217;ll get faithful inverse S&amp;P 500 tracking for a day with the SH ETF. However, the longer you hold the fund, the more the results can vary from what you might expect. Consequently, while the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF would probably make you money during a market crash, it&#8217;s not meant to be held for too long. ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ) If you&#8217;re willing to accept more risk, consider that the NASDAQ 100 mostly covers only one market sector (technology) and only includes around 100 stocks (as opposed to around 500 stocks in the more diversified S&amp;P 500). So, an ETF that inversely tracks the NASDAQ 100 is somewhat riskier but could yield greater rewards in the event of a market crash. To that end, you might consider the ProShares Short QQQ ETF (NYSEARCA:PSQ). This fund inversely corresponds to the daily performance of the NASDAQ 100 index. Bear in mind that the NASDAQ 100 is mainly focused on technology sector stocks, such as Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). You won&#8217;t get as much &#8220;inverse diversification&#8221; with the ProShares Short QQQ ETF as you would get with the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF, but you could potentially achieve greater returns during a market crash with the PSQ ETF. Much like with the ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF, the ProShares Short QQQ ETF is subject to unexpected results if you hold the fund for longer than a day. Hence, I&#8217;ll send out a similar warning: even if the stock market is collapsing, don&#8217;t hold the PSQ ETF for too long because the risks will probably increase over time. Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (SPXS) My third entry for the best inverse ETFs to profit in a market crash is the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:SPXS). This, like the SH ETF, may be somewhat de-risked because it inversely tracks the S&amp;P 500 and has &#8220;inverse diversification.&#8221; However, the SPXS ETF is still the riskiest fund on this list. What makes the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF so high-risk and potentially high-reward is that the fund is inverse and triple-leveraged. This means that the SPXS ETF, on a daily basis, moves three times as fast as the S&amp;P 500, but in the opposite direction. In theory, you might assume that the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF would go up 60% if the S&amp;P 500 goes down 20%. Again, however, there&#8217;s no assurance of faithful index tracking beyond one day. Hence, you could get highly unexpected results if you hold the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF for a long time. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s probably too risky to hold the SPXS ETF for more than a couple of weeks, even during a stock market crash. Besides, if the stock market suddenly rallies, the Direxion Daily S&amp;P 500 Bear 3X Shares ETF could make a triple-magnified move to the downside. The point is that the SPXS ETF is for nimble, sniper-like traders who can get into and out of a position quickly. If you prefer to take on less risk, consider the non-leveraged ProShares Short S&amp;P 500 ETF or ProShares Short QQQ ETF.The post 3 Best Inverse ETFs to Profit in a Market Crash appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/05/22/3-best-inverse-etfs-to-profit-in-a-market-crash/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/3-best-inverse-etfs-to-profit-in-a-market-20250523.jpg

It is a necessary qualifying component of the KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols for financial professionals, and is implemented to establish levels of investment risk that a new customer is comfortable taking. While the ideal investment delivers big capital appreciation and AAA principal safety, the maxim “no guts no glory” applies also to investing, where the largest returns are generally the ones that are the riskiest ventures. Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) are a popular vehicle for diversified investments, as they can be bought and sold online with ease and are usually subject to lower fees than mutual funds. ETFs come in a wide range of configurations, and are generally passively managed and designed to mimic the performance of designated market indexes. Key Points Dividend growth, in the majority of cases, is a stock indicator of a company’s business success, since dividend growth usually is commensurate with profit growth. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF is a popular ETF platform for investors to avail themselves of blue chip companies with a steady track record for both dividend increases and price appreciation growth. Deployment of a dividend reinvestment protocol can substantially boost overall ROI for investments in an ETF such as Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF.

Don’t waste another minute – get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) For those investors who have found the S&amp;P 500 Index too volatile for their liking, there is another index that offers steady growth, albeit at a slower pace, combined with a strong income component and lower volatility. The S&amp;P U.S. Dividend Growers Index is one such benchmark. Containing Dividend Kings (50 or more consecutive years of increased dividends) and Dividend Aristocrats (25 or more years in a row of increased dividends), this index contains Fortune 500 companies whose businesses are historically profitable enough that they can afford to continue higher dividend payouts year after year. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF (NYSE: VIG) is a popular ETF with a portfolio reflecting this exact index. Founded in 2006, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF strives for a mix of capital appreciation and income from dividend growth companies, i.e. those with a history of dividend increases accompanying growth. Its yield is 1.87% and it has a 0.05% expense ratio. The dividend increases have to be consistent for a minimum of 10 years to warrant inclusion. Surprisingly, the top 25% companies with the highest yields are excluded from the 330+ stocks on the VIG roster. VIG has a Morningstar gold ETF ranking. It had $101.79 billion assets under management (AUM) as of the time of this writing. A look at VIG’s top 10 holdings shows how its criteria differ from S&amp;P 500 Index ETFs, which are usually led by Magnificent 7 stocks, based on market cap size: Broadcom Microsoft Apple Eli Lilly JP Morgan Chase Visa, Inc. Exxon Mobil MasterCard Costco Wholesale Walmart The VIG Dividend Difference As the calculator demonstrates, a $15,000 investment in VIG back in January, 2020 would be worth $25,833.91 today, at the time of this writing, which equates to a 72.23% ROI. The total return would be $10,833.91. The annualized return equates to 10.62%. This calculation also includes compounding through reinvested dividends. The reinvested dividend value is $2,425.58. The actual cash dividends paid out from the initial 119.67 shares equates to $1,849.45. If the dividends are not reinvested, the total return would be $8,408.33. Therefore, reinvesting the dividends enabled an additional return differential of $2,425.58 over the 5 year span. The Dividend Reinvestment Advantage For Safer Returns Dividend stocks with annual payout growth can boost capital appreciation through compounding, or provide extra income in the case of emergencies. As the charts demonstrate, reinvesting dividends contributed a 22% boost to ROI, while overall capital appreciation growth still averaged over 10% annually. Dividend Reinvestment Programs (DRIP) can automatically implement purchases of additional shares without additional fees or order entries, if one is so inclined. In the case of an ETF such as VIG, investors with weaker stomachs for volatility can sleep more easily, knowing that their portfolios are still growing albeit without the roller coaster ride delivered by Nvidia, for example. Another plus to VIG is that since it contains both current and potential future Dividend King and Dividend Aristocrat stocks, the dividend amounts will continue to grow with each passing year. This will, in turn, increase the amount of additional shares that can be obtained under a DRIP agreement. This is a classic compounding model for health building that can work for the benefit of many investors. On the contingency side, the investor can always cancel the DRIP agreement if there is an emergency need for the dividend income pending, since it can always be renewed at a later date after the crisis has passed.

The London-based stockbroker has repeated a ‘Buy’ recommendation with a price target pitched at 45p, compared to Arrow’s current market price of around 16.3p. Earlier today, Arrow reported a 36% increase in total oil and gas revenue, reaching US$19.51 million. First quarter earnings (EBITDA) climbed 15% to US$11.53 million, whilst net income amounted to US$2.66 million for the quarter. It comes as the growing oil and gas group continues to develop its fields in Colombia, with new horizontal wells unlocking higher volumes. Production increased to 4,085 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), up 50% compared to the same period a year ago. Operating cash flow totalled $14.43 million, and the company ended the quarter with $24.95 million in cash, after $11.38 million of capex in the three-month period. Arrow drilled two development wells, AB 2 and AB 3, in the Alberta Llanos field. It also completed a 90 km² seismic survey on the southeast Tapir Block. Post-quarter, Arrow spudded the AB HZ4 horizontal well and entered into a US$20 million prepayment agreement with an integrated energy firm to market its Colombian oil. ""The first quarter of 2025 has been exciting for Arrow,” chief executive Marshall Abbott said in a statement. Regular drilling, regular news flow Zeus Capital analyst Daniel Slater, in a note, highlighted that Arrow’s schedule of drilling will provide catalysts for the company to raise its valuation. “Going forward, we look for ongoing execution of the 2025 work programme, and for this to support higher production rates to help underpin our full year forecasts,” Slater said. The analyst added: “These results demonstrate the company’s ability to generate production cash flows to fund its significant ongoing 2025 drilling programme, while also building the balance sheet cash position. “While we will need to see a ramp up in production over the rest of the year in order to make our forecasts, the company is well placed to do this given the increased drilling programme that is planned.” Horizontal development Arrow boss Marshall Abbott today told investors that recent well successes - AB 2 and AB 3 – in the Alberta Llanos field highlighted the potential for horizontal development in the Ubaque reservoir, as well as follow-up zones in the C7 and Guadalupe zones. ""During the dry summer months in the Llanos basin, the company has developed a new road system from the Carrizales Norte pad to the Capullo pad, the Mateguafa Oeste pad and the Mateguafa Attic pad,” Abbott said. “These pads will be utilised in the company's planned drilling program for the remainder of 2025. The company has secured a second rig which is expected to spud the first of four wells at RCE in early June."" Abbott, meanwhile, highlighted that Arrow retains “very healthy netbacks” on its production, in spite of the oil price volatility seen in global markets through early 2025. He noted that the focus is on growing production, continuing development at the Carrizales Norte, Rio Cravo Este and Alberta Llanos fields. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST, ETR:CTO) posted quarterly earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street estimates, as the membership-only warehouse retailer saw its sales jump 8% year-over-year. For the fiscal third quarter which ended on May 11, revenue was $63.2 billion, ahead of the $63.19 billion expected by analysts. Profit for the quarter was $1.9 billion or $4.28 per share, beating estimates of $4.24. Costco does provide an annual outlook, but during its earnings call, CEO Ron Vachris addressed the impact of tariffs. The CEO said the company has proactively managed tariff challenges by accelerating shipments, sourcing more American-made products, and frequently adjusting prices to minimize cost impacts. The company’s tariff exposure is well-managed, analysts at Jefferies believe. “Costco re-confirmed that roughly a third of US sales are imported from other countries, including 8% from China, which drove positive low-single-digit percentage inflation in non-food items,” they wrote. “Management noted rerouting these goods to non-US markets, advancing summer goods, and boosting locally sourced production in the US and Asia, which has lowered member prices by 40% in some regions.” The analysts also highlighted Costco’s efforts to enhance the member experience through technology pilots, such as its expedited checkout technology, ‘Scan-and-Go.’ “Combined with the integration of digital membership cards and improvements in digital wallet usage, management noted improved throughput, evidenced by the immediate positive impact on gas station gallon sales,” analysts wrote. Market share gains ahead Jefferies maintained its 'Buy' rating on Costco following the company’s “strong print” for Q1, noting it is well-positioned for further share gains ahead. “Costco is a defensive name by nature due to its membership model that generates predictable sales and profits, an attractive value orientation, a higher-income customer, and a relatively significant penetration of consumables as a percentage of sales,” they wrote. “Additionally, the company continues to open new clubs in the US, has a meaningful runway for ongoing international expansion, notably China, and recently raised its membership prices.” The analysts have a price target of $1,180 on Costco, reflecting upside of 17% at the time of writing. Shares of Costco moved higher in early trade on Friday, adding 2.7% at about $1,036.",https://www.proactiveinvestors.com,https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/1072163/arrow-exploration-set-for-upside-as-well-schedule-keeps-delivering-catalysts-analyst-1072163.html,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/arrow-exploration-set-for-upside-as-well-schedule-keeps-20250530.jpeg

But with Amazon reigning supreme and tons of huge brands like Walmart and Target focusing on online sales, the nature of shopping in America has been drastically altered. With online retail comes the opportunity to reach any segment of the population from anywhere in the world. As competition skyrockets, brand recognition, marketing, and advertising become crucial to a company&#8217;s success. To find the 10 retail stores Americans love most, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the recent 2025 Axios Harris Poll 100 Reputation Rankings.
