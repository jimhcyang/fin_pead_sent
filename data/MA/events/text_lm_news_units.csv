PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard is furthering its commitment to create a more sustainable and inclusive digital economy, with a pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Understanding that economic growth cannot come at the expense of the planet, the company’s global action plan aims to continue to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) by remaining focused on the decarbonization of its operations and bolstering its efforts to decarbonize its supply chains. Mastercard’s net zero goal builds upon its existing GHG commitments that align with the Business Ambition for 1.5°C pledge. The first in the payments industry to gain Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) approval for its GHG goals, Mastercard is currently working towards its SBTi-approved goal to reduce total Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 38% and Scope 3 emissions by 20% by 2025 from a 2016 baseline. These targets reflect a long-term commitment by the company to monitor and implement best practices to reduce emissions across the business, drive operational energy efficiency, and further engage suppliers in value chain decarbonization. Progress already made towards these goals includes achieving 100% renewable electricity in 2020, reinforced by a commitment to RE100. “2021 is set to be a crucial year for climate action, and we believe the private sector has a vital role to play in the transition to a zero-carbon economy. The quality of all our futures are deeply and inextricably linked to the health and well-being of our planet. That’s why, in addition to improving our own environmental footprint, we’re driving systemic change through powerful coalitions and empowering our network of nearly 3-billion consumers to take collective action to preserve the environment,” said Kristina Kloberdanz, Chief Sustainability Officer, Mastercard. “By coming together, we can drive exponential impact.” Mastercard is also mobilizing its technology, expertise, and trusted global partnerships network to lead on collective climate action, through innovative initiatives such as the Greener Payments Partnership and the Priceless Planet Coalition. Decarbonizing Operations and Supplier Sustainability Mastercard is initially focusing on two priority areas to make progress against its emissions targets – decarbonizing its own operations and leading on supplier sustainability. Mastercard operates close to 180 facilities across the world and is prioritizing renewable energy and energy efficiency programs, including the expanded use of solar panels in data centers, which account for more than 50 percent of energy usage across the company. Currently all Mastercard owned properties in the U.S. are fitted with solar panels and all owned properties across the world are LEED certified. Taking an innovative and collaborative approach to supplier sustainability has made Mastercard a leader in the field, recently maintaining an “A” rating for Supplier Engagement from CDP. Emissions associated with the company’s supply chain (as measured at the end of 2020) amount to more than 70 percent of the total carbon footprint. As such, continued support with setting and achieving GHG goals will be provided to suppliers. In the future, Mastercard will also review opportunities for investing in carbon removal projects, including new nature-based solutions as well as technologies and services that reduce carbon impact while supporting broader local economic and social development goals. Alexander Farsan, Global Lead on Science Based Targets at WWF, one of the SBTi partners said: ""Mastercard has shown real climate leadership by setting science-based targets and it's great to see they have walked the talk and delivered significant emissions reductions since setting their targets. With Mastercard’s commitment, through our Business Ambition for 1.5ºC campaign, to reduce emissions across their entire value chain in line with 1.5ºC, we hope to see them continue the path of deep emissions reductions as they work towards their net-zero goal. At the SBTi, we look forward to more companies following in the footsteps of Mastercard and using science-based-targets as a valuable tool to make meaningful progress towards a zero-carbon economy."" Mobilizing for Collective Climate Action Mastercard is leveraging its experience in financial inclusion to help build sustainable, scalable solutions and drive collective action for long term climate impact. This includes working with banks, merchants and other industry partners to empower consumers with environmental choices. Learn more about how the company is supporting sustainable card choices through the Greener Payments Partnership and Mastercard’s Sustainable Cards Materials Directory here. Through Mastercard’s partnership with Doconomy, consumers can now directly access a Carbon Calculator which allows them to track their footprint, better understand the impact of their purchasing behavior, as well as access information on mindful choices. In addition, through the Priceless Planet Coalition, Mastercard is working with 40+ partners to regrow 100 million trees over 5 years - together with forest restoration partners, Conservation International and World Resources Institute.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--2021 kicked off with retail gains across nearly all sectors and all 50 U.S. states, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment. This January, U.S. retail sales excluding automotive and gasoline increased 9.2% year-over-year, with online sales growing 62.1% compared to 2020. The momentum of a stronger-than-anticipated holiday season continued throughout the month, with consumer spending buoyed by an infusion of stimulus payments, particularly in the first two weeks of the year. At a national level, key retail trends from January include: Home is Where the Spending Still Is: Spending in and around the home remains a top consumer priority, with Furniture & Furnishings (+16.6%) posting its eighth straight month of solid gains. Home categories, along with Grocery, have seen some of the biggest category lifts following stimulus payments. Consumers Start to Refresh their Wardrobes: Following months of working and schooling from home, we’re starting to see consumers invest in their wardrobe again—with Specialty Apparel online sales up +52.5% in January. Although the sector is still down (-4.3%), this is the smallest year-over-year decline experienced since the pandemic began impacting sales in March 2020. A Positive Sign for Department Stores: The Department Store sector experienced its first year-over-year increase in sales (+1.5%) since 2019, boosted by strong online sales (+27.9%). Gasoline Sales Reflect Restricted Mobility in January: No sector has been a clearer bellwether of consumers’ mobility this past year than Gasoline sales, with negative year-over-year growth since mid-March 2020. While the declines eased over the summer months, Covid-19 restrictions as well as winter weather led to a further deterioration in gasoline demand in January. Around the country, Mastercard SpendingPulse analysis shows that the overall retail story remains largely positive: January was a month of growth across all 50 states. States in the southeast and the west are driving the largest increases of total retail sales. More outdoor options are available in the warmer southern states and online sales growth has surged in the western states. Moreover, e-commerce has become a critical driver of sales growth across the country. In California, for instance, online sales grew 77.4%, helping to lift retail sales overall to 7.9%. ""We’re living in a digital world. For consumers, e-commerce has emerged as a lifeline and a lifestyle. January’s numbers are just further proof of this ongoing trend,” said Steve Sadove, Mastercard senior advisor and former CEO of Saks, Inc. “A big, bright note from January is that consumers are spending. While we know that consumers are also saving their stimulus funds and paying down debt, these numbers show that stimulus is helping to boost sales for retailers around the country."" Building on Mastercard’s commitments to help retailers, restaurants, CPG brands and others assess, navigate and emerge stronger from the effects of the pandemic, key SpendingPulse insights will now be published monthly on www.Mastercard.com/news. “For governments and businesses of all sizes, access to timely, data-driven insights is critical to decision-making—particularly in times of uncertainty,” said Raj Seshadri, president of data and services, Mastercard. “By sharing economic insights such as SpendingPulse, we hope to enable smarter decisions with better outcomes today and for the long term.” *Excluding auto and gasoline About Mastercard SpendingPulse: Mastercard SpendingPulse™ reports on national retail sales across all payment types in select markets around the world.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard today announced a US$10 million (approximately 75 crore rupees) commitment to directly address critical Covid-related needs in India. Over the past few weeks, the country has seen a spike in both Covid diagnoses and deaths, with the healthcare system being stretched to its limits as more than 350,000 new cases are identified each day. The philanthropic efforts, delivered through the Mastercard Impact Fund, will focus on three priority areas – access to hospital resources, access to additional oxygen supplies and continued support of the company’s employees across the country. The largest contribution will be designated to support the expansion of 2,000 beds through the installation of portable hospitals that can address the immediate healthcare needs. Working with the government and local partners on the ground, these hospitals can be constructed quickly and could help an estimated 2.5 million Indians gain access to healthcare, adding to the nation’s healthcare infrastructure. “The situation in India is gut-wrenching; it’s clear that no one has been left untouched and that no one can be a bystander,” said Ajay Banga, executive chairman of Mastercard. “We have long been advocates for the people of India, as employers and as enablers of the economy. Now it’s time for us to put our shoulders to the wheel and do whatever we can to help all of India get through this intensified crisis.” In addition to the on-the-ground medical support, Mastercard is also allocating funding for additional shipments of 1,000 oxygen generators, as part of a broader corporate effort. And the company is donating to local charities and NGOs to allow for direct support of those affected by the virus, including the frontline medical workers across the country. “The U.S. and India have a shared history of helping each other during times of crisis,” said Richard Verma, general counsel at Mastercard and former U.S. ambassador to India. “We’re hearing from our own teams the challenges that they and their families are facing. It’s critical that we stand by our friends and help those who have been impacted. Our commitment today and into the future is strong and enduring.” Prof. K. VijayRaghavan, Principal Scientific Adviser to Government of India added, ""The steep rise of Covid-19 cases poses an enormous challenge to clinical care facilities. Revamping existing hospital infrastructure by increasing the number of beds to accommodate more patients requiring critical care and procuring more equipment to enhance oxygenation for patients, is of utmost priority. We are grateful to the industry for their support to aid various State Governments’ critical care systems to boost their response to Covid-19. Mastercard and office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to Government of India have joined hands to provide 2,000 beds and purchase oxygen concentrators for hospitals in states that have been affected the most. There have been many such partnerships, many more such needed in the coming days. We hope to speedily facilitate them where there is most need.” Extended Support for Employees, Partners Mastercard has already committed to cover all vaccine-related costs for its India-based employees and immediate families, as doses are available. To help extend these efforts – and provide another outlet for its employees across the globe to help each other – Mastercard will also match employee donations to its Employee Assistance Fund, up to $15,000 per individual. This comes on top of a $500,000 corporate contribution to the fund. The company will continue to explore other opportunities to activate partnerships in India and across the global community – from the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum and U.S.-India Business Council to the Business Roundtable and the American India Foundation – to support these efforts.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As the world went into pandemic lockdown in 2020, consumers shifted their spending habits to embrace contactless tap-and-go payments and online shopping. As stores closed and social distancing took hold, retailers worldwide moved their businesses online, embraced e-commerce and explored the potential of new ways to pay. More than a year later, research from Mastercard shows that the adoption of new payment technologies is rising, and consumer appetite for new, fast and flexible digital experiences continues to grow. The Mastercard New Payments Index, conducted across 18 markets around the world, shows 93% of people will consider using at least one emerging payment method, such as cryptocurrency, biometrics, contactless, or QR code, in the next year. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (63%) agree they have tried a new payment method they would not have tried under normal circumstances, but the pandemic has galvanized people to try flexible new payment options to get what they want, when they want it. With this interest and consumer demand also comes a greater expectation for businesses to provide multiple ways to shop and pay. In fact, more than half of consumers say they would avoid businesses that do not accept electronic payments of any kind. “The pandemic made us think differently, partly out of necessity,” said Craig Vosburg, Chief Product Officer at Mastercard. “To deliver the choice and flexibility that consumers need – and increasingly expect –retailers worldwide need to offer a range of payment solutions that are easy to access and always on. As we look ahead, we need to continue to enable all choices, both in-store and online, to shape the fabric of commerce and make the digital economy work for everyone.” Contactless technology was the digital catalyst to explore new payment options because of its fast, secure and touch-free experience. Between the first quarter of 2020 and the same period in 2021, more than 100 markets saw contactless as a share of total in-person transactions grow by at least 50 percent. 3 A year into the COVID-19 pandemic, contactless is showing its staying power and dynamism – in the first quarter of 2021 alone, Mastercard saw 1 billion more contactless transactions as compared to the same period of 2020, with particular momentum in emerging contactless markets like the U.S. and Brazil, where contactless penetration in the two markets combined grew by nearly 3x year-over-year. 3 All signs point to a continued growth path for contactless, with nearly 7 in 10 consumers anticipating using a contactless card this year. Looking to the future, digital currencies, biometrics, contactless and QR codes are trending as emerging payments technologies as people’s comfort with them and understanding of them increases and the use of cash decreases. In fact, 71% of people say they expect to use cash less moving forward. The exploding interest in new payment technologies may encourage businesses to expand their options at checkout. The Mastercard New Payments Index found: Cryptocurrency1 Gains Ground, With Millennials Primed to Jump In – Today consumers can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency as a commodity or investment. Consumers are also increasingly showing interest in being able to spend crypto assets for everyday purchases. As global interest in cryptocurrencies as a payment method continues to accelerate, 4 in 10 people (40%) across North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific say they plan to use cryptocurrency in the next year. Millennials globally and those in the Middle East and Africa are especially engaged in the cryptocurrency conversation, with more than half (67%) agreeing they are more open to using cryptocurrency than they were a year ago. In addition, 77% of Millennials are interested in learning more about cryptocurrency, while 75% agree they would use cryptocurrency if they understood it better. While consumer interest in cryptocurrency - especially floating digital currencies such as Bitcoin - is high, work is still required to ensure consumer choice, protection, and their regulatory compliance. Biometric Payments Are More Trustworthy – Perceptions of safety and convenience have been front and center for people over the past year. More than half (53%) of consumers agree that biometric checkout is secure. In fact, 6 in 10 consumers say they are excited about the potential of biometric verification methods such as gait or walk assessments and fingerprint authorization (61%), and 60% feel safer using biometrics to verify a purchase than entering a pin. Gait or walk assessments can be used to pay based on a person’s manner of walking. QR Codes - A Cleaner and More Convenient Alternative to Cash in Developing Markets – While mature markets – like the U.S. – are focused on contactless payments, growing markets are leveraging QR-based options as a clean and convenient way to interact with merchants. In APAC, the majority of respondents perceive new payment methods like QR codes to be cleaner (76%) and more convenient (71%) than cash for in-person payments as it is likely consumers are using their own mobile device. 66% of respondents in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 63% in the Middle East and Africa expect to use more payment technologies like QR in the next year. To Meet People’s Demands, Businesses Forced to Jump into Emerging Payment Trends With consumer interest around new payment technologies, the expectation for businesses to adapt for the long-term is here to stay. Nearly eight in 10 respondents (79%) agree that they prefer to shop at stores that have both an in-person and online presence, and 68% noted being more excited to shop at retailers that can offer the latest payment methods. A recent study on 5,500 major Mastercard merchants, showed that between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, more than a fifth of these merchants globally increased the number of ways they connect with consumers either by enabling an e-commerce channel or accepting contactless transactions2. Over the same period, Mastercard saw the total number of card-not present transactions grow by over 30%.4 As one way to address this consumer preference for fast, touch-free payment experiences, many merchants are turning to contactless payments. Now, nearly 90% of in-person transactions globally take place at a contactless-enabled merchant, and nearly all merchant categories saw an increase in contactless transactions as a share of total in-person transactions year-over-year in the first quarter of 2021. 3 This behavior shift is reinforced by the desire for consumer choice – with 84% saying that they expect to make purchases when they want and how they want.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Total U.S. retail sales sprung into another month of double-digit growth in April, according to Mastercard SpendingPulseTM, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment. U.S. retail sales excluding automotive and gasoline increased 23.3% year-over-year in April, and 10.8% compared to April 2019. Online sales in April grew 19.9% and 95.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods. Retail sales continue to benefit from stimulus payments, coupled with warmer weather and broader reopening across the country. While the recovery has not been universal or consistent – due to geographical, economic, and household differences – there are a number of key overarching trends. Restaurant Resurgence: April marks the second consecutive month of positive growth for the Restaurant category, underscoring that consumers have an appetite to eat out again. Spending at restaurants grew 118.8% vs. 2020, when widespread shut-downs crippled the industry, and were up 5.7% compared 2019. Limited-service Restaurants, such as fast-food, were up 21.7% compared to 2019, outpacing their Full-service counterparts (-13.5% YO2Y). Online Convenience: Despite the record shattering e-commerce growth in April 2020, online sales remained up year-over-year. E-commerce share continues to make up a bigger portion of total retail spend overall (21.6%), as well as in categories such as Apparel (61.7%), Department Stores (21.0%) and Jewelry (15.7%). Department Stores See a Boost: Many of the depressed sectors in 2020, including Department Stores (+202.7%), Jewelry (+255%) and Lodging (+319.1%), are showing some of the largest year-over-year gains as retailers gear up for the return of gatherings and events. Department Stores grew 9.6% compared to 2019. “April's retail sales growth reinforces that the American consumer is healthy and eager to spend, especially on categories such as restaurants, which have faced restrictions over the past year,” said Steve Sadove, Mastercard senior advisor and former CEO of Saks, Inc. “There are a lot of factors at play including stimulus funds, pent-up demand, and the desire to reconnect with friends and family. The fact is that people are excited to gather again and they're refreshing their look for the occasion.” *Overall retail sales excluding gasoline and automotive compared to April 2020 About Mastercard SpendingPulse Mastercard SpendingPulse™ reports on national retail sales across all payment types in select markets around the world.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard announced today a new Start Path global startup engagement program dedicated to supporting fast-growing digital assets, blockchain and cryptocurrency companies. As a continuation of Mastercard’s digital assets work, seven startups have joined the program, including GK8, Domain Money, Mintable, SupraOracles, STACS, Taurus, and Uphold, and together with Mastercard seek to expand and accelerate innovation around digital asset technology and make it safer and easier for people and institutions to buy, spend and hold cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Among the new program participants is Mintable (Singapore), a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace where users can create, buy and sell digital and physical assets backed by the blockchain such as digital collectibles, avant-garde artwork and even music. The Mintable platform is packed with novel features such as gasless minting and credit card purchasing that are designed to empower the everyday person to get involved with NFTs without any prior knowledge in crypto or coding. GK8 (Israel) is a self-managed end-to-end institutional crypto custody platform that offers a true air-gapped cold vault. This means that the platform is capable of creating, signing and sending secure blockchain transactions without receiving input from the internet, eliminating any potential cyberattack vectors. Taurus (Switzerland) delivers enterprise-grade infrastructure to manage any digital asset with one single platform, including crypto assets, digital currencies and tokenized assets covering issuance, custody, asset servicing and trading. Other participating startups and fast-growing digital asset and blockchain companies have been selected to join the inaugural track of the Start Path program: Domain Money (USA) looks to build a next generation investment platform, bridging the gap between digital assets and traditional finance for retail investors. SupraOracles (Switzerland) is a powerful blockchain oracle that helps businesses bridge real-world data to both public and private chains, enabling interoperable smart contracts to automate, simplify and secure the future of financial markets. STACS (Singapore) provides a blockchain infrastructure for the financial industry to unlock massive value and enable effective sustainable financing. Its clients and partners include global banks, national stock exchanges, and asset managers. Uphold (USA) is a crypto-native, multi-asset digital money platform offering investment and payment services to consumers and businesses worldwide. Uphold's unique ‘Anything-to-Anything’ trading experience enables customers to trade directly between asset classes with embedded payments facilitating a future where everyone has access to financial services. Founders of the digital asset and blockchain companies participating in the new Start Path program aim to address a host of pain points including asset tokenization, data accuracy, digital security and seamless access between the traditional and digital economy. Each startup is focused on solving a unique industry challenge and, throughout the program, will leverage Mastercard’s expertise to support the continued growth and development of their solutions. Jess Turner, executive vice president of New Digital Infrastructure and Fintech, commented: “Mastercard has been engaging with the digital currency ecosystem since 2015. As a leading technology player, we believe we can play a key role in digital assets, helping to shape the industry, and provide consumer protections and security. Part of our role is to forge the future of cryptocurrency, and we’re doing that by bridging mainstream financial principles with digital assets innovations.” Digital Assets and Fintech Innovation Supporting the startup ecosystem is a core part of Mastercard’s ethos, and more than 250 startups have participated in the Start Path program since 2014. With the expansion of Start Path to include fast-growing crypto, blockchain and digital assets startups, Mastercard is providing access to its latest tools and solutions to help these companies scale their innovations and cutting-edge technologies.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. and PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--With spend already declining in Birmingham pre-COVID, the decrease rapidly accelerated in Birmingham’s downtown and surrounding tracts because of the pandemic significantly impacting the city’s small businesses. Minority owned businesses in the region saw an outsized impact from the downturn and are a priority focus amidst recovery. Mastercard and the Birmingham Department of Innovation and Economic Opportunity are working to address this with the introduction of Ascend Birmingham. The program is focused on helping local small businesses pivot to digital operations and thrive in an age of a more digitally engaged consumer. ""The City of Birmingham is thrilled to partner with Mastercard on this key initiative, which will go a long way in reaching our goal of making Birmingham a hub for minority-owned small businesses,"" Mayor Woodfin said. ""Allowing these businesses to flourish in digital spaces not only increases their reach but their creative potential as well. It's an incredible opportunity for our business community."" With support from Square, Accion Opportunity Fund and Sunrise by Lendio, Ascend Birmingham will provide education, tools and resources focused on building out an effective digital presence, accepting digital payments, growing and managing your business, gaining access to capital, and keeping your business and your customers protected. Participants in the program will also be provided a custom curated business kit that includes solutions such as a Square Reader for Contactless & Chip along with website development software, bookkeeping software and a professional bookkeeper from Sunrise by Lendio, advisory expertise from Accion Opportunity Fund, Mastercard cybersecurity and data insight solutions and other City-provided resources. Mastercard and the City of Birmingham have also partnered to deliver a city focused Digital Doors platform with always-on content and resources for local owners. “We applaud the efforts of Mayor Woodfin and the Department of Innovation & Economic Opportunity to ensure the endurance of Birmingham-based small businesses and are proud to partner with the city so that owners have access to the tools and resources necessary to thrive in today’s digital age,” said Michael Froman, vice chairman and president Strategic Growth for Mastercard. “The resiliency and drive of small business owners is unprecedented and supporting their recovery is the single most important thing we can all do for economic and social vitality.” Birmingham-based small businesses interested in learning more and signing up for an upcoming Ascend Birmingham cohort can visit here. Mayor Woodfin and Mastercard will also recognize three Birmingham businesses selected to be part of the national Priceless campaign, which highlights creative businesses offering unique experiences for patrons. Ursula Smith, founder of the Ursula Smith Dance Co.; Evan and Eleny Christen, owners of Pinspiration Birmingham; and Tanesha Sims-Summers, founder and CEO of Naughty But Nice Kettle Corn Co. are the Birmingham honorees. “Leveraging data-driven insights, we are partnering with the City of Birmingham to assess the impact of the pandemic on the local economy and help protect local communities and businesses that are most at-risk,” said Linda Kirkpatrick, president of North America for Mastercard. “With these insights we can engage our network of partners and prioritize investments in order to proactively build a foundation that fosters an equitable recovery.” “As an entrepreneur, I have had to adapt to a number of obstacles and uncertainties. When confronted with a problem or difficult situation I never run, which cultivated my faith, resilience, courage and fortitude needed to thrive in life and business. Opening a new studio location, a month before the pandemic hit Alabama forced me to pivot to a digital platform. This allowed me to expand my reach from Florida to Germany,” said Ursula Smith, Owner of Ursula Smith Company. In Solidarity with Birmingham As part of its In Solidarity initiative, Mastercard has embarked on a multi-city road show with Birmingham as the focus for the next stop. To support the region in helping close the racial wealth and opportunity gap for Black communities and business owners Mastercard and Blavity, Inc. the pre-eminent media resource for Black millennials, are partnering to launch a virtual discussion addressing a financial system that has systemically disadvantaged and excluded Black communities with a view to advancing opportunity and equitable growth in Birmingham. Speakers include: The honorable Randall Woodfin, Mayor of Birmingham, the Birmingham Office of Social Justice and Racial Equity, Rev. Arthur Price, Regions Bank and Morgan DeBaun, CEO, Blavity. Expanding Digitally with Customer Experience and Safety Prioritized Ascend Birmingham is part of Mastercard’s wider recovery efforts designed to support businesses and governments across the globe looking for resources to help better manage the health, safety and economic risks presented by the recent pandemic.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Retail sales in the U.S. grew for the 11th consecutive month in July, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse™, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment. With more cash in hand—fueled in part by the Child Tax Credit and pent-up savings—consumers drove U.S. retail spending growth, excluding automotive and gasoline, to +10.9% compared to July 2020. This is nearly quadruple the average growth in the month of July**. At a national level, back-to-school shopping is well underway, impacting a number of sectors as anticipated in our forecast. Overall, key retail trends from July include: Child Tax Credit Boosts Department Stores and Apparel Sales: The first of six monthly Child Tax Credit payments provided parents with an infusion of cash during the peak back-to-school shopping season, with Apparel (+80% YOY) and Department Store (+44.8% YOY) sectors seeing an uptick in sales for the month. This was concentrated in the days immediately following the first distribution on July 15. Return of the In-Store Shopper: Brick-and-mortar browsing is making its return, with in-stores sales making up 81.9% of total retail sales (ex auto) for the month. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, in-store sales were up +15.5% YOY in July and weekends experienced positive spikes in spending as a result of in-store shoppers returning to physical stores. Making a House a Home: According to data released by the U.S. Census Bureau, new home sales have fallen to an 18-month low. However, consumers are still eager to turn their houses into homes as the Furniture & Furnishings sector continues to grow on a YOY (+3.2%) and YO2Y (+26.8%) basis. “While e-commerce continues to play an increasingly significant role for retail, nothing replaces the in-store experience,” said Steve Sadove, senior advisor for Mastercard and former CEO and Chairman of Saks Incorporated. “July numbers reflect a return to the store. Consumers are shopping, spending and splurging across channels.” Mastercard’s chief economist and head of the Mastercard Economics Institute Bricklin Dwyer said, “Back to school shopping is back. Combined with greater savings and higher demand, the Child Tax Credit has provided a boost for families and is putting more money into retailers’ pockets.” *Excluding auto and gas **The average year-over-year growth in July over the past four years was 2.9% About Mastercard SpendingPulse Mastercard SpendingPulse™ reports on national retail sales across all payment types in select markets around the world.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard today announced a new supply chain finance capability within Track Business Payment Service (Track BPS) – designed to increase access to working capital while lowering costs, reducing complexity and risk, and accelerating automation when businesses pay and get paid. Launched in partnership with Demica, a leading global provider of supply chain finance technology, this new offering empowers Mastercard partners to provide their business customers with access to affordable working capital. Mastercard Track, an open-loop network, can now connect providers of B2B payments and their respective buyer and supplier customers to working capital. A lack of scalable solutions in the market has put supply chain financing out of reach for many businesses. As a result, only the largest suppliers can access working capital solutions, while trillions of dollars are tied up in accounts receivable each year. Mastercard’s solution unlocks a network for working capital - covering small businesses and global corporations alike, driving speed to market, and offering ease of integration for payment partners. Demica brings a global, flexible, multi-product financing platform and expansive network of banks and other funders at scale. Payment partners and their customers can benefit from Demica’s capabilities ranging from advisory services, supplier onboarding, and a white-labelled deployment process. “We are delighted to be working with Mastercard to transform the B2B payments landscape. This partnership will unite Demica’s scalable platform technology with Mastercard’s powerful infrastructure to make a real difference for businesses globally,” said Matt Wreford, CEO, Demica. “Our platform automates financing of payables and receivables and our global network of banks and non-bank investors opens up access to new sources of capital – we’re excited to bring these benefits to more companies through our global partnership with Mastercard.” By launching this first of its kind, embedded working capital capability in Mastercard’s Track Business Payment Service multi-rail platform, Mastercard is doubling down on its commitment to empower every business to get the working capital they need to thrive. This solution enables payment partners to extend the reach of buyer programs to more of their supply chain partners, strengthening supplier relationships. Suppliers gain improved access to competitively priced early payments and enjoy enhanced user experiences, such as one-time enrollment, standard agreements, and easy implementation leveraging their partner connections. Craig Vosburg, Chief Product Officer, Mastercard says, “Helping businesses optimize their working capital has been one of the key goals of Mastercard Track Business Payment Service. Disparate systems and processes in the current B2B ecosystem continue to make cash flow management complicated, increase operating costs, and hinder business growth. Our new offering and partnership with Demica help solve these pain points by allowing buyers and suppliers to unlock their working capital and deploy it to grow their businesses – enabling choice and scale and accelerating financial inclusion.” Mastercard is integrating its Track Business Payment Service network and its blockchain-based Mastercard Provenance Solution in supply chains across industries. Buyers and suppliers will see improved visibility, traceability, and procure-to-pay cycle times. As a result, payment partners can use this data to reduce risk, decrease reconciliation costs, and help further advance early payments in the accounts payable and receivable processes. The offering will provide access and support to a new suite of APIs to power each step of the commercial payments journey. Learn more at Mastercard Developers.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard extends its commitment to inclusivity by introducing a new accessible card standard for blind and partially sighted people, called the Touch Card. There are few effective ways for the visually impaired to quickly determine whether they're holding a credit, debit or prepaid card, particularly as more cards move to flat designs without embossed name and numbers. Mastercard is addressing this challenge with a simple yet effective innovation. “The Touch Card will provide a greater sense of security, inclusivity and independence to the 2.2 billion people around the world with visual impairments,“ says Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing and communications officer. “For the visually impaired, identifying their payment cards is a real struggle. This tactile solution allows consumers to correctly orient the card and know which payment card they are using.” With the new Touch Card, Mastercard has improved upon a current design standard by introducing a system of notches on the side of the card to help consumers use the right card, the right way, by touch alone. The new Touch Card credit cards have a round notch; debit cards have a broad squarish notch; and prepaid cards have a triangular notch. The standard has been designed to work with point-of-sale terminals and ATMs, ensuring it can be deployed at scale. Mastercard’s concept has been vetted and endorsed by The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in the U.K. and VISIONS/Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired in the U.S. The card was co-designed by IDEMIA, the global leader in Augmented Identity, providing trusted solutions in the physical as well as digital space. “As the banking industry responds to new trends and developments, it’s critical that any innovation brings progress for everyone, including those with a visual impairment,” says David Clarke, RNIB’s director of services. “We’re very pleased that Mastercard understands how important it is that blind and partially sighted people have equal and independent access to their own finances.“ “Innovation should always be driven by the impulse to include,” adds Rajamannar, who is also the company’s Healthcare president. “With one in seven people experiencing some form of disability, designing these products with accessibility in mind gives them equal opportunity to benefit from the ease and security of a digital world. No one should be left behind.” Mastercard has been embedding its signature melody at checkout counters worldwide, a signal to everyone – the sight impaired in particular – that their card transaction has gone through successfully. Mastercard’s launch of the Touch Card underscores its commitment to inclusivity. It follows the introduction of True Name™, designed in support of the transgender and non-binary communities. The company’s commitment as a brand is to not only stand against inequity but to be an agent for change.

PURCHASE, NY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As world leaders come together for the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), Mastercard unveiled an acceleration of its net zero timeline by a decade, from 2050 to 2040. It is also scaling its sustainable solutions to customers across Europe and Latin America, including Banco de Costa Rica, ekko, Gránit Bank, and Sberbank, which have all signed on to adopt the Mastercard Carbon Calculator. As part of its net zero strategy, Mastercard had already committed to meet its existing science-based targets (SBTi) for greenhouse gas reduction, which are aligned to the United Nations Business Ambition for a 1.5°C future. The company transitioned to 100% renewable energy in 2018 for its operations, and its emission reduction strategy primarily centers on further decarbonization across its value chain, including Scopes 1, 2 & 3 emissions. Mastercard has received an “A” rating for Supplier Engagement since 2018 from CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) and joined the 1.5°C Supply Chain Leaders Initiative, supporting large and small suppliers with concrete resources and tools for measuring their emissions and developing climate strategies through the SME Climate Hub. Supported by its new global Sustainability Innovation Lab, the company aims to encourage tangible action by people who use its 2.9 billion cards across the globe. This includes helping banks offer their consumers digital tools, such as the Mastercard Carbon Calculator, that encourage climate-conscious choices, and cards made from more sustainable materials. “Tackling the global climate crisis will take all of us – and major businesses have a vital role to play. At Mastercard, we continue to raise the bar for ourselves, accelerating our commitment to reach net zero emissions,” said Michael Miebach, chief executive officer, Mastercard. “We will also use our technology and global network to inspire collective action that fosters a more sustainable digital economy.” Enabling sustainable consumer choice According to a recent Mastercard survey, 85% of respondents globally said they’re willing to take personal action to combat environmental and sustainability challenges in 2021. New research from Mastercard also shows our society is now at an inflection point in both the supply and demand for sustainable options. Mastercard is helping inform consumers about the environmental impact of their spending through the Mastercard Carbon Calculator, created in collaboration with Swedish fintech Doconomy. Embedded across Mastercard’s global network earlier this year, the Carbon Calculator will now be adopted by leading banking partners – both traditional financial institutions and emerging fintechs – in markets around the world, including Banco de Costa Rica, ekko, Gránit Bank, and Sberbank. Together with Mastercard, each partner will co-create and define its customer experience, such as enhancing it with relatable and easy-to-understand equivalents (such as the number of trees required to compensate for the same amount of CO2), integrating donation functionality to support reforestation projects, and providing tips about sustainable living. Mastercard’s sustainable cards program shows strong momentum: 148 financial institutions in 46 countries have now issued cards made with more sustainable materials, including HSBC and Banco Santander, as we look to reduce the use of first-use PVC plastic in card manufacturing. The company also recently unveiled a first-of-its kind badge to identify these cards made more sustainably from recyclable, recycled, bio-sourced, chlorine-free or ocean plastics. Through the Priceless Planet Coalition, Mastercard and its partner network also continue to offer easy ways for consumers to contribute to forest restoration. Uniting more than 80 businesses globally in the restoration of 100 million trees, the Coalition now has multiple consumer engagement campaigns running across markets to generate donations to the environment.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As the Official Payment Services Provider of New York Road Runners, Mastercard today announced the launch of the “50 Years and Running” campaign in support of the TCS New York City Marathon. In partnership with documentary filmmaker and small business champion Nick Heller, otherwise known as @newyorknico, Mastercard is celebrating the businesses that have powered New York City over the past 50 years. Mastercard continues to leverage the full scope of its business, technology and network of partners and cardholders to help guide and elevate the visibility of small businesses in New York City and around the world. Through Heller’s authentic New York City voice, the “50 Years and Running” campaign features three iconic small businesses near the marathon route that have overcome obstacles in the face of adversity and provide priceless impact on their communities. They include: Grandma’s Place: Dawn Harris-Martin, lovingly referred to as “Grandma Dawn,” opened her iconic children’s toy and bookstore in 1999 to empower children through literacy. Like the Harlem community, Grandma’s Place caters to people of all ethnicities and backgrounds by centering the shop around games and books that benefit, support, educate, and reach children through fun, open-ended learning experiences. Davey’s Ice Cream: Originally conceptualized as a creative outlet for designer and New York native David Yoo, Davey’s Ice Cream opened in Brooklyn with a focus on quality ingredients sourced from local retailers. Yoo continues to build and diversify his flavors to accommodate the multi-national audience that New York City is known for while still staying true to the homemade origins of his recipes. Bronx Native: Owner Amaurys Grullon provides a cultural hub for creators, artists, and entrepreneurs to showcase Bronx talent with Bronx Native. Launched in 2016, every piece of merchandise – shirts, hats, or gear – serves as a tool to share issues of poverty and untreated illnesses in the surrounding neighborhoods, with a commitment to changing people’s perception of the Bronx. “The issues facing small businesses have changed radically in the 50 years since the TCS New York City Marathon began, and the impacts of the pandemic have only amplified and evolved these challenges,” said Heller. “Running a business takes the same dedication, hard work and grit it takes to run a marathon. We’re proud to pay tribute to the small business owners – from Brooklyn to the Bronx – who exemplify what makes this city one of the greatest in the world.” To further support the small businesses featured in the campaign, Mastercard will provide each with a Digital Doors™ toolkit comprised of exclusive offerings and resources to help maximize their digital presence, protect their online operations, and succeed in the new normal. These efforts build on Mastercard’s sustained emphasis on financial inclusion, including the company’s pledge to bring 50 million micro and small businesses into the digital economy by 2025. “The ’50 Years and Running’ Priceless campaign reflects Mastercard’s ongoing commitment to supporting and elevating the small businesses that serve as the backbone of our communities,” said Cheryl Guerin, executive vice president, North America Marketing and Communications at Mastercard. “We’re thrilled to be celebrating and showcasing the extraordinary small businesses that keep New York City running and provide them with the digital tools and resources they deserve to thrive."" Running Towards Innovation At the TCS New York City Marathon Expo at the Jacob K. Javits Center, which will see approximately 30,000 runners during the week leading up to the race, Mastercard will provide marathon participants and attendees with the opportunity to support small businesses through a one-of-a-kind activation. At Hall 3B, booth 202, Mastercard will unveil an expo venue where consumers can experience Tap on Phone, Mastercard’s innovative technology that turns an Android smartphone or tablet into an acceptance device. Tap on Phone is powered by Mastercard Foundry’s Cloud Point of Sale (POS) technology and leverages Verizon 5G, enabling small- and-medium-sized businesses to handle transactions in a fast and secure manner. Additionally, with every purchase of a $0.50 Mastercard tote, consumers will be entered for a chance to win one bib for the 2022 NYC Marathon and an array of prizes to support the New York City small businesses featured in the “50 Years and Running” campaign, including1: 10 ice cream socials at Davey’s Ice Cream, valued at $500 each 20 $500 shopping sprees at Grandma’s Place, in-store or online 20 $500 shopping sprees at Bronx Native, in-store or online “We are excited to have Mastercard as our Official Payment Services Provider for the first time at the TCS New York City Marathon,” said Christine Burke, senior vice president, Strategic Partnerships and Runner Products at New York Road Runners. “Marathon runners will have the opportunity to explore a variety of innovative payment solutions and experiences all while celebrating the small businesses that have powered New York City over the last 50 years.” The TCS New York City Marathon will take place on November 7. Mastercard will sponsor the Side Street Cheer Zone, located at 4th Avenue & Flatbush at mile eight, the Start Village hospitality space and the TCS New York City Marathon Pavilion.

MADRID--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard announced today the establishment of a new Tourism Innovation Hub in Spain, with the support of the Spanish Government. The Hub, based in Madrid and which will open in the second quarter of 2022, will develop solutions to support a sustainable and inclusive recovery for the global tourism sector through innovation, research and collaboration across the ecosystem. The initiative was ratified today, at the FITUR International Tourism Fair, between Reyes Maroto, Spain’s Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism, and Mark Barnett, President of Mastercard Europe. In 2019, travel and tourism represented 10.4% of global GDP but nearly halved to 5.5% in 2020 - similarly international visitors spent US$1,691.5 billion in 2019 and the amount dropped to US$517.6 billion in 20201. And according to its latest forecast, the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) estimates that international tourist arrivals remained 70 to 75 percent below 2019 levels last year2. The impact also goes beyond GDP figures, with the industry playing a vital role in generating jobs and creating opportunities for micro and small businesses around the world. But despite the clear challenges, Mastercard data shows that there are opportunities for a robust recovery in the relatively near future. Many consumers are looking at how to spend their share of the extra US$5 trillion saved since the onset of COVID-193, and travel ranks second only to eating out as the out-of-home activity most missed during lockdowns4. There has been a clear willingness to travel that has been determined by pandemic-related restrictions. “There has been a multi-trillion dollar impact on the global tourism industry over the past couple of years, but Mastercard is committed to enabling innovation and ensuring that technology is harnessed for a more inclusive, equitable and sustainable recovery,” said Mark Barnett, President of Mastercard Europe. “The Tourism Innovation Hub will foster programs and build partnerships which will help the industry recover and drive more inclusive and sustainable tourism growth. Being located in Spain will allow us to leverage the expertise of a country intrinsically linked to tourism and the second most visited destination in the world."" According to the Spanish Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism, Reyes Maroto: ""The Spanish Government believes that now is the time for us to work together to build the future of our post-pandemic tourism model. We are going to stop measuring the success of the Spanish tourism model exclusively by the increase in the number of tourists - we must now go beyond this and focus on quality, profitability, innovation and sustainability, as well as social inclusion and territorial cohesion. There is no time to lose in taking up this challenge. And we all need to work together - the institutions and the private sector - strengthening our alliances and bringing other partners on board so that the Spanish tourism sector maintains its international leadership."" UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili added: “Tourism’s future will be driven by new ideas, new business methods and through joined-up solutions to overcome challenges and fulfil our sector’s enormous potential. UNWTO warmly welcomed the creation of a new Tourism Innovation Hub and looks forward to working closely with Mastercard to harness the power of data and creativity to build a more inclusive and sustainable sector.” The Tourism Innovation Hub will act as a global platform for industry research, tourism strategy development and the co-creation of tailored products and solutions, through partnerships and initiatives such as: Thought Leadership: leveraging data insights and capturing target consumer insights to identify trends and inform policy decision-making. Development Center: co-creating new products and services, codifying best practices and serving as a platform to bring together public and private sector partners to innovate together. Labs As A Service: designing, developing and testing new products and platforms that deliver digital first, sustainable and inclusive solutions for the industry, which address common business and consumer priorities. Supporting the Global Tourism Industry Mastercard’s trusted network and leading technology stands at the heart of the global tourism industry: Facilitating payments so tourists can spend safely, securely and easily when they travel abroad Enabling digital payments acceptance for small businesses to allow them to benefit from the tourism economy Working with travel agents, airlines, hospitality providers and many others across the ecosystem Building loyalty through engagement programs and Priceless Experiences, giving tourists tailored access to the best and most exciting opportunities when they explore or return to preferred destinations Partnering with tourism agencies to supporting businesses in the tourism industry and encouraging inbound tourism through digital vouchers and incentive schemes Providing data insights to governments and tourism agencies to identify trends and inform strategies, including through the Mastercard Economics Institute Insights Reports, as well as executing inbound tourism campaigns. Sustainable tourism will be a key focus, and there will be close collaboration between the Tourism Innovation Hub and Mastercard’s Sustainability Innovation Lab, to help empower governments, businesses and consumers to transform how they adapt and create new sustainable tourism innovations in destination, travel, accommodation, experience, rewards and incentives and other services. Alongside this, Mastercard is working with the UNWTO, headquartered in Madrid, across a range of initiatives. For example, last year the company supported the UNWTO SDGs Global Startup Competition, providing mentorship to innovative small businesses that are enabling sustainable and responsible tourism around the world. In Spain, Mastercard has a well-established track record of supporting the tourism industry, as part of the broader work with governments and cities around the world adapt their tourism strategies. In 2020, Mastercard's data intelligence tools helped the City Councils of Madrid and Barcelona identify how the flow of tourists were being impacted, helping them draw a roadmap to recover post-pandemic tourism. Additionally, in May last year, together with Turespaña, Mastercard announced the first Security Perception Index, which measures the level of confidence shown by visitors in Spain’s health-measures. The Tourism Innovation Hub becomes part of Mastercard's network of global centers of excellence around the world, including the Intelligence and Cyber Centre in Canada, the Fintech-Cyber Innovation Lab in Israel, the Mastercard Lab for Financial Inclusion in Kenya, and the Sustainability Innovation Lab in Sweden, as well as Tech Hubs in Dublin and New York City.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard today announced the launch of Mastercard TrackTM Instant Pay, a next-generation virtual card solution that uses machine learning and straight-through processing to enable instant payment of supplier invoices. Integrated with Mastercard Track Business Payment Service, Mastercard’s open-loop B2B network, the new, first-of-its-kind virtual card solution delivers greater choice, efficiency and automation for buyers and suppliers to help streamline and speed business payments. Slow and inefficient payment processes continue to create challenges for businesses. Lengthy payment terms and late invoice payments impact cash flow for suppliers, while manual invoice approval and check processing is costly and time consuming for buyers. Other payment methods, like ACH, require buyers to safeguard sensitive bank account information, adding another layer of complexity. Research shows a growing demand from businesses to automate supplier payments with virtual cards, but existing solutions aren’t meeting these needs, with 90% of virtual card transactions still being processed manually1. Mastercard Track Instant Pay is the first virtual card solution that can safely and intelligently authorize an immediate payment to a supplier once they submit an invoice. The solution uses sophisticated machine learning to analyze invoices and identify those likely to be rejected, enabling the rest to be authorized for payment on the same day they’re received. Using straight-through processing, digital payments are sent directly and securely to a supplier’s bank account via a Mastercard virtual card, with no manual intervention required. “Delayed payments create significant challenges for businesses financially and operationally, especially in today’s environment,” said Ron Shultz, executive vice president, New Payment Flows, North America at Mastercard. “Track Instant Pay helps solve these pain points by enabling buyers and suppliers to automate their manual payment processes, unlocking valuable time, working capital and choice. This innovative new solution is the latest step in our ongoing commitment to support multiple payment rails and mission to modernize B2B payments.” Mastercard Track Instant Pay combines machine learning capabilities from Previse, an artificial intelligence and data science company, with Mastercard’s core commercial solutions and global payment network to transform how businesses send and receive payments. The solution is part of Mastercard’s comprehensive suite of B2B products and services designed to reduce complexity and risk, cut costs, and automate processes for businesses around the world. Key benefits of Mastercard Track Instant Pay include: Suppliers: By accelerating payments, Mastercard Track Instant Pay helps suppliers improve cash flow and unlock working capital so they can reinvest in their business. Instant payments eliminate costs associated with chasing collections on outstanding invoices, and rich remittance information is provided with each payment, simplifying reconciliation. Buyers: With Mastercard Track Instant Pay, buyers can grow revenue by increasing acceptance and converting costly check and ACH payments to rebate-generating virtual cards. Automating manual processes helps lower costs, accelerate payments, and remove friction to improve business relationships. Buyers can manage their working capital more efficiently using the credit line tied to their commercial card account; while unique, dynamically generated virtual account numbers with layers of controls provide enhanced security for supplier payments. Issuers: Mastercard Track Instant Pay can help issuers grow and extend the reach of their virtual card programs to meet increasing demand and gain a competitive advantage. Mastercard Track Instant Pay is available in the United States with plans for international expansion, as Mastercard continues to onboard partners as part of its mission to modernize business payments.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--2022 kicked off with gains across nearly all retail sectors, according to Mastercard SpendingPulseTM, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment. This January, U.S. retail sales excluding auto increased 7.2% year-over-year (YOY), with online sales growing 10.4% compared to January 2021. Despite the shadow of Omicron and elevated inflation, consumer spending was buoyed by pent-up savings, wage growth and the continued re-opening of the “experience economy.” Beneficiaries included Department Stores, Apparel and Luxury, which all saw double-digit growth. Key retail trends were a continuation from the strong holiday season, including: The shift back to services: The pandemic arrested a decades-long trend of more spending on services vs goods. Since the middle of last year, this tide has begun to shift back to services – or experiences – as consumers resume in-person activities. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, Restaurant sales grew 36.7% YOY and 16.6% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Digital demand: E-commerce sales growth shows no signs of stopping, with double-digit increases in January even compared to the strong base in 2021. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, e-commerce sales were up 110.1%, underscoring the sustained and significant nature of the shift to digital. New year, new looks: Apparel sales were up 37.6% in January YOY, the strongest growth rate for January in SpendingPulse history. The Apparel sector has experienced positive growth for 11 consecutive months as consumers refresh wardrobes and dress to impress for gatherings and events taking place in 2022. Department Stores have similarly gained from resurgent spending, with January sales up 10.5% YOY and 9.8% vs. pre-pandemic levels. Luxe for loved ones: Luxury (+45.3% YOY) and Jewelry (+19.8% YOY) sales continued to outperform in January ahead of Valentine’s Day. “Coming on the heels of the holidays, January typically marks a month of returns and exchanges. However, the strong growth across sectors reflects the optimism and eagerness for the year ahead,” said Steve Sadove, senior advisor for Mastercard and former CEO and Chairman of Saks Incorporated. “With nearly all sectors up, we see consumers returning to their shopping habits with a continued emphasis on digital.” *Excluding automotive sales About Mastercard SpendingPulse: Mastercard SpendingPulse reports on national retail sales across all payment types in select markets around the world. The findings are based on aggregate sales activity in the Mastercard payments network, coupled with survey-based estimates for certain other payment forms, such as cash and check. Mastercard SpendingPulse defines “U.S. retail sales” as sales at retailers and food services merchants of all sizes. Sales activity within the services sector (for example, travel services such as airlines and lodging) are not included.

MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ACI Worldwide (NASDAQ: ACIW), the global leader in mission-critical, real-time payments software, and Mastercard, a leading global technology company in the payments industry, today announced that Peru’s Cámara de Compensación Electrónica (CCE), has won the Celent Model Bank 2022 Award for Payments Infrastructure. The awards recognize financial institutions for best practices in technology usage across various areas critical to success in banking. ACI and Mastercard’s strategic partnership provides real-time payment solutions globally. CCE chose ACI and Mastercard’s joint solution to drive its real-time payments modernization initiative. Created by Peru’s banks, CCE is the central entity that provides clearing services in the Peruvian financial system, facilitating interbank payments and checks. CCE sits at the heart of the Peruvian payments system, connecting more than 30 financial institutions. The modernization project included upgrading the existing CCE system to support the clearing and settlement of electronic payment methods, implementing Mastercard and ACI’s innovative solution for processing credit transfers in real-time, and enabling users to send and receive payments using a phone number without the need to supply recipient bank details. The transformation will significantly reduce the country’s reliance on cash and create a more digital economy while also driving greater efficiency, enhancing availability and security for its users and enabling innovation between payment systems. According to Celent, “CCE, the partnership’s first customer, selected the joint solution for a few reasons. First, both ACI and Mastercard have extensive global experience in real-time payments, having been involved in creating 18 real-time schemes around the world. CCE wanted to tap into that technology and implementation expertise to ensure that the system would align with the best, globally. CCE believed it would get best-in-class solutions for every element of a central infrastructure, including software, scheme rules, digital overlay services, testing, participant connectivity and onboarding. This end-to-end approach would ensure speed to market, as well as the agility to evolve over time.” “We congratulate CCE on this very well-deserved industry recognition and take immense pride in helping modernize Peru’s real-time payments infrastructure,” said Sam Jawad, head of bank and FI segment, ACI Worldwide. “Through our partnership with Mastercard, we are jointly delivering central banks, scheme operators, financial institutions and payment service providers a powerful platform for innovation.” “CCE’s win is a testament to how its payments modernization will boost Peru’s economy and foster greater financial inclusion for its 23 million unbanked citizens,” said George Evers, senior vice president, Real-Time Products, Mastercard. “We’re incredibly proud to have played a critical role in developing this technology. Our experience, expertise and close partnership with ACI Worldwide is enabling innovation across the globe—supporting economies, empowering businesses and improving the lives of people everywhere.” CCE’s real-time payments scheme, Immediate Interbank Transfers (IIT), launched in 2016 and has experienced significant growth, especially since the start of the pandemic. CCE recognized the need to improve its offering amid tremendous volume increases, while advancing its commitment to achieving greater financial inclusion across Peru. “Launching a new nationwide payment system is no simple task. Replacing one that is already growing rapidly, while simultaneously insulating banks from major changes and providing leading-edge possibilities—during a pandemic—is a remarkable achievement. Peru now finds itself with one of the most flexible systems in the region, if not the world, and well prepared for the future,” Celent added. Celent’s annual Model Bank Awards recognize financial institutions as “model banks” for their outstanding technology initiatives. To win, the initiatives must demonstrate clear business benefits, innovation, and technology or implementation excellence.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--From a clean home to a new wardrobe, Spring brings fresh starts and beckons consumers outside and back into stores. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse™, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment, total retail sales excluding auto in April increased +7.2% year-over-year (YOY) and +15.3% compared to pre-pandemic spending (2019), not adjusted for inflation. This is similar to the YOY monthly growth experienced thus far in 2022. Key trends for April reinforce consumer resilience in the face of inflation and highlight seasonal spending across sectors and channels. Of note: Springing into stores: In-store sales were up +10.0%, while e-commerce sales are down -1.8% compared to last year, reflecting consumer demand to get out. However, online sales remain elevated (+92.0%) vs pre-pandemic April 2019. California, New York, Florida, Nevada and Illinois were among the states leading the charge back to brick-and-mortar. Warm weather wardrobe: Consumers refreshing their wardrobes for potential summer travel and the warmer months ahead contributed to continued growth for Apparel (+10.8% YOY / +8.4% pre-pandemic) and Department Stores (+15.7% YOY / +22.3% pre-pandemic), though rates have started to soften from the peaks earlier this year. Nesting season: Furniture and Furnishing sales, which saw the seventh consecutive month of positive growth, were up +3.8% YOY and +25.7% compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. While the super-hot housing market is starting to show signs of cooling, consumers continue investing in their homes and feathering their nests for seasons to come. “Whether for a family barbeque, returning to the office or senior prom, it seems like everyone is out shopping for something,” said Steve Sadove, senior advisor for Mastercard and former CEO and Chairman of Saks Incorporated. “Mastercard SpendingPulse shows spending across sectors in April.” *Excluding automotive sales.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard has welcomed a raft of new global partners to its innovative Mastercard Installments program and is expanding it further to support small businesses in the U.S. Illustrating the demand for powerful buy now, pay later (BNPL) experiences from familiar and trusted brands, several new partners are providing support for the program, including HSBC, J.P.Morgan and NatWest in the U.K.; Cross River Bank, Evolve Bank & Trust, Jifiti, Live Oak Bank, MOCA Financial and WebBank in the U.S.; and Saudi National Bank (SNB) in Saudi Arabia. The program taps the power and scale of the Mastercard network, which connects to more than 90 million merchants globally, to instantly support secure BNPL payments at checkout, both in-store and online. In addition to delivering more payment choice, Mastercard Installments is built on responsible lending practices and supports shoppers with an enhanced set of consumer protections, data transparency and insight-driven programs. Through technology, data and insights, and its consulting expertise, Mastercard is creating a more intelligent way to provide installment lending at scale. “We believe no matter how you pay, a foundation of strong protections must be in place,” said Craig Vosburg, Chief Product Officer at Mastercard. “Trust is the currency of innovation. Using a Responsible-by-Design approach ensures that we stay ahead of consumer, merchant and bank needs and expectations, continuously building confidence in the payments ecosystem by providing choice at scale.” A Responsible, Intelligent Way to Offer Installment Lending According to new global consumer research from Mastercard's World Payments Advisory™, nearly a quarter of respondents across 50+ markets have used a BNPL product in the past six months.[i] For BNPL users, “forgetting the payment was due” was the leading reason for missing an installment payment, while concerns about “hidden charges” were cited as a leading barrier to consumer adoption overall. Mastercard Installments addresses these concerns with a suite of unique, innovative services that increases transparency and helps protect consumers and businesses. These services include: Cutting-edge insights and analytics: Merchants and lenders are able to access a comprehensive set of data dashboards to better understand how their products are performing. Mastercard Test & Learn® technology can also pinpoint where to prioritize efforts and resources that enhance the user experience and drive successful loan repayment. Mitigating repayment risk with open banking and AI: In the U.S., using consumer-permissioned data and open banking technology, lenders can identify behavioral patterns to reduce the risk of failed payments while artificial intelligence can adjust models more quickly and accurately for success. Dedicated and embedded consumer protections: To participate in the Mastercard Installments program, lenders agree to follow applicable laws and network guidelines on responsible lending practices and data usage practices, among others. Consumers and U.S. small businesses enjoy the peace of mind that they get today from any other Mastercard product – including tokenization, dispute resolution, and zero fraud liability. Empowering U.S. Small Businesses Mastercard research shows that over 70% of small business owners who have used personal installments are likely to adopt business installments products if they become available.[ii] Meeting this demand in the U.S., Live Oak Bank, the nation’s leading small business lender, will support the program, with the goal to make Mastercard Installments available to its 7,000 small business customers.iii This builds on Mastercard’s ongoing commitment to Main Street America, delivering products and services that help improve operational efficiency, manage cash flow and maximize customer connections with financial tools. Learn more about Mastercard Installments and its range of benefits for consumers, merchants and acquiring banks, lenders, as well as wallets and BNPL players. Madhu Kejriwal, Group Head, Unsecured Lending & Partnerships, HSBC Wealth & Personal Banking, said, “Customer expectations have evolved as the payments landscape has advanced, so banks need to find appropriate solutions. Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) lies at the intersection of payments and lending; it can provide customers with a seamless payment option. However, it’s important to realize that it’s very much a form of credit. HSBC is fully committed to responsible lending, and providing transparency to customers is of utmost importance to us. We want to clearly position any BNPL payment plan as part of a customer’s approved credit line. Our partnership with Mastercard is a crucial element of HSBC UK’s responsible lending strategy, as it enables us to provide customers with access to trusted payment options when they want to budget for larger purchases with affordable payment plans.” Huntley Garriott, President of Live Oak Bank, said, “Live Oak knows small business customers need flexible financial products that provide security, transparency and scalability so they can grow their business at the pace that suits their needs. We are excited to partner with Mastercard to explore lending solutions through the Mastercard Installments program as it allows us to deliver innovative products from a trusted source while aligning with our mission to be America’s small business bank.” Martin Wise, Managing Director, Short-Term Borrowing at NatWest, said, “There’s a clear demand for buy now, pay later and we are determined to make it better and safer for our customers. By working closely with Mastercard, we are ensuring responsible measures such as clear affordability checks and useful tools, such as payment reminders to help customers budget, are at the heart of our solution.” Majed Hamdan Al Ghamdi, Chief Executive Officer of Retail Bank at the Saudi National Bank, said, “Flexible payment options benefit everyone in the ecosystem, and our partnership with Mastercard enables us to connect people in Saudi Arabia to the seamless benefits of Mastercard Installments. Through this initiative, we are providing consumers with enhanced ways to pay when and where they want and in line with their budget needs. Underpinned by the renowned security of the Mastercard network, Mastercard Installments opens up new shopping experiences to consumers across the Kingdom while offering them reassurance, confidence and peace of mind.” Sources: About Mastercard (NYSE: MA) Mastercard is a global technology company in the payments industry.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Please replace the photo with the accompanying corrected photo. The release reads: MASTERCARD SPENDINGPULSE: U.S. CONSUMERS CONTINUED TO SPEND IN JULY WHILE NAVIGATING HIGH INFLATION E-commerce growth sees a hot July amid promotional events, while home-focused spending cools According to Mastercard SpendingPulseTM, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment, U.S. retail spending excluding automotive increased +11.2% year-over-year in July, while retail sales excluding automotive and gas rose +9.0%. Notably, e-commerce sales were up 11.7% YOY, a sharp increase after months of softer growth. Rising prices—particularly for necessities such as food and fuel—were a contributing factor, as Mastercard SpendingPulse reflects nominal spending and is not adjusted for inflation. Spending increases in July outpaced monthly year-over-year growth experienced thus far in 2022, with demand and higher prices both contributing factors. Of note: Consumers continue to spend, with inflation’s impact varying across sectors: Consumers continue to navigate high inflation as they spend on wants and needs. The Grocery sector, for instance, saw sales up +16.8% YOY in July due primarily to food price increases. On the other hand, Apparel (+16.6%) and Jewelry (+18.6%) sales saw strong demand-driven year-over-year growth, well outpacing sector-specific inflation. E-commerce sales climb amid major promotional events: While in-store sales remain elevated, up +11.1% YOY/ +13.9% YO3Y, e-commerce posted its first month of double-digit sales growth (+11.7% YOY) since December. E-commerce is up nearly double pre-pandemic levels (+98.5% YO3Y). Online sales have ticked up since the beginning of June, though July’s major promotional events helped entice shoppers to splurge (and save) with online deals. High season for vacation, with road-trippers seeing some relief at the pump: Travel remains a priority, with Lodging up +29.6% YOY and Airline sales up+13.3% YOY. Fuel & Convenience spending remains elevated (+32.3% YOY / +47.1% YO3Y), though the growth rate is down compared to June – reflecting price declines at the pump. “The latest retail trends place an emphasis on consumer choice and passion driven spending – they’re hunting for deals, shopping across channels and ultimately still spending on experiences and goods that make them feel good,” said Steve Sadove, senior advisor for Mastercard and former CEO and Chairman of Saks Incorporated. “As retailers grapple with excess inventory and supply chain constraints, it’s likely that the promotional activity seen in July will continue to be an important strategy for retailers.” Mastercard Economics Institute: Housing market cooldown slows sales of home-related goods After heating up during the pandemic, the U.S. housing market has cooled considerably since the beginning of 2022, influencing consumer spending on home-related goods. Each time a home changes hands, there is usually a significant amount of spending as consumers outfit their new abode. But with significant interest rate hikes resulting in fewer homes sold, this has been translating to a natural decline in home-related purchases, as reflected in this month’s SpendingPulse. Sales growth for the Home Improvement (+2.9%) and Furniture & Furnishings sectors (+5.0%) has slowed. “Consumers’ purchasing power has been strained by higher prices, particularly for the most fundamental needs-based categories like food and energy,” said Michelle Meyer, U.S. chief economist, Mastercard Economics Institute. “Thus far, nominal spending remains strong as consumers cope with high price inflation. As we continue to look at the strength of the consumer, we will be keenly focused on trends surrounding employment and wage growth.” For additional insights about today’s housing trends and the economic impact across the country, see the Mastercard Economic Institute’s latest findings in A View on US Housing: Today and Tomorrow. About Mastercard SpendingPulse Mastercard SpendingPulse™ reports on national retail sales across all payment types in select markets around the world.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard announced today its collaboration with Marvel Studios’ “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”, in theaters November 11, to spotlight Black excellence and the irrepressible strength of Black women – both on and off the screen. With Priceless experiences, digital engagements and shoppable content that supports and celebrates the superpowers of Black business leaders, Mastercard is honoring the film’s inspiring message that the spirit of Wakanda is all around us. “Through representation and access to tools and resources, Mastercard is proud to honor the Black women-owned businesses that strive for success despite the systemic inequalities they face every day,” said Rustom Dastoor, EVP of Marketing and Communications, Mastercard North America. “When we see role models that look like us, which the film so impactfully demonstrates, it expands our sense of what’s possible, including a more diverse, inclusive economic future.” In a Wakanda-inspired commercial spot and supporting campaign, Egypt Otis, the owner of Comma Bookstore & Social Hub – a Flint, Michigan small business that specializes in Black and Brown literature, art and music – stars as a real-life superhero by being a role model to a young shopper. The girl realizes through her imagination and interaction with Egypt that superheroes are all around us, igniting excitement for the film, her ambition for the future, and the belief that she herself has that same potential. “To serve as the face of possibility for aspiring Black women and young girls makes me feel like a superhero of sorts – just for living my truth,” said Otis. “Mastercard’s Strivers Initiative has provided me the resources and platform to help my business thrive and further empower our community, which to me is truly priceless.” Mastercard’s support of the film is an extension of the company’s $500 million commitment to helping close the racial wealth and economic gap in the U.S. by supporting Black women-owned businesses through its Strivers Initiative, and partnerships with HBCUs and youth groups around the country, as well as Mastercard’s sustained efforts to build a more inclusive digital economy by providing the digital tools to help small businesses get online and thrive. In celebration of the film, select small business owners and youth groups will enjoy exclusive screenings in New York City and Atlanta ahead of the film’s release. Designed to create a multisensory experience, the screenings will feature film-inspired décor, photo opportunities, celebratory food and drink options, a Hall of Heroes video installation honoring attendees and other entrepreneurs, free branded swag and more. Separately, Mastercard is launching various Priceless engagements and shoppable activations, including: Mastercard Small Biz Marketplace (Instagram): Consumers can discover a reimagined shoppable social experience of exclusively Black women-owned small businesses and products from across the country with opportunities to shop, share & support them directly on Instagram. Social Content Community Series: Unlocking even more consumer power, Mastercard will feature Talia R. Boone, founder of Los Angeles based immersive floral wellness service Postal Petals®, Jean Brownhill, founder of online contractor network for Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprises Sweeten Enterprise, and Mandy Bowman, founder of the Black-owned business marketplace Official Black Wall Street - in a content series across social platforms, that illustrates their journey to success and impact they make through their business. The Mastercard Small Business Metaverse: in November 2022, Mastercard will launch an immersive virtual reality experience in Meta Horizon Worlds to connect consumers to a world where they can discover a variety of Black-owned small businesses and participate in activities designed to bring to life their unique stories and entrepreneurial journeys.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--New insights from the Mastercard Economics Institute reveal that consumers are taking advantage of a more traditional travel ecosystem in 2023, prioritizing leisure travel and pioneering new corridors around the world. Released today, Travel Industry Trends 2023 delivers key insights about the global state of travel, punctuated by shifting economic landscapes, persistent consumer demands, and a reopening of mainland China. In the face of a changing economic landscape, post-pandemic preferences for experiences over things1 and a consistent demand for leisure travel shape the 2023 outlook. Initially lagging leisure travel, business travel found its footing in the latter half of 2022, especially in cultures prioritizing a return to office. With an uncertain economy providing some cross-market turbulence, mainland China’s reopening is expected to bolster growth globally with concentrated impact in Asia Pacific, according to Mastercard Economics Institute estimates. Key findings include: Leisure and business travel are growing at the same pace. Global leisure travel remains robust, with flight bookings up roughly 31% in March 2023 compared to the same month in 2019.2 In the second half of 2022 into early 2023, corporate flight bookings caught up to leisure flight bookings driven by regions with a strong return to office culture.3 Global leisure and business travel are now growing at similar rates. Our insights show demand for in-person meetings, with the most significant growth in commercial travel and entertainment expenses being led by Asia Pacific and Europe up 64% and 42%, respectively, between January-March 2023.4 Mainland China’s reopening benefits global and Asia Pacific tourism. China’s reopening following tight COVID regulations comes at a time when it will likely have a positive impact on the experience economy as pent-up demand for travel is expected to drive strong tailwinds. By March 2023, spending on experiences was notably 93% of where it was in 2019 despite minimal travel last year.6 Economies in the Asia Pacific region could be obvious beneficiaries of China's opening, given their strong ties to international trade, tourism, and geographical proximity. Based on Mastercard Economics Institute estimates, other countries that are expected to benefit include northern Europe – Germany and France – and Brazil, which could see a boost in their exports to China as the economy recovers. Travelers establish new corridors. As consumers are enjoying higher incomes and returning to some level of pre-pandemic comfort, they’re also starting to venture further from home to new locations. Germany and Spain are becoming more popular for Latin American travelers, while Saudi Arabia and Egypt have become popular destinations for travelers from Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The U.S., previously ranked as number 5 in the top destinations for European travelers in 2022, now ranks number 4, signaling a building desire to explore across the pond7. Traditionally tourism-driven European countries like France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece could disproportionately benefit from resilient global tourists. Tourists continue to prioritize experiences. Preference for experiences over things persists, and travelers are demonstrating new demand for the unique. Potentially influenced by social media and entertainment, travelers are landing in lesser-known destinations in search of cultural immersion. As of March 2023, global spending on experiences was up 65% while spending on things is up 12% compared to 2019.8 Experience-oriented spending is surging in certain corridors where pandemic lockdowns have expired, but Chinese tourists who traditionally over-index on luxury retail compared to other tourists could provide a boost to goods spending across markets. “In the first full year of unfettered travel since the pandemic, consumers are acting on pent-up desire to explore new locales, connect with friends and family, and accumulate experiences to make up for lost time,” said Bricklin Dwyer, Mastercard chief economist and head of the Mastercard Economics Institute. ”Despite evolving economic landscapes, resilient consumers continue to prioritize travel. And with new corridors emerging and China reopening, the 2023 outlook indicates good reason to be optimistic.” Comprehensive Support to Travelers & Tourism Sector Travelers want a good experience from the time they book their plane ticket to their first step on new soil, and companies that understand that are better positioned to establish longer and more valuable relationships with their consumers. This key shift in expectations has already started to change not only how companies work with their consumers, but also the way in which we travel. And though consumer behavior will continue to shift alongside the macroeconomic environment, providing more choice in how to pay (like redeeming points for bookings), and tailoring experiences, recommendations, and offers are just two strategies that keep the individual traveler at the center of engagement. Mastercard is dedicated to helping the global tourism sector recover and welcome travelers through a range of services, from market analysis and high-frequency data insights that help make sense of changing consumer trends to marketing solutions and consumer engagement strategies that drive brand loyalty and maximize bookings.
