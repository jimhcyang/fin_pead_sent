PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard is furthering its commitment to create a more sustainable and inclusive digital economy, with a pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Understanding that economic growth cannot come at the expense of the planet, the company’s global action plan aims to continue to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) by remaining focused on the decarbonization of its operations and bolstering its efforts to decarbonize its supply chains. Mastercard’s net zero goal builds upon its existing GHG commitments that align with the Business Ambition for 1.5°C pledge. The first in the payments industry to gain Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) approval for its GHG goals, Mastercard is currently working towards its SBTi-approved goal to reduce total Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 38% and Scope 3 emissions by 20% by 2025 from a 2016 baseline. These targets reflect a long-term commitment by the company to monitor and implement best practices to reduce emissions across the business, drive operational energy efficiency, and further engage suppliers in value chain decarbonization. Progress already made towards these goals includes achieving 100% renewable electricity in 2020, reinforced by a commitment to RE100. “2021 is set to be a crucial year for climate action, and we believe the private sector has a vital role to play in the transition to a zero-carbon economy. The quality of all our futures are deeply and inextricably linked to the health and well-being of our planet. That’s why, in addition to improving our own environmental footprint, we’re driving systemic change through powerful coalitions and empowering our network of nearly 3-billion consumers to take collective action to preserve the environment,” said Kristina Kloberdanz, Chief Sustainability Officer, Mastercard. “By coming together, we can drive exponential impact.” Mastercard is also mobilizing its technology, expertise, and trusted global partnerships network to lead on collective climate action, through innovative initiatives such as the Greener Payments Partnership and the Priceless Planet Coalition. Decarbonizing Operations and Supplier Sustainability Mastercard is initially focusing on two priority areas to make progress against its emissions targets – decarbonizing its own operations and leading on supplier sustainability. Mastercard operates close to 180 facilities across the world and is prioritizing renewable energy and energy efficiency programs, including the expanded use of solar panels in data centers, which account for more than 50 percent of energy usage across the company. Currently all Mastercard owned properties in the U.S. are fitted with solar panels and all owned properties across the world are LEED certified. Taking an innovative and collaborative approach to supplier sustainability has made Mastercard a leader in the field, recently maintaining an “A” rating for Supplier Engagement from CDP. Emissions associated with the company’s supply chain (as measured at the end of 2020) amount to more than 70 percent of the total carbon footprint. As such, continued support with setting and achieving GHG goals will be provided to suppliers. In the future, Mastercard will also review opportunities for investing in carbon removal projects, including new nature-based solutions as well as technologies and services that reduce carbon impact while supporting broader local economic and social development goals. Alexander Farsan, Global Lead on Science Based Targets at WWF, one of the SBTi partners said: ""Mastercard has shown real climate leadership by setting science-based targets and it's great to see they have walked the talk and delivered significant emissions reductions since setting their targets. With Mastercard’s commitment, through our Business Ambition for 1.5ºC campaign, to reduce emissions across their entire value chain in line with 1.5ºC, we hope to see them continue the path of deep emissions reductions as they work towards their net-zero goal. At the SBTi, we look forward to more companies following in the footsteps of Mastercard and using science-based-targets as a valuable tool to make meaningful progress towards a zero-carbon economy."" Mobilizing for Collective Climate Action Mastercard is leveraging its experience in financial inclusion to help build sustainable, scalable solutions and drive collective action for long term climate impact. This includes working with banks, merchants and other industry partners to empower consumers with environmental choices. Learn more about how the company is supporting sustainable card choices through the Greener Payments Partnership and Mastercard’s Sustainable Cards Materials Directory here. Through Mastercard’s partnership with Doconomy, consumers can now directly access a Carbon Calculator which allows them to track their footprint, better understand the impact of their purchasing behavior, as well as access information on mindful choices. In addition, through the Priceless Planet Coalition, Mastercard is working with 40+ partners to regrow 100 million trees over 5 years - together with forest restoration partners, Conservation International and World Resources Institute.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--2021 kicked off with retail gains across nearly all sectors and all 50 U.S. states, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment. This January, U.S. retail sales excluding automotive and gasoline increased 9.2% year-over-year, with online sales growing 62.1% compared to 2020. The momentum of a stronger-than-anticipated holiday season continued throughout the month, with consumer spending buoyed by an infusion of stimulus payments, particularly in the first two weeks of the year. At a national level, key retail trends from January include: Home is Where the Spending Still Is: Spending in and around the home remains a top consumer priority, with Furniture & Furnishings (+16.6%) posting its eighth straight month of solid gains. Home categories, along with Grocery, have seen some of the biggest category lifts following stimulus payments. Consumers Start to Refresh their Wardrobes: Following months of working and schooling from home, we’re starting to see consumers invest in their wardrobe again—with Specialty Apparel online sales up +52.5% in January. Although the sector is still down (-4.3%), this is the smallest year-over-year decline experienced since the pandemic began impacting sales in March 2020. A Positive Sign for Department Stores: The Department Store sector experienced its first year-over-year increase in sales (+1.5%) since 2019, boosted by strong online sales (+27.9%). Gasoline Sales Reflect Restricted Mobility in January: No sector has been a clearer bellwether of consumers’ mobility this past year than Gasoline sales, with negative year-over-year growth since mid-March 2020. While the declines eased over the summer months, Covid-19 restrictions as well as winter weather led to a further deterioration in gasoline demand in January. Around the country, Mastercard SpendingPulse analysis shows that the overall retail story remains largely positive: January was a month of growth across all 50 states. States in the southeast and the west are driving the largest increases of total retail sales. More outdoor options are available in the warmer southern states and online sales growth has surged in the western states. Moreover, e-commerce has become a critical driver of sales growth across the country. In California, for instance, online sales grew 77.4%, helping to lift retail sales overall to 7.9%. ""We’re living in a digital world. For consumers, e-commerce has emerged as a lifeline and a lifestyle. January’s numbers are just further proof of this ongoing trend,” said Steve Sadove, Mastercard senior advisor and former CEO of Saks, Inc. “A big, bright note from January is that consumers are spending. While we know that consumers are also saving their stimulus funds and paying down debt, these numbers show that stimulus is helping to boost sales for retailers around the country."" Building on Mastercard’s commitments to help retailers, restaurants, CPG brands and others assess, navigate and emerge stronger from the effects of the pandemic, key SpendingPulse insights will now be published monthly on www.Mastercard.com/news. “For governments and businesses of all sizes, access to timely, data-driven insights is critical to decision-making—particularly in times of uncertainty,” said Raj Seshadri, president of data and services, Mastercard. “By sharing economic insights such as SpendingPulse, we hope to enable smarter decisions with better outcomes today and for the long term.” *Excluding auto and gasoline About Mastercard SpendingPulse: Mastercard SpendingPulse™ reports on national retail sales across all payment types in select markets around the world. The findings are based on aggregate sales activity in the Mastercard payments network, coupled with survey-based estimates for certain other payment forms, such as cash and check. As such, SpendingPulse™ insights do not in any way contain, reflect or relate to actual Mastercard operational or financial performance, or specific payment-card-issuer data. Mastercard SpendingPulse defines “U.S. retail sales” as sales at retailers and food services merchants of all sizes. Sales activity within the services sector (for example, travel services such as airlines and lodging) are not included. Holiday spending insights are preliminary.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard (NYSE: MA) today announced the appointment of Tim Murphy, the company’s general counsel, to the newly created position of chief administrative officer. In this role, he will have oversight of the company’s Law, Franchise and Integrity activities, as well as the added management of its People and Capabilities function. Michael Fraccaro will continue as chief people officer and a member of the company’s management committee, reporting to Murphy. Together, they will further shape and drive Mastercard’s world-class culture with decency at its core. A 21-year veteran of the company, Murphy has helped to shape Mastercard throughout his tenure, beginning with his role as one of the lead lawyers for the company’s initial public offering. Since then, he has blended business and legal insights and evolution, serving at different times as president of the company’s U.S. region and chief product officer. “In the decade I’ve worked with Tim, I’ve seen firsthand his ability to drive transformational change while sustaining fidelity to the core values that make Mastercard a special place to work,” said Michael Miebach, chief executive officer. “We have a unique opportunity in bringing together the teams that care about our people, law, policy, security, franchise, compliance and inclusion. Tim is the right person to use this moment to advance the strategy Mastercard needs to thrive in an increasingly complex world.” Richard Verma, executive vice president for Global Public Policy and Regulatory Affairs, has been promoted to general counsel and head of Global Public Policy. He will now lead the company’s core legal and regulatory functions, as well as its global and regional public policy teams. Verma will also join the Mastercard’s Management Committee. He joined Mastercard in late 2020, bringing more than 25 years of international experience across senior levels of business, law, diplomacy and the military. “In just a few short months, Rich has had a true impact on our engagement with policymakers and others across the globe. We’ll look to continue to tap into his extensive experience in public policy, geopolitics, trade and international law, and strong relationships to support the global move to a digital economy,” said Murphy. The company also announced two other executive changes. Ron Green, Mastercard’s chief security officer, has been appointed to the company’s management committee. Randall Tucker, the company’s chief inclusion officer, has been promoted to executive vice president and will continue to lead a refreshed Diversity, Equity & Inclusion team.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Trust is the key ingredient to conducting digital commerce. Central to creating trust in a digital world is the ability to prove your digital identity - who you are, whether you are interacting in person, online or in app. Today, Mastercard (NYSE: MA) took steps to advance its identity verification efforts with the acquisition of Ekata for US$850 million. Digital identity is a foundational part of Mastercard’s multi-layered approach to security. In 2019, the company introduced a new framework on how digital interactions should evolve, as well as how digital identity will build trust, collaboration and economic growth. That framework is now in use across a number of sectors, from education to travel to healthcare. Ekata works with a wide range of global merchants, financial institutions, travel companies, marketplaces and digital currency platforms. The company uses insights to deliver unique scores, data attributes and risk indicators that businesses then use to make more informed decisions. They help their customers identify good consumers and businesses and bad actors in real-time during online account opening, payments and variety of other digital interactions. ""The shift to a more digital world requires real solutions to secure every transaction and instill trust in every interaction,"" said Ajay Bhalla, president of cyber and intelligence solutions at Mastercard. ""With the addition of Ekata, we will advance our identity capabilities and create a safer, seamless way for consumers to prove who they say they are in the new digital economy."" Ekata's identity verification data, machine learning technology and global experience combined with Mastercard's fraud prevention and digital identity programs will help businesses confidently know who their customers are and, in turn, help those customers safely interact online. Mastercard and Ekata's integrated services will build on both companies’ commitments to ensure trust and the responsible use of data. “The acceleration of online transactions has thrust global digital identity verification to the forefront as one of the biggest opportunities to build digital trust and combat global fraud,” said Rob Eleveld, CEO at Ekata, Inc. ""The right identity verification solutions enable inclusive and frictionless experiences while, at the same time, ensuring customer privacy, control and security. Becoming part of the Mastercard Identity family ensures a broader, collective approach to meeting the growing demands of the digital economy.” Ekata is headquartered in Seattle, with offices in Amsterdam, Singapore and Budapest. Delivering on the Strategy, Strengthening Value Commitment to Privacy, Responsibility - Ekata shares Mastercard’s commitment to safe and secure data practices centered around the individual, further reinforcing their value to the end user. Strong Identity Technology - Ekata has built a core set of identity verification services that helps to provide the backbone of the safety and security of everyday commerce. By bringing the capabilities, technologies and teams together, there is the potential to deliver even more trust and peace of mind, well beyond identity verification and identifying fraud trends. Complementary Expertise - The addition of Ekata's technology and engineering teams will help bolster the support Mastercard can provide as a one-stop partner for any consumer, bank, merchant, fintech or government’s data, payment and open banking needs. The combined capabilities across digital-first, installment and crypto payment services will help to enable greater choice and functionality, with the potential to expand further to real-time payments and cross-border activities. Together, Mastercard and Ekata will deliver a more comprehensive identity service that can power real-time decision-making needs, from new account openings to helping merchants assess potential fraud before a payment transaction is authorized. As with past acquisitions, Mastercard does not expect this acquisition to be dilutive to its business for greater than 24 months. This dilution is driven by investments in the business, including the impact of purchase accounting and integration related costs. The transaction is subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions. It is anticipated to close within the next six months.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Black women are building and growing businesses faster than any other segment and yet receive less than one percent of venture capital funding. In addition, only three percent of the people actually leading investments at VC firms are Black according to the National Venture Capital Association. To help further access to funding for Black women, Mastercard today announced a multi-million dollar investment in Fearless Fund, a venture capital fund built by women of color for women of color. “The significant investment gaps in women-founded companies, which is especially acute for Women of Color, holds everyone back,” said Michael Froman, president of strategic growth, Mastercard. “The need to narrow this gender and racial disparity is critical in driving forward innovation and fueling inclusive, sustained economic recovery across our country. We are investing in Fearless Fund and partnering to bring innovative programs to market to help Black women founders get access to the capital and resources they need to achieve their full potential.” The investment will allow Fearless Fund to further expand their portfolio of women of color founded and co-founded companies in the CPG, Food & Beverage, Beauty, Fashion, and Technology sectors. Additionally, the social impact of the investment will have a significant role in job creation and wealth distribution in underserved communities. ""This multi-million dollar investment from Mastercard is further proof of their commitment to providing resources in an effort to better serve the hard-working but severely underfunded Women of Color entrepreneurs who so deserve equal capital distribution. We have been working together with Mastercard for almost 3 years now and look forward to growing this relationship,"" says Arian Simone, Co-Founder & General Partner of Fearless Fund. Mastercard has long been an advocate for the small business community and reinforced its investments to support Black communities with the introduction of its Strivers Initiative earlier this year. This initiative is focused on elevating the visibility of Black female business owners overcoming obstacles to maintain and grow their business, while encouraging consumers and businesses alike to shop, share and support them. In Solidarity Across U.S. Cities Last year, Mastercard announced a half-billion-dollar commitment to support Black communities across the U.S. over the next five years, to help close the racial wealth and opportunity gap starting in seven cities. As part of that effort the company is hosting in a series of local In Solidarity events to address financial barriers and how to advance equitable growth. The tour includes Strivers programming, hosted by Arian Simone, General Partner and Co-Founder of Fearless Fund, and in partnership with Create & Cultivate, to drive awareness on the state of Black women-owned business in select cities across the U.S. local markets. The Strivers events will foster dialogue with local leaders and small businesses around delivering on the needs of local businesses and the actions cities can take to advance an equitable business climate. To further underscore its commitment to this community, Mastercard and Fearless Fund launched the Fearless Strivers Grant Contest* to provide Black female small business owners across the U.S. who’ve been hit hardest by the pandemic with additional grants and tools to help grow their business. These efforts build on Mastercard’s sustained commitment to building a more inclusive digital economy including its commitment to bring 50 million small and medium-sized businesses into the digital economy, specifically helping 25 million woman entrepreneurs grow their businesses.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard today announced a US$10 million (approximately 75 crore rupees) commitment to directly address critical Covid-related needs in India. Over the past few weeks, the country has seen a spike in both Covid diagnoses and deaths, with the healthcare system being stretched to its limits as more than 350,000 new cases are identified each day. The philanthropic efforts, delivered through the Mastercard Impact Fund, will focus on three priority areas – access to hospital resources, access to additional oxygen supplies and continued support of the company’s employees across the country. The largest contribution will be designated to support the expansion of 2,000 beds through the installation of portable hospitals that can address the immediate healthcare needs. Working with the government and local partners on the ground, these hospitals can be constructed quickly and could help an estimated 2.5 million Indians gain access to healthcare, adding to the nation’s healthcare infrastructure. “The situation in India is gut-wrenching; it’s clear that no one has been left untouched and that no one can be a bystander,” said Ajay Banga, executive chairman of Mastercard. “We have long been advocates for the people of India, as employers and as enablers of the economy. Now it’s time for us to put our shoulders to the wheel and do whatever we can to help all of India get through this intensified crisis.” In addition to the on-the-ground medical support, Mastercard is also allocating funding for additional shipments of 1,000 oxygen generators, as part of a broader corporate effort. And the company is donating to local charities and NGOs to allow for direct support of those affected by the virus, including the frontline medical workers across the country. “The U.S. and India have a shared history of helping each other during times of crisis,” said Richard Verma, general counsel at Mastercard and former U.S. ambassador to India. “We’re hearing from our own teams the challenges that they and their families are facing. It’s critical that we stand by our friends and help those who have been impacted. Our commitment today and into the future is strong and enduring.” Prof. K. VijayRaghavan, Principal Scientific Adviser to Government of India added, ""The steep rise of Covid-19 cases poses an enormous challenge to clinical care facilities. Revamping existing hospital infrastructure by increasing the number of beds to accommodate more patients requiring critical care and procuring more equipment to enhance oxygenation for patients, is of utmost priority. We are grateful to the industry for their support to aid various State Governments’ critical care systems to boost their response to Covid-19. Mastercard and office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to Government of India have joined hands to provide 2,000 beds and purchase oxygen concentrators for hospitals in states that have been affected the most. There have been many such partnerships, many more such needed in the coming days. We hope to speedily facilitate them where there is most need.” Extended Support for Employees, Partners Mastercard has already committed to cover all vaccine-related costs for its India-based employees and immediate families, as doses are available. To help extend these efforts – and provide another outlet for its employees across the globe to help each other – Mastercard will also match employee donations to its Employee Assistance Fund, up to $15,000 per individual. This comes on top of a $500,000 corporate contribution to the fund. The company will continue to explore other opportunities to activate partnerships in India and across the global community – from the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum and U.S.-India Business Council to the Business Roundtable and the American India Foundation – to support these efforts.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As the world went into pandemic lockdown in 2020, consumers shifted their spending habits to embrace contactless tap-and-go payments and online shopping. As stores closed and social distancing took hold, retailers worldwide moved their businesses online, embraced e-commerce and explored the potential of new ways to pay. More than a year later, research from Mastercard shows that the adoption of new payment technologies is rising, and consumer appetite for new, fast and flexible digital experiences continues to grow. The Mastercard New Payments Index, conducted across 18 markets around the world, shows 93% of people will consider using at least one emerging payment method, such as cryptocurrency, biometrics, contactless, or QR code, in the next year. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (63%) agree they have tried a new payment method they would not have tried under normal circumstances, but the pandemic has galvanized people to try flexible new payment options to get what they want, when they want it. With this interest and consumer demand also comes a greater expectation for businesses to provide multiple ways to shop and pay. In fact, more than half of consumers say they would avoid businesses that do not accept electronic payments of any kind. “The pandemic made us think differently, partly out of necessity,” said Craig Vosburg, Chief Product Officer at Mastercard. “To deliver the choice and flexibility that consumers need – and increasingly expect –retailers worldwide need to offer a range of payment solutions that are easy to access and always on. As we look ahead, we need to continue to enable all choices, both in-store and online, to shape the fabric of commerce and make the digital economy work for everyone.” Contactless technology was the digital catalyst to explore new payment options because of its fast, secure and touch-free experience. Between the first quarter of 2020 and the same period in 2021, more than 100 markets saw contactless as a share of total in-person transactions grow by at least 50 percent. 3 A year into the COVID-19 pandemic, contactless is showing its staying power and dynamism – in the first quarter of 2021 alone, Mastercard saw 1 billion more contactless transactions as compared to the same period of 2020, with particular momentum in emerging contactless markets like the U.S. and Brazil, where contactless penetration in the two markets combined grew by nearly 3x year-over-year. 3 All signs point to a continued growth path for contactless, with nearly 7 in 10 consumers anticipating using a contactless card this year. Looking to the future, digital currencies, biometrics, contactless and QR codes are trending as emerging payments technologies as people’s comfort with them and understanding of them increases and the use of cash decreases. In fact, 71% of people say they expect to use cash less moving forward. The exploding interest in new payment technologies may encourage businesses to expand their options at checkout. The Mastercard New Payments Index found: Cryptocurrency1 Gains Ground, With Millennials Primed to Jump In – Today consumers can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency as a commodity or investment. Consumers are also increasingly showing interest in being able to spend crypto assets for everyday purchases. As global interest in cryptocurrencies as a payment method continues to accelerate, 4 in 10 people (40%) across North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific say they plan to use cryptocurrency in the next year. Millennials globally and those in the Middle East and Africa are especially engaged in the cryptocurrency conversation, with more than half (67%) agreeing they are more open to using cryptocurrency than they were a year ago. In addition, 77% of Millennials are interested in learning more about cryptocurrency, while 75% agree they would use cryptocurrency if they understood it better. While consumer interest in cryptocurrency - especially floating digital currencies such as Bitcoin - is high, work is still required to ensure consumer choice, protection, and their regulatory compliance. Biometric Payments Are More Trustworthy – Perceptions of safety and convenience have been front and center for people over the past year. More than half (53%) of consumers agree that biometric checkout is secure. In fact, 6 in 10 consumers say they are excited about the potential of biometric verification methods such as gait or walk assessments and fingerprint authorization (61%), and 60% feel safer using biometrics to verify a purchase than entering a pin. Gait or walk assessments can be used to pay based on a person’s manner of walking. QR Codes - A Cleaner and More Convenient Alternative to Cash in Developing Markets – While mature markets – like the U.S. – are focused on contactless payments, growing markets are leveraging QR-based options as a clean and convenient way to interact with merchants. In APAC, the majority of respondents perceive new payment methods like QR codes to be cleaner (76%) and more convenient (71%) than cash for in-person payments as it is likely consumers are using their own mobile device. 66% of respondents in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 63% in the Middle East and Africa expect to use more payment technologies like QR in the next year. To Meet People’s Demands, Businesses Forced to Jump into Emerging Payment Trends With consumer interest around new payment technologies, the expectation for businesses to adapt for the long-term is here to stay. Nearly eight in 10 respondents (79%) agree that they prefer to shop at stores that have both an in-person and online presence, and 68% noted being more excited to shop at retailers that can offer the latest payment methods. A recent study on 5,500 major Mastercard merchants, showed that between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, more than a fifth of these merchants globally increased the number of ways they connect with consumers either by enabling an e-commerce channel or accepting contactless transactions2. Over the same period, Mastercard saw the total number of card-not present transactions grow by over 30%.4 As one way to address this consumer preference for fast, touch-free payment experiences, many merchants are turning to contactless payments. Now, nearly 90% of in-person transactions globally take place at a contactless-enabled merchant, and nearly all merchant categories saw an increase in contactless transactions as a share of total in-person transactions year-over-year in the first quarter of 2021. 3 This behavior shift is reinforced by the desire for consumer choice – with 84% saying that they expect to make purchases when they want and how they want. The businesses that can provide multiple ways to shop and pay are best positioned to meet these expectations. As the demand for emerging payments and choice continues, it requires a wider range of payment solutions, insights, and products to meet the accelerating enthusiasm for the future state of pay.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Total U.S. retail sales sprung into another month of double-digit growth in April, according to Mastercard SpendingPulseTM, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment. U.S. retail sales excluding automotive and gasoline increased 23.3% year-over-year in April, and 10.8% compared to April 2019. Online sales in April grew 19.9% and 95.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods. Retail sales continue to benefit from stimulus payments, coupled with warmer weather and broader reopening across the country. While the recovery has not been universal or consistent – due to geographical, economic, and household differences – there are a number of key overarching trends. Restaurant Resurgence: April marks the second consecutive month of positive growth for the Restaurant category, underscoring that consumers have an appetite to eat out again. Spending at restaurants grew 118.8% vs. 2020, when widespread shut-downs crippled the industry, and were up 5.7% compared 2019. Limited-service Restaurants, such as fast-food, were up 21.7% compared to 2019, outpacing their Full-service counterparts (-13.5% YO2Y). Online Convenience: Despite the record shattering e-commerce growth in April 2020, online sales remained up year-over-year. E-commerce share continues to make up a bigger portion of total retail spend overall (21.6%), as well as in categories such as Apparel (61.7%), Department Stores (21.0%) and Jewelry (15.7%). Department Stores See a Boost: Many of the depressed sectors in 2020, including Department Stores (+202.7%), Jewelry (+255%) and Lodging (+319.1%), are showing some of the largest year-over-year gains as retailers gear up for the return of gatherings and events. Department Stores grew 9.6% compared to 2019. “April's retail sales growth reinforces that the American consumer is healthy and eager to spend, especially on categories such as restaurants, which have faced restrictions over the past year,” said Steve Sadove, Mastercard senior advisor and former CEO of Saks, Inc. “There are a lot of factors at play including stimulus funds, pent-up demand, and the desire to reconnect with friends and family. The fact is that people are excited to gather again and they're refreshing their look for the occasion.” *Overall retail sales excluding gasoline and automotive compared to April 2020 About Mastercard SpendingPulse Mastercard SpendingPulse™ reports on national retail sales across all payment types in select markets around the world.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard announced today it will enhance its card program for cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, making it simpler for partners to convert cryptocurrency to traditional fiat currency. Working with Evolve Bank & Trust and Paxos Trust Company, the leading blockchain infrastructure and regulated stablecoin issuance platform, and Circle, a global financial technology firm and the principal operator of the USD Coin (USDC), a dollar digital currency or stablecoin, Mastercard and its partners will test this new capability to enable more banks and crypto companies to offer a card option to people wanting to spend their digital assets anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Today, when people spend cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, or Litecoin, it must enter and settle on Mastercard’s network as traditional fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar. Until now, crypto providers planning to launch or expand card programs could find it operationally challenging to perform the currency conversion, a critical step preceding the settlement on Mastercard’s network. Mastercard’s engagement with Evolve, Paxos and Circle solves this challenge for players across the industry. Mastercard announced in February 2021 it is preparing to enable select stablecoins directly on its network, expanding the future potential of digital assets and payments. Today’s news, enhancing the experience for cryptocurrency exchanges, is a critical step in expanding the ecosystem and safely, securely and compliantly setting the stage for the future of crypto payments. Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of digital asset and blockchain products & partnerships at Mastercard, commented: “Today not all crypto companies have the foundational infrastructure to convert cryptocurrency to traditional fiat currency, and we’re making it easier. Through our engagement with Evolve, Paxos, Circle and the larger digital assets community, Mastercard expects to deliver on our promise of consumer choice to provide options to people around the world on how and when to pay.” The enhancement to Mastercard’s existing Crypto Card Program includes a suite of partners. Mastercard is in discussions with Evolve Bank & Trust and Metropolitan Commercial Bank to issue cards, Uphold and BitPay to provide real-time crypto wallet technology, and i2c Inc., Apto Payments and Galileo Financial Technologies® to support processing and program management. With this enhancement to Mastercard’s Crypto Card Program, Paxos and Circle will use their platforms to facilitate the conversion of crypto to fiat through fiat-backed stablecoins, a class of cryptocurrency that offers price stability and is backed by reserve assets. Making the process simpler will allow more banks and crypto partners the opportunity to offer their consumers the choice of paying with cryptocurrency. Hear from Our Partners “As pioneers in crypto-backed debit card issuance, we are absolutely thrilled to see the level of investment that Mastercard and all the associated partners are demonstrating for innovative products,” said Apto Payments CEO Meg Nakamura. “BitPay believes the future of payments is on the blockchain because it transforms how consumers send, receive, and store money around the world,” said Stephen Pair, co-founder and CEO of BitPay. “Working with Mastercard’s pilot to turn digital assets into dollars for everyday spending will accelerate consumers’ use of crypto as a means of commerce.” Dante Disparte, Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Global Policy at Circle, commented: “The collaboration between Circle and Mastercard demonstrates that dollar digital currencies like USDC play a foundational role in making payments more efficient and can facilitate new economic activity for businesses worldwide.” “We are thrilled to be partnering with Mastercard and other leaders to evolve the payments landscape,” said Scot Lenoir, chairman of Evolve. “Evolve is a known leader that supports all forms of stored value and money movement for our diverse array of fintech customers. To support the tremendous consumer and business adoption of digital currencies over the last few years, we see settlement via USDC and other stablecoins as our next step in our journey to continue to modernize banking for all.” ""Galileo is excited to partner with Mastercard to simplify payments and provide the modern API technology that enables a seamless cryptocurrency conversion process of new currencies and coins to fiat currency and U.S. stablecoins,” said Derek White, CEO Galileo Financial Technologies. ""As one of the world's leading issuer-processors powering millions of active crypto-backed cards globally, i2c couldn't be more enthusiastic or honored to be counted as a key Mastercard partner for crypto,"" said Jim McCarthy, president, i2c Inc. ""We look forward to helping visionary crypto companies bring their card programs to market quickly through a single global platform, offering product diversity, robust applications, services, scale and unprecedented reliability."" ""Metropolitan Commercial Bank is proud to be named a key partner with Mastercard and its plan to enhance its existing Crypto Card Program,” said Nick Rosenberg, executive vice president and head of Global Payments at Metropolitan Commercial Bank. ""We are excited to join Mastercard in making it simpler to convert cryptocurrency to traditional fiat currency."" Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of Paxos, added, “Paxos builds the underlying technology that will usher in an open digital economy. Our stablecoins are trusted, regulated and always fully backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars. We can facilitate instant settlement for transactions on a 24/7 basis, 365 days a year. By partnering with Mastercard, we'll bring the benefits of crypto and blockchain to the everyday lives of consumers globally.” JP Thieriot, CEO of Uphold, said: “We’re thrilled to be working with Mastercard to advance the payments landscape and enable next generation transactionality for consumers and merchants alike. Removing friction and barriers to entry is critical to ensure the wide adoption of digital payments, and Mastercard is in position to lead the way.” About Mastercard (NYSE:MA): Mastercard is a global technology company in the payments industry.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard announced today a new Start Path global startup engagement program dedicated to supporting fast-growing digital assets, blockchain and cryptocurrency companies. As a continuation of Mastercard’s digital assets work, seven startups have joined the program, including GK8, Domain Money, Mintable, SupraOracles, STACS, Taurus, and Uphold, and together with Mastercard seek to expand and accelerate innovation around digital asset technology and make it safer and easier for people and institutions to buy, spend and hold cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Among the new program participants is Mintable (Singapore), a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace where users can create, buy and sell digital and physical assets backed by the blockchain such as digital collectibles, avant-garde artwork and even music. The Mintable platform is packed with novel features such as gasless minting and credit card purchasing that are designed to empower the everyday person to get involved with NFTs without any prior knowledge in crypto or coding. GK8 (Israel) is a self-managed end-to-end institutional crypto custody platform that offers a true air-gapped cold vault. This means that the platform is capable of creating, signing and sending secure blockchain transactions without receiving input from the internet, eliminating any potential cyberattack vectors. Taurus (Switzerland) delivers enterprise-grade infrastructure to manage any digital asset with one single platform, including crypto assets, digital currencies and tokenized assets covering issuance, custody, asset servicing and trading. Other participating startups and fast-growing digital asset and blockchain companies have been selected to join the inaugural track of the Start Path program: Domain Money (USA) looks to build a next generation investment platform, bridging the gap between digital assets and traditional finance for retail investors. SupraOracles (Switzerland) is a powerful blockchain oracle that helps businesses bridge real-world data to both public and private chains, enabling interoperable smart contracts to automate, simplify and secure the future of financial markets. STACS (Singapore) provides a blockchain infrastructure for the financial industry to unlock massive value and enable effective sustainable financing. Its clients and partners include global banks, national stock exchanges, and asset managers. Uphold (USA) is a crypto-native, multi-asset digital money platform offering investment and payment services to consumers and businesses worldwide. Uphold's unique ‘Anything-to-Anything’ trading experience enables customers to trade directly between asset classes with embedded payments facilitating a future where everyone has access to financial services. Founders of the digital asset and blockchain companies participating in the new Start Path program aim to address a host of pain points including asset tokenization, data accuracy, digital security and seamless access between the traditional and digital economy. Each startup is focused on solving a unique industry challenge and, throughout the program, will leverage Mastercard’s expertise to support the continued growth and development of their solutions. Jess Turner, executive vice president of New Digital Infrastructure and Fintech, commented: “Mastercard has been engaging with the digital currency ecosystem since 2015. As a leading technology player, we believe we can play a key role in digital assets, helping to shape the industry, and provide consumer protections and security. Part of our role is to forge the future of cryptocurrency, and we’re doing that by bridging mainstream financial principles with digital assets innovations.” Digital Assets and Fintech Innovation Supporting the startup ecosystem is a core part of Mastercard’s ethos, and more than 250 startups have participated in the Start Path program since 2014. With the expansion of Start Path to include fast-growing crypto, blockchain and digital assets startups, Mastercard is providing access to its latest tools and solutions to help these companies scale their innovations and cutting-edge technologies. These startups use the program to connect with our ecosystem of banks, merchants, partners and digital players across the globe to deliver new solutions.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. and PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--With spend already declining in Birmingham pre-COVID, the decrease rapidly accelerated in Birmingham’s downtown and surrounding tracts because of the pandemic significantly impacting the city’s small businesses. Minority owned businesses in the region saw an outsized impact from the downturn and are a priority focus amidst recovery. Mastercard and the Birmingham Department of Innovation and Economic Opportunity are working to address this with the introduction of Ascend Birmingham. The program is focused on helping local small businesses pivot to digital operations and thrive in an age of a more digitally engaged consumer. ""The City of Birmingham is thrilled to partner with Mastercard on this key initiative, which will go a long way in reaching our goal of making Birmingham a hub for minority-owned small businesses,"" Mayor Woodfin said. ""Allowing these businesses to flourish in digital spaces not only increases their reach but their creative potential as well. It's an incredible opportunity for our business community."" With support from Square, Accion Opportunity Fund and Sunrise by Lendio, Ascend Birmingham will provide education, tools and resources focused on building out an effective digital presence, accepting digital payments, growing and managing your business, gaining access to capital, and keeping your business and your customers protected. Participants in the program will also be provided a custom curated business kit that includes solutions such as a Square Reader for Contactless & Chip along with website development software, bookkeeping software and a professional bookkeeper from Sunrise by Lendio, advisory expertise from Accion Opportunity Fund, Mastercard cybersecurity and data insight solutions and other City-provided resources. Mastercard and the City of Birmingham have also partnered to deliver a city focused Digital Doors platform with always-on content and resources for local owners. “We applaud the efforts of Mayor Woodfin and the Department of Innovation & Economic Opportunity to ensure the endurance of Birmingham-based small businesses and are proud to partner with the city so that owners have access to the tools and resources necessary to thrive in today’s digital age,” said Michael Froman, vice chairman and president Strategic Growth for Mastercard. “The resiliency and drive of small business owners is unprecedented and supporting their recovery is the single most important thing we can all do for economic and social vitality.” Birmingham-based small businesses interested in learning more and signing up for an upcoming Ascend Birmingham cohort can visit here. Mayor Woodfin and Mastercard will also recognize three Birmingham businesses selected to be part of the national Priceless campaign, which highlights creative businesses offering unique experiences for patrons. Ursula Smith, founder of the Ursula Smith Dance Co.; Evan and Eleny Christen, owners of Pinspiration Birmingham; and Tanesha Sims-Summers, founder and CEO of Naughty But Nice Kettle Corn Co. are the Birmingham honorees. “Leveraging data-driven insights, we are partnering with the City of Birmingham to assess the impact of the pandemic on the local economy and help protect local communities and businesses that are most at-risk,” said Linda Kirkpatrick, president of North America for Mastercard. “With these insights we can engage our network of partners and prioritize investments in order to proactively build a foundation that fosters an equitable recovery.” “As an entrepreneur, I have had to adapt to a number of obstacles and uncertainties. When confronted with a problem or difficult situation I never run, which cultivated my faith, resilience, courage and fortitude needed to thrive in life and business. Opening a new studio location, a month before the pandemic hit Alabama forced me to pivot to a digital platform. This allowed me to expand my reach from Florida to Germany,” said Ursula Smith, Owner of Ursula Smith Company. In Solidarity with Birmingham As part of its In Solidarity initiative, Mastercard has embarked on a multi-city road show with Birmingham as the focus for the next stop. To support the region in helping close the racial wealth and opportunity gap for Black communities and business owners Mastercard and Blavity, Inc. the pre-eminent media resource for Black millennials, are partnering to launch a virtual discussion addressing a financial system that has systemically disadvantaged and excluded Black communities with a view to advancing opportunity and equitable growth in Birmingham. Speakers include: The honorable Randall Woodfin, Mayor of Birmingham, the Birmingham Office of Social Justice and Racial Equity, Rev. Arthur Price, Regions Bank and Morgan DeBaun, CEO, Blavity. Expanding Digitally with Customer Experience and Safety Prioritized Ascend Birmingham is part of Mastercard’s wider recovery efforts designed to support businesses and governments across the globe looking for resources to help better manage the health, safety and economic risks presented by the recent pandemic.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Retail sales in the U.S. grew for the 11th consecutive month in July, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse™, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment. With more cash in hand—fueled in part by the Child Tax Credit and pent-up savings—consumers drove U.S. retail spending growth, excluding automotive and gasoline, to +10.9% compared to July 2020. This is nearly quadruple the average growth in the month of July**. At a national level, back-to-school shopping is well underway, impacting a number of sectors as anticipated in our forecast. Overall, key retail trends from July include: Child Tax Credit Boosts Department Stores and Apparel Sales: The first of six monthly Child Tax Credit payments provided parents with an infusion of cash during the peak back-to-school shopping season, with Apparel (+80% YOY) and Department Store (+44.8% YOY) sectors seeing an uptick in sales for the month. This was concentrated in the days immediately following the first distribution on July 15. Return of the In-Store Shopper: Brick-and-mortar browsing is making its return, with in-stores sales making up 81.9% of total retail sales (ex auto) for the month. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, in-store sales were up +15.5% YOY in July and weekends experienced positive spikes in spending as a result of in-store shoppers returning to physical stores. Making a House a Home: According to data released by the U.S. Census Bureau, new home sales have fallen to an 18-month low. However, consumers are still eager to turn their houses into homes as the Furniture & Furnishings sector continues to grow on a YOY (+3.2%) and YO2Y (+26.8%) basis. “While e-commerce continues to play an increasingly significant role for retail, nothing replaces the in-store experience,” said Steve Sadove, senior advisor for Mastercard and former CEO and Chairman of Saks Incorporated. “July numbers reflect a return to the store. Consumers are shopping, spending and splurging across channels.” Mastercard’s chief economist and head of the Mastercard Economics Institute Bricklin Dwyer said, “Back to school shopping is back. Combined with greater savings and higher demand, the Child Tax Credit has provided a boost for families and is putting more money into retailers’ pockets.” *Excluding auto and gas **The average year-over-year growth in July over the past four years was 2.9% About Mastercard SpendingPulse Mastercard SpendingPulse™ reports on national retail sales across all payment types in select markets around the world. The findings are based on aggregate sales activity in the Mastercard payments network, coupled with survey-based estimates for certain other payment forms, such as cash and check. As such, SpendingPulse™ insights do not in any way contain, reflect or relate to actual Mastercard operational or financial performance, or specific payment-card-issuer data.

PURCHASE, N.Y. & WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Top business, government and civil society leaders will gather today for the second Global Inclusive Growth Summit, co-hosted by the Aspen Institute and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth. Key participants at the “Rebuilding for All” summit will announce commitments of more than $54 million across 10 new programs that will take action to help build inclusive and sustainable economies in communities around the world. These new commitments include efforts to support housing stability and build financial infrastructure in marginalized communities; investing in companies that support the resiliency of unsecured workers in India; and working to reduce bias in the data and algorithms that financial services institutions use in the U.S. Select summit participants have been supported in the development of their programs through a partnership with the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), an initiative of the Clinton Foundation. The COVID-19 pandemic has both accelerated the shift to a digital economy, and exacerbated inequality around the world. Here in the United States, the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on Black, Latino, and Native American communities – with wide disparities on both the health and financial effects of the pandemic. It is critical that public, private and civic sector leaders work together to address these longstanding disparities and advance solutions to help create a more inclusive economic recovery. Today’s sessions covered three thematic areas: People, Planet & Prosperity: Creating Growth that Sustains; The Global Agenda for Financial Security; and TechTonic Shifts: Putting Technology to Work for the Common Good. Global leaders shared their perspectives on “rebuilding for all”, as well as the risk of not acting: Vice President Kamala Harris, transcript remarks “When we harness our collective innovation and determination, we maximize our impact. Take the business community, for instance. There are employers across our nation that are leading the way on gender equality. They are committed to pay transparency, intentional in hiring and promoting, thoughtful in ensuring, flexibility and predictability. And studies have shown that they are seeing higher equity returns, increased profit margins, and greater productivity. So, here is my on-going challenge to business leaders, foundation leaders, and non-profit leaders across our country: think about what more you can do to remove barriers to opportunity within your own businesses and organizations. To make those businesses and organizations as inclusive as they are strong. And then, please do it. Because we need your help to build an economy that works for women and for all. In this moment of transformation, I believe that change is possible if we make it together. So, let's get to work.” Bill Clinton, 42nd President of the United States; Founder and Board Chair, Clinton Foundation “As the COVID-19 pandemic has painfully reminded us, far too many people have been left out and left behind for far too long. We have both a rare opportunity and a moral imperative to bring people together from across sectors and around the world, to build economies that give every person the chance to succeed. The investments being announced today will support both the immediate needs of the workforce and set up our economies for long-term inclusive growth and prosperity.” Raphael Bostic, President & CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta “I think it's really important that everyone understand that systemic racism and indeed any structure or institution that restricts opportunity based on a person's skin color or their family connections or any of those sorts of things is an economic issue because it constrains the access to opportunity and it really limits the ability of people and communities of achieving their full potential. And if they don't achieve their full potential, we all lose because we have smaller economies than we should, and we have less resilient economies than we should. At the Atlanta Fed, we are committed to ensuring the economy works for everyone and to creating a foundation upon which all individuals, communities and businesses can thrive.” 10 partners launch 10 new programs with a singular focus: impact Programs focused on driving financial inclusion for individuals: Mobility Capital Finance, Mastercard, and the City of Birmingham will jointly develop, launch, and manage Birmingham’s financial services infrastructure program to help 50,000 underbanked and unbanked residents in marginalized communities. JPMorgan Chase will commit $8.4 million to improve household stability as part of the firm’s $400 million five-year commitment to close the housing affordability gap for Black, Hispanic and Latino households. These commitments and policy solutions are part of the firm’s $30 billion commitment to advance racial equity and help drive an inclusive economic recovery. Prudential is building on the impact of its decade-long partnership with the Aspen Institute with a pledge of $11 million over five years to together establish “Equity Re-imagined” to improve job quality, empower people to build financial security, and amplify wealth creation opportunities for historically underserved communities. Solutions to help small businesses scale: STRIVE COMMUNITY will launch a $1 million Innovation Fund to build, test, or enhance solutions that support small business growth. GRAB, Southeast Asia’s leading super-app, announced a regional partnership with Mastercard’s Center for Inclusive Growth, to provide millions of informal workers and small businesses on the Grab platform access to digital upskilling opportunities to create more pathways and income opportunities for them. Initiatives to better equip the workforce of tomorrow: Mastercard and Microsoft will link workers to training providers and employers; unlocking access to capital for small businesses; reducing bias in the financial services industry by identifying and mitigating bias in data and algorithms used by financial services providers. AARP, in partnership with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the World Economic Forum, will identify and share multigenerational, inclusive workforce practices among international member companies to enable expansion of those practices in diverse industries. Acumen, with initial support of the Target Foundation, will develop an accelerator for a cohort of early-stage companies focused on promoting green jobs and circular models that aim to drive sustainable and equitable economic growth in India and provide seed capital to select early-stage companies on their path to scale. Bolstering access to capital: Beyond The Billion will secure pledges from venture funds and limited partner investors as part of their goal to unlock $10 billion in venture capital to be invested in a diverse group of women founders. In addition, Senator Chris Coons called for the creation of a new Presidential Financial Inclusion Commission at the Department of the Treasury tasked with creating a national, interagency financial inclusion strategy. The Commission would build on the Biden Administration’s work to create a more equitable economy. In addition to working across federal agencies, the Commission will bring in a diverse set of leaders with relevant experience in the nonprofit and private sectors to produce a federal strategy for improving the financial well-being of American households. And finally, CARE and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth announced progress on a commitment made at the 2019 Global Inclusive Growth Summit. In 2019, a new partnership was announced that included a $5.26 million grant to support 3.9 million small businesses in Pakistan, Peru and Vietnam, where large segments of unserved small businesses are ready for investment. Today, CARE USA will announce that the program has so far reached over 1 million entrepreneurs and their communities across the three countries. “As the global economy begins to recover, the necessity of creating inclusive and sustainable growth has never been greater,” said Mike Froman, vice chairman of Mastercard. “Today’s Global Inclusive Growth Summit shines a spotlight on the kind of partnerships, digital technology and bold commitments that are needed to substantively move the needle towards a more equitable society. In order to tackle the scale of global challenges we face, we cannot go it alone. We will need partners across public, private and civic sectors to come together, expand pathways to the middle class and help people and small businesses thrive and grow.” “When we launched the Global Inclusive Growth Partnership in 2019, economic inequity was already an immediate challenge. Few could have predicted just how fundamental the work of inclusive growth would become, however, over the past 18 months. As the global economy recovers from a devastating pandemic, we must act with renewed urgency to build a more equitable society,” said Dan Porterfield, President and CEO of the Aspen Institute. “The commitments announced at the summit today, within this framework, have the potential to transform the lives of people, families, and communities around the world. Each sector—including business, governments, and nonprofits—has an opportunity and a responsibility to put these solutions into practice.” Quotes from Global Inclusive Growth Summit Commitment Partners ""As people live, learn, and earn longer, AARP is committed to working with businesses to help them reap the benefits of a multigenerational workforce where people can continue to work for as long as they need or want to,"" said AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins. “Research shows that age-diverse workforces have a positive effect on employee engagement, productivity and the bottom line. It is heartening to see that business leaders around the world recognize this value, even as we’ve been concerned the pandemic could fuel ageism.” “The effects of the climate crisis – resource depletion, urbanization, and pollution – are exacerbating problems for the informal, migrant workforce in India. We know there are social entrepreneurs building companies that can address the needs of India’s informal workforce and mitigate the irrevocable impacts of climate change. In the spirit of collaboration and putting people and the planet first, we hope to leverage our collective resources through this program and create greener and more equitable growth in India in partnership with others who share these goals,” shares Yasmina Zaidman, Chief Partnerships Officer at Acumen. ""Investing in women is just good business. We've learned from our journey that to truly fuel women-led innovation, we need to address the entire supply chain of capital, and this is why we're excited to work with limited partner investors - from some of the largest pensions, endowments, foundations to families to diversify and advance the global venture ecosystem,"" Shelly Porges and Sarah Chen, Co-Founders, Beyond The Billion. “Access to safe, affordable housing is key to building wealth but out of reach for far too many families,” said Heather Higginbottom, President, JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter and Co-Head of Global Philanthropy. “Today’s announcement will help promote immediate housing stability for underserved households and is one step toward our goal of addressing barriers to affordable housing and homeownership, especially for Black, Latino and Hispanic families.” “MoCaFi is committed to the movement for economic justice. We are proud to partner with companies and organizations that assist us in creating sustainable financial pathways for marginalized communities, and our program in Birmingham matches our initiatives with the visionary leadership of Mayor Woodfin. This program will serve as a model for the country and how technology can bring productive financial solutions to the most vulnerable residents and neighborhoods. MoCaFi is honored that the Clinton Global Initiative and the Aspen Institute have recognized this collaboration and our dedication to providing economic mobility to all Americans,” said Wole Coaxum, Founder and CEO, MoCaFi “Mobility Capital Finance, Inc.” “Prudential is committed to closing the financial divide as an urgent moral and business imperative,” said Lata Reddy, senior vice president of Inclusive Solutions at Prudential Financial and chair of The Prudential Foundation. “For the past 11 years, the Aspen Institute has been a key partner to us in driving innovation, narrative change, and policies that bring financial stability to historically underserved communities. Through Equity Re-imagined, our new $11 million partnership with Aspen, together we will reimagine the future of work, wealth and capitalism.” Launched in October 2019 with an inaugural summit, the Global Inclusive Growth Partnership (GIGP) combines the expertise and networks of both the Aspen Institute and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth to address systemic issues across a range of topics including financial security, the future of workers and portable benefits, growing micro and small businesses, and commercially sustainable social impact. CGI provided assistance to select summit participants in developing the programs announced today. Over the years, CGI and its successors have brought together leaders from across sectors to improve the lives of more than 430 million people in 180 countries worldwide.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard and Previse today announced the integration of Mastercard Cross-Border Services – a global push payments platform that enables funds to be sent seamlessly, securely and with certainty to any account – into Previse’s InstantPay platform. The collaboration will enable instant payments to suppliers in over 100 markets globally. In today’s environment, cash flow is critical – particularly for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Over one third of SMBs in North America report facing cash flow issues due to late payments and slow processing times for cash and checks1. Globally, many businesses also lack streamlined ways to receive payments in their local currency when dealing with customers in multiple markets. This forces them to borrow money at expensive rates to support cash flow, while they wait for payment on outstanding invoices. Using the latest advances in machine learning, Previse’s InstantPay solution analyzes invoices to identify those that are likely to be rejected, enabling the rest to be paid the same day they’re received. With the integration of Mastercard’s Cross-Border Services, companies using InstantPay can now send digital payments seamlessly and securely to suppliers in over 100 counties via bank accounts and digital wallets. In addition to paying suppliers quickly, business can reduce the cost of transactions and access real-time exchange rates for local currency, while reducing the need for additional documents and manual processes. “Delayed payments have always been a challenge for businesses and the pandemic only exacerbated this pain point,” said Ron Shultz, executive vice president, New Payments Flows, North America at Mastercard. “With Mastercard Cross-Border Services, businesses can expect to receive funds quickly, directly and securely. Digital B2B payment innovations like the ones being driven by Mastercard and Previse are helping suppliers gain faster access to funds and freedom from inefficient processes, so they can not only recover today - but thrive tomorrow.” “Flexible, robust supply chains and steadfast cash flow are essential for businesses to thrive and grow, particularly SMBs,” comments Paul Christensen, CEO and Co-Founder of Previse. “The integration of Mastercard Cross-Border Services enables every corporate using InstantPay to effortlessly pay suppliers across the world on day one. It's an innovative solution from Mastercard and Previse, which strengthens global supply chains and is a true win-win for large corporates and SMBs alike as we recover from the pandemic.” Previse joins a growing list of global partners working with Mastercard to offer people and businesses a more predictable and more certain way to pay and get paid across borders. Mastercard Cross-Border Services connects 90 percent of the world’s population via bank accounts, digital wallets, cards and cash agents, all through a single and secure point of access.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard today announced a new supply chain finance capability within Track Business Payment Service (Track BPS) – designed to increase access to working capital while lowering costs, reducing complexity and risk, and accelerating automation when businesses pay and get paid. Launched in partnership with Demica, a leading global provider of supply chain finance technology, this new offering empowers Mastercard partners to provide their business customers with access to affordable working capital. Mastercard Track, an open-loop network, can now connect providers of B2B payments and their respective buyer and supplier customers to working capital. A lack of scalable solutions in the market has put supply chain financing out of reach for many businesses. As a result, only the largest suppliers can access working capital solutions, while trillions of dollars are tied up in accounts receivable each year. Mastercard’s solution unlocks a network for working capital - covering small businesses and global corporations alike, driving speed to market, and offering ease of integration for payment partners.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard extends its commitment to inclusivity by introducing a new accessible card standard for blind and partially sighted people, called the Touch Card. There are few effective ways for the visually impaired to quickly determine whether they're holding a credit, debit or prepaid card, particularly as more cards move to flat designs without embossed name and numbers. Mastercard is addressing this challenge with a simple yet effective innovation. “The Touch Card will provide a greater sense of security, inclusivity and independence to the 2.2 billion people around the world with visual impairments,“ says Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing and communications officer. “For the visually impaired, identifying their payment cards is a real struggle. This tactile solution allows consumers to correctly orient the card and know which payment card they are using.” With the new Touch Card, Mastercard has improved upon a current design standard by introducing a system of notches on the side of the card to help consumers use the right card, the right way, by touch alone. The new Touch Card credit cards have a round notch; debit cards have a broad squarish notch; and prepaid cards have a triangular notch. The standard has been designed to work with point-of-sale terminals and ATMs, ensuring it can be deployed at scale. Mastercard’s concept has been vetted and endorsed by The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in the U.K. and VISIONS/Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired in the U.S. The card was co-designed by IDEMIA, the global leader in Augmented Identity, providing trusted solutions in the physical as well as digital space. “As the banking industry responds to new trends and developments, it’s critical that any innovation brings progress for everyone, including those with a visual impairment,” says David Clarke, RNIB’s director of services. “We’re very pleased that Mastercard understands how important it is that blind and partially sighted people have equal and independent access to their own finances.“ “Innovation should always be driven by the impulse to include,” adds Rajamannar, who is also the company’s Healthcare president. “With one in seven people experiencing some form of disability, designing these products with accessibility in mind gives them equal opportunity to benefit from the ease and security of a digital world. No one should be left behind.” Mastercard has been embedding its signature melody at checkout counters worldwide, a signal to everyone – the sight impaired in particular – that their card transaction has gone through successfully. Mastercard’s launch of the Touch Card underscores its commitment to inclusivity. It follows the introduction of True Name™, designed in support of the transgender and non-binary communities. The company’s commitment as a brand is to not only stand against inequity but to be an agent for change.

PURCHASE, NY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As world leaders come together for the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), Mastercard unveiled an acceleration of its net zero timeline by a decade, from 2050 to 2040. It is also scaling its sustainable solutions to customers across Europe and Latin America, including Banco de Costa Rica, ekko, Gránit Bank, and Sberbank, which have all signed on to adopt the Mastercard Carbon Calculator. As part of its net zero strategy, Mastercard had already committed to meet its existing science-based targets (SBTi) for greenhouse gas reduction, which are aligned to the United Nations Business Ambition for a 1.5°C future. The company transitioned to 100% renewable energy in 2018 for its operations, and its emission reduction strategy primarily centers on further decarbonization across its value chain, including Scopes 1, 2 & 3 emissions. Mastercard has received an “A” rating for Supplier Engagement since 2018 from CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) and joined the 1.5°C Supply Chain Leaders Initiative, supporting large and small suppliers with concrete resources and tools for measuring their emissions and developing climate strategies through the SME Climate Hub. Supported by its new global Sustainability Innovation Lab, the company aims to encourage tangible action by people who use its 2.9 billion cards across the globe. This includes helping banks offer their consumers digital tools, such as the Mastercard Carbon Calculator, that encourage climate-conscious choices, and cards made from more sustainable materials. “Tackling the global climate crisis will take all of us – and major businesses have a vital role to play. At Mastercard, we continue to raise the bar for ourselves, accelerating our commitment to reach net zero emissions,” said Michael Miebach, chief executive officer, Mastercard. “We will also use our technology and global network to inspire collective action that fosters a more sustainable digital economy.” Enabling sustainable consumer choice According to a recent Mastercard survey, 85% of respondents globally said they’re willing to take personal action to combat environmental and sustainability challenges in 2021. New research from Mastercard also shows our society is now at an inflection point in both the supply and demand for sustainable options. Mastercard is helping inform consumers about the environmental impact of their spending through the Mastercard Carbon Calculator, created in collaboration with Swedish fintech Doconomy. Embedded across Mastercard’s global network earlier this year, the Carbon Calculator will now be adopted by leading banking partners – both traditional financial institutions and emerging fintechs – in markets around the world, including Banco de Costa Rica, ekko, Gránit Bank, and Sberbank. Together with Mastercard, each partner will co-create and define its customer experience, such as enhancing it with relatable and easy-to-understand equivalents (such as the number of trees required to compensate for the same amount of CO2), integrating donation functionality to support reforestation projects, and providing tips about sustainable living. Mastercard’s sustainable cards program shows strong momentum: 148 financial institutions in 46 countries have now issued cards made with more sustainable materials, including HSBC and Banco Santander, as we look to reduce the use of first-use PVC plastic in card manufacturing. The company also recently unveiled a first-of-its kind badge to identify these cards made more sustainably from recyclable, recycled, bio-sourced, chlorine-free or ocean plastics. Through the Priceless Planet Coalition, Mastercard and its partner network also continue to offer easy ways for consumers to contribute to forest restoration. Uniting more than 80 businesses globally in the restoration of 100 million trees, the Coalition now has multiple consumer engagement campaigns running across markets to generate donations to the environment. The Coalition’s restoration partners, Conservation International and World Resources Institute, have also broken ground in key project locations. To help accelerate progress toward Mastercard’s sustainability goals, the company made changes to its executive compensation model, linking it to three global ESG priorities including operational carbon neutrality. Mastercard also showed progress in 2020 against its existing 1.5°C SBTi-approved targets, including a Scope 1 & 2 reduction of 44% and Scope 3 reduction of 57% against a 2016 baseline, and was recently awarded for Supply Chain Leadership from the Climate Leadership Conference. Quote sheet Todd Stern, Former Special Envoy for Climate Change, the US’s chief negotiator for the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, and Priceless Planet Coalition Advisor: “COP26 is an enormously important event as world leaders come together, but the action that follows is even more crucial. Businesses can play an important role by stepping up their own pledges and delivering on the demand from consumers for more green products and solutions. We need bold commitments and even bolder actions. The work Mastercard and its partners are doing through the Priceless Planet Coalition and with the Carbon Calculator will empower more consumers to contribute to tackling climate change.” Banco de Costa Rica, Guillermo Gayle Monge, Head of Payments: “Costa Rica is a world icon as a green country and Banco de Costa Rica as a state bank is fully committed to environmental sustainability, we are proud to boost projects in favor of the environment. We thank Mastercard for inviting us to be part of the launch of the Carbon Calculator in LAC and give a hand to our planet, mitigating all of us our carbon footprint.” Doconomy, Mathias Wikström, co-founder and CEO: “Doconomy is proud to work with Mastercard, contributing through the Åland Index methodology for the Carbon Calculator and the set-up of the Sustainability Innovation Lab. This is a strong foundation to enable everyone to contribute to much needed climate action. Mastercard continues to lead the way for their industry.” ekko, Oli Cook, co-founder and CEO: “As the world’s leaders come together at COP26 to advocate collaborative action, so starts our own journey. We are excited to introduce ekko to the world and offer people a greener way to pay. From collecting ocean bound plastic to global reforestation, together with Mastercard we will help our customers live more sustainably and become more aware of the carbon footprint of what they consume by doing nothing other than using their ekko card.” GRÁNIT Bank, Eva Hegedüs, chairperson and CEO: ”Businesses need to use their resources to drive meaningful change for the planet. At GRÁNIT Bank we support every sustainability effort wholeheartedly. From the very beginning, it has been our mission to inspire the customers’ minds and hearts towards sustainability and to make the planet-friendly living possible. For this work, GRÁNIT Bank has received several accolades, (e.g. Green Financial Innovator Prize awarded by the National Bank of Hungary), but the greatest prize of all is our planet that we can save for future generations. To this end, the Bank will shortly launch a new innovative function in its mobile banking application: the carbon calculator will enable users to measure and reduce their carbon footprint. It is a great honor to us that we have had the opportunity to work together with Mastercard on this and on many other innovative projects.” Sberbank, Evgenia Tyurikova, Head of Sber Private Banking: “In partnership with Mastercard, we work on the launch of the Carbon Calculator. We want our business to drive meaningful change around the world. The Mastercard Carbon Calculator will help draw people's attention to environmental issues and increase their level of engagement by providing them with tools to assess their impact on the environment and the ability to neutralize this impact.” About Mastercard (NYSE: MA) Mastercard is a global technology company in the payments industry.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As the Official Payment Services Provider of New York Road Runners, Mastercard today announced the launch of the “50 Years and Running” campaign in support of the TCS New York City Marathon. In partnership with documentary filmmaker and small business champion Nick Heller, otherwise known as @newyorknico, Mastercard is celebrating the businesses that have powered New York City over the past 50 years. Mastercard continues to leverage the full scope of its business, technology and network of partners and cardholders to help guide and elevate the visibility of small businesses in New York City and around the world. Through Heller’s authentic New York City voice, the “50 Years and Running” campaign features three iconic small businesses near the marathon route that have overcome obstacles in the face of adversity and provide priceless impact on their communities. They include: Grandma’s Place: Dawn Harris-Martin, lovingly referred to as “Grandma Dawn,” opened her iconic children’s toy and bookstore in 1999 to empower children through literacy. Like the Harlem community, Grandma’s Place caters to people of all ethnicities and backgrounds by centering the shop around games and books that benefit, support, educate, and reach children through fun, open-ended learning experiences. Davey’s Ice Cream: Originally conceptualized as a creative outlet for designer and New York native David Yoo, Davey’s Ice Cream opened in Brooklyn with a focus on quality ingredients sourced from local retailers. Yoo continues to build and diversify his flavors to accommodate the multi-national audience that New York City is known for while still staying true to the homemade origins of his recipes. Bronx Native: Owner Amaurys Grullon provides a cultural hub for creators, artists, and entrepreneurs to showcase Bronx talent with Bronx Native. Launched in 2016, every piece of merchandise – shirts, hats, or gear – serves as a tool to share issues of poverty and untreated illnesses in the surrounding neighborhoods, with a commitment to changing people’s perception of the Bronx. “The issues facing small businesses have changed radically in the 50 years since the TCS New York City Marathon began, and the impacts of the pandemic have only amplified and evolved these challenges,” said Heller. “Running a business takes the same dedication, hard work and grit it takes to run a marathon. We’re proud to pay tribute to the small business owners – from Brooklyn to the Bronx – who exemplify what makes this city one of the greatest in the world.” To further support the small businesses featured in the campaign, Mastercard will provide each with a Digital Doors™ toolkit comprised of exclusive offerings and resources to help maximize their digital presence, protect their online operations, and succeed in the new normal. These efforts build on Mastercard’s sustained emphasis on financial inclusion, including the company’s pledge to bring 50 million micro and small businesses into the digital economy by 2025. “The ’50 Years and Running’ Priceless campaign reflects Mastercard’s ongoing commitment to supporting and elevating the small businesses that serve as the backbone of our communities,” said Cheryl Guerin, executive vice president, North America Marketing and Communications at Mastercard. “We’re thrilled to be celebrating and showcasing the extraordinary small businesses that keep New York City running and provide them with the digital tools and resources they deserve to thrive."" Running Towards Innovation At the TCS New York City Marathon Expo at the Jacob K. Javits Center, which will see approximately 30,000 runners during the week leading up to the race, Mastercard will provide marathon participants and attendees with the opportunity to support small businesses through a one-of-a-kind activation. At Hall 3B, booth 202, Mastercard will unveil an expo venue where consumers can experience Tap on Phone, Mastercard’s innovative technology that turns an Android smartphone or tablet into an acceptance device. Tap on Phone is powered by Mastercard Foundry’s Cloud Point of Sale (POS) technology and leverages Verizon 5G, enabling small- and-medium-sized businesses to handle transactions in a fast and secure manner. Additionally, with every purchase of a $0.50 Mastercard tote, consumers will be entered for a chance to win one bib for the 2022 NYC Marathon and an array of prizes to support the New York City small businesses featured in the “50 Years and Running” campaign, including1: 10 ice cream socials at Davey’s Ice Cream, valued at $500 each 20 $500 shopping sprees at Grandma’s Place, in-store or online 20 $500 shopping sprees at Bronx Native, in-store or online “We are excited to have Mastercard as our Official Payment Services Provider for the first time at the TCS New York City Marathon,” said Christine Burke, senior vice president, Strategic Partnerships and Runner Products at New York Road Runners. “Marathon runners will have the opportunity to explore a variety of innovative payment solutions and experiences all while celebrating the small businesses that have powered New York City over the last 50 years.” The TCS New York City Marathon will take place on November 7. Mastercard will sponsor the Side Street Cheer Zone, located at 4th Avenue & Flatbush at mile eight, the Start Village hospitality space and the TCS New York City Marathon Pavilion.

MADRID--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard announced today the establishment of a new Tourism Innovation Hub in Spain, with the support of the Spanish Government. The Hub, based in Madrid and which will open in the second quarter of 2022, will develop solutions to support a sustainable and inclusive recovery for the global tourism sector through innovation, research and collaboration across the ecosystem. The initiative was ratified today, at the FITUR International Tourism Fair, between Reyes Maroto, Spain’s Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism, and Mark Barnett, President of Mastercard Europe. In 2019, travel and tourism represented 10.4% of global GDP but nearly halved to 5.5% in 2020 - similarly international visitors spent US$1,691.5 billion in 2019 and the amount dropped to US$517.6 billion in 20201. And according to its latest forecast, the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) estimates that international tourist arrivals remained 70 to 75 percent below 2019 levels last year2. The impact also goes beyond GDP figures, with the industry playing a vital role in generating jobs and creating opportunities for micro and small businesses around the world. But despite the clear challenges, Mastercard data shows that there are opportunities for a robust recovery in the relatively near future. Many consumers are looking at how to spend their share of the extra US$5 trillion saved since the onset of COVID-193, and travel ranks second only to eating out as the out-of-home activity most missed during lockdowns4. There has been a clear willingness to travel that has been determined by pandemic-related restrictions. “There has been a multi-trillion dollar impact on the global tourism industry over the past couple of years, but Mastercard is committed to enabling innovation and ensuring that technology is harnessed for a more inclusive, equitable and sustainable recovery,” said Mark Barnett, President of Mastercard Europe. “The Tourism Innovation Hub will foster programs and build partnerships which will help the industry recover and drive more inclusive and sustainable tourism growth. Being located in Spain will allow us to leverage the expertise of a country intrinsically linked to tourism and the second most visited destination in the world."" According to the Spanish Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism, Reyes Maroto: ""The Spanish Government believes that now is the time for us to work together to build the future of our post-pandemic tourism model. We are going to stop measuring the success of the Spanish tourism model exclusively by the increase in the number of tourists - we must now go beyond this and focus on quality, profitability, innovation and sustainability, as well as social inclusion and territorial cohesion. There is no time to lose in taking up this challenge. And we all need to work together - the institutions and the private sector - strengthening our alliances and bringing other partners on board so that the Spanish tourism sector maintains its international leadership."" UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili added: “Tourism’s future will be driven by new ideas, new business methods and through joined-up solutions to overcome challenges and fulfil our sector’s enormous potential. UNWTO warmly welcomed the creation of a new Tourism Innovation Hub and looks forward to working closely with Mastercard to harness the power of data and creativity to build a more inclusive and sustainable sector.” The Tourism Innovation Hub will act as a global platform for industry research, tourism strategy development and the co-creation of tailored products and solutions, through partnerships and initiatives such as: Thought Leadership: leveraging data insights and capturing target consumer insights to identify trends and inform policy decision-making. Development Center: co-creating new products and services, codifying best practices and serving as a platform to bring together public and private sector partners to innovate together. Labs As A Service: designing, developing and testing new products and platforms that deliver digital first, sustainable and inclusive solutions for the industry, which address common business and consumer priorities. Supporting the Global Tourism Industry Mastercard’s trusted network and leading technology stands at the heart of the global tourism industry: Facilitating payments so tourists can spend safely, securely and easily when they travel abroad Enabling digital payments acceptance for small businesses to allow them to benefit from the tourism economy Working with travel agents, airlines, hospitality providers and many others across the ecosystem Building loyalty through engagement programs and Priceless Experiences, giving tourists tailored access to the best and most exciting opportunities when they explore or return to preferred destinations Partnering with tourism agencies to supporting businesses in the tourism industry and encouraging inbound tourism through digital vouchers and incentive schemes Providing data insights to governments and tourism agencies to identify trends and inform strategies, including through the Mastercard Economics Institute Insights Reports, as well as executing inbound tourism campaigns. Sustainable tourism will be a key focus, and there will be close collaboration between the Tourism Innovation Hub and Mastercard’s Sustainability Innovation Lab, to help empower governments, businesses and consumers to transform how they adapt and create new sustainable tourism innovations in destination, travel, accommodation, experience, rewards and incentives and other services. Alongside this, Mastercard is working with the UNWTO, headquartered in Madrid, across a range of initiatives. For example, last year the company supported the UNWTO SDGs Global Startup Competition, providing mentorship to innovative small businesses that are enabling sustainable and responsible tourism around the world. In Spain, Mastercard has a well-established track record of supporting the tourism industry, as part of the broader work with governments and cities around the world adapt their tourism strategies. In 2020, Mastercard's data intelligence tools helped the City Councils of Madrid and Barcelona identify how the flow of tourists were being impacted, helping them draw a roadmap to recover post-pandemic tourism. Additionally, in May last year, together with Turespaña, Mastercard announced the first Security Perception Index, which measures the level of confidence shown by visitors in Spain’s health-measures. The Tourism Innovation Hub becomes part of Mastercard's network of global centers of excellence around the world, including the Intelligence and Cyber Centre in Canada, the Fintech-Cyber Innovation Lab in Israel, the Mastercard Lab for Financial Inclusion in Kenya, and the Sustainability Innovation Lab in Sweden, as well as Tech Hubs in Dublin and New York City.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard today announced the launch of Mastercard TrackTM Instant Pay, a next-generation virtual card solution that uses machine learning and straight-through processing to enable instant payment of supplier invoices. Integrated with Mastercard Track Business Payment Service, Mastercard’s open-loop B2B network, the new, first-of-its-kind virtual card solution delivers greater choice, efficiency and automation for buyers and suppliers to help streamline and speed business payments. Slow and inefficient payment processes continue to create challenges for businesses. Lengthy payment terms and late invoice payments impact cash flow for suppliers, while manual invoice approval and check processing is costly and time consuming for buyers. Other payment methods, like ACH, require buyers to safeguard sensitive bank account information, adding another layer of complexity. Research shows a growing demand from businesses to automate supplier payments with virtual cards, but existing solutions aren’t meeting these needs, with 90% of virtual card transactions still being processed manually1. Mastercard Track Instant Pay is the first virtual card solution that can safely and intelligently authorize an immediate payment to a supplier once they submit an invoice. The solution uses sophisticated machine learning to analyze invoices and identify those likely to be rejected, enabling the rest to be authorized for payment on the same day they’re received. Using straight-through processing, digital payments are sent directly and securely to a supplier’s bank account via a Mastercard virtual card, with no manual intervention required. “Delayed payments create significant challenges for businesses financially and operationally, especially in today’s environment,” said Ron Shultz, executive vice president, New Payment Flows, North America at Mastercard. “Track Instant Pay helps solve these pain points by enabling buyers and suppliers to automate their manual payment processes, unlocking valuable time, working capital and choice. This innovative new solution is the latest step in our ongoing commitment to support multiple payment rails and mission to modernize B2B payments.” Mastercard Track Instant Pay combines machine learning capabilities from Previse, an artificial intelligence and data science company, with Mastercard’s core commercial solutions and global payment network to transform how businesses send and receive payments. The solution is part of Mastercard’s comprehensive suite of B2B products and services designed to reduce complexity and risk, cut costs, and automate processes for businesses around the world. Key benefits of Mastercard Track Instant Pay include: Suppliers: By accelerating payments, Mastercard Track Instant Pay helps suppliers improve cash flow and unlock working capital so they can reinvest in their business. Instant payments eliminate costs associated with chasing collections on outstanding invoices, and rich remittance information is provided with each payment, simplifying reconciliation. Buyers: With Mastercard Track Instant Pay, buyers can grow revenue by increasing acceptance and converting costly check and ACH payments to rebate-generating virtual cards. Automating manual processes helps lower costs, accelerate payments, and remove friction to improve business relationships. Buyers can manage their working capital more efficiently using the credit line tied to their commercial card account; while unique, dynamically generated virtual account numbers with layers of controls provide enhanced security for supplier payments. Issuers: Mastercard Track Instant Pay can help issuers grow and extend the reach of their virtual card programs to meet increasing demand and gain a competitive advantage. Mastercard Track Instant Pay is available in the United States with plans for international expansion, as Mastercard continues to onboard partners as part of its mission to modernize business payments.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--2022 kicked off with gains across nearly all retail sectors, according to Mastercard SpendingPulseTM, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment. This January, U.S. retail sales excluding auto increased 7.2% year-over-year (YOY), with online sales growing 10.4% compared to January 2021. Despite the shadow of Omicron and elevated inflation, consumer spending was buoyed by pent-up savings, wage growth and the continued re-opening of the “experience economy.” Beneficiaries included Department Stores, Apparel and Luxury, which all saw double-digit growth. Key retail trends were a continuation from the strong holiday season, including: The shift back to services: The pandemic arrested a decades-long trend of more spending on services vs goods. Since the middle of last year, this tide has begun to shift back to services – or experiences – as consumers resume in-person activities. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, Restaurant sales grew 36.7% YOY and 16.6% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Digital demand: E-commerce sales growth shows no signs of stopping, with double-digit increases in January even compared to the strong base in 2021. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, e-commerce sales were up 110.1%, underscoring the sustained and significant nature of the shift to digital. New year, new looks: Apparel sales were up 37.6% in January YOY, the strongest growth rate for January in SpendingPulse history. The Apparel sector has experienced positive growth for 11 consecutive months as consumers refresh wardrobes and dress to impress for gatherings and events taking place in 2022. Department Stores have similarly gained from resurgent spending, with January sales up 10.5% YOY and 9.8% vs. pre-pandemic levels. Luxe for loved ones: Luxury (+45.3% YOY) and Jewelry (+19.8% YOY) sales continued to outperform in January ahead of Valentine’s Day. “Coming on the heels of the holidays, January typically marks a month of returns and exchanges. However, the strong growth across sectors reflects the optimism and eagerness for the year ahead,” said Steve Sadove, senior advisor for Mastercard and former CEO and Chairman of Saks Incorporated. “With nearly all sectors up, we see consumers returning to their shopping habits with a continued emphasis on digital.” *Excluding automotive sales About Mastercard SpendingPulse: Mastercard SpendingPulse reports on national retail sales across all payment types in select markets around the world. The findings are based on aggregate sales activity in the Mastercard payments network, coupled with survey-based estimates for certain other payment forms, such as cash and check. Mastercard SpendingPulse defines “U.S. retail sales” as sales at retailers and food services merchants of all sizes. Sales activity within the services sector (for example, travel services such as airlines and lodging) are not included.

MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ACI Worldwide (NASDAQ: ACIW), the global leader in mission-critical, real-time payments software, and Mastercard, a leading global technology company in the payments industry, today announced that Peru’s Cámara de Compensación Electrónica (CCE), has won the Celent Model Bank 2022 Award for Payments Infrastructure. The awards recognize financial institutions for best practices in technology usage across various areas critical to success in banking. ACI and Mastercard’s strategic partnership provides real-time payment solutions globally. CCE chose ACI and Mastercard’s joint solution to drive its real-time payments modernization initiative. Created by Peru’s banks, CCE is the central entity that provides clearing services in the Peruvian financial system, facilitating interbank payments and checks. CCE sits at the heart of the Peruvian payments system, connecting more than 30 financial institutions. The modernization project included upgrading the existing CCE system to support the clearing and settlement of electronic payment methods, implementing Mastercard and ACI’s innovative solution for processing credit transfers in real-time, and enabling users to send and receive payments using a phone number without the need to supply recipient bank details. The transformation will significantly reduce the country’s reliance on cash and create a more digital economy while also driving greater efficiency, enhancing availability and security for its users and enabling innovation between payment systems. According to Celent, “CCE, the partnership’s first customer, selected the joint solution for a few reasons. First, both ACI and Mastercard have extensive global experience in real-time payments, having been involved in creating 18 real-time schemes around the world. CCE wanted to tap into that technology and implementation expertise to ensure that the system would align with the best, globally. CCE believed it would get best-in-class solutions for every element of a central infrastructure, including software, scheme rules, digital overlay services, testing, participant connectivity and onboarding. This end-to-end approach would ensure speed to market, as well as the agility to evolve over time.” “We congratulate CCE on this very well-deserved industry recognition and take immense pride in helping modernize Peru’s real-time payments infrastructure,” said Sam Jawad, head of bank and FI segment, ACI Worldwide. “Through our partnership with Mastercard, we are jointly delivering central banks, scheme operators, financial institutions and payment service providers a powerful platform for innovation.” “CCE’s win is a testament to how its payments modernization will boost Peru’s economy and foster greater financial inclusion for its 23 million unbanked citizens,” said George Evers, senior vice president, Real-Time Products, Mastercard. “We’re incredibly proud to have played a critical role in developing this technology. Our experience, expertise and close partnership with ACI Worldwide is enabling innovation across the globe—supporting economies, empowering businesses and improving the lives of people everywhere.” CCE’s real-time payments scheme, Immediate Interbank Transfers (IIT), launched in 2016 and has experienced significant growth, especially since the start of the pandemic. CCE recognized the need to improve its offering amid tremendous volume increases, while advancing its commitment to achieving greater financial inclusion across Peru. “Launching a new nationwide payment system is no simple task. Replacing one that is already growing rapidly, while simultaneously insulating banks from major changes and providing leading-edge possibilities—during a pandemic—is a remarkable achievement. Peru now finds itself with one of the most flexible systems in the region, if not the world, and well prepared for the future,” Celent added. Celent’s annual Model Bank Awards recognize financial institutions as “model banks” for their outstanding technology initiatives. To win, the initiatives must demonstrate clear business benefits, innovation, and technology or implementation excellence.

According to Mastercard SpendingPulse™, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment, total retail sales excluding auto in April increased +7.2% year-over-year (YOY) and +15.3% compared to pre-pandemic spending (2019), not adjusted for inflation. This is similar to the YOY monthly growth experienced thus far in 2022. Key trends for April reinforce consumer resilience in the face of inflation and highlight seasonal spending across sectors and channels. Of note: Springing into stores: In-store sales were up +10.0%, while e-commerce sales are down -1.8% compared to last year, reflecting consumer demand to get out. However, online sales remain elevated (+92.0%) vs pre-pandemic April 2019. California, New York, Florida, Nevada and Illinois were among the states leading the charge back to brick-and-mortar. Warm weather wardrobe: Consumers refreshing their wardrobes for potential summer travel and the warmer months ahead contributed to continued growth for Apparel (+10.8% YOY / +8.4% pre-pandemic) and Department Stores (+15.7% YOY / +22.3% pre-pandemic), though rates have started to soften from the peaks earlier this year. Nesting season: Furniture and Furnishing sales, which saw the seventh consecutive month of positive growth, were up +3.8% YOY and +25.7% compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. While the super-hot housing market is starting to show signs of cooling, consumers continue investing in their homes and feathering their nests for seasons to come. “Whether for a family barbeque, returning to the office or senior prom, it seems like everyone is out shopping for something,” said Steve Sadove, senior advisor for Mastercard and former CEO and Chairman of Saks Incorporated. “Mastercard SpendingPulse shows spending across sectors in April.” *Excluding automotive sales.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard has welcomed a raft of new global partners to its innovative Mastercard Installments program and is expanding it further to support small businesses in the U.S. Illustrating the demand for powerful buy now, pay later (BNPL) experiences from familiar and trusted brands, several new partners are providing support for the program, including HSBC, J.P.Morgan and NatWest in the U.K.; Cross River Bank, Evolve Bank & Trust, Jifiti, Live Oak Bank, MOCA Financial and WebBank in the U.S.; and Saudi National Bank (SNB) in Saudi Arabia. The program taps the power and scale of the Mastercard network, which connects to more than 90 million merchants globally, to instantly support secure BNPL payments at checkout, both in-store and online. In addition to delivering more payment choice, Mastercard Installments is built on responsible lending practices and supports shoppers with an enhanced set of consumer protections, data transparency and insight-driven programs. Through technology, data and insights, and its consulting expertise, Mastercard is creating a more intelligent way to provide installment lending at scale. “We believe no matter how you pay, a foundation of strong protections must be in place,” said Craig Vosburg, Chief Product Officer at Mastercard. “Trust is the currency of innovation. Using a Responsible-by-Design approach ensures that we stay ahead of consumer, merchant and bank needs and expectations, continuously building confidence in the payments ecosystem by providing choice at scale.” A Responsible, Intelligent Way to Offer Installment Lending According to new global consumer research from Mastercard's World Payments Advisory™, nearly a quarter of respondents across 50+ markets have used a BNPL product in the past six months.[i] For BNPL users, “forgetting the payment was due” was the leading reason for missing an installment payment, while concerns about “hidden charges” were cited as a leading barrier to consumer adoption overall. Mastercard Installments addresses these concerns with a suite of unique, innovative services that increases transparency and helps protect consumers and businesses. These services include: Cutting-edge insights and analytics: Merchants and lenders are able to access a comprehensive set of data dashboards to better understand how their products are performing. Mastercard Test & Learn® technology can also pinpoint where to prioritize efforts and resources that enhance the user experience and drive successful loan repayment. Mitigating repayment risk with open banking and AI: In the U.S., using consumer-permissioned data and open banking technology, lenders can identify behavioral patterns to reduce the risk of failed payments while artificial intelligence can adjust models more quickly and accurately for success. Dedicated and embedded consumer protections: To participate in the Mastercard Installments program, lenders agree to follow applicable laws and network guidelines on responsible lending practices and data usage practices, among others. Consumers and U.S. small businesses enjoy the peace of mind that they get today from any other Mastercard product – including tokenization, dispute resolution, and zero fraud liability. Empowering U.S. Small Businesses Mastercard research shows that over 70% of small business owners who have used personal installments are likely to adopt business installments products if they become available.[ii] Meeting this demand in the U.S., Live Oak Bank, the nation’s leading small business lender, will support the program, with the goal to make Mastercard Installments available to its 7,000 small business customers.iii This builds on Mastercard’s ongoing commitment to Main Street America, delivering products and services that help improve operational efficiency, manage cash flow and maximize customer connections with financial tools. Learn more about Mastercard Installments and its range of benefits for consumers, merchants and acquiring banks, lenders, as well as wallets and BNPL players. Madhu Kejriwal, Group Head, Unsecured Lending & Partnerships, HSBC Wealth & Personal Banking, said, “Customer expectations have evolved as the payments landscape has advanced, so banks need to find appropriate solutions. Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) lies at the intersection of payments and lending; it can provide customers with a seamless payment option. However, it’s important to realize that it’s very much a form of credit. HSBC is fully committed to responsible lending, and providing transparency to customers is of utmost importance to us. We want to clearly position any BNPL payment plan as part of a customer’s approved credit line. Our partnership with Mastercard is a crucial element of HSBC UK’s responsible lending strategy, as it enables us to provide customers with access to trusted payment options when they want to budget for larger purchases with affordable payment plans.” Huntley Garriott, President of Live Oak Bank, said, “Live Oak knows small business customers need flexible financial products that provide security, transparency and scalability so they can grow their business at the pace that suits their needs. We are excited to partner with Mastercard to explore lending solutions through the Mastercard Installments program as it allows us to deliver innovative products from a trusted source while aligning with our mission to be America’s small business bank.” Martin Wise, Managing Director, Short-Term Borrowing at NatWest, said, “There’s a clear demand for buy now, pay later and we are determined to make it better and safer for our customers. By working closely with Mastercard, we are ensuring responsible measures such as clear affordability checks and useful tools, such as payment reminders to help customers budget, are at the heart of our solution.” Majed Hamdan Al Ghamdi, Chief Executive Officer of Retail Bank at the Saudi National Bank, said, “Flexible payment options benefit everyone in the ecosystem, and our partnership with Mastercard enables us to connect people in Saudi Arabia to the seamless benefits of Mastercard Installments. Through this initiative, we are providing consumers with enhanced ways to pay when and where they want and in line with their budget needs. Underpinned by the renowned security of the Mastercard network, Mastercard Installments opens up new shopping experiences to consumers across the Kingdom while offering them reassurance, confidence and peace of mind.” Sources: About Mastercard (NYSE: MA) Mastercard is a global technology company in the payments industry.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Please replace the photo with the accompanying corrected photo. The release reads: MASTERCARD SPENDINGPULSE: U.S. CONSUMERS CONTINUED TO SPEND IN JULY WHILE NAVIGATING HIGH INFLATION E-commerce growth sees a hot July amid promotional events, while home-focused spending cools According to Mastercard SpendingPulseTM, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment, U.S. retail spending excluding automotive increased +11.2% year-over-year in July, while retail sales excluding automotive and gas rose +9.0%. Notably, e-commerce sales were up 11.7% YOY, a sharp increase after months of softer growth. Rising prices—particularly for necessities such as food and fuel—were a contributing factor, as Mastercard SpendingPulse reflects nominal spending and is not adjusted for inflation. Spending increases in July outpaced monthly year-over-year growth experienced thus far in 2022, with demand and higher prices both contributing factors. Of note: Consumers continue to spend, with inflation’s impact varying across sectors: Consumers continue to navigate high inflation as they spend on wants and needs. The Grocery sector, for instance, saw sales up +16.8% YOY in July due primarily to food price increases. On the other hand, Apparel (+16.6%) and Jewelry (+18.6%) sales saw strong demand-driven year-over-year growth, well outpacing sector-specific inflation. E-commerce sales climb amid major promotional events: While in-store sales remain elevated, up +11.1% YOY/ +13.9% YO3Y, e-commerce posted its first month of double-digit sales growth (+11.7% YOY) since December. E-commerce is up nearly double pre-pandemic levels (+98.5% YO3Y). Online sales have ticked up since the beginning of June, though July’s major promotional events helped entice shoppers to splurge (and save) with online deals. High season for vacation, with road-trippers seeing some relief at the pump: Travel remains a priority, with Lodging up +29.6% YOY and Airline sales up+13.3% YOY. Fuel & Convenience spending remains elevated (+32.3% YOY / +47.1% YO3Y), though the growth rate is down compared to June – reflecting price declines at the pump. “The latest retail trends place an emphasis on consumer choice and passion driven spending – they’re hunting for deals, shopping across channels and ultimately still spending on experiences and goods that make them feel good,” said Steve Sadove, senior advisor for Mastercard and former CEO and Chairman of Saks Incorporated. “As retailers grapple with excess inventory and supply chain constraints, it’s likely that the promotional activity seen in July will continue to be an important strategy for retailers.” Mastercard Economics Institute: Housing market cooldown slows sales of home-related goods After heating up during the pandemic, the U.S. housing market has cooled considerably since the beginning of 2022, influencing consumer spending on home-related goods. Each time a home changes hands, there is usually a significant amount of spending as consumers outfit their new abode. But with significant interest rate hikes resulting in fewer homes sold, this has been translating to a natural decline in home-related purchases, as reflected in this month’s SpendingPulse. Sales growth for the Home Improvement (+2.9%) and Furniture & Furnishings sectors (+5.0%) has slowed. “Consumers’ purchasing power has been strained by higher prices, particularly for the most fundamental needs-based categories like food and energy,” said Michelle Meyer, U.S. chief economist, Mastercard Economics Institute. “Thus far, nominal spending remains strong as consumers cope with high price inflation. As we continue to look at the strength of the consumer, we will be keenly focused on trends surrounding employment and wage growth.” For additional insights about today’s housing trends and the economic impact across the country, see the Mastercard Economic Institute’s latest findings in A View on US Housing: Today and Tomorrow. About Mastercard SpendingPulse Mastercard SpendingPulse™ reports on national retail sales across all payment types in select markets around the world.

As such, SpendingPulse™ insights do not in any way contain, reflect or relate to actual Mastercard operational or financial performance, or specific payment-card-issuer data.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard announced today its collaboration with Marvel Studios’ “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”, in theaters November 11, to spotlight Black excellence and the irrepressible strength of Black women – both on and off the screen. With Priceless experiences, digital engagements and shoppable content that supports and celebrates the superpowers of Black business leaders, Mastercard is honoring the film’s inspiring message that the spirit of Wakanda is all around us. “Through representation and access to tools and resources, Mastercard is proud to honor the Black women-owned businesses that strive for success despite the systemic inequalities they face every day,” said Rustom Dastoor, EVP of Marketing and Communications, Mastercard North America. “When we see role models that look like us, which the film so impactfully demonstrates, it expands our sense of what’s possible, including a more diverse, inclusive economic future.” In a Wakanda-inspired commercial spot and supporting campaign, Egypt Otis, the owner of Comma Bookstore & Social Hub – a Flint, Michigan small business that specializes in Black and Brown literature, art and music – stars as a real-life superhero by being a role model to a young shopper. The girl realizes through her imagination and interaction with Egypt that superheroes are all around us, igniting excitement for the film, her ambition for the future, and the belief that she herself has that same potential. “To serve as the face of possibility for aspiring Black women and young girls makes me feel like a superhero of sorts – just for living my truth,” said Otis. “Mastercard’s Strivers Initiative has provided me the resources and platform to help my business thrive and further empower our community, which to me is truly priceless.” Mastercard’s support of the film is an extension of the company’s $500 million commitment to helping close the racial wealth and economic gap in the U.S. by supporting Black women-owned businesses through its Strivers Initiative, and partnerships with HBCUs and youth groups around the country, as well as Mastercard’s sustained efforts to build a more inclusive digital economy by providing the digital tools to help small businesses get online and thrive. In celebration of the film, select small business owners and youth groups will enjoy exclusive screenings in New York City and Atlanta ahead of the film’s release. Designed to create a multisensory experience, the screenings will feature film-inspired décor, photo opportunities, celebratory food and drink options, a Hall of Heroes video installation honoring attendees and other entrepreneurs, free branded swag and more.

The Mastercard Small Business Metaverse: in November 2022, Mastercard will launch an immersive virtual reality experience in Meta Horizon Worlds to connect consumers to a world where they can discover a variety of Black-owned small businesses and participate in activities designed to bring to life their unique stories and entrepreneurial journeys.

She Runs This: Celebrating Entrepreneurship in Business and Hip-Hop: Beginning Thursday, February 2 and running through Saturday, February 4, Black women owned small businesses in Los Angeles will host invited guests for dynamic discussions about entrepreneurship for women in business and hip-hop with music icons such as MC Lyte, Lil Kim, Salt-N-Pepa, and Yo-Yo as well as emerging artists such as Jozzy, Baby Tate, and Coi Leray; and a special appearance by Mastercard ambassador Jennifer Hudson. “Small Business City:” Mastercard’s virtual reality experience in Meta Horizon Worlds will spotlight Black women SBOs to inspire and educate a future generation, providing networking opportunities and tools for success. Mastercard Striver and co-creator of Small Business City RhondaX will discuss her thriving career as a creator in the Web3 space on The Jennifer Hudson Show. Mastercard Striver and co-creator of Small Business City RhondaX will discuss her thriving career as a creator in the Web3 space on The Jennifer Hudson Show. TikTok Challenge: A TikTok challenge, kicked off by Jennifer Hudson will invite SBOs to share what makes them a small business superstar with a “drop the mic” moment. SBOs will be able to stitch their responses and pass the mic to the next participant, with Mastercard’s sonic melody as the backing track. Small Business Marketplaces: Mastercard has collaborated with Amazon to promote Black women owned small businesses, setting the stage for the SBOs to share the origin stories of their brands on Amazon Live where they can connect directly with customers via an interactive live chat. Consumers can also discover a reimagined shoppable social experience of products from exclusively Black women-owned small businesses from across the country directly on Pinterest. Fearless Strivers Grant Contest: Mastercard has once again extended its partnership with Fearless Fund, a with the Black women-owned venture capital fund built by women of color for women of color, to provide Black women SBOs across the country with $20,000 grants, digital tools and mentorship to help them build, protect and sustain their business through its third annual Fearless Strivers Grant Contest. This program is just one element of Mastercard’s growing music footprint. In January, in support of helping all creators reach their full potential, Mastercard announced the Mastercard Artist Accelerator Program, a Web3 collective that connects musicians, creators and fans to collaborate like never before. The development program will harness Web3 and blockchain technologies to prepare emerging artists from underrepresented communities with tools, skills and access to forge their own paths in the digital economy.

SEATTLE & PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Expedia Group and Mastercard today expand their partnership for a new joint adventure: Travel with Rewards, a modern loyalty points redemption solution that enables consumers to redeem credit card loyalty points for travel bookings powered by Expedia. A complete redemption system leveraging Mastercard’s trusted loyalty solutions and Expedia’s extensive travel supply, Travel with Rewards will make exciting experiences more accessible on a global scale. Through a participating issuer’s website, U.S. cardholders can access Travel with Rewards, powered by Expedia, using a seamless single sign-on. From there, the cardholder can see the points to dollars conversion as they search for travel, and will have the option to book using only points, their Mastercard credit card, or a combination of both. With Expedia Group’s substantial reach, cardholders will have access to 700k+ properties, 500+ airlines, 100+ car rental companies and thousands of activities around the world. Travelers making bookings will also gain access to Expedia Group’s high-quality, end-to-end customer service – whether that’s speaking to live agents or leveraging the company’s self-serve capabilities such as the Virtual Agent tool – allowing them to make changes or ask questions about their trip. “With Travel with Rewards, we’re providing consumers choice in how they want to pay and underscoring the importance of building loyalty programs that provide real value,” said Stephanie Meltzer-Paul, Executive Vice President of Global Loyalty at Mastercard. “Our companies are uniquely positioned to deliver a more effective point redemption experience that’s easy to activate for issuers and allows cardholders to transform points they’ve already earned from everyday spending into the ultimate reward: their next adventure.” Expedia Group’s White Label Template allows issuing banks and merchants to seamlessly integrate the solution to their existing customer interface, providing a frictionless experience for both cardholder and issuer. This strategic partnership unifies the travel loyalty experience into one ideal solution, reinventing redemption functionality and standardizing access for partners seeking to deliver more diverse offerings to their consumers. Together, the companies have united complementary technology, with Expedia Group’s template technology and Mastercard’s digital redemption capability combining to act as a turnkey solution that can be implemented by issuers around the world. “We are proud to partner with Mastercard to ensure their customers can spend their well-earned loyalty points on great travel experiences. Our template technology will power Mastercard’s global network of issuers, giving their customers access to a broad choice of hotels, flights, car rentals and activities, all backed by our deep customer service expertise.

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--New insights from the Mastercard Economics Institute reveal that consumers are taking advantage of a more traditional travel ecosystem in 2023, prioritizing leisure travel and pioneering new corridors around the world. Released today, Travel Industry Trends 2023 delivers key insights about the global state of travel, punctuated by shifting economic landscapes, persistent consumer demands, and a reopening of mainland China. In the face of a changing economic landscape, post-pandemic preferences for experiences over things1 and a consistent demand for leisure travel shape the 2023 outlook. Initially lagging leisure travel, business travel found its footing in the latter half of 2022, especially in cultures prioritizing a return to office. With an uncertain economy providing some cross-market turbulence, mainland China’s reopening is expected to bolster growth globally with concentrated impact in Asia Pacific, according to Mastercard Economics Institute estimates. Key findings include: Leisure and business travel are growing at the same pace. Global leisure travel remains robust, with flight bookings up roughly 31% in March 2023 compared to the same month in 2019.2 In the second half of 2022 into early 2023, corporate flight bookings caught up to leisure flight bookings driven by regions with a strong return to office culture.3 Global leisure and business travel are now growing at similar rates. Our insights show demand for in-person meetings, with the most significant growth in commercial travel and entertainment expenses being led by Asia Pacific and Europe up 64% and 42%, respectively, between January-March 2023.4 Mainland China’s reopening benefits global and Asia Pacific tourism. China’s reopening following tight COVID regulations comes at a time when it will likely have a positive impact on the experience economy as pent-up demand for travel is expected to drive strong tailwinds. By March 2023, spending on experiences was notably 93% of where it was in 2019 despite minimal travel last year.6 Economies in the Asia Pacific region could be obvious beneficiaries of China's opening, given their strong ties to international trade, tourism, and geographical proximity. Based on Mastercard Economics Institute estimates, other countries that are expected to benefit include northern Europe – Germany and France – and Brazil, which could see a boost in their exports to China as the economy recovers. Travelers establish new corridors. As consumers are enjoying higher incomes and returning to some level of pre-pandemic comfort, they’re also starting to venture further from home to new locations. Germany and Spain are becoming more popular for Latin American travelers, while Saudi Arabia and Egypt have become popular destinations for travelers from Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The U.S., previously ranked as number 5 in the top destinations for European travelers in 2022, now ranks number 4, signaling a building desire to explore across the pond7. Traditionally tourism-driven European countries like France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece could disproportionately benefit from resilient global tourists. Tourists continue to prioritize experiences. Preference for experiences over things persists, and travelers are demonstrating new demand for the unique. Potentially influenced by social media and entertainment, travelers are landing in lesser-known destinations in search of cultural immersion. As of March 2023, global spending on experiences was up 65% while spending on things is up 12% compared to 2019.8 Experience-oriented spending is surging in certain corridors where pandemic lockdowns have expired, but Chinese tourists who traditionally over-index on luxury retail compared to other tourists could provide a boost to goods spending across markets. “In the first full year of unfettered travel since the pandemic, consumers are acting on pent-up desire to explore new locales, connect with friends and family, and accumulate experiences to make up for lost time,” said Bricklin Dwyer, Mastercard chief economist and head of the Mastercard Economics Institute. ”Despite evolving economic landscapes, resilient consumers continue to prioritize travel. And with new corridors emerging and China reopening, the 2023 outlook indicates good reason to be optimistic.” Comprehensive Support to Travelers & Tourism Sector Travelers want a good experience from the time they book their plane ticket to their first step on new soil, and companies that understand that are better positioned to establish longer and more valuable relationships with their consumers. This key shift in expectations has already started to change not only how companies work with their consumers, but also the way in which we travel. And though consumer behavior will continue to shift alongside the macroeconomic environment, providing more choice in how to pay (like redeeming points for bookings), and tailoring experiences, recommendations, and offers are just two strategies that keep the individual traveler at the center of engagement. Mastercard is dedicated to helping the global tourism sector recover and welcome travelers through a range of services, from market analysis and high-frequency data insights that help make sense of changing consumer trends to marketing solutions and consumer engagement strategies that drive brand loyalty and maximize bookings.

Stablecoins offer significant benefits for international transactions, but widespread adoption faces hurdles like convenience, security, and merchant-consumer currency agreements. Between 74% and 90% of stablecoin volume is tied to crypto transactions, and when spent on the real economy, card networks are still used. Stablecoins reduce costs and time in cross-border transactions, a huge addressable market that represents a small percentage of Mastercard's revenues."
