MA,2021-10-28,2021-10-14,2021-11-11,MA,,2021-10-14 10:07:00,2021-10-14T10:07:00-04:00,2021-10-14,Second Global Inclusive Growth Summit Launches New Programs to Fight Increasing Inequality,"PURCHASE, N.Y. & WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Top business, government and civil society leaders will gather today for the second Global Inclusive Growth Summit, co-hosted by the Aspen Institute and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth. Key participants at the “Rebuilding for All” summit will announce commitments of more than $54 million across 10 new programs that will take action to help build inclusive and sustainable economies in communities around the world. These new commitments include efforts to support housing stability and build financial infrastructure in marginalized communities; investing in companies that support the resiliency of unsecured workers in India; and working to reduce bias in the data and algorithms that financial services institutions use in the U.S. Select summit participants have been supported in the development of their programs through a partnership with the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), an initiative of the Clinton Foundation. The COVID-19 pandemic has both accelerated the shift to a digital economy, and exacerbated inequality around the world. Here in the United States, the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on Black, Latino, and Native American communities – with wide disparities on both the health and financial effects of the pandemic. It is critical that public, private and civic sector leaders work together to address these longstanding disparities and advance solutions to help create a more inclusive economic recovery. Today’s sessions covered three thematic areas: People, Planet & Prosperity: Creating Growth that Sustains; The Global Agenda for Financial Security; and TechTonic Shifts: Putting Technology to Work for the Common Good. Global leaders shared their perspectives on “rebuilding for all”, as well as the risk of not acting: Vice President Kamala Harris, transcript remarks “When we harness our collective innovation and determination, we maximize our impact. Take the business community, for instance. There are employers across our nation that are leading the way on gender equality. They are committed to pay transparency, intentional in hiring and promoting, thoughtful in ensuring, flexibility and predictability. And studies have shown that they are seeing higher equity returns, increased profit margins, and greater productivity. So, here is my on-going challenge to business leaders, foundation leaders, and non-profit leaders across our country: think about what more you can do to remove barriers to opportunity within your own businesses and organizations. To make those businesses and organizations as inclusive as they are strong. And then, please do it. Because we need your help to build an economy that works for women and for all. In this moment of transformation, I believe that change is possible if we make it together. So, let's get to work.” Bill Clinton, 42nd President of the United States; Founder and Board Chair, Clinton Foundation “As the COVID-19 pandemic has painfully reminded us, far too many people have been left out and left behind for far too long. We have both a rare opportunity and a moral imperative to bring people together from across sectors and around the world, to build economies that give every person the chance to succeed. The investments being announced today will support both the immediate needs of the workforce and set up our economies for long-term inclusive growth and prosperity.” Raphael Bostic, President & CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta “I think it's really important that everyone understand that systemic racism and indeed any structure or institution that restricts opportunity based on a person's skin color or their family connections or any of those sorts of things is an economic issue because it constrains the access to opportunity and it really limits the ability of people and communities of achieving their full potential. And if they don't achieve their full potential, we all lose because we have smaller economies than we should, and we have less resilient economies than we should. At the Atlanta Fed, we are committed to ensuring the economy works for everyone and to creating a foundation upon which all individuals, communities and businesses can thrive.” 10 partners launch 10 new programs with a singular focus: impact Programs focused on driving financial inclusion for individuals: Mobility Capital Finance, Mastercard, and the City of Birmingham will jointly develop, launch, and manage Birmingham’s financial services infrastructure program to help 50,000 underbanked and unbanked residents in marginalized communities. JPMorgan Chase will commit $8.4 million to improve household stability as part of the firm’s $400 million five-year commitment to close the housing affordability gap for Black, Hispanic and Latino households. These commitments and policy solutions are part of the firm’s $30 billion commitment to advance racial equity and help drive an inclusive economic recovery. Prudential is building on the impact of its decade-long partnership with the Aspen Institute with a pledge of $11 million over five years to together establish “Equity Re-imagined” to improve job quality, empower people to build financial security, and amplify wealth creation opportunities for historically underserved communities. Solutions to help small businesses scale: STRIVE COMMUNITY will launch a $1 million Innovation Fund to build, test, or enhance solutions that support small business growth. GRAB, Southeast Asia’s leading super-app, announced a regional partnership with Mastercard’s Center for Inclusive Growth, to provide millions of informal workers and small businesses on the Grab platform access to digital upskilling opportunities to create more pathways and income opportunities for them. Initiatives to better equip the workforce of tomorrow: Mastercard and Microsoft will link workers to training providers and employers; unlocking access to capital for small businesses; reducing bias in the financial services industry by identifying and mitigating bias in data and algorithms used by financial services providers. AARP, in partnership with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the World Economic Forum, will identify and share multigenerational, inclusive workforce practices among international member companies to enable expansion of those practices in diverse industries. Acumen, with initial support of the Target Foundation, will develop an accelerator for a cohort of early-stage companies focused on promoting green jobs and circular models that aim to drive sustainable and equitable economic growth in India and provide seed capital to select early-stage companies on their path to scale. Bolstering access to capital: Beyond The Billion will secure pledges from venture funds and limited partner investors as part of their goal to unlock $10 billion in venture capital to be invested in a diverse group of women founders. In addition, Senator Chris Coons called for the creation of a new Presidential Financial Inclusion Commission at the Department of the Treasury tasked with creating a national, interagency financial inclusion strategy. The Commission would build on the Biden Administration’s work to create a more equitable economy. In addition to working across federal agencies, the Commission will bring in a diverse set of leaders with relevant experience in the nonprofit and private sectors to produce a federal strategy for improving the financial well-being of American households. And finally, CARE and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth announced progress on a commitment made at the 2019 Global Inclusive Growth Summit. In 2019, a new partnership was announced that included a $5.26 million grant to support 3.9 million small businesses in Pakistan, Peru and Vietnam, where large segments of unserved small businesses are ready for investment. Today, CARE USA will announce that the program has so far reached over 1 million entrepreneurs and their communities across the three countries. “As the global economy begins to recover, the necessity of creating inclusive and sustainable growth has never been greater,” said Mike Froman, vice chairman of Mastercard. “Today’s Global Inclusive Growth Summit shines a spotlight on the kind of partnerships, digital technology and bold commitments that are needed to substantively move the needle towards a more equitable society. In order to tackle the scale of global challenges we face, we cannot go it alone. We will need partners across public, private and civic sectors to come together, expand pathways to the middle class and help people and small businesses thrive and grow.” “When we launched the Global Inclusive Growth Partnership in 2019, economic inequity was already an immediate challenge. Few could have predicted just how fundamental the work of inclusive growth would become, however, over the past 18 months. As the global economy recovers from a devastating pandemic, we must act with renewed urgency to build a more equitable society,” said Dan Porterfield, President and CEO of the Aspen Institute. “The commitments announced at the summit today, within this framework, have the potential to transform the lives of people, families, and communities around the world. Each sector—including business, governments, and nonprofits—has an opportunity and a responsibility to put these solutions into practice.” Quotes from Global Inclusive Growth Summit Commitment Partners ""As people live, learn, and earn longer, AARP is committed to working with businesses to help them reap the benefits of a multigenerational workforce where people can continue to work for as long as they need or want to,"" said AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins. “Research shows that age-diverse workforces have a positive effect on employee engagement, productivity and the bottom line. It is heartening to see that business leaders around the world recognize this value, even as we’ve been concerned the pandemic could fuel ageism.” “The effects of the climate crisis – resource depletion, urbanization, and pollution – are exacerbating problems for the informal, migrant workforce in India. We know there are social entrepreneurs building companies that can address the needs of India’s informal workforce and mitigate the irrevocable impacts of climate change. In the spirit of collaboration and putting people and the planet first, we hope to leverage our collective resources through this program and create greener and more equitable growth in India in partnership with others who share these goals,” shares Yasmina Zaidman, Chief Partnerships Officer at Acumen. ""Investing in women is just good business. We've learned from our journey that to truly fuel women-led innovation, we need to address the entire supply chain of capital, and this is why we're excited to work with limited partner investors - from some of the largest pensions, endowments, foundations to families to diversify and advance the global venture ecosystem,"" Shelly Porges and Sarah Chen, Co-Founders, Beyond The Billion. “Access to safe, affordable housing is key to building wealth but out of reach for far too many families,” said Heather Higginbottom, President, JPMorgan Chase PolicyCenter and Co-Head of Global Philanthropy. “Today’s announcement will help promote immediate housing stability for underserved households and is one step toward our goal of addressing barriers to affordable housing and homeownership, especially for Black, Latino and Hispanic families.” “MoCaFi is committed to the movement for economic justice. We are proud to partner with companies and organizations that assist us in creating sustainable financial pathways for marginalized communities, and our program in Birmingham matches our initiatives with the visionary leadership of Mayor Woodfin. This program will serve as a model for the country and how technology can bring productive financial solutions to the most vulnerable residents and neighborhoods. MoCaFi is honored that the Clinton Global Initiative and the Aspen Institute have recognized this collaboration and our dedication to providing economic mobility to all Americans,” said Wole Coaxum, Founder and CEO, MoCaFi “Mobility Capital Finance, Inc.” “Prudential is committed to closing the financial divide as an urgent moral and business imperative,” said Lata Reddy, senior vice president of Inclusive Solutions at Prudential Financial and chair of The Prudential Foundation. “For the past 11 years, the Aspen Institute has been a key partner to us in driving innovation, narrative change, and policies that bring financial stability to historically underserved communities. Through Equity Re-imagined, our new $11 million partnership with Aspen, together we will reimagine the future of work, wealth and capitalism.” Launched in October 2019 with an inaugural summit, the Global Inclusive Growth Partnership (GIGP) combines the expertise and networks of both the Aspen Institute and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth to address systemic issues across a range of topics including financial security, the future of workers and portable benefits, growing micro and small businesses, and commercially sustainable social impact. CGI provided assistance to select summit participants in developing the programs announced today. Over the years, CGI and its successors have brought together leaders from across sectors to improve the lives of more than 430 million people in 180 countries worldwide.

The collaboration will enable instant payments to suppliers in over 100 markets globally. In today’s environment, cash flow is critical – particularly for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Over one third of SMBs in North America report facing cash flow issues due to late payments and slow processing times for cash and checks1. Globally, many businesses also lack streamlined ways to receive payments in their local currency when dealing with customers in multiple markets. This forces them to borrow money at expensive rates to support cash flow, while they wait for payment on outstanding invoices. Using the latest advances in machine learning, Previse’s InstantPay solution analyzes invoices to identify those that are likely to be rejected, enabling the rest to be paid the same day they’re received. With the integration of Mastercard’s Cross-Border Services, companies using InstantPay can now send digital payments seamlessly and securely to suppliers in over 100 counties via bank accounts and digital wallets. In addition to paying suppliers quickly, business can reduce the cost of transactions and access real-time exchange rates for local currency, while reducing the need for additional documents and manual processes. “Delayed payments have always been a challenge for businesses and the pandemic only exacerbated this pain point,” said Ron Shultz, executive vice president, New Payments Flows, North America at Mastercard. “With Mastercard Cross-Border Services, businesses can expect to receive funds quickly, directly and securely. Digital B2B payment innovations like the ones being driven by Mastercard and Previse are helping suppliers gain faster access to funds and freedom from inefficient processes, so they can not only recover today - but thrive tomorrow.” “Flexible, robust supply chains and steadfast cash flow are essential for businesses to thrive and grow, particularly SMBs,” comments Paul Christensen, CEO and Co-Founder of Previse. “The integration of Mastercard Cross-Border Services enables every corporate using InstantPay to effortlessly pay suppliers across the world on day one. It's an innovative solution from Mastercard and Previse, which strengthens global supply chains and is a true win-win for large corporates and SMBs alike as we recover from the pandemic.” Previse joins a growing list of global partners working with Mastercard to offer people and businesses a more predictable and more certain way to pay and get paid across borders. Mastercard Cross-Border Services connects 90 percent of the world’s population via bank accounts, digital wallets, cards and cash agents, all through a single and secure point of access.

Launched in partnership with Demica, a leading global provider of supply chain finance technology, this new offering empowers Mastercard partners to provide their business customers with access to affordable working capital. Mastercard Track, an open-loop network, can now connect providers of B2B payments and their respective buyer and supplier customers to working capital. A lack of scalable solutions in the market has put supply chain financing out of reach for many businesses. As a result, only the largest suppliers can access working capital solutions, while trillions of dollars are tied up in accounts receivable each year. Mastercard’s solution unlocks a network for working capital - covering small businesses and global corporations alike, driving speed to market, and offering ease of integration for payment partners. Demica brings a global, flexible, multi-product financing platform and expansive network of banks and other funders at scale. Payment partners and their customers can benefit from Demica’s capabilities ranging from advisory services, supplier onboarding, and a white-labelled deployment process. “We are delighted to be working with Mastercard to transform the B2B payments landscape. This partnership will unite Demica’s scalable platform technology with Mastercard’s powerful infrastructure to make a real difference for businesses globally,” said Matt Wreford, CEO, Demica. “Our platform automates financing of payables and receivables and our global network of banks and non-bank investors opens up access to new sources of capital – we’re excited to bring these benefits to more companies through our global partnership with Mastercard.” By launching this first of its kind, embedded working capital capability in Mastercard’s Track Business Payment Service multi-rail platform, Mastercard is doubling down on its commitment to empower every business to get the working capital they need to thrive. This solution enables payment partners to extend the reach of buyer programs to more of their supply chain partners, strengthening supplier relationships. Suppliers gain improved access to competitively priced early payments and enjoy enhanced user experiences, such as one-time enrollment, standard agreements, and easy implementation leveraging their partner connections. Craig Vosburg, Chief Product Officer, Mastercard says, “Helping businesses optimize their working capital has been one of the key goals of Mastercard Track Business Payment Service. Disparate systems and processes in the current B2B ecosystem continue to make cash flow management complicated, increase operating costs, and hinder business growth. Our new offering and partnership with Demica help solve these pain points by allowing buyers and suppliers to unlock their working capital and deploy it to grow their businesses – enabling choice and scale and accelerating financial inclusion.” Mastercard is integrating its Track Business Payment Service network and its blockchain-based Mastercard Provenance Solution in supply chains across industries. Buyers and suppliers will see improved visibility, traceability, and procure-to-pay cycle times. As a result, payment partners can use this data to reduce risk, decrease reconciliation costs, and help further advance early payments in the accounts payable and receivable processes. The offering will provide access and support to a new suite of APIs to power each step of the commercial payments journey. Learn more at Mastercard Developers. This new supply chain finance offering is available on Account-to-Account (A2A) rails in the United States with plans for global expansion throughout 2022 as Mastercard continues to onboard partners in this space through its focused approach to global trade. New Track BPS Partners Offer Choice for Customers Around the World Mastercard continues its strong growth with network partners supporting Track Business Payment Service which is now live in regions around the world for A2A and global card payments.

Mastercard is addressing this challenge with a simple yet effective innovation. “The Touch Card will provide a greater sense of security, inclusivity and independence to the 2.2 billion people around the world with visual impairments,“ says Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing and communications officer. “For the visually impaired, identifying their payment cards is a real struggle. This tactile solution allows consumers to correctly orient the card and know which payment card they are using.” With the new Touch Card, Mastercard has improved upon a current design standard by introducing a system of notches on the side of the card to help consumers use the right card, the right way, by touch alone. The new Touch Card credit cards have a round notch; debit cards have a broad squarish notch; and prepaid cards have a triangular notch. The standard has been designed to work with point-of-sale terminals and ATMs, ensuring it can be deployed at scale. Mastercard’s concept has been vetted and endorsed by The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in the U.K. and VISIONS/Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired in the U.S. The card was co-designed by IDEMIA, the global leader in Augmented Identity, providing trusted solutions in the physical as well as digital space. “As the banking industry responds to new trends and developments, it’s critical that any innovation brings progress for everyone, including those with a visual impairment,” says David Clarke, RNIB’s director of services. “We’re very pleased that Mastercard understands how important it is that blind and partially sighted people have equal and independent access to their own finances.“ “Innovation should always be driven by the impulse to include,” adds Rajamannar, who is also the company’s Healthcare president. “With one in seven people experiencing some form of disability, designing these products with accessibility in mind gives them equal opportunity to benefit from the ease and security of a digital world. No one should be left behind.” Mastercard has been embedding its signature melody at checkout counters worldwide, a signal to everyone – the sight impaired in particular – that their card transaction has gone through successfully. Mastercard’s launch of the Touch Card underscores its commitment to inclusivity. It follows the introduction of True Name™, designed in support of the transgender and non-binary communities. The company’s commitment as a brand is to not only stand against inequity but to be an agent for change.

It is also scaling its sustainable solutions to customers across Europe and Latin America, including Banco de Costa Rica, ekko, Gránit Bank, and Sberbank, which have all signed on to adopt the Mastercard Carbon Calculator. As part of its net zero strategy, Mastercard had already committed to meet its existing science-based targets (SBTi) for greenhouse gas reduction, which are aligned to the United Nations Business Ambition for a 1.5°C future. The company transitioned to 100% renewable energy in 2018 for its operations, and its emission reduction strategy primarily centers on further decarbonization across its value chain, including Scopes 1, 2 & 3 emissions. Mastercard has received an “A” rating for Supplier Engagement since 2018 from CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) and joined the 1.5°C Supply Chain Leaders Initiative, supporting large and small suppliers with concrete resources and tools for measuring their emissions and developing climate strategies through the SME Climate Hub. Supported by its new global Sustainability Innovation Lab, the company aims to encourage tangible action by people who use its 2.9 billion cards across the globe. This includes helping banks offer their consumers digital tools, such as the Mastercard Carbon Calculator, that encourage climate-conscious choices, and cards made from more sustainable materials. “Tackling the global climate crisis will take all of us – and major businesses have a vital role to play. At Mastercard, we continue to raise the bar for ourselves, accelerating our commitment to reach net zero emissions,” said Michael Miebach, chief executive officer, Mastercard. “We will also use our technology and global network to inspire collective action that fosters a more sustainable digital economy.” Enabling sustainable consumer choice According to a recent Mastercard survey, 85% of respondents globally said they’re willing to take personal action to combat environmental and sustainability challenges in 2021. New research from Mastercard also shows our society is now at an inflection point in both the supply and demand for sustainable options. Mastercard is helping inform consumers about the environmental impact of their spending through the Mastercard Carbon Calculator, created in collaboration with Swedish fintech Doconomy. Embedded across Mastercard’s global network earlier this year, the Carbon Calculator will now be adopted by leading banking partners – both traditional financial institutions and emerging fintechs – in markets around the world, including Banco de Costa Rica, ekko, Gránit Bank, and Sberbank. Together with Mastercard, each partner will co-create and define its customer experience, such as enhancing it with relatable and easy-to-understand equivalents (such as the number of trees required to compensate for the same amount of CO2), integrating donation functionality to support reforestation projects, and providing tips about sustainable living. Mastercard’s sustainable cards program shows strong momentum: 148 financial institutions in 46 countries have now issued cards made with more sustainable materials, including HSBC and Banco Santander, as we look to reduce the use of first-use PVC plastic in card manufacturing. The company also recently unveiled a first-of-its kind badge to identify these cards made more sustainably from recyclable, recycled, bio-sourced, chlorine-free or ocean plastics. Through the Priceless Planet Coalition, Mastercard and its partner network also continue to offer easy ways for consumers to contribute to forest restoration. Uniting more than 80 businesses globally in the restoration of 100 million trees, the Coalition now has multiple consumer engagement campaigns running across markets to generate donations to the environment. The Coalition’s restoration partners, Conservation International and World Resources Institute, have also broken ground in key project locations. To help accelerate progress toward Mastercard’s sustainability goals, the company made changes to its executive compensation model, linking it to three global ESG priorities including operational carbon neutrality. Mastercard also showed progress in 2020 against its existing 1.5°C SBTi-approved targets, including a Scope 1 & 2 reduction of 44% and Scope 3 reduction of 57% against a 2016 baseline, and was recently awarded for Supply Chain Leadership from the Climate Leadership Conference. Quote sheet Todd Stern, Former Special Envoy for Climate Change, the US’s chief negotiator for the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, and Priceless Planet Coalition Advisor: “COP26 is an enormously important event as world leaders come together, but the action that follows is even more crucial. Businesses can play an important role by stepping up their own pledges and delivering on the demand from consumers for more green products and solutions. We need bold commitments and even bolder actions. The work Mastercard and its partners are doing through the Priceless Planet Coalition and with the Carbon Calculator will empower more consumers to contribute to tackling climate change.” Banco de Costa Rica, Guillermo Gayle Monge, Head of Payments: “Costa Rica is a world icon as a green country and Banco de Costa Rica as a state bank is fully committed to environmental sustainability, we are proud to boost projects in favor of the environment. We thank Mastercard for inviting us to be part of the launch of the Carbon Calculator in LAC and give a hand to our planet, mitigating all of us our carbon footprint.” Doconomy, Mathias Wikström, co-founder and CEO: “Doconomy is proud to work with Mastercard, contributing through the Åland Index methodology for the Carbon Calculator and the set-up of the Sustainability Innovation Lab. This is a strong foundation to enable everyone to contribute to much needed climate action. Mastercard continues to lead the way for their industry.” ekko, Oli Cook, co-founder and CEO: “As the world’s leaders come together at COP26 to advocate collaborative action, so starts our own journey. We are excited to introduce ekko to the world and offer people a greener way to pay. From collecting ocean bound plastic to global reforestation, together with Mastercard we will help our customers live more sustainably and become more aware of the carbon footprint of what they consume by doing nothing other than using their ekko card.” GRÁNIT Bank, Eva Hegedüs, chairperson and CEO: ”Businesses need to use their resources to drive meaningful change for the planet. At GRÁNIT Bank we support every sustainability effort wholeheartedly. From the very beginning, it has been our mission to inspire the customers’ minds and hearts towards sustainability and to make the planet-friendly living possible. For this work, GRÁNIT Bank has received several accolades, (e.g. Green Financial Innovator Prize awarded by the National Bank of Hungary), but the greatest prize of all is our planet that we can save for future generations. To this end, the Bank will shortly launch a new innovative function in its mobile banking application: the carbon calculator will enable users to measure and reduce their carbon footprint. It is a great honor to us that we have had the opportunity to work together with Mastercard on this and on many other innovative projects.” Sberbank, Evgenia Tyurikova, Head of Sber Private Banking: “In partnership with Mastercard, we work on the launch of the Carbon Calculator. We want our business to drive meaningful change around the world. The Mastercard Carbon Calculator will help draw people's attention to environmental issues and increase their level of engagement by providing them with tools to assess their impact on the environment and the ability to neutralize this impact.” About Mastercard (NYSE: MA) Mastercard is a global technology company in the payments industry.

In partnership with documentary filmmaker and small business champion Nick Heller, otherwise known as @newyorknico, Mastercard is celebrating the businesses that have powered New York City over the past 50 years. Mastercard continues to leverage the full scope of its business, technology and network of partners and cardholders to help guide and elevate the visibility of small businesses in New York City and around the world. Through Heller’s authentic New York City voice, the “50 Years and Running” campaign features three iconic small businesses near the marathon route that have overcome obstacles in the face of adversity and provide priceless impact on their communities. They include: Grandma’s Place: Dawn Harris-Martin, lovingly referred to as “Grandma Dawn,” opened her iconic children’s toy and bookstore in 1999 to empower children through literacy. Like the Harlem community, Grandma’s Place caters to people of all ethnicities and backgrounds by centering the shop around games and books that benefit, support, educate, and reach children through fun, open-ended learning experiences. Davey’s Ice Cream: Originally conceptualized as a creative outlet for designer and New York native David Yoo, Davey’s Ice Cream opened in Brooklyn with a focus on quality ingredients sourced from local retailers. Yoo continues to build and diversify his flavors to accommodate the multi-national audience that New York City is known for while still staying true to the homemade origins of his recipes. Bronx Native: Owner Amaurys Grullon provides a cultural hub for creators, artists, and entrepreneurs to showcase Bronx talent with Bronx Native. Launched in 2016, every piece of merchandise – shirts, hats, or gear – serves as a tool to share issues of poverty and untreated illnesses in the surrounding neighborhoods, with a commitment to changing people’s perception of the Bronx. “The issues facing small businesses have changed radically in the 50 years since the TCS New York City Marathon began, and the impacts of the pandemic have only amplified and evolved these challenges,” said Heller. “Running a business takes the same dedication, hard work and grit it takes to run a marathon. We’re proud to pay tribute to the small business owners – from Brooklyn to the Bronx – who exemplify what makes this city one of the greatest in the world.” To further support the small businesses featured in the campaign, Mastercard will provide each with a Digital Doors™ toolkit comprised of exclusive offerings and resources to help maximize their digital presence, protect their online operations, and succeed in the new normal. These efforts build on Mastercard’s sustained emphasis on financial inclusion, including the company’s pledge to bring 50 million micro and small businesses into the digital economy by 2025. “The ’50 Years and Running’ Priceless campaign reflects Mastercard’s ongoing commitment to supporting and elevating the small businesses that serve as the backbone of our communities,” said Cheryl Guerin, executive vice president, North America Marketing and Communications at Mastercard. “We’re thrilled to be celebrating and showcasing the extraordinary small businesses that keep New York City running and provide them with the digital tools and resources they deserve to thrive."" Running Towards Innovation At the TCS New York City Marathon Expo at the Jacob K. Javits Center, which will see approximately 30,000 runners during the week leading up to the race, Mastercard will provide marathon participants and attendees with the opportunity to support small businesses through a one-of-a-kind activation. At Hall 3B, booth 202, Mastercard will unveil an expo venue where consumers can experience Tap on Phone, Mastercard’s innovative technology that turns an Android smartphone or tablet into an acceptance device. Tap on Phone is powered by Mastercard Foundry’s Cloud Point of Sale (POS) technology and leverages Verizon 5G, enabling small- and-medium-sized businesses to handle transactions in a fast and secure manner. Additionally, with every purchase of a $0.50 Mastercard tote, consumers will be entered for a chance to win one bib for the 2022 NYC Marathon and an array of prizes to support the New York City small businesses featured in the “50 Years and Running” campaign, including1: 10 ice cream socials at Davey’s Ice Cream, valued at $500 each 20 $500 shopping sprees at Grandma’s Place, in-store or online 20 $500 shopping sprees at Bronx Native, in-store or online “We are excited to have Mastercard as our Official Payment Services Provider for the first time at the TCS New York City Marathon,” said Christine Burke, senior vice president, Strategic Partnerships and Runner Products at New York Road Runners. “Marathon runners will have the opportunity to explore a variety of innovative payment solutions and experiences all while celebrating the small businesses that have powered New York City over the last 50 years.” The TCS New York City Marathon will take place on November 7. Mastercard will sponsor the Side Street Cheer Zone, located at 4th Avenue & Flatbush at mile eight, the Start Village hospitality space and the TCS New York City Marathon Pavilion.
