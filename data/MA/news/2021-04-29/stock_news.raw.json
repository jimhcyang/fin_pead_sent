    "text": "PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard (NYSE: MA) today announced the appointment of Tim Murphy, the company’s general counsel, to the newly created position of chief administrative officer. In this role, he will have oversight of the company’s Law, Franchise and Integrity activities, as well as the added management of its People and Capabilities function. Michael Fraccaro will continue as chief people officer and a member of the company’s management committee, reporting to Murphy. Together, they will further shape and drive Mastercard’s world-class culture with decency at its core. A 21-year veteran of the company, Murphy has helped to shape Mastercard throughout his tenure, beginning with his role as one of the lead lawyers for the company’s initial public offering. Since then, he has blended business and legal insights and evolution, serving at different times as president of the company’s U.S. region and chief product officer. “In the decade I’ve worked with Tim, I’ve seen firsthand his ability to drive transformational change while sustaining fidelity to the core values that make Mastercard a special place to work,” said Michael Miebach, chief executive officer. “We have a unique opportunity in bringing together the teams that care about our people, law, policy, security, franchise, compliance and inclusion. Tim is the right person to use this moment to advance the strategy Mastercard needs to thrive in an increasingly complex world.” Richard Verma, executive vice president for Global Public Policy and Regulatory Affairs, has been promoted to general counsel and head of Global Public Policy. He will now lead the company’s core legal and regulatory functions, as well as its global and regional public policy teams. Verma will also join the Mastercard’s Management Committee. He joined Mastercard in late 2020, bringing more than 25 years of international experience across senior levels of business, law, diplomacy and the military. “In just a few short months, Rich has had a true impact on our engagement with policymakers and others across the globe. We’ll look to continue to tap into his extensive experience in public policy, geopolitics, trade and international law, and strong relationships to support the global move to a digital economy,” said Murphy. The company also announced two other executive changes. Ron Green, Mastercard’s chief security officer, has been appointed to the company’s management committee. Randall Tucker, the company’s chief inclusion officer, has been promoted to executive vice president and will continue to lead a refreshed Diversity, Equity & Inclusion team.

    "text": "PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Trust is the key ingredient to conducting digital commerce. Central to creating trust in a digital world is the ability to prove your digital identity - who you are, whether you are interacting in person, online or in app. Today, Mastercard (NYSE: MA) took steps to advance its identity verification efforts with the acquisition of Ekata for US$850 million. Digital identity is a foundational part of Mastercard’s multi-layered approach to security. In 2019, the company introduced a new framework on how digital interactions should evolve, as well as how digital identity will build trust, collaboration and economic growth. That framework is now in use across a number of sectors, from education to travel to healthcare. Ekata works with a wide range of global merchants, financial institutions, travel companies, marketplaces and digital currency platforms. The company uses insights to deliver unique scores, data attributes and risk indicators that businesses then use to make more informed decisions. They help their customers identify good consumers and businesses and bad actors in real-time during online account opening, payments and variety of other digital interactions. \"The shift to a more digital world requires real solutions to secure every transaction and instill trust in every interaction,\" said Ajay Bhalla, president of cyber and intelligence solutions at Mastercard. \"With the addition of Ekata, we will advance our identity capabilities and create a safer, seamless way for consumers to prove who they say they are in the new digital economy.\" Ekata's identity verification data, machine learning technology and global experience combined with Mastercard's fraud prevention and digital identity programs will help businesses confidently know who their customers are and, in turn, help those customers safely interact online. Mastercard and Ekata's integrated services will build on both companies’ commitments to ensure trust and the responsible use of data. “The acceleration of online transactions has thrust global digital identity verification to the forefront as one of the biggest opportunities to build digital trust and combat global fraud,” said Rob Eleveld, CEO at Ekata, Inc. \"The right identity verification solutions enable inclusive and frictionless experiences while, at the same time, ensuring customer privacy, control and security. Becoming part of the Mastercard Identity family ensures a broader, collective approach to meeting the growing demands of the digital economy.” Ekata is headquartered in Seattle, with offices in Amsterdam, Singapore and Budapest. Delivering on the Strategy, Strengthening Value Commitment to Privacy, Responsibility - Ekata shares Mastercard’s commitment to safe and secure data practices centered around the individual, further reinforcing their value to the end user. Strong Identity Technology - Ekata has built a core set of identity verification services that helps to provide the backbone of the safety and security of everyday commerce. By bringing the capabilities, technologies and teams together, there is the potential to deliver even more trust and peace of mind, well beyond identity verification and identifying fraud trends. Complementary Expertise - The addition of Ekata's technology and engineering teams will help bolster the support Mastercard can provide as a one-stop partner for any consumer, bank, merchant, fintech or government’s data, payment and open banking needs. The combined capabilities across digital-first, installment and crypto payment services will help to enable greater choice and functionality, with the potential to expand further to real-time payments and cross-border activities. Together, Mastercard and Ekata will deliver a more comprehensive identity service that can power real-time decision-making needs, from new account openings to helping merchants assess potential fraud before a payment transaction is authorized. As with past acquisitions, Mastercard does not expect this acquisition to be dilutive to its business for greater than 24 months. This dilution is driven by investments in the business, including the impact of purchase accounting and integration related costs. The transaction is subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions. It is anticipated to close within the next six months.

    "text": "PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Black women are building and growing businesses faster than any other segment and yet receive less than one percent of venture capital funding. In addition, only three percent of the people actually leading investments at VC firms are Black according to the National Venture Capital Association. To help further access to funding for Black women, Mastercard today announced a multi-million dollar investment in Fearless Fund, a venture capital fund built by women of color for women of color. “The significant investment gaps in women-founded companies, which is especially acute for Women of Color, holds everyone back,” said Michael Froman, president of strategic growth, Mastercard. “The need to narrow this gender and racial disparity is critical in driving forward innovation and fueling inclusive, sustained economic recovery across our country. We are investing in Fearless Fund and partnering to bring innovative programs to market to help Black women founders get access to the capital and resources they need to achieve their full potential.” The investment will allow Fearless Fund to further expand their portfolio of women of color founded and co-founded companies in the CPG, Food & Beverage, Beauty, Fashion, and Technology sectors. Additionally, the social impact of the investment will have a significant role in job creation and wealth distribution in underserved communities. \"This multi-million dollar investment from Mastercard is further proof of their commitment to providing resources in an effort to better serve the hard-working but severely underfunded Women of Color entrepreneurs who so deserve equal capital distribution. We have been working together with Mastercard for almost 3 years now and look forward to growing this relationship,\" says Arian Simone, Co-Founder & General Partner of Fearless Fund. Mastercard has long been an advocate for the small business community and reinforced its investments to support Black communities with the introduction of its Strivers Initiative earlier this year. This initiative is focused on elevating the visibility of Black female business owners overcoming obstacles to maintain and grow their business, while encouraging consumers and businesses alike to shop, share and support them. In Solidarity Across U.S. Cities Last year, Mastercard announced a half-billion-dollar commitment to support Black communities across the U.S. over the next five years, to help close the racial wealth and opportunity gap starting in seven cities. As part of that effort the company is hosting in a series of local In Solidarity events to address financial barriers and how to advance equitable growth. The tour includes Strivers programming, hosted by Arian Simone, General Partner and Co-Founder of Fearless Fund, and in partnership with Create & Cultivate, to drive awareness on the state of Black women-owned business in select cities across the U.S. local markets. The Strivers events will foster dialogue with local leaders and small businesses around delivering on the needs of local businesses and the actions cities can take to advance an equitable business climate. To further underscore its commitment to this community, Mastercard and Fearless Fund launched the Fearless Strivers Grant Contest* to provide Black female small business owners across the U.S. who’ve been hit hardest by the pandemic with additional grants and tools to help grow their business. These efforts build on Mastercard’s sustained commitment to building a more inclusive digital economy including its commitment to bring 50 million small and medium-sized businesses into the digital economy, specifically helping 25 million woman entrepreneurs grow their businesses.

Fearless Strivers Grant Contest Rules NO PURCHASE NECESSARY. THIS IS A SKILL BASED CONTEST. Void where prohibited. Open to black females who are legal U.S. residents (including DC), 18+ and the principal owner of a U.S.-based small business (as described in the Official Rules). Ends 5/23/21.

    "text": "PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard today announced a US$10 million (approximately 75 crore rupees) commitment to directly address critical Covid-related needs in India. Over the past few weeks, the country has seen a spike in both Covid diagnoses and deaths, with the healthcare system being stretched to its limits as more than 350,000 new cases are identified each day. The philanthropic efforts, delivered through the Mastercard Impact Fund, will focus on three priority areas – access to hospital resources, access to additional oxygen supplies and continued support of the company’s employees across the country. The largest contribution will be designated to support the expansion of 2,000 beds through the installation of portable hospitals that can address the immediate healthcare needs. Working with the government and local partners on the ground, these hospitals can be constructed quickly and could help an estimated 2.5 million Indians gain access to healthcare, adding to the nation’s healthcare infrastructure. “The situation in India is gut-wrenching; it’s clear that no one has been left untouched and that no one can be a bystander,” said Ajay Banga, executive chairman of Mastercard. “We have long been advocates for the people of India, as employers and as enablers of the economy. Now it’s time for us to put our shoulders to the wheel and do whatever we can to help all of India get through this intensified crisis.” In addition to the on-the-ground medical support, Mastercard is also allocating funding for additional shipments of 1,000 oxygen generators, as part of a broader corporate effort. And the company is donating to local charities and NGOs to allow for direct support of those affected by the virus, including the frontline medical workers across the country. “The U.S. and India have a shared history of helping each other during times of crisis,” said Richard Verma, general counsel at Mastercard and former U.S. ambassador to India. “We’re hearing from our own teams the challenges that they and their families are facing. It’s critical that we stand by our friends and help those who have been impacted. Our commitment today and into the future is strong and enduring.” Prof. K. VijayRaghavan, Principal Scientific Adviser to Government of India added, \"The steep rise of Covid-19 cases poses an enormous challenge to clinical care facilities. Revamping existing hospital infrastructure by increasing the number of beds to accommodate more patients requiring critical care and procuring more equipment to enhance oxygenation for patients, is of utmost priority. We are grateful to the industry for their support to aid various State Governments’ critical care systems to boost their response to Covid-19. Mastercard and office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to Government of India have joined hands to provide 2,000 beds and purchase oxygen concentrators for hospitals in states that have been affected the most. There have been many such partnerships, many more such needed in the coming days. We hope to speedily facilitate them where there is most need.” Extended Support for Employees, Partners Mastercard has already committed to cover all vaccine-related costs for its India-based employees and immediate families, as doses are available. To help extend these efforts – and provide another outlet for its employees across the globe to help each other – Mastercard will also match employee donations to its Employee Assistance Fund, up to $15,000 per individual. This comes on top of a $500,000 corporate contribution to the fund. The company will continue to explore other opportunities to activate partnerships in India and across the global community – from the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum and U.S.-India Business Council to the Business Roundtable and the American India Foundation – to support these efforts.

    "site": "businesswire.com",
    "text": "PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As the world went into pandemic lockdown in 2020, consumers shifted their spending habits to embrace contactless tap-and-go payments and online shopping. As stores closed and social distancing took hold, retailers worldwide moved their businesses online, embraced e-commerce and explored the potential of new ways to pay. More than a year later, research from Mastercard shows that the adoption of new payment technologies is rising, and consumer appetite for new, fast and flexible digital experiences continues to grow. The Mastercard New Payments Index, conducted across 18 markets around the world, shows 93% of people will consider using at least one emerging payment method, such as cryptocurrency, biometrics, contactless, or QR code, in the next year. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (63%) agree they have tried a new payment method they would not have tried under normal circumstances, but the pandemic has galvanized people to try flexible new payment options to get what they want, when they want it. With this interest and consumer demand also comes a greater expectation for businesses to provide multiple ways to shop and pay. In fact, more than half of consumers say they would avoid businesses that do not accept electronic payments of any kind. “The pandemic made us think differently, partly out of necessity,” said Craig Vosburg, Chief Product Officer at Mastercard. “To deliver the choice and flexibility that consumers need – and increasingly expect –retailers worldwide need to offer a range of payment solutions that are easy to access and always on. As we look ahead, we need to continue to enable all choices, both in-store and online, to shape the fabric of commerce and make the digital economy work for everyone.” Contactless technology was the digital catalyst to explore new payment options because of its fast, secure and touch-free experience. Between the first quarter of 2020 and the same period in 2021, more than 100 markets saw contactless as a share of total in-person transactions grow by at least 50 percent. 3 A year into the COVID-19 pandemic, contactless is showing its staying power and dynamism – in the first quarter of 2021 alone, Mastercard saw 1 billion more contactless transactions as compared to the same period of 2020, with particular momentum in emerging contactless markets like the U.S. and Brazil, where contactless penetration in the two markets combined grew by nearly 3x year-over-year. 3 All signs point to a continued growth path for contactless, with nearly 7 in 10 consumers anticipating using a contactless card this year. Looking to the future, digital currencies, biometrics, contactless and QR codes are trending as emerging payments technologies as people’s comfort with them and understanding of them increases and the use of cash decreases. In fact, 71% of people say they expect to use cash less moving forward. The exploding interest in new payment technologies may encourage businesses to expand their options at checkout. The Mastercard New Payments Index found: Cryptocurrency1 Gains Ground, With Millennials Primed to Jump In – Today consumers can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency as a commodity or investment. Consumers are also increasingly showing interest in being able to spend crypto assets for everyday purchases. As global interest in cryptocurrencies as a payment method continues to accelerate, 4 in 10 people (40%) across North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific say they plan to use cryptocurrency in the next year. Millennials globally and those in the Middle East and Africa are especially engaged in the cryptocurrency conversation, with more than half (67%) agreeing they are more open to using cryptocurrency than they were a year ago. In addition, 77% of Millennials are interested in learning more about cryptocurrency, while 75% agree they would use cryptocurrency if they understood it better. While consumer interest in cryptocurrency - especially floating digital currencies such as Bitcoin - is high, work is still required to ensure consumer choice, protection, and their regulatory compliance. Biometric Payments Are More Trustworthy – Perceptions of safety and convenience have been front and center for people over the past year. More than half (53%) of consumers agree that biometric checkout is secure. In fact, 6 in 10 consumers say they are excited about the potential of biometric verification methods such as gait or walk assessments and fingerprint authorization (61%), and 60% feel safer using biometrics to verify a purchase than entering a pin. Gait or walk assessments can be used to pay based on a person’s manner of walking. QR Codes - A Cleaner and More Convenient Alternative to Cash in Developing Markets – While mature markets – like the U.S. – are focused on contactless payments, growing markets are leveraging QR-based options as a clean and convenient way to interact with merchants. In APAC, the majority of respondents perceive new payment methods like QR codes to be cleaner (76%) and more convenient (71%) than cash for in-person payments as it is likely consumers are using their own mobile device. 66% of respondents in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 63% in the Middle East and Africa expect to use more payment technologies like QR in the next year. To Meet People’s Demands, Businesses Forced to Jump into Emerging Payment Trends With consumer interest around new payment technologies, the expectation for businesses to adapt for the long-term is here to stay. Nearly eight in 10 respondents (79%) agree that they prefer to shop at stores that have both an in-person and online presence, and 68% noted being more excited to shop at retailers that can offer the latest payment methods. A recent study on 5,500 major Mastercard merchants, showed that between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, more than a fifth of these merchants globally increased the number of ways they connect with consumers either by enabling an e-commerce channel or accepting contactless transactions2. Over the same period, Mastercard saw the total number of card-not present transactions grow by over 30%.4 As one way to address this consumer preference for fast, touch-free payment experiences, many merchants are turning to contactless payments. Now, nearly 90% of in-person transactions globally take place at a contactless-enabled merchant, and nearly all merchant categories saw an increase in contactless transactions as a share of total in-person transactions year-over-year in the first quarter of 2021. 3 This behavior shift is reinforced by the desire for consumer choice – with 84% saying that they expect to make purchases when they want and how they want. The businesses that can provide multiple ways to shop and pay are best positioned to meet these expectations. As the demand for emerging payments and choice continues, it requires a wider range of payment solutions, insights, and products to meet the accelerating enthusiasm for the future state of pay.

    "text": "PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Total U.S. retail sales sprung into another month of double-digit growth in April, according to Mastercard SpendingPulseTM, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment. U.S. retail sales excluding automotive and gasoline increased 23.3% year-over-year in April, and 10.8% compared to April 2019. Online sales in April grew 19.9% and 95.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods. Retail sales continue to benefit from stimulus payments, coupled with warmer weather and broader reopening across the country. While the recovery has not been universal or consistent – due to geographical, economic, and household differences – there are a number of key overarching trends. Restaurant Resurgence: April marks the second consecutive month of positive growth for the Restaurant category, underscoring that consumers have an appetite to eat out again. Spending at restaurants grew 118.8% vs. 2020, when widespread shut-downs crippled the industry, and were up 5.7% compared 2019. Limited-service Restaurants, such as fast-food, were up 21.7% compared to 2019, outpacing their Full-service counterparts (-13.5% YO2Y). Online Convenience: Despite the record shattering e-commerce growth in April 2020, online sales remained up year-over-year. E-commerce share continues to make up a bigger portion of total retail spend overall (21.6%), as well as in categories such as Apparel (61.7%), Department Stores (21.0%) and Jewelry (15.7%). Department Stores See a Boost: Many of the depressed sectors in 2020, including Department Stores (+202.7%), Jewelry (+255%) and Lodging (+319.1%), are showing some of the largest year-over-year gains as retailers gear up for the return of gatherings and events. Department Stores grew 9.6% compared to 2019. “April's retail sales growth reinforces that the American consumer is healthy and eager to spend, especially on categories such as restaurants, which have faced restrictions over the past year,” said Steve Sadove, Mastercard senior advisor and former CEO of Saks, Inc. “There are a lot of factors at play including stimulus funds, pent-up demand, and the desire to reconnect with friends and family. The fact is that people are excited to gather again and they're refreshing their look for the occasion.” *Overall retail sales excluding gasoline and automotive compared to April 2020 About Mastercard SpendingPulse Mastercard SpendingPulse™ reports on national retail sales across all payment types in select markets around the world.
