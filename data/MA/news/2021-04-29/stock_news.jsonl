Over the past few weeks, the country has seen a spike in both Covid diagnoses and deaths, with the healthcare system being stretched to its limits as more than 350,000 new cases are identified each day. The philanthropic efforts, delivered through the Mastercard Impact Fund, will focus on three priority areas – access to hospital resources, access to additional oxygen supplies and continued support of the company’s employees across the country. The largest contribution will be designated to support the expansion of 2,000 beds through the installation of portable hospitals that can address the immediate healthcare needs. Working with the government and local partners on the ground, these hospitals can be constructed quickly and could help an estimated 2.5 million Indians gain access to healthcare, adding to the nation’s healthcare infrastructure. “The situation in India is gut-wrenching; it’s clear that no one has been left untouched and that no one can be a bystander,” said Ajay Banga, executive chairman of Mastercard. “We have long been advocates for the people of India, as employers and as enablers of the economy. Now it’s time for us to put our shoulders to the wheel and do whatever we can to help all of India get through this intensified crisis.” In addition to the on-the-ground medical support, Mastercard is also allocating funding for additional shipments of 1,000 oxygen generators, as part of a broader corporate effort. And the company is donating to local charities and NGOs to allow for direct support of those affected by the virus, including the frontline medical workers across the country. “The U.S. and India have a shared history of helping each other during times of crisis,” said Richard Verma, general counsel at Mastercard and former U.S. ambassador to India. “We’re hearing from our own teams the challenges that they and their families are facing. It’s critical that we stand by our friends and help those who have been impacted. Our commitment today and into the future is strong and enduring.” Prof. K. VijayRaghavan, Principal Scientific Adviser to Government of India added, \"The steep rise of Covid-19 cases poses an enormous challenge to clinical care facilities. Revamping existing hospital infrastructure by increasing the number of beds to accommodate more patients requiring critical care and procuring more equipment to enhance oxygenation for patients, is of utmost priority. We are grateful to the industry for their support to aid various State Governments’ critical care systems to boost their response to Covid-19. Mastercard and office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to Government of India have joined hands to provide 2,000 beds and purchase oxygen concentrators for hospitals in states that have been affected the most. There have been many such partnerships, many more such needed in the coming days. We hope to speedily facilitate them where there is most need.” Extended Support for Employees, Partners Mastercard has already committed to cover all vaccine-related costs for its India-based employees and immediate families, as doses are available. To help extend these efforts – and provide another outlet for its employees across the globe to help each other – Mastercard will also match employee donations to its Employee Assistance Fund, up to $15,000 per individual. This comes on top of a $500,000 corporate contribution to the fund. The company will continue to explore other opportunities to activate partnerships in India and across the global community – from the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum and U.S.-India Business Council to the Business Roundtable and the American India Foundation – to support these efforts.

As stores closed and social distancing took hold, retailers worldwide moved their businesses online, embraced e-commerce and explored the potential of new ways to pay. More than a year later, research from Mastercard shows that the adoption of new payment technologies is rising, and consumer appetite for new, fast and flexible digital experiences continues to grow. The Mastercard New Payments Index, conducted across 18 markets around the world, shows 93% of people will consider using at least one emerging payment method, such as cryptocurrency, biometrics, contactless, or QR code, in the next year. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (63%) agree they have tried a new payment method they would not have tried under normal circumstances, but the pandemic has galvanized people to try flexible new payment options to get what they want, when they want it. With this interest and consumer demand also comes a greater expectation for businesses to provide multiple ways to shop and pay. In fact, more than half of consumers say they would avoid businesses that do not accept electronic payments of any kind. “The pandemic made us think differently, partly out of necessity,” said Craig Vosburg, Chief Product Officer at Mastercard. “To deliver the choice and flexibility that consumers need – and increasingly expect –retailers worldwide need to offer a range of payment solutions that are easy to access and always on. As we look ahead, we need to continue to enable all choices, both in-store and online, to shape the fabric of commerce and make the digital economy work for everyone.” Contactless technology was the digital catalyst to explore new payment options because of its fast, secure and touch-free experience. Between the first quarter of 2020 and the same period in 2021, more than 100 markets saw contactless as a share of total in-person transactions grow by at least 50 percent. 3 A year into the COVID-19 pandemic, contactless is showing its staying power and dynamism – in the first quarter of 2021 alone, Mastercard saw 1 billion more contactless transactions as compared to the same period of 2020, with particular momentum in emerging contactless markets like the U.S. and Brazil, where contactless penetration in the two markets combined grew by nearly 3x year-over-year. 3 All signs point to a continued growth path for contactless, with nearly 7 in 10 consumers anticipating using a contactless card this year. Looking to the future, digital currencies, biometrics, contactless and QR codes are trending as emerging payments technologies as people’s comfort with them and understanding of them increases and the use of cash decreases. In fact, 71% of people say they expect to use cash less moving forward. The exploding interest in new payment technologies may encourage businesses to expand their options at checkout. The Mastercard New Payments Index found: Cryptocurrency1 Gains Ground, With Millennials Primed to Jump In – Today consumers can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency as a commodity or investment. Consumers are also increasingly showing interest in being able to spend crypto assets for everyday purchases. As global interest in cryptocurrencies as a payment method continues to accelerate, 4 in 10 people (40%) across North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific say they plan to use cryptocurrency in the next year. Millennials globally and those in the Middle East and Africa are especially engaged in the cryptocurrency conversation, with more than half (67%) agreeing they are more open to using cryptocurrency than they were a year ago. In addition, 77% of Millennials are interested in learning more about cryptocurrency, while 75% agree they would use cryptocurrency if they understood it better. While consumer interest in cryptocurrency - especially floating digital currencies such as Bitcoin - is high, work is still required to ensure consumer choice, protection, and their regulatory compliance. Biometric Payments Are More Trustworthy – Perceptions of safety and convenience have been front and center for people over the past year. More than half (53%) of consumers agree that biometric checkout is secure. In fact, 6 in 10 consumers say they are excited about the potential of biometric verification methods such as gait or walk assessments and fingerprint authorization (61%), and 60% feel safer using biometrics to verify a purchase than entering a pin. Gait or walk assessments can be used to pay based on a person’s manner of walking. QR Codes - A Cleaner and More Convenient Alternative to Cash in Developing Markets – While mature markets – like the U.S. – are focused on contactless payments, growing markets are leveraging QR-based options as a clean and convenient way to interact with merchants. In APAC, the majority of respondents perceive new payment methods like QR codes to be cleaner (76%) and more convenient (71%) than cash for in-person payments as it is likely consumers are using their own mobile device. 66% of respondents in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 63% in the Middle East and Africa expect to use more payment technologies like QR in the next year. To Meet People’s Demands, Businesses Forced to Jump into Emerging Payment Trends With consumer interest around new payment technologies, the expectation for businesses to adapt for the long-term is here to stay. Nearly eight in 10 respondents (79%) agree that they prefer to shop at stores that have both an in-person and online presence, and 68% noted being more excited to shop at retailers that can offer the latest payment methods. A recent study on 5,500 major Mastercard merchants, showed that between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, more than a fifth of these merchants globally increased the number of ways they connect with consumers either by enabling an e-commerce channel or accepting contactless transactions2. Over the same period, Mastercard saw the total number of card-not present transactions grow by over 30%.4 As one way to address this consumer preference for fast, touch-free payment experiences, many merchants are turning to contactless payments. Now, nearly 90% of in-person transactions globally take place at a contactless-enabled merchant, and nearly all merchant categories saw an increase in contactless transactions as a share of total in-person transactions year-over-year in the first quarter of 2021. 3 This behavior shift is reinforced by the desire for consumer choice – with 84% saying that they expect to make purchases when they want and how they want. The businesses that can provide multiple ways to shop and pay are best positioned to meet these expectations. As the demand for emerging payments and choice continues, it requires a wider range of payment solutions, insights, and products to meet the accelerating enthusiasm for the future state of pay.

U.S. retail sales excluding automotive and gasoline increased 23.3% year-over-year in April, and 10.8% compared to April 2019. Online sales in April grew 19.9% and 95.6%, respectively, compared to the same periods. Retail sales continue to benefit from stimulus payments, coupled with warmer weather and broader reopening across the country. While the recovery has not been universal or consistent – due to geographical, economic, and household differences – there are a number of key overarching trends. Restaurant Resurgence: April marks the second consecutive month of positive growth for the Restaurant category, underscoring that consumers have an appetite to eat out again. Spending at restaurants grew 118.8% vs. 2020, when widespread shut-downs crippled the industry, and were up 5.7% compared 2019. Limited-service Restaurants, such as fast-food, were up 21.7% compared to 2019, outpacing their Full-service counterparts (-13.5% YO2Y). Online Convenience: Despite the record shattering e-commerce growth in April 2020, online sales remained up year-over-year. E-commerce share continues to make up a bigger portion of total retail spend overall (21.6%), as well as in categories such as Apparel (61.7%), Department Stores (21.0%) and Jewelry (15.7%). Department Stores See a Boost: Many of the depressed sectors in 2020, including Department Stores (+202.7%), Jewelry (+255%) and Lodging (+319.1%), are showing some of the largest year-over-year gains as retailers gear up for the return of gatherings and events. Department Stores grew 9.6% compared to 2019. “April's retail sales growth reinforces that the American consumer is healthy and eager to spend, especially on categories such as restaurants, which have faced restrictions over the past year,” said Steve Sadove, Mastercard senior advisor and former CEO of Saks, Inc. “There are a lot of factors at play including stimulus funds, pent-up demand, and the desire to reconnect with friends and family. The fact is that people are excited to gather again and they're refreshing their look for the occasion.” *Overall retail sales excluding gasoline and automotive compared to April 2020 About Mastercard SpendingPulse Mastercard SpendingPulse™ reports on national retail sales across all payment types in select markets around the world.
