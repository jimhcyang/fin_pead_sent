    "text": "Micron Technology's memory demand destruction is well behind us, as the close partnership with NVDA and 6 hyperscalers drives its renewed growth opportunity. With an outsized FQ4'25 performance and promising FQ1 '26 guidance, I can understand why the consensus has drastically raised their estimates and FOMO traders have piled in. With MU also reporting demand recovery in the automotive and industrial end markets, we believe that the rally has been well deserved, albeit occurring rather fast/furiously.",
