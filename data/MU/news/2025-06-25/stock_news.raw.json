Bank Stress Tests 12:34 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The Fed is expected to release the results of this year&#8217;s financial institution stress tests in the coming days. The tests are designed to show how nearly two dozen major banks would hold up in the event of a financial meltdown, including the possibility of an economic recession. The Nasdaq Composite is now down 0.37%. Micron Tech in Focus 11:12 am by Gerelyn Terzo Micron Technology (Nasdaq: MU) is expected to report its Q3 earnings next week. The stock is down 1% today but has advanced approximately 40% year-to-date. The company is widely expected to continue to ride the AI profit wave higher. The markets have turned cautious, sending the Nasdaq Composite lower by 0.58%. Interest Rate Horizon 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo While Jerome Powell and the Fed left interest rates unchanged this time around, there could be good news for the markets on the horizon. Fed Governor Christopher Waller revealed that an interest rate cut could be on the horizon as soon as July amid a cooling inflationary economy. President Trump previously said that a rate cut would serve as &#8220;rocket fuel&#8221; for the markets. The Nasdaq Composite is now up 0.24%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. In a week filled with escalating Middle East tensions and a Fed meeting, the markets are attempting to finish on a positive note. President Trump has mentioned potential negotiations between Israel and Iran, giving traders and investors reason for optimism. All three major stock market averages opened higher, including a 0.56% gain in the Nasdaq Composite. Most sectors of the economy are gaining ground today, led by energy stocks amid a rising crude oil price amid the heightened Middle East tensions. Big Tech stocks are seeing green this morning. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is up 0.75%. The e-commerce giant is teaming up with SK Group to pour billions ($5 billion) into an AI-powered data center in South Korea. For those keeping score, Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is recouping some recent losses with a 2.5% jump today. The Nasdaq Composite is relatively flat over the past five trading sessions. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 217.19 (+0.54%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 128.41 (+0.66%) S&amp;P 500: Up 33.39 (+0.58%) Market Movers Professional services company Accenture (NYSE: ACN) is missing out on today&#8217;s gains, falling 8% after its quarterly results showed booking weakness. Accenture&#8217;s revenue surpassed estimates, but the markets are seeing the glass half empty. Carmax (NYSE: KMX) is up 2.7%. After reporting quarterly results, the stock is benefiting from rising demand for used vehicles, especially as the auto sector faces ongoing tariff pressures. Kroger (NYSE: KR) is up 5.6% today on the heels of its mixed Q1 earnings results. The post Live Nasdaq Composite: Markets Seek Optimistic Close to Whipsaw Week appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended So Close and Yet so Far 4:09 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices both crossed over into record territory during today&#8217;s trading session but they came off those lofty levels by the market closing. The Nasdaq Composite still closed up about 1% to 20,167.91 while the S&amp;P 500 index finished the day 0.80% higher at 6,141.02. Big Tech Downgrade 12:55 pm by Gerelyn Terzo While Tesla stock received a ringing endorsement from Wall Street analysts today, Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is seeing the other side of the spectrum. JPMorgan analysts lowered their price target on the iPhone maker to $230 from $240, keeping their &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the stock. The analysts are worried about demand for the iPhone 17. Apple shares are lower by 0.79% today. The Nasdaq Composite is now up 0.70%. Benchmark Bullish on TSLA 11:01 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street research firm Benchmark is bullish on EV leader Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). The firm believes TSLA stock has runway for 45% gains as a result of its competitive edge over rival robotaxi company Waymo. Benchmark lifted its price target on Tesla stock by a massive $125 to $450 per share. Tesla stock is up 0.39% today and is down 18.7% year-to-date. Wall Street Calls 10:00 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analysts are making some calls on the following stocks this morning: KeyBanc has started coverage of networking giant Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) with an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating, saying the stock has plenty of runway for growth. Baird analysts are bullish on health stock Haemonetics (NYSE: HAE), beginning coverage with an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating. UBS has reiterated its &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on Apple (Nasdaq: APPL) stock, citing risks surrounding a potential deal with AI giant Perplexity. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are showing off as stocks come within grasp of their latest all-time high levels. With the strikes between Israel and Iran seemingly behind, the markets have reason for optimism and they are taking it. All three of the major stock market averages are in the green out of the gate, including a 0.40% advance in the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite. The S&amp;P 500 is eyeing its latest all-time high of 2025, which is in the ballpark of 6,147, its early 2025 intraday high level. After Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) clinched a new record high of approximately $156 per share, bullish sentiment has enveloped technology stocks for the most part. On the economic front, the economy slowed at a steeper pace than originally expected in Q1 2025. U.S. GDP declined by 0.5% in Q1 compared to original estimates of a 0.2% contraction. As the data continues to flow in, the Commerce Department downwardly revised results in areas such as consumer spending and exports. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 121.40 (+0.37%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 87.92 (+0.40%) S&amp;P 500: Up 21.43 (+0.39%) Market Movers AeroVironment (Nasdaq: AVAV) is gaining 9.2% today, extending its rally after posting impressive Q4 results that were powered by robust military drone demand, fueling a 40% increase in revenue. BP (NYSE: BP) is under pressure today amid reports that it is a takeover target involving industry giant Shell, rumors BP rebuffed. Micron Technology (Nasdaq: MU) is down slightly on the heels of its strong Q3 results, including better-than-expected profits and a positive outlook for the current quarter.
