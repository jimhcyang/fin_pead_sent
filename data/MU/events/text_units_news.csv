Micron announced fiscal Q3 earnings on June 26, but guidance was in-line with consensus, questioning the rationale for explosive share growth in the past three months. My analysis shows HBM market to grow from 4% to 15% of global advanced semiconductor packaging market by 2028, with Micron gaining share. I expect Micron's HBM capacity to increase from 5.6% in Q1 2024 to 14.0% in Q4 2025, positioning the company as the fastest growing in the DRAM oligopoly."

Micron Technology, Inc.'s delivery of robust F3Q24 results were overshadowed by a weaker than expected guidance, underscoring limitations to its ability in matching resilient industry growth levels. A deeper dive into its revenue drivers during F3Q24 also shows emerging cracks in the durability of Micron's long-term growth trajectory, given extended capacity restraints and intensifying competition.

Micron's strong earnings and market reaction don't justify its valuation, with FCF annualized at sub 1%, making it a poor investment.

Micron stock is currently well-positioned for strong FY25 returns. Despite a high valuation, especially after sentiment improved following its strong Q4 report, this could be sustained for now. Toward the end of FY25, it is reasonable to expect downside volatility as a result of lower growth forecasts for FY26. Therefore, this is a substantial short-term opportunity. That being said, Micron is investing heavily in its long-term capacity with new fabs being built and an effort to compete in HBM4 with SK Hynix and Samsung."

Micron is seeing growth in the HBM market but management's market share outlook of ~20% has negatively surprised me; I expected it to be higher given Samsung's lagging position. I believe the main positive surprise in Q4 was better gross margins delivery due to cost savings in DRAM production and better HBM yields. This is expected to continue. Micron still trades at a modest 32% premium vs its memory peers. I am not sure if this is justified as I doubt overall outperformance vs its competition."

Micron Technology, Inc. stock is selling off after-hours, down more than 13%. Weak consumer demand and lower-than-expected NAND bit demand led to reduced guidance and CapEx cuts, despite strong HBM and enterprise SSD sales. Micron expects to return to growth in 2H2025, driven by AI accelerator demand and data center growth, and I think shares represent a buying opportunity."

Shares of Micron Technology, Inc. dipped ~15% after printing FQ1 results, owing to the market's perception of a weaker FQ2 outlook. The company notes that consumer end-markets are responding slower to AI innovation than initially expected, leading to softening NAND ASPs and a need to trim NAND capex. On the flip side, AI-fueled data center demand is surging, with data center revenue up 400% y/y in Q1."

Micron's Q1'25 earnings met estimates, but Q2'25 guidance fell short, leading to a -16% after-hours selloff; revenue guidance is $1B below consensus estimates. Capital investments are forecast to grow by 70% for FY25 driven by expanding DRAM & HBM capacity and new facility builds. Despite strong data center performance, the consumer market may not recovery as anticipated as a result of limited consumer discretionary spending."

Benzinga examined the prospects for many investors’ favorite stocks over the last week — here’s a look at some of our top stories. Major U.S. indexes ended the week higher, with the Dow up 0.4%, S&P 500 gaining 0.7%, and Nasdaq rising 0.8%, breaking a three-week decline streak. The S&P 500’s strong Christmas Eve performance fueled hopes for a “Santa Rally,” a historical trend showing gains 64 out of 96 years during December’s final week. Markets started recovering from the Fed’s hawkish rate cut signals but faced renewed volatility Friday, tempering Santa Rally expectations. Despite near-term uncertainty, 2024 remains exceptional, with the S&P 500 matching last year’s 24% gain and U.S. stocks outperforming global markets by the widest margin since 1997. Benzinga provides daily reports on the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week’s most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look. “AMD And Micron Are Top Analyst Picks For AI And Next-Gen Tech Growth,” by Anusuya Lahiri, highlights Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD being a top 2025 analyst’s pick for CPU/GPU momentum and AI edge opportunities, and Micron Technology, Inc. MU for its dominance in high-bandwidth memory. “Dogecoin Whales Load Up Coins Worth $92 Million Over 4 Days As Meme King Outperforms Bitcoin, Ethereum In 2024,” by Shivdeep Dhaliwal, reports that whale investors acquired 270 million Dogecoin DOGE/USD, worth $92 million, over four days, boosting DOGE's 274% YTD rally, far outpacing Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD gains of 132% and 53%, respectively. “Quantum Computing Stock QUBT Soars 157% While Bitcoin Drops Post Google's ‘Willow’ Reveal,” by Aniket Verma, highlights Quantum Computing Inc. QUBT surging after Google's “Willow” chip breakthrough, outperforming key indices, while Bitcoin faced a downturn amid concerns Willow’s quantum power could undermine cryptographic security.

Micron's Q2'25 earnings exceeded expectations due to strong demand for memory products, particularly HBM3E, and showed solid revenue growth in DRAM and NAND segments. The memory and storage company provided a positive outlook for Q3 with projected revenues of $8.8B, reflecting strong demand for memory, driven by Data Centers.

I believe the Micron Technology, Inc. post-earnings selloff was exaggerated, especially considering the strong momentum in HBM revenue growth and 2025 capacity is already sold out. I still don't see clear signs of demand recovery in the mobile and storage segments. That said, FQ3 guidance has priced in the current headwinds in these 2 segments. Speaking of headwinds, I think the trends in NAND pricing look pretty weak. The picture doesn't improve when factoring in rising inventories and ongoing margin pressure heading into FQ3."

Micron is turning production to HBM3E 12-high chips for Nvidia's GB300 GPU in 2h25 and anticipating significant revenue growth on a per-chip basis.

Micron's valuation might look overextended now, but it's still essentially fairly valued. This bull run isn't over, but this isn't a time when elite investors will be buying.

Micron Technology, Inc.'s premium window runs through FY2026. HBM contracts and tight supply lock in margins now, but these dynamics are temporary. By 2027, new fabs and aggressive competitor output will likely flood the market, driving down pricing power and moderating revenue growth. AI keeps troughs shallower, but memory remains cyclical.

Micron Technology, Inc. is one of the few companies walking the talk on AI, guiding for adjusted profit to almost double sequentially from $4.78 to $8.42 and $4-5B top-line upside in Q2. Everyone knows that MU is extremely well-positioned due to the memory-bound nature of AI build-out, but we don't think markets recognize that Micron has more leverage in the bank. Unlike Nvidia and Broadcom, Micron just reported a gross margin of 56.8%, up from 45.7% last quarter, and is guiding for 68% next quarter, with more growth expected in FY26."
