I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President, Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly Biomedicines; and Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes. We're also joined by Sara Smith and Lauren Durfy of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3. The additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2019, and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2019. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our 2020 results.",241.0,122.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.00819672131147541,0.0,0.040983606557377046,0.0,0.0,0.00819672131147541
LLY,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,2021-01-29,2021-01-29T09:00:00-05:00,0,2021-01-29,prepared,,Dave Ricks,"Thanks, Kevin. On our guidance call in December 2019, we provided a framework for how we are thinking about the 2020 to 2025 period, noting our expectations to continue to deliver top-tier revenue growth and operating margin growing into the mid-to high 30s while continuing to increase R&D productivity. As we met with investors throughout 2020, it was evident that while there was good insight into management's expectations for the next few years, investors were increasingly focused on our ability to grow in the second-half of this coming decade. In the past two months, we have begin – we have begun to deliver answers to that question, with positive data for LOXO-305, tirzepatide and donanemab, each with a chance to significantly improve patient outcomes in areas of high unmet medical need. We believe these are three of the most important and exciting pipeline assets in our industry and provide meaningful support for Lilly's growth potential beyond 2025. Together with Verzenio data in early breast cancer last summer, we have significantly reinforced our growth prospects for the midterm and upgraded them for the long-term. While these readouts drive incredible momentum for our future, I am also pleased with the way that we delivered in a complex and challenging 2020. Our 2020 revenue enabled us to exceed our midterm revenue goal of 7% CAGR from the years 2015 to 2020. Turning to the quarter. Revenue grew an impressive 22% versus Q4 2019, or 20% in constant currency. This strong performance was driven entirely by volume growth of 24 percentage points despite continued pricing headwinds and demand pressure from the effects of COVID-19. Excluding bamlanivimab, revenue grew over 7% for the quarter. Key growth products continue to drive this volume and our revenue, now representing 55% of our base business. We continue to advance our productivity agenda in Q4 as the combination of strong revenue growth and modest operating expense growth drove significant margin expansion. Our non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 33% with and without COVID-19 therapies, an improvement of roughly 650 basis points versus Q4 2019. With continued margin expansion for the quarter and full-year, excluding the impacts of COVID-19 on our business in 2020, we would have achieved our midterm operating margin as a percent of revenue goal of 31%. We're proud to have delivered nearly 1,000 basis points of operating margin expansion since 2016. In addition to the strong business performance, we achieved multiple pipeline milestones since our Q3 earnings call. These include the positive results I noted for LOXO-305, tirzepatide and donanemab; the FDA granting emergency use authorizations for bamlanivimab and baricitinib to help patients with COVID-19; the submission of empagliflozin for heart failure in people with reduced injection fraction in the U.S., Europe and Japan, this is done in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim; and the submission of Verzenio in early breast cancer in the U.S. During Q4, we put our growing operating cash flow to work, announcing a 5% increase in the dividend for the third consecutive year, as well as continuing to pursue external innovation to augment future growth prospects with the acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics. This acquisition adds a promising new modality for Lilly by creating a gene therapy program that will be anchored by Prevail's portfolio of clinical-stage and late-preclinical-stage gene therapies across Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia, ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. Moving to Slides 5 and 6. You'll see a list of key events since our last earnings call. In November, we announced that Arti Shaw, our Senior Vice President and Chief Information and Digital Officer, will retire in the first-half of this year after 27 years of service to Lilly. She's been an invaluable member of our Executive Committee and a leader who really models our values. In addition to leading the development of our digital information strategy, she has developed and mentored talent throughout the organization and demonstrated a deep care for the patients we aim to serve. I want to thank Arti for her many contributions to Lilly. And now, I'll turn the call over to Josh to review our Q4 and full-year results.",677.0,349.0,19.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.054441260744985676,0.008595988538681949,0.011461318051575931,0.0,0.0,0.045845272206303724
LLY,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,2021-01-29,2021-01-29T09:00:00-05:00,0,2021-01-29,prepared,,Josh Smiley,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Slide 7 summarizes our non-GAAP financial performance in Q4 and 2020. As Dave mentioned, revenue increased 22% this quarter compared to Q4 2019 and increased 7%, excluding bamlanivimab sales. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 130 basis points to 78.6%. Excluding the impact of bamlanivimab revenue and the related manufacturing costs, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 79.9%, in line with Q4 2019 performance. Moving down the P&L. Operating expenses grew 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were down 8% as reduced activity due to COVID-19 and productivity measures offset investments in key growth products. R&D expenses increased 16%, driven by investment in COVID-19 therapies. Net of COVID-19 expenses, baseline R&D was relatively flat, and total operating expenses decreased over 5% compared to Q4 2019. Operating income increased 53% compared to Q4 2019 as revenue growth far outpaced expense growth, resulting in operating income as a percent of revenue of 33% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 therapies, operating income grew 34% in the quarter and the operating margin for our base business was 32.7% for Q4. Other income and expense was income of $477 million this quarter compared to income of $206 million in Q4 2019, driven by investment gains on public equities. As we noted in our Q3 earnings call, beginning in 2021, we will exclude the gains or losses due to equity investments from our non-GAAP measures. We have posted a supplemental investor workbook for Q4 on that basis to enable you to have an apples-to-apples comparison as we move into 2021 and compare to 2020 non-GAAP performance. Our tax rate was 14.4%, an increase of 180 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by net discrete tax items in both quarters. At the bottom line, net income increased 58%, while earnings per share increased 59%. Net of COVID-19 therapies, net income and earnings per share increased 43%. Moving to Slide 8. You can see these same non-GAAP measures for the full-year. In spite of the ongoing demand impact from the pandemic, we grew the top line at 10% or 6%, excluding bamlanivimab. Excluding COVID-19 therapies, our operating margin expanded by 300 basis points contributing to 30% EPS growth while continuing to invest behind our newer products and pipeline. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. As mentioned earlier, worldwide revenue grew 20% in constant currency during Q4, driven by strong volume growth of 24%, partially offset by price. Foreign exchange had a modest impact on revenue growth. U.S. revenue grew 31% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and 7%, excluding bamlanivimab. For the base business, volume growth of 11% was led by Trulicity, Taltz and Verzenio. Pricing was a 5% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter driven primarily by increased rates to maintain excellent access, partially offset by modest list price increases, largely for diabetes, and to a lesser extent, by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts for Taltz, which was driven by the access win at ESI. Segment mix was not a major driver of U.S. price performance in the fourth quarter as increased utilization in more highly rebated government segments was offset by lower utilization in the 340B segment primarily for Trulicity and Humalog. Like Q4, the full impact of price was also a headwind of 5%, consistent with our 2020 expectations for a mid-single-digit net price decline in the U.S. While the midterm price trends are stable at present, given the increasing variability in payer mix, we expect to see quarterly variability in our U.S. price impact during the course of 2021. Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 12% in constant currency driven by 9% volume growth and a favorable impact from price. Volume growth was led by Alimta, Trulicity and Taltz. We're pleased with the continued uptake of our key growth products across Europe and are looking forward to continued strong growth in 2021. In Japan, revenue decreased 10% in constant currency driven primarily by decreased volume in post-patent expiry products, Cialis and Forteo, as well as by a modest pricing headwind due to the government-mandated price decreases that went into effect in March 2020. Japan is experiencing the impact of countercyclical patent expiries with Cialis, Strattera and Cymbalta LOEs impacting growth in 2020 and likely in 2021. In China, revenue grew 31% in constant currency driven by 57% volume growth driven by Tyvyt and partially offset by pricing concessions for the government-sponsored programs, which drove Tyvyt significant volume growth. We are excited about the momentum of our China oncology business, and we are looking forward to continued growth for Tyvyt and the launch uptake for Verzenio. We're also pleased that Trulicity and Olumiant were added to the NRDL as of January 2021. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 6% in constant currency driven by strong volume from Trulicity and Olumiant as well as three percentage points of growth coming from bamlanivimab sales to Canada. The same information for our full year revenue is at the bottom of the slide. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive impressive volume growth. These newer medicines delivered nearly 14 percentage points of growth this quarter, with bamlanivimab also contributing roughly 14 percentage points of growth. The strong volume growth in our key products was partially offset by post-LOE products as well as by reduced Trajenta royalties from the restructuring of our alliance with Boehring Ingelheim. This impact will sunset as we move into 2021. Slide 11 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated over $3.6 billion in revenue this quarter, making up 55% of our base revenue. Amidst the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic, we are encouraged by the performance of our key growth products in 2020. Trulicity grew 23%, adding nearly $1 billion last year to finish with over $5 billion in revenue while outgrowing the GLP-1 injectable class in revenue while outgrowing the GLP-1 injectable class in the U.S. and exiting 2020 with a nearly 47% share of total prescriptions amidst the reacceleration of growth for injectable GLP-1s. Taltz grew 31% to nearly $1.8 billion in revenue, outgrowing the U.S. market in both dermatology and rheumatology and entering 2021 with best-in-class access that provides a strong foundation for long-term growth. Jardiance crossed $1 billion in sales for Lilly's share revenue in 2020, ending the year at nearly 60% of total SGLT2 prescriptions in the U.S. and driving encouraging growth for the class, as we look forward to the regulatory action for FrEF and the readout for HFrEF this year. And Verzenio revenue grew nearly 60% in 2020 to over $900 million, significantly outgrowing the CDK 4/6 class growing six percentage points in total prescriptions while nearly doubling new-to-brand share of market on the heels of positive data readouts for overall survival in metastatic breast cancer in 2019 and early breast cancer in 2020. Our key growth products will continue to drive Lilly's strong growth outlook in 2021. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2020, we invested over $8 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after-tax investment in R&D. In addition, we returned approximately $3.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. As mentioned earlier, we also announced a 15% dividend increase for the third consecutive year, demonstrating our confidence in the outlook for the Company. We are focused on utilizing the strong cash flow our through both internal and external sources, as highlighted by the recently completed acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics. We will remain active in assessing bolt-on acquisitions or in-licensing, where we can create shareholder value and enhance our future growth prospects. Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on Slide 13. We are affirming our non-GAAP guidance, and we've updated our GAAP guidance to reflect the impact of the Precision Biosciences, Merus and Asahi Kasei agreements, which with reported earnings per share for 2021, now expected to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.75. The impact of the recently completed acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics will be updated on our next quarterly call and will only impact Lilly's GAAP guidance for 2021. There will be no change to our 2021 guidance for R&D expense or non-GAAP EPS as a result of this transaction. As we move into this New Year, and as we noted on our guidance call, we continue to experience suppressed demand due to the pandemic with several key therapeutic classes still below our pre-COVID baseline. We remain committed to ensuring we are doing our part to limit COVID-19 exposure for physicians, patients and our employees as cases surge in the U.S. and around the world. At present, most of our HCP interactions in the U.S. and many other major markets are virtual. While this may have a near-term impact on new-to-brand performance, we continue to believe our approach is the appropriate posture as we support health care professionals navigating the ongoing pandemic and driving broad vaccination to enable a return to normalcy for health care systems in the second half of the year. In addition, our year-end 2020 inventory build was approximately a $120 million higher than Q4 2019, which was driven by 2019 having a lower-than-typical year-end stocking. This primarily impacts our diabetes products as well as Taltz and Alimta. We anticipate this inventory will burn off in Q1 2021 like normal historical patterns. As I noted on our guidance call, we also experienced significant COVID-19-related stocking benefit of roughly $250 million in Q1 2020. Given those divergent year-over-year inventory trends, we expect inventory patterns will have a negative impact on revenue growth and operating margin expansion in the first quarter of 2021. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our full year outlook for 2021 and have increased confidence in our mid- and long-term outlook given our recent high-quality pipeline readouts. So, now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.",1646.0,877.0,29.0,8.0,17.0,1.0,3.0,10.0,8.0,4.0,0.0330672748004561,0.009122006841505131,0.019384264538198404,0.0011402508551881414,0.0034207525655644243,0.02394526795895097
LLY,2021-01-29,2021-01-29,,2021-01-29,2021-01-29T09:00:00-05:00,0,2021-01-29,prepared,,Dr. Dan Skovronsky,"Thanks, Josh. We had an exciting start to 2021 as we read out positive results for gentimab in the Phase 2 Trailblazer Al study. Lilly has spent more than 30 years dedicated to finding solutions for Alzheimer's disease, and we are proud of our progress in advancing the science and providing hope for patients and their families suffering from this devastating disease. On Slide 14, you can see our key takeaways from this exciting trial. We are encouraged by the strong efficacy results, where in a relatively small study, we overcame the scale of the study with precision on patient enrollment and a very potent and effective plaque-clearing drug, becoming the first-ever disease modification study to hit statistical significance on its primary endpoint, with a slowing of decline by 32% relative to placebo as measured by the integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale. ADAS is a clinical composite tool, combining two well-accepted measures in Alzheimer's disease: ADAS-Cog 13 for cognition; and ADCS IADL, Instrumental Activities of Data Living, for function. While the study was not powered for assessing multiple endpoints, we're very encouraged by the consistent improvements observed on all pre-specified secondary endpoints for cognition and function compared to placebo though ganitumab did not reach statistical significance on every secondary endpoint. The consistency across time points and across statistical methods was very encouraging, particularly the disease progression model, which is becoming more accepted by the scientific community. In addition, we saw rapid and deep amyloid plaque clearance for ganitumab-treated patients who, on average, showed an 84 centiloid reduction of amyloid plaque at 76 weeks compared to a baseline of 108 centiloids. Since below 25 centiloids is a negative amyloid scan, this means that the average ganitumab-treated patient had a negative scan by the end of the study. Finally, the safety profile was consistent with observations from Phase 1. Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities or ARIA were observed, which is consistent with plaque-clearing antibodies. In the ganitumab treatment Group, ARIA E occurred in 27% of treated participants with an overall incidence of 6% of patients experiencing symptomatic ARIA E. We look forward to sharing the full results of Trailblazer AS at the ADPD 2021 virtual meeting on March 13, and we plan to have an investor call at 11 a.m. on March 15. We hope to reproduce and extend these exciting findings in our second pivotal donanemab trial, TRAILBLAZER ALS 2, an 18-month study which began enrolling patients last year. At present, the study is expected to complete enrollment later this year with nearly twice as many patients as the first TRAILBLAZER trial. We'll be engaging regulators to finalize the patient numbers and statistical plans for TRAILBLAZER 2, and we hope the exciting results from TRAILBLAZER 1 will increase patient interest and expedite enrollment. TRAILBLAZER 2 was designed last year prior to TRAILBLAZER 1 data. And while the design is similar, at that time, we incorporated a few differences, including CDR sum of the boxes was moved to the primary endpoint for this larger trial, while ADAS becomes a key secondary endpoint. We added a high tau group and we include a blood-based screening for enrollment using the P-tau biomarker. We look forward to sharing the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ data and discussing next step for ganitumab with regulators. Moving to Slide 15. As we discussed in-depth on Tuesday's call, there've been a number of developments for our COVID-19 antibodies since our last earnings call, which I will highlight only briefly now. In November, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for bamlanivimab as a treatment for COVID-19. We also submitted a request for EUA for bamlanivimab and antisemab together, which remain under review based on Phase 2 data from the BLAZE 1 trial. Since the EUA for bamlanivimab, we've shipped approximately 1 million doses. We will have over 1 million additional doses available through mid-2021 for use around the world. This week, the U.S. government committed to purchase 500,000 of those additional doses by the end of March. Should any EUA be granted for bamlanivimab and etesevimab together, we expect to be able to supply in collaboration with Amgen up to 1 million doses of antisemab for administration with bamlanivimab together by mid-2021, with 250,000 doses available already in the first quarter this year. In just the past eight days, we've shared Phase 3 data from the BLAZE 2 prevention trial where bamlanivimab showed up to an 80% reduction of risk of COVID-19 for nursing home residents; Phase 3 data from the BLAZE 1 trial for eisemanab together with bamlanivimab, which showed a 70% reduction in hospitalization or death among high-risk COVID-19 patients, providing further support for the EUA request for their joint administration. Importantly, there were no COVID-19-related deaths in the antibody treatment arms from these two pivotal data sets. After having seen these results, Lilly has decided we will no longer conduct placebo-controlled studies in high-risk patients. Initial results from the ongoing BLAZE 4 Phase 2 trial provide viral load and PK/PD data, which demonstrated that lower doses, including bamlanivimab 700 milligrams and tiseramab 1,400 milligrams together, are similar to the 2,800 milligram doses of those antibodies administered together. We expanded the BLAZE 4 trial to also evaluate the administration of bamlanivimab AB with VER-7831 in collaboration with Vier and GSK, reinforcing our commitment to collaborate across the industry to treat current and future strains of COVID-19. And yesterday, we received authorization from the FDA to update preparation and administration instructions in response to feedback from frontline nurses and doctors to enable flexibility, which can reduce infusion times considerably. These updates can shorten infusion times to as little as 16 minutes. We're pleased with the potential impact our neutralizing antibodies can have, and we're working diligently to make them available to patients around the world. While the exciting progress with donanemab and the COVID-19-neutralizing antibodies has dominated Lilly's news in the past few weeks, we have continued to robustly advance the rest of our pipeline. Slide 16 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 27. Positive movement since our last earnings call includes the submissions Dave noted for Jardiance and Verzenio, the submission of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19 in Japan, the initiation of a Phase 3 trial for empagliflozin in post-myocardial infarction patients. The movement of two pain assets into Phase 2 and the introduction of eight new Phase 1 assets, including our first clinical assets from two new modalities for Lilly: the siRNA molecule, ANGPTL3 from our collaboration with Dicerna and two gene therapy molecules from Prevail. In fact, we ended 2020 with a total of 17 new Phase 1 starts for the year, surpassing 2019's total of 16 first human doses, which was the highest number of new clinical starts for Lilly in a decade. Considering the significant challenges we faced in 2020, including temporarily stopping the initiation of new clinical studies, this is a remarkable achievement. It speaks to the resilience and determination of our R&D organization during challenging times. Moving to Slide 17. We show a final tally of how we finish 2020 versus the key events that we expected to occur. Since our guidance call in mid-December, we had submissions for selpercatinib for non-small cell lung cancer in Japan, Jardiance for heart failure for reduced ejection fraction in the United States and Verzenio for early breast cancer in the United States. The sea of blue checkmarks emphasizes the sheer quantity of pipeline advancements in 2020. However, my take away from the year past is that I'm delighted with the quality represented here, including potentially practice-changing data for type 2 diabetes, for hematologic tumors; for early breast cancer, the launch of a first-in-class RET inhibitor; as well as the emergency use authorizations for two medicines to help address the COVID-19 pandemic. We're proud of the significant achievements delivered in 2020. As we transition into 2021, I'd like to note that Josh Bilenker will be leaving his position as CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly to explore other interests and endeavors. We're grateful to Josh for his contributions to human health, both at Loxo and in his time with Lilly. We look forward to working with him in a consulting role. I'm very pleased to announce that Jacob Bernardin is assuming the CEO role, continuing to work alongside Nisha Nanda and David Heyman, ensuring leadership continuity in maintaining the strategy and operating model for Loxo Oncology at Lilly. Jake is a very highly talented leader, and this move allows him to continue to grow his responsibilities for the benefit of Lilly and Loxo. Moving to Slide 18. You can see the expected events for 2021, including the donanemab data and upcoming disclosure I previously mentioned. A number of other major readouts are expected this year, including the remainder of the tirzepatide Phase 3 program, where we are looking forward to building on the SURPASS 1 data we disclosed late last year. The Phase 2 readout for zagotenemab, our anti-tau antibody for early Alzheimer's, in a trial similar in design to the TRAILBLAZER trial that just read out; several to the TRAILBLAZER trial that just read out; several to the TRAILBLAZER trial that just read out; several potential Phase 3 readouts in immunology; and the results of empagliflozin for HFrEF. Based on the recent high-quality pipeline data readouts for ganitumab, tirzepatide and LOXO-305, we entered 2021 optimistic by the impact these assets could have on patients. And we're focused on discovering and developing more new medicines to help patients. Now I turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks.",1574.0,804.0,34.0,15.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.04228855721393035,0.018656716417910446,0.008706467661691543,0.0024875621890547263,0.0024875621890547263,0.0236318407960199

Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we made in 2020. 2020 was a remarkable year as Lilly worked to fulfill its purpose in new and important ways. In addition to many contributions in the fight against the global pandemic, our business grew 10% in 2020 driven by strong volume growth from our key growth products launched since 2014. These products now account for more than half of our revenue for the first time. We continued our productivity journey, delivering nearly 300 basis points of operating margin expansion for our base business. We made significant progress on our innovation based strategy, with LOXO-305, tirzepatide and Verzenio early breast cancer readouts, delivering potential category-changing data. While January's donanemab top line success was a first in Alzheimer's. With EUAs for bamlanivimab and Olumiant to combat COVID-19 and bolt-on acquisitions of Dermira and Prevail book ending the year, the past 12 months have been an exceptional example of Lilly's success in leveraging internal and external innovation. We returned nearly $3.2 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase, and we will have another meaningful dividend increase, which we announced in December, reflecting significant confidence in the ongoing strength of our business.

I think when we look across our therapeutic areas, it's relatively consistent at this point that we're still not quite back to new to grand prescriptions in key areas, like immunology, pain and diabetes, although the diabetes numbers are looking stronger as we get here into January, but I think we're still seeing some suppressed demand. Physicians have, I think, in most markets has figured out how to see patients safely, and we're seeing nothing like what we saw back in April and May in the U.S. So, I think we just have to be cautious as we get into the first quarter and realize that the more complex treatments have some higher degree of variability against them and that includes starting new patients in areas like migraine. I think maintenance has been good throughout the pandemic. So, we do expect it, as we get through the first-half of this year, we'll see returned to fully normal levels.

Look, we - in general, we don't disclose our back and forth with FDA or other regulators. In this case, of course, we said that next steps are discussions with regulators. So clearly, that hasn't happened yet. Still, we understand the regulatory threshold traditionally has been adequate and well controlled trial that means more than one trial. In this case, we have a single adequate and well controlled trial in Alzheimer's disease. That, as I said, has not been the standard in this area. Of course, in other disease areas, notably in oncology, drugs can be approved from a single trial, usually, that's an accelerated approval. Usually, it's a group that's well defined by pathologic characteristics and biomarkers. Usually, there's dramatic pathologic response as well as clinical outcomes. Of course, that's also true in the case of this donanemab trial, but again, oncology is quite different than Alzheimer's disease. Your second question was on the question of toxic oligomers. It's long been unclear what is the toxic species of a beta, is it monomers? is it oligomers? Is it plaques? This antibody was designed to be exquisitely specific for amyloid plaques. We don't think it binds oligomers. And thereby, the efficacy – therefore, the efficacy we see here seems to imply that it's the plaques that are the toxic species rather than the like oligomers. However, we can't rule out that these two things are in equilibrium with each other and perhaps by clearing plaques, you remove oligomers as well.",280.0,123.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.032520325203252036,0.032520325203252036,0.024390243902439025,0.0,-0.032520325203252036

Dan, in the prior studies, the IADRS DAS endpoint, the composite they use in donanemab, it didn't correlate very well with CDR sum of the boxes. But I did find it interesting that the most recent EXPEDITION3 trial for solanezumab did have high concordance between this new composite versus CDR sum of the boxes. I guess what I'm wondering is how should we be thinking about whether IADRS versus CDR sum of the boxes correlate closely or not? Or is it more a function of the more recent trials where CDR does, in fact, correlate very closely with IADRS? I'm thinking about that heading into your donanemab trial. The other one I had is, you have this tau antibody Phase 3 coming up this year. Maybe if you could remind us how's this tau-mab similar or different than some of the other ones because the progress on this target has not been quite good to date.

Look, when we think about an endpoint for any clinical trial, there's really two things that make an endpoint, a good endpoint. One is the statistical validation behind it. So in other words, is it reliable across different patients across different time points, across different trials, we put together a lot of data that support that. Second, is it meaningful for patients? And in this course - case, of course, we believe that that's inherently true. This is a composite of two things that are widely used, both thought to be important and meaningful ADAS-Cog and activities of daily living, obviously, activities of daily living inherently meaningful for patients. Now, why do we pick IADRS versus CDR to be the primary outcome of the study? That should be obvious, it's because we believe that IADRS would be more sensitive for measuring decline and therefore more sensitive for measuring a drug effect. That's based on all of that statistical validation data that we did. If ADAS and some of the boxes were perfectly well correlated then ADAS couldn't be better, couldn't be more powerful. And yet, I'm telling you that our assumption going into this trial was that it would be. So of course, different outcomes will have some correlation, but they won't be perfectly correlated. Based on what we saw in this trial, I think we haven't changed our thinking on outcomes, and we still think ADAS is a very valid and important outcome for Alzheimer's trials. Of course, that's a discussion to be had with regulators in the scientific community. With the zagotenemab, this is our anti-tau antibody. Just as donanemab was a different type of anti-amyloid beta based on its specificity for plaque, zagotenemab is a different kind of anti-tau antibody. It's highly specific for aggregated tau. Now, we think that's particularly important in the case of tau because there's a lot of soluble monomeric tau, and tau antibodies, like any other antibody, not much of it gets in the brain. So if you have a lot of monomer and a little bit of antibody, it could sop up all of your antibody and not have left to go after what we think is the more important species, aggregated tau. So, we'll have to wait and see. Of course, this is a field that is younger than anti-amyloid therapies, but we've taken a lot of things we learned from anti-amyloid, applied them to anti-tau, and we're quite looking forward to getting that data later this year.",455.0,197.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.02030456852791878,0.01015228426395939,0.02030456852791878,0.005076142131979695,0.0,0.01015228426395939

A notable feature of the TRAILBLAZER trial is that we excluded patients who had too much tau in their brain. We believe that people who have the highest tau or it's spread throughout their brain are past the point of no return at least for an amyloid-directed therapy. Of course, as we fully analyze this data, and hopefully, even in time for the upcoming presentation, we'll understand what we're seeing in this current data set with respect to baseline tau levels predicting response to therapy, as we see that, that could lead us to be either more excited or less excited about including high-tau patients in TRAILBLAZER 2 study. And so that is something that is still very much open. As we see that data and understand it, we could think about changing the design there. In terms of the percent of patients that are impacted here, it sort of depends on how you cut it. If you start with all of the early Alzheimer's patients, plus -- mild AD plus MCI, that's about 4.5 million in the U.S. and double that in Europe and Japan combined. Many of those patients with amyloid negative. We've shown that before. So you take about one-third out for that. A small fraction of them will be amyloid positive but no tau at all. We didn't include those patients. And then a slightly larger fraction will be in that tau high group. So once you've excluded all those patients, we've said it's sort of 30% to 45% of that mild AD to MCI population that would meet these enrollment criteria in TRAILBLAZER 1.",290.0,126.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.031746031746031744,0.023809523809523808,0.03968253968253968,0.0,0.007936507936507936,0.007936507936507936

Of course, the change we made was to go back to the legislated intent and to provide the discounts to the actual hospitals that provide care and to exclude contract pharmacy that have grown overtime And when we look at that business, it's probably about half of the businesses in these contracted pharmacy. So that's where we've made the change, to not provide the pricing there. Now, we do have a process where those contracted pharmacy can apply and we've said for insolence, as long as they can demonstrate that they're passing on the entire pricing that they're still eligible to participate. When we look at all that together, we knew that that's where we implemented in September. We knew there would be challenges, and we're seeing those challenges come, but I think in terms of patient impacts, we haven't seen much yet. So, we're seeing the fact that the discounts are being provided as per our change, but we don't think it's impacting patient care at this point. So everything we're seeing so far is consistent with the decision we made. We knew it would be a difficult decision to implement. We knew there would be some customer concerns.

We said before that TRAILBLAZER 1, we carried this study out with the quality that we typically use for regulatory pivotal studies, fully blinded, double-blinded study. You raised the possibility that there could be some unintentional unblinding as a result of amyloid clearance. We don't see that that's possible. Patients don't know or feel the clearance of amyloid in their brain directly. And investigators wouldn't have seen that the results of the PET scan themselves. The other potential in any Alzheimer's study for in over blinding is ARIA E because sometimes that is something that can cause a side effect. And we commented on the 6% of patients that had symptomatic ARIA E or so. I think that's certainly an important analysis, I think, in every study in Alzheimer's disease is to look at the drug effect with and without ARIA patients. And certainly, that's something that we hope to have complete and be able to share in March. And then finally, you asked about the behavior of the placebo arm. That's a great question. Really, when we saw this data that was the first thing I wanted to look at. Sometimes, you have small studies that look promising. It's because your placebo arm did worse than typical. And here, we said -- we've communicated a high level of confidence and encouragement based on the data. So that excludes that possibility. This placebo arm is not behaving aberrantly. That's not what's driving the effect. Again, we'll get into the details of that in March, but very, very pleased with the performance of the placebo arm here.",294.0,123.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.032520325203252036,0.04878048780487805,0.008130081300813009,0.0,-0.008130081300813009

So as you noted, 2020 was really another year of very positive and clinically 2020 was really another year of very positive and clinically meaningful data for Verzenio. And then our shares, as a result, I think, continue to improve. While obviously, no CDK is yet approved in the EVC setting, we do think that this readout is particularly drew attention to the market class. So that said, we're really confident that the current trends are a result of our strong execution and our focus on NBC and then the -- particularly logistically significant OS data, which a key competitor in the space didn't have. As we compare Q4 '19 to Q4 '20, it was really a remarkable period of growth, as you said, for Verzenio. We saw TRx increase of 6% worldwide revenue growth of 57% and U.S. growth of 36%. And what we're hearing pretty repeatedly now from thought leaders is that they're seeing more and more that Verzenio is a differentiated agent. So obviously, we've shared that in MEMS, we feel we have higher CDK4 activity than -- versus others, differentiated continuous dosing, a monotherapy indication, and then obviously, the data that we saw in MONARCH 2 with the primary endocrine-resistant population. So I think all of that is really playing into the growth that we're seeing in the MVC market. And so, we'll expect to continue to see our growth -- our share market grow in that space. On the adjuvant side, as Dave and others mentioned, we did submit to the FDA in other areas at the end of last year. So we look forward to regulatory action later this year. This market size is significant in the fact that it's probably an additional 50% if you match our entry criteria, 50% increase to our current metastatic market in this high-risk adjuvant population. So that's significant. And what's also significant is the duration of treatment will very likely will be longer than a metastatic setting. So patients in the study are treated for 24 months. And right now, we're seeing patients stay on for months on average in the study. And many of the patients are still on study, so I think that number will continue to get longer. So that duration of treatment offers upside as well. But we're incredibly excited about the data. We're looking forward to bringing it to patients as soon as possible.

On the issue of whether potentially donanemab could be submitted on the back of the Phase 2 data set that you have. Could you talk to your level of preparedness, particularly manufacturing, given the anticipated demand, but also to the P tau blood test that will potentially be used to define the patients? I'm just trying to understand where you at because there is a scenario by which you could be on the market sooner than perhaps that many may believe. And that's an open observation rather than reflecting any particularly personal view. And then second for Anne, could you talk to your BTK inhibitor 305? I know you're hiring medical liaisons already, which in hematology would suggest that you're optimistic about being able to file in the second half. From your understanding of the community nature of practice for CLL, given the very high tolerability of the drug and the strong efficacy even without a randomized trial, do you believe that this drug could take significant market share in the first BTK refractory or intolerant setting?

We actually initiated manufacturing preparedness before we had this data. So, this is something we do at Lilly. We always prepare for success. And so at the same time, that our manufacturing colleagues we're ramping up the anti-COVID antibodies, we asked them to also prepare for donanemab. So that is well underway, and I like what's going on, the progress we're making in manufacturing there. The diagnostic ecosystem also needs work. We started that both ramping up imaging and proceeding along with opportunities to bring the phospho-TAL blood test to more patients. That's both underway, again, started before we had this data and then, of course, is useful whether we're successful in coming to market or whether any other anti-amyloid drug comes to market.

So with the MSL population, it's important to remember, this arm of our company talks about the work that's going on in our -- across our portfolio. So this is not just related to 305, but we have other assets in the portfolio that may be heading in this space. So I wouldn't read too much into that, its normal operations to make sure that we're covering the portfolio. But obviously, they do get many questions about 305, the excitement that's out there in treating physicians. And importantly, we have a number of large Phase 3 trials that are starting as well. And as you know, that field force helps us identify high-quality rates to include in those programs. As far as CLL, obviously, the story there is incredibly exciting, and we do think that we have a real contender here. Particularly what we're interested in seeing is what has been seen in the past, certainly in the area of oncology, is that drugs that have a meaningful treatment effect on the same target pathway in patients who have relapsed tend to have sometimes an even more pronounced effect in that first-line setting. And so that's the upside here that is the potential for LOXO-305 is that first-line setting. So this year, we're actually planning to initiate, as you know, four global clinical studies, and three of them are in CLL. And obviously, two of them are in the BTK-pretreated patients, but one is in that really in a head-to-head setting and looking at head-to-head with ibrutinib in CLL. And obviously, this is a riskier study to do. We still feel very confident in the later-line setting, but we do have a belief that this molecule has a lot of potential in the first line, but hence, doing the trials. So obviously, as I said earlier, I can't comment on the regulatory likelihood. Those are ongoing conversations with the FDA. But regardless, we know that in this space, you need randomized clinical trials to really reach the patients that we wish to reach. And so that's -- the intention is to do those trials regardless.",375.0,156.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.02564102564102564,0.019230769230769232,0.03205128205128205,0.00641025641025641,0.0,0.00641025641025641

And I think that was even from before this latest data set.

I mean we've -- since the beginning, we've been working with health care systems and physicians across the country to enable uptake of the antibodies. I guess it's, in some ways, a test of what happens when you don't have the normal commercial preparation and rollout. This was done via government channels under an EUA. And you see big differences in adoption rates, and I highlighted that it seems to be an inverse relationship between the places you think about advanced medicine and who's actually using this. One of those barriers clearly is conviction on the data. So, I'm really pleased with the data we announced in the last week, and I think it will, has to, increase conviction. And this is also -- there's a class effect here, too. And the fact that other antibodies are demonstrating promise in different settings adds to that data and I think will build confidence. So hopefully, that will change. There's two endorsements as well we hope will change: one is NIH, the other is the Infectious Disease Society. That said, there's tons of practical problems with at scale, infusing people with COVID-19 that have been completely worked out by numerous health systems and not worked out by many, many others. So we work quite a bit with state departments of health, et cetera, to share those practices. The best practice is chart flagging upon positive COVID-19 for at-risk patients, scheduling of appointments, dedicated facilities and staff for high-throughput antibody administration. Where that's happening, they're using a lot of material. And you can almost see actually a reduction in health care utilization. So we're actually running an experiment like that in New Mexico to actually prove it as well as with UnitedHealthcare. But I'm optimistic that we'll see the rate of use grow. It moved from about 20% in December to about double that now.

So what we've said for this year is guidance range for COVID antibodies is $1 billion to $2 billion. And of course, there's a lot of uncertainty in that. Although with what we've announced this morning on the call, the next agreement that we've signed with the U.S. government, it's probably high probability for $1 billion in the first quarter. That's just the purchase agreements that we already have. I think then to get past that, we have -- based on what we've already committed to in terms of manufacturing, probably about another 500,000 banliminivab doses available in the first half of the year in monotherapy and one million combo. So if we sold all of that and it's weighted heavily towards the U.S. or high-income countries, you could get above $2 billion. But we don't have an EUA with the U.S. government or any other government for the combo yet, and there's a lot to still play out, I think, in terms of vaccine and where these products can be utilized. If we get into the second half of the year, I think we can continue at the pace of production of million-plus doses available per quarter. I don't think the manufacturing piece is going to be as much of a barrier in the second half of the year if we stay on the course of vaccines and otherwise. So clearly, we could be above $2 billion for the year.

So on donanemab, I guess the bar that you can see from the FDA is one kind of well internally correlated trial and data support elsewhere. When you look at your program, it looks like the support you could provide is from removal of plaque from earlier trials. And I guess the question for you is, is the understanding that plaque removal is related to clinical benefits solid enough that you can use that as early approval based elsewhere? As for a non-donanemab question, I was going to go back to the 340B prices. The signs are increasing from data there might be an action on this issue before the end of 2021.

It's a really good question that you're asking, which is how strong is the biomarker evidence here? And how can that be used to support regulatory decisions? I certainly think that's the direction the field is going. So in other words, when I look across all of the trials that have read out, again, this is the first plaque removing antibody that has had a positive study that hit its primary endpoint on the pre-specified statistical analysis. But even the other ones that didn't do that, when you look across the totality of evidence, you get a sense that there's a correlation between plaque removal in general and better cognitive performance. Here, we have probably the most significant plaque removal, the fastest, deepest plaque removal and a very meaningful clinical effect. So it's another point in this sort of dose response curve comparing amyloid plaque removal and cognitive changes across different trials. As that gets filled out further and further by additional experiments, I think amyloid plaque removal could someday become an important surrogate that could aid in the regulatory approval of drugs. Are we there today? I don't know.

Of course, the placebo effect getting stronger in second trials is something that's been seen a lot in psychiatry and sometimes in pain studies. As you pointed out, I'm not sure it's such a strong effect in Alzheimer's disease. One thing that encourages us here and I think would allow us to see a strong signal even if there is some of that here, is -- maybe two things that encourage us. First is the magnitude of the effect that we're seeing overall, which, as I said, hits test given in the small trial and TRAILBLAZER 2 is much bigger. Second is the consistency across endpoints and time points and statistical methods. That gives us additional confidence as well.

So on combination of purchase for Alzheimer's, I do think that's what the future holds. One of the really neat things about donanemab is that we just treat until amyloid plaques are removed. This is not a drug that we anticipate patients will be taking for the rest of their lives. Once they're clear of amyloid plaques, we stop treatment with this drug. We know from prior data that plaques don't come back. So you can imagine clearing a patient amyloid plaques and then treating them with another mechanism. That could be complementary, for example, in anti-tau drug or an immunomodulatory drug for Alzheimer's disease. So that's certainly something that we're considering and quite likely will pursue in the future. Thanks for noting momentum in the pain space. This is an area that is just so underserved by the pharmaceutical industry. I think there's a variety of reasons including regulatory thresholds, that have held back investment in an area that represents one of the greatest unmet medical needs. This is why patients -- number one reason why patients see doctors because they're in pain. And we know the drawbacks to current therapies. So we designed a platform pain study, which actually tests -- can test multiple molecules against multiple indications, And we can keep funneling molecules in and get results out. Depending on the strength of the efficacy here, that will inform next steps, but we're confident that this study is well designed to whether we have meaningful treatment effects or not. Of course, a holdback in pain, as I said before, is the regulatory bar, which is heavily weighted towards safety. And typically, that takes a large number of patients to discharge. Certainly, tanezumab, a perfect example of that with so many patients studied and a well-understood signal here on both efficacy and potential safety that needs to be resolved for the FDA.",330.0,164.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.03048780487804878,0.018292682926829267,0.018292682926829267,0.012195121951219513,0.006097560975609756,0.012195121951219513

And when might we see the data readout for the lead assets? And indeed, when might we see these potentially come to market? And then my second question is just more housekeeping in nature. You talked about a stocking benefit in Q4. I think it was $120 million. Could you detail which drugs that impacted primarily and whether you'd expect an unwind into the next quarter?",100.0,48.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.0625,0.0,0.0,-0.020833333333333332

This is a really great gene therapy platform. Why we picked -- and a great team. Those are clearly two of the reasons why we picked Prevail. Also, I think there's just a natural synergy with the work we do at Lilly. We're extremely strong in neuroscience. We have a deep commitment to the space. And therefore, as we thought about what's our entry point into gene therapy, and we believe gene therapy will be an important treatment modality across therapeutic areas in the future, it made sense to enter gene therapy to begin our efforts here in neuroscience. Prevail has got two exciting programs in the clinic already. One is for Parkinson's disease with GBA1 mutations, and it’s a GBA1 gene transfer. There's a lot of phase validity to that kind of approach, and we're looking forward to seeing data from that. The other similarly well-validated target here in frontotemporal dementia with GRN mutations. And that's also, I think, exciting. In terms of time lines to market, I think it's -- these programs are still very early. We're just in the first few patients here, and we'll have to see what the data showed in port of those time lines.",223.0,105.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0380952380952381,0.0,0.009523809523809525,0.0,0.009523809523809525,0.0380952380952381

On inventory, what we've said is if you look at 2020 inventory in the U.S. inventory levels versus Q4 of 2019, we're $120 million higher. We're not concerned about that. 2019 was an unusually low year when you just look at days of stock. So the $120 million is in line with our expectations. But now as we look into Q1 2021, we do expect that $120 million will burn off. And it's across the portfolio. But as you would imagine, Trulicity is one of the products. We see a little bit extra in Taltz, and I think some of this is a function of the anticipation of increased volume for Taltz as a function of the ESI win that'll go in -- that went into effect on January 1. And we also see some on Alimta. We did see some purchasing patterns through the year in oncology. I think some of which was related to the pandemic and some delays in infused products, but those are probably the two biggest products where we see this on. So we would expect that $120 million to burn off in Q1 as it normally does. The other piece, though, that we want to make investors aware is, remember last year in Q1 we saw a $250 million build in inventory on a worldwide basis. This was as customers were stocking up in anticipation of the walk-downs that were coming with the pandemic. So I think if you put those two things together, the $250 million build last year and what we assumed to be $120 million burn this year, that's about $370 million of headwind when you just do year-over-year compare in growth, and that's -- could be up to six points or something. Again, it's not a concern to build into how we think about the year, but we do want to remind investors on that piece. Now -- and I think throughout the year, we're going to have some strange compares. Remember that we sold $871 million in bamlanivimab in Q4, we expect to have significant sales this year as well. So we'll tease all that as we go through. But on the underlying base business, you should expect to see an inventory negative growth effect in Q1.",378.0,150.0,1.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.006666666666666667,0.02666666666666667,0.04,0.0,0.0,-0.02

I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes. And we'd also like to welcome Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly, who will be joining us today and moving forward to answer your questions about discovery and early-stage oncology efforts he's leading. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave -- sorry, we're also joined by Sara Smith and Lauren Zierke of the Investor Relations team.  During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Forms 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.

Lilly entered 2021 focused on expanding our reach to over 45 million patients by scaling our key growth brands around the world, continuing the advancement of our pipeline following a very successful 2020 and increasing productivity in the SG&A line while investing in research for sustainable long-term growth. We are pleased with the progress we've made on these objectives in our first quarter while also delivering hundreds of thousands of doses of our COVID-19 antibodies to patients to help the continued fight against COVID-19. As we unpack this quarter's results, we will attempt to give you a clear picture of the underlying trends in our core business.  We recognize this quarter was noisy, catching the increased consumer stock in from the Q1 2020 in our quarterly compare and increased COVID-19 therapy R&D spend in 2021. These items, coupled with the FX rate movement and a number of changes to U.S. government purchase agreements for COVID-19 antibodies throughout the quarter, make for a longer earnings call and press release. And we realize, for those keeping score on sell-side model accuracy, perhaps some disappointment. Nonetheless, underneath all of that is a strong and growing core business for Lilly and a significant number of positive, even compelling pipeline readouts in the quarter to support long-term growth across all of our core therapy areas. And we continue to expect top line growth and margin expansion to accelerate throughout this year.  This quarter, revenue grew 16% compared to Q1 2020 or 13% in constant currency. This performance was driven entirely by volume, which grew 17 percentage points. As previously highlighted in Q1 2020, we had roughly a $250 million COVID-19-related inventory build that is impacting the year-over-year comparison. When excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue and the Q1 2020 stocking benefit, our core business grew 7% for the quarter. Key growth products continued to drive volume and revenue growth and now represent 52% of our core business in Q1 2021.  Our non-GAAP gross margin was 75.4% in Q1 and 78% excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 27.5% for the quarter and 30.1% excluding the FX impact. While foreign exchange on international inventories sold has a modest effect on our Q1 -- on our results in 2019 and 2020, in the first quarter of 2021, we experienced over 250 basis point of negative impact on our gross margin and operating margin. Recall that is purely a noncash accounting item.  On the pipeline front, we achieved multiple milestones since our Q4 earnings call, including the Phase III initiation of pirtobrutinib, formerly known as LOXO-305; and for additional obesity studies in tirzepatide's SURMOUNT program; the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization for the administration of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together as a treatment for COVID-19; positive Phase III results from tirzepatide's SURPASS-2, 3 and 5 trials in type 2 diabetes; and positive Phase III results for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis and baricitinib in alopecia areata.  About a decade ago, Lilly made the decision to enter into and invest in immunology with the Phase III initiation of ixekizumab, now known as Taltz. Since then, we have added Olumiant in rheumatoid arthritis and several new indications with first or best-in-category data for Taltz and Olumiant in rheumatology and dermatology. This year, we see further expansion of our immunology strategy with the successful completion of Phase III studies of mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis. The first IL-23p19 antibody medicine to demonstrate results in this setting.  We're also excited about lebrikizumab's potential to differentiate from Dupixent on itch, sleep and safety, primarily in conjunctivitis, in what is an increasingly large and growing class with meaningful unmet medical need. And we anticipate multiple Phase III readouts for lebrikizumab later this year in monotherapy and in combination with corticosteroids. We look forward to potentially reaching increasing numbers of patients in difficult-to-treat immunology conditions in the coming years.  We also entered into several business development deals, including the in-licensing of a RIPK1 inhibitor from Rigel Pharmaceuticals and the divestiture of QBREXZA, which along with lebrikizumab was part of the Dermira acquisition last year. We also distributed nearly $800 million in dividends this quarter with the share -- dividend per share increasing 15% versus last year.  Moving on to Slides 5 and 6, you'll see a list of key events since our last earnings call. We announced plans to host a webinar to provide an overview of the company's commitment in the areas of environmental, social and governance for the investment community, for media and the general public on May 4, 2021. Additionally, we announced 2 planned retirements of long-tenured executives and several additions to our leadership team. I'd like to thank Myles O'Neill, President of Lilly Manufacturing; and Melissa Barnes, our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, for their leadership and service to our company. We also extend a warm welcome to Edgardo Hernandez, who will be succeeding Myles; to Alonzo Weems, who will succeed Melissa; and to Diogo Rau, who will be joining Lilly next month as Chief Information and Digital Officer, succeeding Aarti Shah, whose retirement was announced last fall.  Finally, we announced the appointment of Anat Ashkenazi, our CFO. Anat has a deep experience, having been the CFO of every part of our value chain. For the last 4 years, Anat has a large -- has led a large portion of our finance organization with all of our divisional CFOs reporting to her as well as our accounting and financial reporting team, our corporate strategy group and our business transformation office. During this time, Anat worked closely with me, our Executive Committee and our Board of Directors to develop and implement our annual business and long-term strategic plans. I have no doubt that Anat will perform extremely well as CFO of Lilly and expect no changes in our priorities, our strategy or execution, given her significant involvement in all those areas.  Anat, welcome to our leadership team, and I'll turn the call over to you for our Q1 results.",996.0,508.0,19.0,7.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.03740157480314961,0.013779527559055118,0.011811023622047244,0.0,0.003937007874015748,0.023622047244094488

As Dave mentioned, revenue increased 16% this quarter compared to Q1 of 2020 or 7% when excluding the COVID-19 antibody revenue and the Q1 2020 COVID-related stocking benefit, representing a good momentum for our core business.  Last year, with the health and safety of our employees, patients and providers in mind, we shifted from in-person interactions to primarily virtual interactions and began 2021 with few sales reps in the field in the U.S. We feel good about our capabilities to work with providers virtually and are encouraged as we exited Q1 2021 with the majority of U.S. reps back in the field. As we navigate the early stages of the recovery, we're focused on operational excellence in both virtual and in-person environment and are pleased with the volume and share growth in key brands despite continued pandemic-related headwinds for several classes.  As we look at gross margin, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 490 basis points to 75.4%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventory sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 78%, a decrease of 260 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable product mix driven largely by sales of COVID-19 antibodies and, to a lesser extent, by lower realized prices and revenue.  Moving down the P&L. Operating expenses grew 11% compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2% while R&D expenses increased 21%, driven primarily by $220 million of investments in COVID-19 therapies. Net of the COVID-19 expenses, R&D increased 5%, driven by continued investments in our late-stage pipeline.  Total operating expense growth was less than 3% compared to Q1 2020 when excluding the investments in COVID-19 therapies. Operating income increased 6% compared to Q1 of 2020 and operating income as a percent of revenue was 27.5% for the quarter, a decline of 250 basis points compared to prior year. This decline was driven entirely by the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold.  Other income and expense was income of $35 million this quarter compared to expense of $73 million in Q1 of 2020, driven primarily by a benefit related to favorable European patent settlement for Alimta. As we noted previously, beginning in 2021, we are excluding the gains or losses due to equity investments from our non-GAAP measures and have provided revised figures for 2020 in our investor workbook to enable year-over-year comparison on that same basis.  Our effective tax rate was 10.8%, a decrease of 210 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for both periods was reduced by net discrete tax benefits with the larger net discrete benefit reflected in the first quarter of 2021. At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share increased 16%.  On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth across the world. U.S. revenue grew 18% compared to the first quarter of 2020 while revenue decreased slightly, excluding COVID-19 antibodies. Adjusting for the Q1 2020 stocking benefit, the core business grew 5% in the U.S. These results were driven entirely by volume, led by Trulicity and Taltz, partially offset by a mid-single-digit price decline.  Pricing was a 6% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, driven primarily by Taltz' improved access and corresponding higher contracted rates, partially offset by a modest list price increase. Excluding the impact of Taltz' win at ESI, we experienced low single-digit net price decline in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2021. We noted on previous calls that we expect that Taltz would experience price headwind in Q1 beyond general rate pressure with the improved access position.  There were two pieces of the ESI impact. The first existing patients already covered through medical exceptions were moved to the newly contracted rate, a onetime step-down in prices as we move through 2021. In addition, we were pleased with the update for new patients at ESI at the contracted rate and we expect that, that population will grow meaningfully over time.  There is always a near-term impact when we have a step -- a significant step-up in access. And this win nearly doubled our commercial access. We're encouraged by the volume growth we saw in the first quarter and believe Taltz will return to net sales growth in the second quarter, which should continue to accelerate as we move through the year as the volume growth from the major access upgrade outpaces the related pricing headwind.  Beyond Taltz, segment mix was not a major of U.S. price performance in the first quarter as increased utilization in the more highly rebated government segment was offset by lower utilization in the 340B segment, primarily for our diabetes portfolio. While mid-term trends are stable at present, given the increase in variability in payer mix, we continue to expect quarterly variability in reported net price changes. We also expect Taltz' price impact to moderate as we move through the year and overall, low to mid-single-digit total net price decline in the U.S. for the full year.  Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 15% in constant currency. Excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue and the impact of Q1 2020 COVID-related stocking, revenue grew 5% in constant currency despite lockdowns in a number of European countries and driven primarily -- entirely by volume growth for Alimta, Trulicity and Taltz. We're pleased with the momentum of our business in Europe and are looking forward to continued strong growth in 2021.  In Japan, revenue decreased 8% in constant currency, driven entirely by decreased volume for Cialis and Forteo. Net of the impact for those post-patent expiry products, Japan grew 5% in constant currency, driven by Verzenio, Jardiance in collaboration with BI and Olumiant.  In China, revenue grew 26% in constant currency, driven by 32% volume growth, primarily from Tyvyt and, to a lesser extent, our diabetes portfolio. We're excited about the momentum in China as our business has accelerated significantly the past 2 quarters. Tyvyt continues its strong growth, Trulicity and Olumiant are now in the NRDL and we look forward to launch uptake for Verzenio. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 1% in constant currency, driven primarily by continued erosion of Cialis.  As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive impressive volume growth. Despite the Q1 2020 COVID-related stocking benefit impacting year-over-year growth, these newer medicines delivered over 9 percentage point of growth this quarter with COVID antibodies also contributing roughly 14 percentage points of growth. The strong volume growth was partially offset by post-LOE products as well as insulin, whose volume growth was also meaningfully impacted by the Q1 2020 stocking benefit.  Slide 10 highlights the contribution of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated approximately $3.1 billion in revenue this quarter and made up 52% of core business revenue. We are particularly encouraged by Trulicity's performance. 3 years ago, Trulicity was the #2 injectable GLP-1 in the U.S. market at roughly 40% share of market. Weekly scripts for the class were approximately 180,000 and a new weekly injectable entrant had just launched. Since that time, Trulicity has become the most prescribed GLP-1 in the U.S. with a 48% share of the injectable market in a class that is now twice the size at roughly 360,000 weekly scripts.  Trulicity continues to have the highest adherence of any diabetes medication, oral or injectable, with the additional dose of 3 and 4.5 milligram providing the potential for Trulicity to both extend the time on therapy for existing patients and compete for new patients as demonstrated by the new-to-brand share of market having increased more than 4 points since the launch of these additional doses in September 2020. As we start 2021, we are pleased with Trulicity's ability to outgrow the injectable class and establish all-time highs in new therapy starts as well as total market share.  We see meaningful opportunity for continued robust class growth for GLP-1s as they are still less than 1 in 10 diabetes scripts and have significant opportunity for further penetration in the first injectable space as well. With more positive readouts from the tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes this quarter, we remain focused on sustaining Trulicity's leadership position, accelerating class growth and providing continued innovation in the incretin space.  On Slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1, we invested nearly $3 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditure and after-tax investments in R&D. In addition, we returned nearly $800 million to shareholders via dividend. We are focused on utilizing our cash flow -- our strong cash flow to develop the next wave of new medicine through both internal and external sources, as highlighted by the recently completed in-licensing of the RIP kinase 1 inhibitor from Rigel Pharmaceuticals. We will remain active in assessing the in-licensing opportunities as well as bolt-on acquisitions, where we believe we can create shareholders' value and enhance our future growth prospects.  Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on Slide 12. We are updating our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. We continue to support health care professionals, navigating the ongoing pandemic and driving broad vaccinations to enable return to normalcy for health care systems in the second half of the year. Despite some therapeutic class still at or below pre-COVID baselines for new therapy starts and the highlighted inventory impact on year-over-year growth, we are confident in the performance of our core business.  We are increasing our full year revenue outlook by $100 million to reflect the FX benefit realized on the top line in the first quarter. We are, however, narrowing the range for COVID-19 antibody revenue from approximately $1 billion to $2 billion to $1 billion to $1.5 billion for the year. Based on the rollout of the vaccine across major markets, current antibody utilization rate, existing U.S. government bamlanivimab supply and the transition to only supply bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together in the U.S., we believe this update range contemplates a variety of potential scenarios. We recognize that situations across the globe can evolve quickly, and we'll plan to adapt as required moving forward. The net impact of these changes is an updated revenue range of $26.6 billion to $27.6 billion. Our outlook for gross margin percent remains unchanged with the impact of COVID-19 antibodies diluting our total gross margin percent by approximately 100 basis points.  For research and development, we're increasing our range from $6.5 billion to $7.7 billion to $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion. This reflects an increase of $100 million in COVID-19 antibody expense to support the advancement of a third antibody, LY-1404, as we continue to address the COVID-19 pandemic and approximately $300 million on the core business, driven by investments in donanemab for the expansion of the Phase III TRAILBLAZER-2 study and the initiation of the new Phase III study, TRAILBLAZER Alzheimer's 3 in asymptomatic Alzheimer's patients. Our investments in donanemab is consistent with our R&D strategy to continue to bolster our pipeline to ensure long-term growth, and based on the strength of the data, invest meaningfully in innovative molecules that we believe have the potential to deliver practice change in data that could significantly improve patient outcomes in areas of high unmet need.  We're increasing our non-GAAP range for OID to an expense of $100 million to $200 million to reflect the Alimta patent settlement in Europe I noted earlier, while our GAAP range is now income of $150 million to $250 million, which reflects the impact of equity investment gains in the first quarter. We are lowering our effective tax rate to approximately 13% to reflect higher discrete tax items in the first quarter and a lower base rate. We're lowering our non-GAAP operating margin guidance to approximately 31%. The decrease in operating margin is driven entirely by the decreased investments in Alzheimer's for donanemab. Our longer-term margin expansion remains unchanged as we expect continued operating margin expansion to mid- to high 30s. Our GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 26%.  Finally, the non-GAAP range for earnings per share is now $7.80 to $8. The increase on the lower end of the range reflects the net benefit for the core business related to the changes to OID and tax rate as well as increased revenue, offset by increased R&D for investments in donanemab. The reduction in the upper end of the range reflects the narrow revenue range and increased R&D expense for COVID-19 therapies. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.03 to $7.23, which reflects an increase to acquire the IP R&D related to completed business development transactions, other specified items related primarily to asset impairments, COVID-19 inventory charges and acquisition and integration costs as well as the benefit from net gains on investments in equity securities. We're confident in our ability to achieve our 2021 revenue goals for the core business while also delivering operating margin expansion in mid-teens EPS growth.  As we move forward, I would encourage you to look at trends in our core business for the first half of the year, given the significant variability we saw across the period in 2020. As a reminder, revenue performance in the second quarter of 2020 was impacted by the reversal of largely all the $250 million COVID-related stocking benefit from Q1 of 2020 as well as an additional $250 million due to the significant decline in new patient prescription as health care utilization decreased and systems temporarily closed down in the face of a surging pandemic. As we look at underlying volume and share trends across our key products, we are confident in our full year outlook for the core business. And the pipeline successes in the first quarter only furthers our conviction in our mid-term and long-term outlook for continued revenue growth and operating margin expansion.  Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.",2310.0,1256.0,50.0,13.0,23.0,6.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,0.03980891719745223,0.010350318471337579,0.018312101910828025,0.004777070063694267,0.0015923566878980893,0.02945859872611465

Before I get into the broader portfolio update, I'll spend a few minutes highlighting results from tirzepatide's first 4 top line readouts from the Phase III SURPASS program, including the strong results from SURPASS-2, the head-to-head trial with semaglutide 1 milligram. This program is aptly named as we've seen tirzepatide surpass our expectations through these initial readouts, displaying significantly greater hemoglobin A1C reduction, weight loss and percent of patients reaching normal glucose levels than any GLP-1 on the market.  On Slide 13, you can see impressive performance in the efficacy estimate analysis in glycemic control for tirzepatide with each dose demonstrating superiority in each trial across a range of patient populations, comparators and background medications. The clear highlight is the impressive A1C reduction of the 5-milligram dose across each of these 3 -- each of these different patient populations while the higher doses provide additional glucose control up to and surpassing 2.5% A1C reductions.  Moving to Slide 14. You can see how tirzepatide performed across all 3 doses in terms of patients achieving HbA1c below 5.7%, the normal glycemic level seen in people without type 2 diabetes. We believe this is an exciting finding that may reset expectations for the impact diabetes medications could have for patients. Using the efficacy estimate analysis across SURPASS-1, 2 and 3, we see about half of the patients on the 15-milligram dose of tirzepatide achieve this remarkable level of Hba1c control.  In SURPASS-5, which focused on patients on background insulin glargine, 62% of patients on 15-milligram tirzepatide achieved this level of A1C compared to only 3% of patients in the placebo group. Remember, this is a patient population on background basal insulin with an average duration of diabetes of over 13 years. Achieving this level of glucose control in such a population is something that prior to GIP/GLP-1 agonists like tirzepatide, we did not even contemplate as possible.  On Slide 15, we show the efficacy estimate analysis for weight reduction across the 4 studies. Here again, we see levels of efficacy that previously were thought unobtainable with incretin therapy in type 2 diabetes patients. As we and others have discussed, studies like AWARD-11 and SUSTAIN FORTE have begun to show the limit of what fully hitting the GLP-1 mechanism can accomplish for weight loss and A1C. There appear to be diminishing returns as doses of GLP-1 alone fully saturate the GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism and a flattening of the dose response curve occurs.  And then you look at this slide, including importantly, SURPASS-2. And you can see quite clearly that there's something different going on here as the dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist is beyond the flattening of the dose response curve of GLP-1 performance, which we believe evidences the power of adding in the GIP mechanisms. Highlights from these studies include the 15-milligram dose delivering 14% weight reduction in SURPASS-3, noting here weight gain of 3% on insulin degludec comparator, the 15-milligram dose nearly doubling the weight reduction of semaglutide 1-milligram in SURPASS-2 and strong performance from the 5 and 10-milligram doses with statistically superior weight loss, even as high as 11% on the 10-milligram dose versus placebo or active comparators.  We're encouraged that in these 40 and 52-week studies, we haven't yet seen the weight loss curves plateau on the higher doses. It's really exciting to think about how tirzepatide could potentially perform with the longer duration of treatment that we'll see in future studies. We had a lot of confidence in the efficacy data coming out of Phase II. But there was a lot we didn't yet know about safety and tolerability. Recall, for example, that the primary Phase II trial had only about 200 patients on therapy and patients were only on therapy for 26 weeks.  As we look at Slide 16, we've been pleased to see through these 4 SURPASS readouts that the overall safety profile was similar to the well-established GLP-1 receptor agonist class and the most commonly reported adverse events were GI-related and mild to moderate in severity. We're particularly encouraged by the potential impact of the optimized dose escalation scheme, and accordingly, by the tolerability profile observed in the Phase III program, which improved greatly in comparison to Phase II, including the lower rates of nausea, diarrhea and vomiting that we've seen, consistent with what we saw in Phase III studies for other well-tolerated and highly used incretin therapies, including our own Trulicity. In addition, we're pleased with the discontinuation rates due to adverse events, which have ranged from 3% to 11% across doses in these studies.  Stepping back from the data a bit, we're excited about the safety and efficacy results across all doses, but perhaps especially so for the efficacy of the 5-milligram dose, which has performed well in each study, including showing superiority to semaglutide 1 milligram in SURPASS-2 on both A1C reduction and weight loss. I think these data show that the 5-milligram dose could be a great first incretin that can potentially deliver best-in-class efficacy with tolerability that is as good or better than other leading incretins. So we have the low maintenance dose of 5 milligrams that, if approved, could potentially be appropriate for many patients with physicians knowing they could have higher doses available as they continue management of disease.  Tirzepatide could provide patients with the opportunity to set treatment goals that might surpass what was previously thought possible in type 2 diabetes, both in terms of getting patients to normal glucose control, which has never been contemplated as a potential treatment goal, as well as for impressive weight loss with the highest dose of tirzepatide having roughly double the weight loss of semaglutide 1 milligram in SURPASS-2. Today, type 2 diabetes is largely a treat-to-fail disease.  With these results, tirzepatide, if approved, could potentially provide doctors options to enable early control of glucose and weight. This has the potential to translate to improved levels of end organ protection and a more meaningful reduction in disease complications that has yet been seen. We'll be testing this potential for tirzepatide in ongoing and planned studies in diabetes, obesity, heart failure and NASH. Accordingly, we've now initiated SURMOUNTs-2, 3 and 4 for tirzepatide in obesity and top line results from SURMOUNT-1 are expected next year.  Moving back to diabetes. The top line readout for SURPASS-4, which is in a high cardiovascular risk population and we believe will provide an important contribution to our CV safety assessment, is the gating trial for global submissions in type 2 diabetes. Completion of this trial has always been contingent on accruing a prespecified number of CV events. We've achieved the necessary events, which triggers bringing patients in for final treatment and safety visits before moving the trial to completion. Based on this update, we anticipate a top line readout by the middle of this year. We look forward to disclosing the results of SURPASS-1, 2, 3 and 5 at the ADA 2021 Virtual Meeting, which will include a 90-minute ADA symposium featuring these results the morning of June 29.  While we're excited with the progress of tirzepatide, we think innovation in the incretin space is not over. At ADA, we'll also be discussing preclinical and Phase I data for our glucagon/GLP/GIP triagonist, also known as GGG, which we're pleased to announce we'll be moving into Phase II later this quarter. We've previously commented that in this space, we have a high bar for progressing molecules in development, one that has been raised recently by tirzepatide. While it's still early, we're advancing GGG to Phase II based on our belief that it could exceed the benefits seen with tirzepatide. With our GGG molecule, we expect to see even more weight loss than what can be achieved with tirzepatide while preserving glucose-lowering efficacy. In addition, due to glucagon's direct action on the liver, we'd also hope to see benefits in NASH. Consequently, our ambitious Phase II program is designed to evaluate GGG for obesity, type 2 diabetes and NASH.  In addition to our next-generation incretins, we're also very excited by our novel weekly insulin, basal insulin-Fc. Thanks to Lilly's work on Trulicity, weekly incretin therapy is now the standard of care in the GLP-1 space. And together with tirzepatide, we hope incretin-based therapies will become the standard of care in the first injectable space for people with type 2 diabetes. For those people who need basal insulin therapy in addition to their incretin therapy, we'd like to make weekly insulin therapy possible, ultimately avoiding daily injections completely. We'll give an update at ADA on our novel weekly basal insulin. We plan to have an investor call in the morning of July 1 to discuss the data releases at ADA for tirzepatide, GGG and weekly basal insulin.  While the progress in our diabetes portfolio is compelling, Lilly has continued to advance the rest of our pipeline this quarter. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 23 and Slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. In addition to the progress on tirzepatide I just discussed, major developments since our last earnings call include progress with donanemab on multiple fronts. In terms of data, we presented detailed results at AD/PD showing donanemab met its primary endpoint, significantly slowing cognitive decline compared to placebo on the integrated Alzheimer's disease rating scale, a composite measure of cognition and daily function in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. And data from secondary analyses showed donanemab consistently slowed cognitive and functional decline with ranges between 20% and 40% in all secondary endpoints with nominal statistical significance at multiple time points compared to placebo.  On the clinical front, as we discussed in detail on our call last month, we expanded TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 to be a Phase III study, and it's now enrolling quickly. And today, we're announcing that we will start a new Phase III study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease. This trial is anticipated to begin enrollment later this year. Our goal here is to enroll patients who already have Alzheimer's brain pathology but don't yet have any clinical symptoms. The study will have development and progression of Alzheimer's disease symptoms as the primary endpoint. And we anticipate it will take approximately 3 years from completion of enrollment to reach a sufficient number of events. We'll be testing if a short course of donanemab treatment at the start of the trial can prevent progression in a substantial fraction of patients over the subsequent several years. These types of trials are extremely challenging to enroll and conduct. But here, we're buoyed by our expertise in biomarkers, including both PET scans and importantly, our plasma P-tau217 assay.  On the regulatory front, based on feedback from the FDA, we currently do not see a path forward for near-term submission and approval based on the first TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study alone. As you know, the unmet need in Alzheimer's disease is significant. So while we remain focused on speeding up enrollment and completion of our second pivotal study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, we are continuing to actively engage with the FDA and are fully exploring any opportunities for early submission.  Another highlight this quarter was the initiation of pirtobrutinib’s Phase III program with study start in chronic lymphocytic leukemia as monotherapy. We're also proud of the continuation of our work against COVID-19, including a planned transition from bamlanivimab alone to the administration of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together for the treatment of COVID-19 in the U.S., accomplished by first gaining Emergency Use Authorization for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together in February and then our request for revocation of the EUA for bamlanivimab alone, which FDA subsequently granted.  We also submitted bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for regulatory review in Europe. And we initiated the evaluation of bamlanivimab with VIR-7831 in collaboration with Vir and GSK as well as started trials with a new, potentially broadly neutralizing antibody, LY-1404, in collaboration with AbCellera in case new combinations are needed to fight variants. We announced top line Phase III results evaluating baricitinib on top of standard of care, which did not meet statistical significance on the primary endpoint for treatment of COVID-19 but did result in a significant reduction of death from any cause by 38% by day 28. And baricitinib received regulatory approval in conjunction with remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 in Japan.  Our work on tirzepatide, donanemab and pirtobrutinib brings great potential for patients in the long term and is highly prioritized at Lilly. Our work on COVID-19 is another clear highlight, where we moved quickly to help address an unmet medical need in the midst of a pandemic. We're optimistic though that this need will wane in the coming years. Beyond these significant efforts, there's been progress across many other commercial stage and clinical stage assets.  Starting in oncology, we're pleased with the approval of selpercatinib for non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer in Europe. We're also pleased that the results of monarchE, our adjuvant breast cancer study, are now submitted in Japan, along with Europe, China and the U.S. As you know, the primary endpoint for the study was invasive disease-free survival, which we hit at the interim analysis. As anticipated, this hazard ratio continues to strengthen over time as more events have accrued. Important secondary endpoints for the study include distant relapse-free survival and overall survival.  For the U.S. submission, the FDA has noted, and we agree, that the OS data are immature and thus unreliable as we shared in the JCO publication last year. FDA has, therefore, asked us to see an updated OS analysis during the review cycle to determine that OS is trending in favor of Verzenio. Given the robust distant relapse-free survival data, we're highly confident that the overall survival data will eventually reflect and reinforce the survival benefit. But it takes time for these events to accrue, especially in the adjuvant setting.  In immunology, we have positive Phase III readouts for baricitinib in alopecia areata, a disease with significant unmet medical need, and we look forward to regulatory submissions starting in the second half of this year. We also announced that the FDA extended the review period for baricitinib for atopic dermatitis by 3 months, another disease where we think JAK inhibition could potentially alleviate important unmet medical needs.  With mirikizumab, we reported positive Phase III results in ulcerative colitis in the 12-week induction study, hitting the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints, and we look forward to seeing the maintenance data early next year. We also have updates to mirikizumab psoriasis program. While the OASIS program generated positive results with safety and efficacy similar to other IL-23p19s, we believe the psoriasis market is well served with highly effective treatment options, including Taltz.  Lilly's immunology strategy is to focus our new molecules and indications on areas where patients have significant unmet needs, not merely adding new options or leveraging commercial presence to create a space, where effective solutions like Taltz already exist for patients. Therefore, we will not pursue submission of mirikizumab in psoriasis, but instead, we'll focus our efforts on the ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease indications, where unmet medical need is higher and where we believe the potential of the IL-23p19 mechanism to create a new standard of care is greater.  In addition to late-stage progress, our early-stage portfolio continues to advance with the introduction of 5 new Phase I assets and the attrition of 2. In addition to the progress we've made in just the first few months of the year, we anticipate important developments for the remainder of 2021, including the final readout for tirzepatide's Phase III type 2 diabetes program, SURPASS-4, noted earlier; Phase III results for Jardiance in HFpEF and for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis; regulatory actions for Jardiance for HFrEF, Verzenio in the adjuvant setting for ER-positive breast cancer, baricitinib for atopic dermatitis and tanezumab for osteoarthritis pain, where we previously noted our disappointment in the outcome of the Tanezumab Advisory Committee; the presentation of Phase I data for our oral SERD; the initiation of Phase I for a BCL-2 inhibitor and for KRAS G12C inhibitor; along with the filing of an IND for our next-generation RET inhibitor later this year as we announced at AACR; and the Phase II readout for zagotenemab, our anti-tau antibody for early Alzheimer's disease.  We believe our continued pipeline success drives increasing visibility to meaningful long-term growth, and we look forward to continued progress across our portfolio in the coming quarters.  Now I turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks.",2828.0,1443.0,80.0,32.0,33.0,7.0,3.0,15.0,16.0,2.0,0.05544005544005544,0.022176022176022176,0.02286902286902287,0.004851004851004851,0.002079002079002079,0.033264033264033266

Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made to start the year. Amid several moving pieces in a challenging health care environment, we are excited by the momentum we are seeing. Our business grew 16% in the first quarter with the core business growing 7%, adjusted for COVID-19 antibody revenue and last year's COVID-19-related inventory stocking benefit. Our top line growth continues to be strong, driven strongly by volume across our key growth products, which account for more than half of our core business.  Net of the significant impact from foreign exchange on international inventories sold, our operating margin was in line with our expectations as we continue to expect operating margin expansion throughout the year and further expansion in years to come. We made significant progress developing new medicines with many more data readouts expected this year. Advances for tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, Verzenio, mirikizumab, Retevmo and Olumiant, serve as a reminder of the breadth and depth of opportunities we have to sustain robust long-term growth. We returned nearly $800 million to shareholders, being increased dividend, reflecting confidence in the ongoing strength of our business.  I want to say thank you to my Lilly teammates, whose commitment to excellence and dedication to our purpose of bringing innovative new medicines to patients is inspiring and drove these accomplishments amidst ongoing pandemic headwinds. While our people, health care providers and patients continue to face near-term challenges associated with COVID-19, our long-term outlook is as bright as ever.  This concludes our prepared remarks.

I guess, first, on Verzenio, did I hear that you mentioned FDA is looking for updated OS data as part of the review? So I was just wondering when you'll have that data. And does that push out approval timelines in any meaningful way that we need to think about?  And then the second one I had was on tirzepatide. I guess, in light of the data you've seen from the SURPASS studies, does that -- has that changed how you think about what patient populations you'll focus on from a commercial standpoint or your go-to-market strategy? And I guess, as part of that, as we think about tirzepatide coming to market, do you expect substantial switches from Trulicity? Or is tirzepatide growth more about new patient starts and kind of expanding the market?",146.0,55.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818

And so we will be delivering this data set to the FDA without delaying our standard review timing. We can't really comment on what the FDA will do with the data or the application, but these discussions are progressing as planned. Important to note, as the data matures, I think, as Dan said, given the strength of the DRFS hazard ratio, remember, it was a 0.687 haz ratio with a very strong p-value, we are highly confident that the OS will trend in favor of Verzenio. So really, what we believe we're discussing is when that will occur.  So obviously, as I said, we can't comment on the discussion with FDA, but we do look forward to working with them on bringing this medicine to patients. And maybe just a comment to reference how immature this data is. At the time of the interim analysis that we published in JCO late last year, there were 39 deaths in the abema arm and 37 in the control arm. So that makes it really challenging to interpret this data when there's over 5,000 patients in the study.

No, the tirzepatide results have not changed the way we want to position tirzepatide in the marketplace. Obviously very pleased with those results. We're also just really blessed to have both Trulicity and tirzepatide. Our goal will be to maximize our entire incretin portfolio. Trulicity has established a strong market position. And I think the best data to support that is just how we've been able to grow share of market in the face of Ozempic and Rybelsus. So it has a strong position in the marketplace and that will remain.  But now as we think about tirzepatide, the dual incretin mechanism, that GIP component is really a game changer. Dan went through the results, but we just haven't seen the ability to return to someone living with type 2 diabetes, whether they're late or early, someone with type 2 diabetes progression, back to normal A1C. In fact, we were able to get 50% to 60% people back, it’s really incredible. Also weight loss at the highest dose, up to 14%. So when you just take a look at that and you take a look at the fact that 90% of people who live with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese, they can really benefit from early treatment with type 2 diabetes.  So the real question is why would you want to put them on something else early on? And why would you want to wait for them to have those benefits? So we see tirzepatide has the potential to really transform the market, driving earlier use of incretin, in particular tirzepatide's dual mechanism, and really expand the incretin market. So I think tirzepatide will clearly win some new patients that would have went on to Trulicity. You have some people who were maybe not performing well or not -- or needed more efficacy that will go on to tirzepatide. But clearly, our focus will be to profoundly change and disrupt the type 2 diabetes marketplace by driving earlier use of incretins with tirzepatide.",337.0,148.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,1.0,0.0,0.060810810810810814,0.02702702702702703,0.006756756756756757,0.0,0.0,0.033783783783783786

On mirikizumab, really as we see the greatest opportunity for unmet need for patients and we've said all along, we believe that mirikizumab has the greatest opportunity in GI, in IBD, in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We were pleased with the LUCENT-1 results. And so we're looking forward to seeing the maintenance data at the early part of next year.  In terms of psoriasis, as we take a look at the market and unmet need, we do continue to believe that Taltz is the gold standard and best in disease and believe that really is a market well served.

Before I come to combinations, maybe I'd just handicap this Phase II trial quickly. The pro here in favor of tau is clearly genetic validation and pathologic validation of the target. It's a great target for Alzheimer's disease. The cons here that we have to acknowledge is data from other companies' tau antibodies, which hasn't been particularly promising, and the difficulty in hitting the tau target in the brain. Now we have a differentiated antibody here that binds just aggregated tau, so perhaps there's reason to think we could get different results.  We're certainly eagerly awaiting those data in the second half of the year. And you're exactly right, if we see efficacy, combination would be an important consideration here. For sure, the general theme of combining an anti-amyloid drug with an anti-tau drug is a good one, particularly when you have a drug like donanemab, where you can completely clear amyloid plaques with a limited duration of therapy and then perhaps at that moment, intervene with an anti-tau drug.

I assume you're still expecting growth for the year as a whole, but if you could just sort of clarify. And is that contract with ESI, I'm not sure, is that a full year contract?

So on Taltz, first, let me just say we're really pleased about the progress we're making on Taltz and the growth that we're seeing with the step-up in access upgrades, ESI and beyond. And so as we take a look, even though that we've had some price impact in Q1, there are some elements there where we have a number of patients that were on medical exception that are now in the rebated contract that we have with ESI. Of course, we're also seeing an increase in overall volumes with ESI. What's encouraging is that we're not only seeing improvements in overall volume based off of switches, we're also seeing significant improvement in our new therapy starts.  And so we're, in dermatology, now the leading share in dermatology with over 19% share. And then in rheumatology, we're almost doubling our share from previous year. And so as we think about the year in terms of growth, we do believe we'll get to net sales growth in Q2, and we'll continue to accelerate that volume growth throughout the year. The contracting that we have for Taltz is -- goes beyond 1 year. And so we're encouraged about the volume growth of over 20% now, and we continue to see encouraging signs in the market.",224.0,94.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0851063829787234,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.0851063829787234

We probably don't get into too many details here, but we are, of course, expecting to -- this to be a large trial involving thousands of individuals, but yet we also set very ambitious enrollment goals. And while we don't have all the details planned out on how to achieve this, our goal is that we should be able to enroll this trial in about a year. That's pretty exciting to contemplate.  And Alzheimer's prevention trial is something that makes great sense, given the science and the biology here and what we know about the onset of Alzheimer's disease and its relation to years of having amyloid plaque in the brain. But there have been 2 major drawbacks that have not made these trials really very practical. First is finding the patients. That has gone from impossible before our introduction of amyloid PET scan to possible but really hard with amyloid PET scans as we experienced firsthand in the A4 trial to now something that's eminently feasible with our advent of the plasma tau -- phospho-tau217 assay. That's a huge advance that just unlocks this trial.  The second is if you think about this population, which is not experiencing symptoms, is a bit younger than an Alzheimer's population and introducing a therapy that is likely an infusion that they take for the rest of their lives, that's also a pretty significant hurdle. Again, we've, I think, abrogated that risk with donanemab in a limited treatment duration to give lasting plaque clearance, so excited about the TRAILBLAZER-3 trial.",278.0,118.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.03389830508474576,0.0423728813559322,0.025423728813559324,0.00847457627118644,0.0,-0.00847457627118644

Dave, as you think about some of the various proposals that are in Congress currently, could you just give us your thoughts on the tax proposal? And maybe Anat could give a little bit of the potential implications for Lilly. And then separately, there's obviously a lot of controversy swelling on drug pricing. Just wanted to get your sense of the proposals that are out there currently and if the industry is poised to or ready to step up with a more reasonable proposal.  And then just the second question is on the JAK inhibitor space and Lilly's opportunity with lebrikizumab, particularly in atopic dermatitis. There's a bit of a compare and contrast. Only Lilly, I think, has both potential opportunities in this space. I think there's a lot of speculation that there is going to be a safety update from the FDA, if not a full safety panel.

Look, on tax, this is a live discussion, of course, because the president has introduced a number of ideas on corporate tax changes. I guess we join a growing chorus of large companies who oppose, that means to raise revenue, especially when the stated policy goal of the infrastructure plan is to build back the economy. Of course, private money and corporate actions make up the vast majority of the investment that could or would occur. And taxing that seems like a bad idea, maybe the opposite idea from the bill itself.  Within the bill, maybe just a couple of general comments, and we can follow up if we need to. There's the nominal rate discussion, which, of course, when we say moving from 21% to 28% is moving toward the middle of the pack, is not true because, of course, in the U.S., we have state-level income tax. It would really put the U.S. at the highest developed economy in terms of corporate tax rate.  Additionally, we're the only major economy that taxes overseas earnings of its domiciled companies and changing the so-called GILTI tax, foreign minimum tax, really is punitive to our home companies in multiple ways and is something that would have a disproportionate effect on pharmaceutical companies. And so both these actions don't make a lot of sense to us and we oppose. We would favor things like looking at funding the IRS, so they can collect taxes from all the people that don't pay, including businesses and other items that could be pay-fors, we certainly support infrastructure in many ways.  On drug pricing, this has been pushed out a little bit. I wouldn't be surprised if we see HR 3 being debated soon, but as you may have read, apparently it won't be part of the second package from the White House. That's good because HR 3 and those concepts are really set to take a huge piece out of the industry, do nothing for patient out-of-pocket affordability and really derail the innovation machine that is the only reason we're escaping from the COVID-19 pandemic. So we will oppose that with every ounce of our being as pharma.  That said, we are all for changes to the system that make out-of-pocket costs go down for patients. There are a lot of ways to do this within the system that the industry is willing to put pay-fors on the table. This is much more around the contours of maybe what we saw with Senate Finance or the reported proposals made in the 11th hour of the last administration. We will table those ideas. We are tabling those ideas. And I think probably in the second half, you'll hear more about that.  We think there's a great opportunity to improve affordability and strengthen the health care system and really address health care inequities as well that occur because people who are of lower economic means, people of color, women are disproportionately affected by bad insurance design and bad benefit design.

As you noted and what we said on the call is that we're quite excited about our progress in immunology as a whole. And if we think about the growth opportunities within immunology, atopic dermatitis is one catalyst for the company, both in what we believe in Olumiant's success but also lebrikizumab. In terms of the question around JAKs and FDA decision, I won't speculate on any decision the FDA may make. But it's safe to say that the delay across all JAKs in atopic dermatitis and other indications suggests that there's a broader review on JAK safety. We feel that Olumiant has a robust safety profile. And with dermatology being more safety conscious, we do believe that Olumiant has a very good prospect to compete in this space, especially after topical failure.  And then lebrikizumab is one to watch out for, for the second half of the year. As we get more data, well, we feel like we can compete and differentiate versus Dupixent. And so long-term prospect and catalysts for growth are very good for having both mechanisms. And we also see catalyst for growth in alopecia areata, a very -- to be first in disease with Olumiant.

In terms of area differentiation, the focus for lebrikizumab is not only to look at the efficacy on skin but also one of the more impactful symptoms related to atopic dermatitis is itch. And so we believe we may have the opportunity to differentiate an itch, which also has impact on sleep. And we believe that lebrikizumab may have a better safety profile. So that's where we believe we can differentiate. And so we're excited to get the results for lebrikizumab at the back half of the year. In terms of new indications, I think it's early to take a look at any new indications. We're obviously evaluating opportunities to grow lebrikizumab.

I think as it relates to differentiation, I'd point out a few things. First off, obviously, as I think you and others know, pirtobrutinib itself is a differentiated BTK inhibitor that we believe affords certain advantages in combination. Obviously, we need to prove that clinically, but that's our hypothesis right now. So that sort of stands on its own. The LOXO-338 program, the BCL-2 inhibitor, we'll be putting into the clinic this year. And obviously, important that, that drug meets its human pharmacology goals so that we know that it itself is on track as a drug. Should that prove to be the case, which we expect it to, we will then look to combine these 2 agents.  I think when you look out at others that are combining BTK and BCL-2, the latter largely being venetoclax, I think what you see is a very fragmented landscape of asset ownership across companies, and as a result of that, some -- oftentimes perverse incentives about how to combine those drugs and where. We think it's important that if you have a new and differentiated BTK inhibitor like we believe we do with pirtobrutinib, we thought it was strategically important to own our own BCL-2 inhibitor. And so we think we'll be really the only player in the field who owns both agents outright. So that, to us, is a key differentiating feature downstream. But it's still a bunch of hoops we have to jump through to enable that combination.",265.0,99.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.020202020202020204,0.010101010101010102,0.020202020202020204,0.0,0.0,0.010101010101010102

Can you maybe just walk through some of those key design choices and the extent regulators have bought in, and also confirm that that single study would be sufficient for approval in that setting?

Can you talk about what you're seeing in the U.S. in terms of rebating for this oral oncology category? My understanding is that the level of rebates may be stepping up.

But what's the outlook for gross-to-net price trends in this category?  And then on Tyvyt, your PD-1 from Innovent, a Chinese company, you note that you'll file for approval in non-small cell lung in the U.S. this year. It's really hard for me to see how you gain any share with this product, given what would be a limited label and given payer and prescriber dynamics, where in things like Part B, you can't really compete on price.

So I think, as you're mentioning, it's an incredibly competitive market with the CDK4/6s. And so we and others continue to do what we need to do to make sure that patients get access to the right medicines. So we have obviously a strong strategy there. I can't comment on the specifics, but we do see competition. And really, what we're seeing -- I think you're seeing in Verzenio, what we're seeing is an incredibly nice trend growing in Q1.  As you saw, we had positive momentum with the U.S. strong share growth in March and we saw TRx of over 17% and NBRx of over 28%, so -- and this is despite, as you've noticed, a modest year-on-year TRx market decline. So I think what we're seeing is both from a payer strategy but also very much from a data strategy, we're seeing that Verzenio is growing its share nicely. And so I like how all of our different programs are coming together.  And obviously, the data in AZURE breast cancer reinforce the growing awareness that these medicines are different. But what really has been the focus for our execution has been capitalizing on positive OS data and making sure that people are aware of that and we're seeing more trial, more adoption as we go through that. So very pleased how all of our strategies with Verzenio are coming together.  On Tyvyt, yes, I mean, as you mentioned, it's a competitive space, obviously. And while I can't really comment on our commercial strategy prior to approval, you can be reassured that we're looking at ways to differentiate and really add value to this innovative class of medicines. So obviously, we know that there's certain commercial approaches we'll have to take to capture share as really a late entrant in the field, but we see opportunity here.  And obviously, this deal made sense with the partnership that we've had with Innovent and we're committed to the U.S. submission this year. And so more to come as we look to launch the product and share that strategy and how we intend to make an opportunity here.

In terms of our focus, it's -- let's not -- conscious is more related to looking at opportunities for growth. We have a long runway for Taltz. And so we do believe that Taltz is kind of at the foundation of our immunology strategy. We have numerous head-to-head studies in real world evidence to suggest that Taltz is a best-in-disease treatment. And as part of our growth strategy looking at mirikizumab in GI, we do believe that within the next 5 to 10 years, we can, across multiple mechanisms in those 3 specialized groups, dermatology, rheumatology and GI, have significant growth and become a top-tier immunology company. In terms of pricing, I think it's -- they're all very competitive fields.

And one year later, I'm proud of the innovation and resilience displayed by my Lilly colleagues to deliver against our objectives in new ways, while also mobilizing to develop treatments to help combat COVID-19. Looking at Q2 2021, we were encouraged by the increasing worldwide vaccination rates, as well as the underlying environment in most of our major markets. COVID-19 related stocking in Q1 followed by destocking in Q2 of last year, complicates quarterly performance comparisons. Therefore, looking at revenue growth in the first half of 2021 better reflects the underlying trends in our business. On today's call, we will provide year-over-year comparisons for both Q2 and the first half of the year. In the first half of 2021, we delivered 11% growth in our core business. This excludes COVID-19 antibody revenue, this was buoyed by strong volume driven growth across key brands in major geographies, including the U.S., Europe, and China.  Turning specifically to Q2, revenue grew 23% compared to Q2 2020, or 20% in constant currency. This performance was driven entirely by volume growth of 22 percentage points. As previously highlighted, in Q2 2020, we saw reversal of the $250 million pandemic related product stocking which occurred in Q1 2020. When excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue, the Q2 2020 COVID-19 related destocking and the sale of Cialis in China, our core business grew 12% for the quarter, up from 7% in Q1 on the same basis.  We were pleased to see sequential top line growth in the core business this quarter, signaling that healthcare systems continue recovery from the pandemic and the strength of our underlying business. Key growth products continue to drive our revenue growth and represent 54% of our core business this quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79.3% in Q2, or 79.7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. Excluding the FX impact, our gross margin increased by approximately 60 basis points compared to last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 29.4%, representing an improvement of nearly 140 basis points. We were pleased to see operating margin expand year-over-year and we expect continued expansion in the second half of this year.  On the pipeline front, we achieved multiple milestones since our earnings call in April, including receiving Breakthrough Therapy designation for donanemab and announcing our plan to submit to the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway; announcing positive Phase 3 results for tirzepatide SURPASS-4 trial with planned global submissions of the SURPASS program for tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes by the end of 2021; obtaining approval for Jardiance in partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim for HFrEF in Europe; and announcing positive Phase 3 results from the EMPEROR-Preserved trial for Jardiance in HFpEF, the first and only successful trial for this patient population; and initiating Phase 3 trial results for pirtobrutinib in mantle-cell lymphoma, tirzepatide in HFpEF and Verzenio in HR+ HER2+ early breast cancer, and now, prostate cancer.  We also continue to augment our pipeline with business development deals and announced the acquisition of Protomer Technologies. We welcome the Protomer team to Lilly and are excited to bring this technology to our diabetes pipeline. As we believe glucose sensing is one, maybe become the next generation for insulin treatment to improve the quality of life for people living with diabetes.  Lastly, on financials, we returned approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in the quarter and authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion in stock in addition to the $500 million authorization remaining under our 2018 share repurchase program. Moving on to slides 5 and 6, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 earnings call, including a May webcast, which highlighted our updated environmental, social and governance strategy and our sustainability efforts, as well as the launch of a new ESG website to serve as a comprehensive resource to provide increased transparency regarding the company's ESG goals and progress. Further, as part of our goal to become carbon-neutral in our own operations at our manufacturing plant in Kinsale, we recently inaugurated a new solar field, which is now the largest in Ireland. We also announced donations of COVID-19 therapies at no cost to low income and lower middle income countries, heavily impacted by the pandemic, and are proud of the impact we’re having around the world, as we work to combat COVID-19. Now, I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q2 results and to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2020.",753.0,397.0,19.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,0.04785894206549118,0.007556675062972292,0.015113350125944584,0.0,0.0,0.04030226700251889

Slides 7 and 8 summarize financial performance in the second quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. Revenue increased 23% this quarter compared to Q2 2020 or 12% excluding the items Dave mentioned earlier, representing strong momentum for our core business. Given the COVID-19 related stocking, and destocking seen between Q1 and Q2 of 2020, our first half performance of 11% revenue growth or 8% in constant currency, excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue is a more accurate reflection of underlying performance, and the sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue growth better represent the strength in our core business. Sequential revenue growth from Q1 to Q2 for core business, increase in vaccination rates in many major markets, and the majority of our sales reps now being back in the field, suggests the recovery from the pandemic was in line with our expectation for the quarter. We're particularly pleased with the strong volume growth across key brands like Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio and Jardiance. Verzenio in the U.S. grew nearly 6 percentage points in share total prescription exiting June, compared to the prior year. While Trulicity, Taltz and Jardiance increased their leading market share in the same period, while class growth accelerated. These products along with other key growth products represented 54% of revenue in the core business this quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 30 basis points to 79.3% in Q2. The decrease in gross margin percent was driven primarily by unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. Excluding this FX impact, gross margin as a percent of revenue grew 60 points this quarter. Total operating expenses grew 18% this quarter, compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 16% as the base period in Q2 2020 included a meaningful reduction in direct-to-consumer marketing and customer-facing expenses as health care system closed. R&D expenses increased 20% driven by investment in exciting late-stage pipeline opportunities, including pirtobrutinib, tirzepatide, donanemab and lebrikizumab. In Q2, we also invested approximately $85 million in COVID therapy’s R&D bringing our total COVID-19 R&D investment to approximately $300 million year-to-date. Net of COVID-19 R&D investment, operating expense growth was 18% compared to Q2 of 2020, and 10% for the first half of the year.  Operating income increased 29% compared to Q2 of 2020 and operating income as a percent of revenue was 29.4% for the quarter, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by revenue growth outpacing expense growth, and we expect continued margin expansion in the second half of 2021. Other income and expense was income of $5 million this quarter, compared to expense of $57 million in Q2 2020, driven by income from European patent settlements for Alimta.  Our effective tax rate was 14.4%, an increase of 350 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for both periods were reduced by net discrete tax benefit, with the lower net discreet tax benefit reflected in the second quarter of 2021. At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share increased 29% in Q2, and 22% year-to-date or 30% and 24%, respectively, in constant currency.  On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth across the world. And we are encouraged by the growth seen across most of our major geographies. This quarter U.S. revenue grew 18% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted for COVID-19 antibody revenue, and the Q2 2020 COVID-19 related destocking, the core business grew 8% in the U.S., up from 5% in Q1 on that same basis. These results were driven entirely by volume laid by Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio and Jardiance. Pricing was a 1% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, with increased rebates to maintain excellent access and higher growth in lower net price segments, largely offset by lower utilization into 340B segment, changes for estimates to rebates and discounts, and to a lesser extent, modest list price increases. The year-to-date price decline of 3% in the U.S. is in line with our net price expectations for the full-year.  Specific to Taltz in the U.S., performance for the quarter was in line with the expectation we described on the Q1 earnings call. And we were pleased to see a return to net sales growth this quarter, as volume gains more than offset price decline. Taltz Q2 performance benefited from a favorable change to prior estimates for rebates and discounts, and COVID-19 related inventory destocking last year. Excluding these items, Taltz still returned to double-digit growth in the second quarter. We believe the net price decline for Taltz in the first half of 2021 represents the underlying full price trend, and that continued volume growth will drive net sales acceleration in the second half of the year. While midterm price trends are currently stable, given increasing variability in payer mix, we continue to expect quarterly variability in reported U.S. net price changes across our business.  Moving to Europe, revenue grew 27% in constant currency. Excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue and the negative impact of Q2 2020 COVID-19 related customer buying patterns, revenue grew 14% in constant currency, driven entirely by volume growth, primarily for Trulicity, Taltz, Alimta and Olumiant. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of our business in Europe and expect continued growth in the second half of this year, excluding the expected impact from the loss of exclusivity for Alimta. In Japan revenue grew 2% in constant currency, driven primarily by the launches of Olumiant and Emgality. Revenue growth in Japan continues to be negatively impacted by the decreased demand for several products that have lost market exclusivity. But our key growth products grew 21% in Q2 in Japan, and represented approximately 50% of the business there. Recent surges of COVID-19 cases continue to negatively impact recovery in Japan. So, we currently expect improved revenue growth in the second half of the year, based on the uptake of newer products. In China, revenue grew 106% in constant currency, primarily driven by the divestiture of Cialis and the launches of Tyvyt and Trulicity. Excluding the impact from the Cialis transaction, our revenue in China grew 35% in constant currency. We are excited about the continued momentum in China as sales of new medicines have accelerated significantly in the past 3 quarters. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 5% in constant currency, driven primarily by our key growth products. At the bottom of the slide is the price rate volume effect on revenue for our June year-to-date results, which shows double-digit growth across all major geographies, except Japan. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive strong worldwide volume growth. These products drove nearly 17 percentage points of growth this quarter and continue to drive our overall performance and outlook. Slide 11 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated over $3.5 billion in revenue this quarter and made up 54% of our core business revenue in Q2. We're encouraged by the strength of our key products in Q2, collectively up over 34% compared to the same period last year. Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio and Jardiance, all continue to outgrow their respective classes. We are now tracking above pre-COVID-19 new-to-brand prescription baseline in the U.S. across all major therapeutic areas, with the exception of oncology and the CGRP antibody class, which we expect will continue to recover in the second half of the year. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first half of 2021, we invested $5 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of after-tax investments in R&D, business development and capital investments. In addition, we returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders in dividend and share repurchase. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we will continue to fund our growth of our key products and recent launches, invest in our pipeline and seek external innovation to augment our future prospects as well as returning capital to shareholders. Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on Slide 13. We are updating our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. While the COVID-19 pandemic is still impacting countries around the world, the pace of recovery from the pandemic was in line with our expectations in Q2. New-to-brand scripts in most of the classes in which we compete with are tracking above pre-COVID baseline in the U.S. and health care systems in most major markets are largely returning to normal as we enter the second half of 2021. We are increasing our full year revenue outlook for the core business by $200 million to reflect the strong performance and favorable impact from foreign exchange. We are, however, lowering the top end of the range for COVID-19 antibody revenue by $400 million and confirming the bottom end of that range. Moving forward, we expect COVID-19 antibody revenues to be less of a factor, as demonstrated by Q2 revenue declining to $150 million from $810 million in Q1. As variants are growing, we recognize the situations across the globe can evolve quickly and we plan to adapt as required. The net impact of these changes is an updated revenue range of $26.8 billion to $27.4 billion. Our outlook for non-GAAP gross margin percent remains unchanged at approximately 79%. On a reported basis, we've lowered guidance for gross margin percent to approximately 75% to reflect the impact of COVID-19 antibodies' excess inventory charge due to the combination of changes to current and forecasted demand from the U.S. and international government and near-term expiry of COVID-19 antibodies inventory. For research and development and SG&A, our guidance ranges remain unchanged. However, investment in promising R&D opportunities and exciting potential launches could push us towards the top end of our guidance range for both R&D and SG&A. Our non-GAAP operating margin guidance is now expected to be approximately 30%, driven by lower COVID-19 antibody revenue. However, it remains approximately 31%, excluding COVID-19 antibodies. Our GAAP operating margin is now expected to be approximately 24%. We are increasing our non-GAAP range for OID to an expense of $0 to $100 million to reflect the Alimta patent settlements in Europe I noted earlier. And our GAAP range is now income of $375 million to $475 million, which also reflects the impact of equity investment gains in the first half of the year. On a non-GAAP basis, our expected tax rate remains unchanged. And on a reported basis, we've lowered our expected tax rate to approximately 12%. Finally, the non-GAAP range for earnings per share remains unchanged at $7.80 to $8, while GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.73 to $6.93, primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 antibody inventory charge, the impact of equity investment gains and the Alimta patent settlements in Europe. We are confident in our ability to achieve our 2021 revenue goals for the core business while delivering mid-teens EPS growth. As we look at the underlying volume and share trends across our key growth products, we're confident in our full year outlook for the core business. And the pipeline successes in the first half of this year strengthen our conviction in our midterm and long-term outlook for continued top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline.",1884.0,1023.0,35.0,14.0,17.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.03421309872922776,0.013685239491691105,0.016617790811339198,0.0039100684261974585,0.0009775171065493646,0.020527859237536656
LLY,2021-08-03,2021-08-03,,2021-08-03,2021-08-03T09:00:00-04:00,0,2021-08-03,prepared,,Dr. Dan Skovronsky,"Thanks, Anat. 2021 has clearly been a productive year for R&D at Lilly, with continued strong progress in our pipeline and more potential catalysts on the way. Before I get into the broader portfolio update, I'll spend a few minutes highlighting several updates for our late-stage pipeline. I'll start with donanemab.  In Q2, the first amyloid lung agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease was approved under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway based on plaque lowering, which we believe reflects a shift in policy and sets a new path for Alzheimer's drug approval in the U.S. Lilly has long been an advocate for using biomarkers for amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles to identify patients for treatment and to monitor their response to therapy. We were pleased to see the FDA's conclusion that improvements in brain pathology are appropriate surrogates for clinical efficacy of Alzheimer's drugs. Based on data we've seen to date, we believe donanemab clears plaque faster and deeper than previously seen with other therapies and achieved complete plaque clearance in a majority of patients in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ after only limited duration of dosing. On the basis of the clinical evidence for donanemab, we were pleased to have received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA. At the Alzheimer's Association International Conference last week, we shared additional important analyses from donanemab TRAILBLAZER-ALZ. Briefly, I'll highlight several findings. First, we shared detailed exploratory statistical analyses comparing a variety of methods beyond MMRM and DPM, as summarized on Slide 14. We are pleased to see that these new analyses showed consistency of effects on primary and secondary outcomes across all statistical methods. Notably, all of the new analyses conducted showed good separation of treatment from placebo with statistical significance achieved for most endpoints at nearly all relevant time points measured. The robustness of the treatment efficacy across analytical methods increases our confidence in the potential clinical benefit of donanemab. While all statistical methods evaluated showed similar results, we note that the Bayesian disease progression model, DPM, closely reflected the raw observed data with the smallest standard error of any method. These results reinforced our hypothesis that DPM is a preferred analytical method for Alzheimer's trials. Additionally, we shared new data showing a relationship of amyloid plaque reduction and slowing of cognitive decline, as shown on Slide 15. To our knowledge, this is the first time such results have been available. When we initially reported the results of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ, we commented that at a group level, patients treated with donanemab showed both statistically better plaque reduction and statistically better slowing of cognitive decline at 18 months. But patient-level correlations between degree of plaque reduction and magnitude of slowing or cognitive decline were not significant. Now using a more sophisticated PK iADRS exploratory analysis that uses all of the available time course data, we showed a highly significant relationship between degree of amyloid plaque reduction and slowing of cognitive decline with P less than 0.001.  The Conrado model, shown here, was published in 2014 and is the result of efforts from the Coalition Against Major Diseases, CAMD, which collected placebo data from 15 randomized trials, including almost 4,500 participants. We introduced a treatment arm and incorporated percent amyloid plaque removal into this model to generate these results. And we believe this is important support for the use of amyloid plaque reduction as a surrogate for clinical efficacy. Notably, these data suggests that full clearance of amyloid plaque is required for highest efficacy as model results predict that patients achieving a 100% clearance of amyloid plaque could have more than 40% slowing of disease progression. Moving to Slide 16. We show an exploratory analysis looking at the effect of donanemab's plaque clearance on development of tau pathology. Tau pathology is an exciting biomarker since measures of Alzheimer's disease tau, unlike measures of amyloid plaque, have been correlated with clinical measures of cognitive and functional decline as noted here. Importantly, we have previously shown that donanemab-treated patients had slower accumulation of regional brain tau pathology than placebo-treated patients. This is an important finding because the amount of brain tau pathology is an excellent predictor of subsequent cognitive decline, a finding we observed with solanezumab in EXPEDITION3 and reproduced once again in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ. Now we've extended these results to show that the donanemab-treated patients who achieved complete clearance of amyloid plaque by 6 months had the most marked slowing of tau spread with nearly complete abrogation of progression in the frontal lobe. This reinforces our hypothesis that both deep and rapid amyloid plaque clearance are required for optimal drug efficacy. With this new data we presented last week, we have now linked degree of amyloid plaque reduction with degree of clinical benefit as well as degree of amyloid plaque reduction with degree of benefit on brain tau pathology, which is itself linked to clinical benefit. As displayed on Slide 17, we have just recently obtained data with our plasma tau biomarker, phospho-tau217. These new data demonstrate that amyloid plaque clearance with donanemab also resulted in reversal of the typical increases of phosphorylated tau seen in the blood with decreases from baseline of more than 24% and a change from the untreated arm with a P-value of less than 0.0001. This highly significant effect was seen as early as 3 months following initiation of treatment and could reflect a combination of less tau spread in the brain as well as less neuronal damage, which could account for tau leakage into the periphery. You can see on the right side of the slide that the effect on plasma tau is also correlated to a degree of plaque reduction with nearly every patient on treatment who achieved substantial plaque clearance showing flat or declining plasma phospho-tau. We are delighted to see the potential utility of P-tau217 not just for diagnosing disease, but also for monitoring treatment efficacy. We believe this could be another important contribution to the Alzheimer's field. Finally, on Slide 18, the significant relationship between plasma P-tau217 reduction and the slowing of cognitive decline is shown. This additional biomarker for efficacy links the donanemab mechanism of amyloid plaque clearance with positive effects on both clinical outcomes and tau pathology. These data suggest that patients who achieved a 30% decrease in P-tau217 from baseline showed more than 40% slowing of disease progression. The 3 main findings I just discussed. One, the consistency of clinical benefit across statistical methods; two, the correlation of plaque lowering the clinical benefit, the patients who achieved the greatest plaque clearance. I mean, the greatest opportunity for benefit; and three, the correlation between achieving complete plaque clearance and beneficial effects on tau pathology seen in the brain and measured in the periphery, which themselves are predictors for clinical benefit, strongly support the efficacy of donanemab and give us confidence that the remarkable levels of amyloid plaque clearance achieved by donanemab could translate into a meaningful breakthrough for patients. Moving to Slide 19. Accordingly, we've announced that we plan to submit to the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway before the end of this year based on data from completed studies, supplemented by additional safety data from the ongoing TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study. We remain focused on enrolling TRAILBLAZER-2 with the aim to replicate the positive results of TRAILBLAZER-1. Replication is important to overcome skepticism in the field. We hope that TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 will generate important confirmatory data for patients, physicians and payers and help us understand how to make sure the right patient gets the right duration of therapy at the right stage of disease. We are pleased to announce today that we have closed screening for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, with an adequate number of subjects now in the trial's screening process to fully enroll the study. Given that conducting and processing and imaging studies used during screening take several weeks to complete, we expect that the final subject to complete screening procedures and receive their first dose of donanemab or placebo by the end of the third quarter and the study will complete 18 months later. Given this progress in enrollment, we are confident that we will achieve the number and duration of drug exposures needed to appropriately characterize the safety profile of donanemab, allowing for regulatory submission by the end of this year. Discussions with the FDA are consistent with our prior statement supporting a submission before the end of 2021. I also want to provide a few comments on how we believe the national coverage determination opened for monoclonal antibody therapies targeting amyloid by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services may impact Lilly and donanemab. We believe this NCD is a clear opportunity to focus treatment on the patients most likely to benefit from amyloid plaque-reducing therapies. This would align with our goals, which have long been to use advanced diagnostic tools to identify the right patients that can benefit the most from amyloid-reducing therapies. We're particularly encouraged that our progress with the plasma P-tau217 assay could open up broader access to diagnostic tools. Still, despite the advances in diagnostics and the promise of donanemab, we acknowledge the current skepticism in the national discussion. And we hope that each drug will be evaluated by payers and prescribers based on its own data. This could be particularly important given the data I've shared today, which suggests that the degree of donanemab's amyloid plaque clearance relates to clinical benefit. In summary, we look forward to submitting donanemab to the FDA later this year with the potential to bring a robust amyloid plaque-clearing agent with limited treatment duration to market for early symptomatic Alzheimer's patients in 2022 with potential replicated clinical efficacy results expected in 2023. Transitioning now to Verzenio. On the last earnings call, we commented that FDA had asked to see an overall survival trend in favor of Verzenio in the monarchE trial in adjuvant breast cancer. We also noted that the OS data set is quite immature in the overall population, which makes interpretation challenging. We have now provided to the FDA additional data from the monarchE study, and we were encouraged to see continued strengthening of the primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival, IDFS, as well as consistent benefit in the key secondary endpoint of distant recurrence-free survival, DRFS. Of note, with this continued follow-up, we can now confirm this benefit extends beyond the 2-year Verzenio treatment period. We look forward to disclosing this new analysis at a medical meeting this fall. Our discussions with the FDA have focused on the prespecified subpopulation of patients with high Ki-67 index, a marker of increased cell proliferation. These patients have more aggressive disease and higher risk of relapse and thus are more mature for overall survival analysis. This group, which makes up approximately half of the monarchE population, are demonstrating an overall survival trend that favors the treatment arm. And based on FDA feedback, we expect an initial approval in adjuvant breast cancer in this population before the end of the year, in line with the current review cycle. Importantly, since the IDFS and DRFS hazard ratios favoring Verzenio are similar in patients with high and low Ki-67 index, we expect that the OS trend first seen in the Ki-67 high population will, in time, be replicated in the broader study population. We hope to expand the label to the entire enrolled population in the future once we see more overall survival events in the broader population. To date, regulators outside the U.S. have not raised the same questions on overall survival. Finally, moving to Olumiant. We shared in July that the FDA will not meet the PDUFA action date for the supplemental new drug application for atopic dermatitis. This delay is related to the FDA's ongoing assessment of JAK inhibitors. Patient safety is critical to Lilly, and we continue to further evaluate baricitinib's safety profile with ongoing randomized and observational safety studies. We're confident that the efficacy and safety data for baricitinib support a favorable benefit risk profile for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, and we look forward to continuing to work with the FDA during the remainder of the review process. We do not have additional information on timing or specific action date from the FDA, but we see potential for regulatory action for atopic dermatitis in the U.S. later this year. We're committed to bringing Olumiant to market in the U.S. to help meet the needs for people living with atopic dermatitis. Slide 20 shows select pipeline opportunities as of July 30, and Slide 21 shows potential key events for the year. There have been several additional major developments since our last earnings call and I'll cover these by therapeutic area. In May, we shared the positive results for tirzepatide in SURPASS-4 and announced that the SURPASS program met regulatory submission requirements for evaluating cardiovascular risk and confirmed our intention to submit a registration package for tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes to global regulatory authorities by the end of 2021. At ADA in June, tirzepatide was a large focus as we shared detailed data for the first 4 studies from the tirzepatide SURPASS program for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These results support our belief that tirzepatide may represent a substantial improvement in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, with early and unsurpassed improvements in A1c and body weight reduction across doses. We remain on track for global regulatory submissions before the end of this year. We are also excited about tirzepatide's opportunity across multiple indications, including cardiovascular outcomes, obesity, NASH and heart failure. In Q2, we initiated SUMMIT, our planned Phase 3 study for tirzepatide in heart failure. In July, we achieved an important milestone with Jardiance as the first and only medicine to achieve a primary endpoint for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF. The EMPEROR-Preserved Phase 3 trial met its primary endpoint and demonstrated significant risk reduction with Jardiance for the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in adults with HFpEF. This is a significant breakthrough for patients, and we're proud of what we've achieved here in partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim. We look forward to presenting detailed results from this study at the European Society of Cardiology on August 27, and we expect to submit this indication to regulators later this year. We also received approval in the EU for Jardiance HFrEF in June and expect regulatory action in the U.S. and Japan later this year for this indication. Additionally, we've advanced our GGG tri-agonist into Phase 2 for diabetes based on the promising data we shared at ADA, which supports the potential for differentiated efficacy from tirzepatide with respect to body weight while maintaining glycemic control. We also started 2 Phase 1 studies for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Lastly, we removed one of our oral GIP/GLP Phase 1 molecules from our pipeline. In oncology, we also continue to make important progress. Starting with Verzenio, we've initiated 2 Phase 3 studies since our last update. As planned, we've initiated an adjuvant study for HR+ HER2 breast cancer. And we are announcing today that a result -- as a result of a favorable blinded interim analysis for our Phase 2 trial in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we've also initiated the Phase 3 portion of this adaptive study. This action was based on a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC. The IDMC reviewed interim efficacy and safety data and concluded that the results met the prespecified expansion criteria based on radiographic progression-free survival and recommended advancing the study to the registrational Phase 3 stage. While Lilly remains blinded to the study, we are obviously very pleased with this development and have already begun dosing patients in the Phase 3 portion of this trial. Given that the expansion of Phase 3 includes the cohort of patients who are in the Phase 2 study, these data remain blinded and we will not be disclosing these at medical meeting. On the development front in oncology, we also made progress with pirtobrutinib and our oral SERD. We've initiated the Phase 3 study for pirtobrutinib in relapsed/refractory MCL monotherapy, executing on our commitment to a robust Phase 3 program for this molecule. Regarding oral SERD, we announced our plans to begin a Phase 3 study later in 2021 based on the Phase 1 results we shared at ASCO in June that showed an efficacy and safety profile in line with our expectations. In addition, we've now achieved the first human dose for our next-generation KRAS G12C inhibitor. Lastly, in oncology, we announced that the FDA has accepted our submission of sintilimab for non-small cell lung cancer. This submission is an encouraging start for our collaborative efforts with Innovent to make sintilimab available in countries beyond China. In neurodegeneration, in addition to donanemab news I just shared, we anticipate a Phase 2 readout for zagotenemab later this year and note that our GBA1 gene therapy asset from PREVAIL started a Phase 2 study in type 2 Gaucher disease. For immunology, we do not have additional significant updates in Q2 but we're looking forward to the Phase 3 readouts of lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis and baricitinib for lupus later this year. We also submitted baricitinib for alopecia areata in Japan. Lastly, we're moving our COVID-19 antibody therapy, LY-CoV1404, now known as bebtelovimab, into Phase 2 to address viral variants as part of our ongoing commitment to help combat COVID-19, if needed. To recap, Q2 was another positive quarter for R&D at Lilly, and we're excited about a number of further readouts and important milestones coming later this year, reflecting continued advances on behalf of patients suffering from disease.

Before we go to the Q&A, let me sum up the progress we've made during this quarter. We've seen strength in our core business in the first half of this year and increased momentum in Q2. This is driven by strong volume-driven growth across key brands in most major geographies. We're pleased to see sequential top line growth this quarter as well as year-over-year margin expansion. We made significant progress developing new medicines, and Q2 was another positive quarter for our pipeline as we announced plans to submit tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes and donanemab in Alzheimer's disease later this year as well as an approval for Jardiance in HFrEF, and as Dan outlined, positive results in HFpEF. We returned nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and completed $500 million in share repurchases, reflecting confidence in the ongoing strength of our business. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we are quite confident in our long-term prospects. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to share -- also like to share that we will hold a live investor meeting this December to highlight our R&D pipeline and progress for investors. We will also provide our initial 2022 guidance at this meeting. Given the limited physical space available, this event will have an accompanying webcast. We're hopeful that we can host this event in person, but are watching the evolution of the pandemic closely and we'll adjust accordingly to a virtual event, if needed.

In June, when we got the Breakthrough Therapy designation and we announced our expectations to file the BLA by the end of the year, that was based on our current understanding of the situation. Since then, things have progressed and I would say I'm even more confident now than I was then, that we should have an adequate package to support a complete submission by the end of this year. That includes, of course, our confidence that we have enough safety data to support a full evaluation of the benefit/risk of this drug. I think given limited duration of dosing, that helps as well as given the near completion now of enrollment in TRAILBLAZER-2. So it's our intent then to use combined safety data from the completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies as well as an early look at safety data from that ongoing Phase 3 study to support the package. Now of course, with any ongoing study, there's always risk. We don't know what that safety data is going to show. If it's consistent with safety data we've collected prior to the study, then I think we should also be confident that, that would support a positive benefit/risk assessment and put us on track to launch next year, as we said.",231.0,109.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.045871559633027525,0.009174311926605505,0.027522935779816515,0.0,0.0,0.03669724770642202

Can you talk a little bit about what markets do you expect to have proved by when? And how do you see the -- essentially, the entire patient passage through the use of donanemab going forward? And how does it differ from other amyloid β? And second, Basaglar seems to have a bit of a price drop this quarter. Can you discuss a little bit what you're seeing here?

Of course, this has been an area of great progress and great investment by Lilly. We continue to put a lot of emphasis here. I think objectively, you wouldn't have had the progress that we're seeing now in Alzheimer's disease had it not been for the ability to select patients for treatment and follow their response treatment with biomarkers. We don't see that as a research-only application. That should be available, those kinds of tools, to patients in the clinical -- who are being clinically treated for Alzheimer's disease in the future. So the status of the tools right now is both of the PET agents, the tau PET imaging with Tauvid that we use in the amyloid PET imaging with Amyvid. Those are both, of course, FDA approved and availability is somewhat limited right now, particularly for Tauvid, but could quickly be scaled with the launch of donanemab in the future. The third agent, which is probably the one that will be the most accessible to patients is the phospho-tau217 assay. Just as we continue to work on that assay, we're more and more impressed with its performance, its ability to identify patients, and even as I've shown today, track their progression. So this could be an answer for patients in the near term. We'll work hard to make that available. The bar is often lower for in vitro diagnostics and in vivo diagnostics. And I think there's good potential there. You asked about the patient flow once all these things are approved and available and presumably, that happens around the time that donanemab launched but not before. I think it would make sense and fit with medical practice if screening starts with some sort of simple cognitive exams by a physician to assess the patient's eligibility to early Alzheimer's, then they would move on to probably a blood-based test like phospho-tau217. If that's positive, that could either be a basis for treatment depending on if data support that or that could triage patients to PET scans for further evaluation.",368.0,159.0,5.0,1.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.031446540880503145,0.006289308176100629,0.05660377358490566,0.0,0.006289308176100629,0.025157232704402517

The performance that you're seeing in the second quarter of '21 has primarily been driven by pricing pressure and volume pressure in the Medicaid segment for Basaglar. Let me give you a little bit of color on how the Medicaid segment works. There's really 2 different types of states: those that have one signal unified preferred drug list across managed Medicaid and fee-for-service; and then others that have 2 different kind of unique preferred drug list across fee-for-service and a different one for managed Medicaid. What we've seen with Basaglar is when states decide to transition from having 2 preferred drug list to a unified preferred drug list, the economics for the state tends to favor the long-standing brands like Lantus. And so at that point, you see if we have one estate for -- in a managed Medicaid, you'll see the transition back to Lantus. So that's what you've seen driving our Q2 performance. Also in the managed Medicaid space, we have seen some pricing pressure there from Semglee that has required us to put more rebates on the -- in order to preserve volume for that. Now let me turn to kind of -- well, first of all, before turning to Semglee, know that the trends for Basaglar are fully baked into our guidance for the remaining part of 2021. Now let me turn to Semglee. First of all, understand that Semglee has gained interchangeability just with Lantus, not with Basaglar. So we don't anticipate any immediate impact on Basaglar. If you look at Semglee performance to date, they've captured about 2% share of market on the TRx and about 1% of new treatment starts. And the vast majority of that has come from Medicare Part A, which is hospitals, and the Medicaid segment. If you look at the price point for Semglee, it's currently at $99 per vial and about $150 for 5 pack of pens.  And with the move to interchangeability, we really support any actions that help patients with diabetes have more affordable out-of-pocket experience, which is why anyone, regardless of insurance status, is eligible to buy their monthly prescription of Lilly insulin for $35 or less through our Insulin Value Program. The Insulin Value Program has helped lower the average out-of-pocket costs for a monthly prescription of Lilly insulin, which also requires -- or includes multiple vials or insulin pen packs to $28.05 in the face of raising health insurance deductibles. So it's great that people living with diabetes has access to many options to lower their out-of-pocket costs.

Just your general thoughts on subcu dosing with antibodies to plaque, does that offer meaningful differentiation? At a high level, the benefits would seem quite obvious to being able to dose a drug at home. But some argue that it falls outside of a Medicare Part B framework, so maybe docs would be more inclined to stick with an infusion. And I believe you originally did not pursue subcu because you're worried you wouldn't get enough drug across the blood brain barrier. Roche has shown us that they can achieve that. So can we expect Lilly might also pursue a subcu? And would this require a formal Phase 3 study looking at plaque reduction as a primary endpoint? And then last quick question, why wouldn't something like P-tau217 become a separate meaningful revenue stream in its own right for Lilly?",147.0,74.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.05405405405405406,0.04054054054054054,0.0,0.013513513513513514,-0.02702702702702703

No, it's a good question and line of questions here on subcu dosing for anti-amyloid therapies. Probably 2 factors that we have taken into account in addition to the ones you mentioned. First and most important is efficacy for patients. And I think all of the data that we have so far suggest and support the notion that deep and rapid clearance is key here. And so if you're going to go to subcu dosing, it's important to make sure you do get enough drug in so that you can quickly get patients to clear. That's not going to always be possible with every drug. I think the second consideration with subcu dosing is the duration of therapy. So if it's a limited duration of therapy, the difference between IV and subcu, if it's once a month for 6 months, that's not a big difference between IV and subcu. Whereas if it's for the rest of your life, maybe that is a bigger difference. Finally, with respect to our plans for subcu, I do think it's an important option to offer patients, notwithstanding the previous comments, even for a limited duration therapy, some patients may prefer it, assuming you can get the same kind of efficacy. I think with donanemab, that's unlikely to be possible, and we're not pursuing it given the doses we need and the formulation we have. However, we have a second-generation antibody here that we call N3pG4, which I think is quite likely to be viable in a subcutaneous presentation. And that is our focus of development around N3pG4. My expectation around that is that it should be able to show comparable amyloid plaque lowering with subcutaneous dosing as donanemab does with IV dosing. If so, given the similarities between the drugs, we would seek an accelerated approval pathway for that drug in the future as sort of a subcutaneous version of donanemab, although it is a new enemy. Your second question was around the phospho-tau assay and whether that's a significant revenue stream. It's certainly conceivable and we haven't sort of thought through all of our commercial plans around that. But really for Lilly, and it may be significant for some companies, I think for Lilly, though, our focus is on removing barriers for treatment to patients. And so as we think about how we position diagnostics and therapeutics in the marketplace, our focus will be on really making sure that most patients possible can get treated appropriately.",432.0,183.0,2.0,4.0,10.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.01092896174863388,0.02185792349726776,0.0546448087431694,0.01092896174863388,0.0,-0.01092896174863388

There are clearly benefits in the short-duration treatment, like Dan said, with donanemab in a Part B. They're going to be watched closely by their physicians initially anyway. There are real and important side effects, which require imaging analysis for this class of drugs. And so it's an intensively managed disease. But through time, as we've seen with other classes, as comfort level will rise in primary care, in particular, in using therapeutic antibodies to treat Alzheimer's, a more convenient form available at our local pharmacy, perhaps for self-injection or injection by a caregiver, would be preferred. So our plans line up with -- in pursuing both those channels, although in early days, probably the intensive nature of the treatment and specialist nature will favor the infusion.

Just I guess my bigger question on donanemab is, how are you thinking about the role of Aβ antibodies maybe prior to definitive cognition data being available? So I guess do you see cognition data significantly expanding the market opportunity for these products? Or do you anticipate we're going to see broad usage, even in the event, let's just say, the additional cognitive readouts you see on donanemab were less definitive than what we saw in the Phase 2? I'm just trying to say, do you think the whole market at this point is just going to move to plaque regression or reduction or at least cognition is still very important, I think, in terms of the commercial opportunity? My second question was on the Verzenio update. I just -- just a 2-parter here. Just when do you think you'll have that incremental OS data for the other 50% of the population?

The first part is like how important is in the near term to have additional cognitive benefit data for amyloid plaque [lung] drugs. And then in the longer term, what happens if the confirmatory studies give a negative surprise. So in the short term, I'd just clarify that we have compelling clinical efficacy data for donanemab. The only trial that's going to be successful, a positive Phase II study and its primary endpoint showing cognitive benefits for donanemab, that's different, unique and exciting, published in the New England Journal, that's exciting. And I think that will be helpful even before we have the confirmatory data, being in that unique position. There will be some physicians, I'm sure, as are today, who still say, I don't want to use a drug until I have cognitive data. Fine, for those physicians who are willing to make that link between the surrogate efficacy data and the Phase II data in donanemab, if you believe that lowering amyloid plaque is the good thing to do, you're going to want the drug that lowers amyloid plaque the most. And I think that's an exciting aspect of donanemab as well. But then we come to the confirmatory studies. I think surely everyone have to acknowledge if for multiple sponsors, multiple drugs are all clearly negative, that would be a bad thing and we would retreat and say that this was a wrong way of thinking. I think that scenario is extremely unlikely. I think the most likely scenario is probably a mixed picture. Some drugs will be better than others. Some trials will reach significance, others might not. You've heard me speak about the confidence in our trial, but we have to see the data. I think in that scenario, that will strengthen -- that would be good enough to reinforce the notion that amyloid is an important surrogate and reducing amyloid is a good idea.",341.0,159.0,10.0,6.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.06289308176100629,0.03773584905660377,0.025157232704402517,0.0,0.006289308176100629,0.025157232704402517

And as Dan shared, we are incredibly pleased with what we're seeing out of Verzenio and the monarchE data and as he shared key endpoints, such as IDFS have continued to strengthen with further follow-up. And now we have two years of median follow-up. And so very pleased with that, and as he shared, we remain very confident there will be an OS trend favoring Verzenio in the broader population. So we would work with the FDA to expand our label to include these patients in the future. So obviously, this is event driven and so the timing of this will be determined by the event rate. So our next planned analysis is in the second half of '22, and this analysis will help us really further inform the timing of that final analysis. So as you commented, the overall survival data in the broader population is still immature. We still have less than 50% of the events needed to do that final OS analysis. But with what we're seeing, and again, strong performance in both the high and low Ki67, we remain confident to see this trend in OS favoring Verzenio to replicate. As far as Ki67, good news here is that this is really a familiar concept to physicians. It is already accepted as a prognostic factor in breast cancer. And it's really easily performed through an IHC assay, so very simple assay. And these are broadly available in the pathology labs. And the assay and the methodology that we used on monarchE is straightforward and proven to be accurate and really highly reproducible. So our belief is that oncologists will move to quickly adopt this in practice. And really, this clarity in patients with the highest risk, I think, will help to accelerate uptake in this setting.

Dan, I have three subparts. First, are you expecting to use interim data from your ongoing Phase III as part of the regulatory filing or during the review? Secondly, once the plaque is cleared, and I think 60% of patients have clearance by 12 months, what rate of onset of new amyloid plaque do you expect subsequently? And I'm just trying to understand your expectation on finite duration of dosing versus Biogen's opinion on continued dosing. And then finally, I'm also trying to reconcile the slide you showed on the nonlinear model, the Conrado model, suggesting a relationship between plaque decrease and a slowing in clinical progression. Are you saying there's a relationship? Or are you saying there's a causality? Because you might recall the New England Journal paper on your Phase II mentioned there was no association between plaque and clinical benefit at patient level 1, Biogen data suggested similar.

So the first question, you asked if we'd use interim data, I commented that we'll take a safety cut of data in the right way to support that submission. We don't plan to support that submission or do we see the need to support that submission with any looks at efficacy data. We have adequate efficacy data supporting the plaque lowering, which would be the basis of submission and approval under accelerated approval. Your second question is once plaque clears, how long does it take to come back? We have some data on that that was also presented at AAIC. I didn't highlight it this morning. But what we found is that off therapy, there is very slow, negligible, really, regrowth of plaque. I think if you sort of extrapolate it out, it might take 14 or 15 years or something like that to regrow amyloid plaque. The average age of patients in this trial is 75. And remember, we haven't fully halted progression of disease. So that doesn't feel like a near-term thinking on redosing will be necessary to keep them clear. But we'll have the ability to follow patients for many, many years and confirm that. Finally, I think you've correctly summarized the situation, which is that in our initial analysis, we didn't see a correlation and now we are reporting that we do see a correlation. Why is that? And of course, correlation can't prove causation so it is just a correlation. So why do we see it now? I think what we learned was quite interesting. And that's that the amount of plaque you remove depends a lot on how much plaque you have to start with. So if you only have 50 centiloids of plaque, there's only so much you can remove. If you have 100 centiloids of plaque based on, you can remove a lot more. So that turns out to be a pretty important compound in these kinds of correlations. The people who are -- have the more severe disease, perhaps longer duration, lower cognitive performance, older age, they might have more plaque at baseline, you can remove more but they still might be the worst progressors than people who have lower plaque and you remove less. So, I think our thinking initially, and maybe the field thinking, was a little bit backwards on this to look for a straight correlation between change and change without adjusting for all of those important baseline covariance.",424.0,184.0,0.0,8.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.03260869565217391,0.0,0.005434782608695652,-0.043478260869565216

Just going back to interim analysis for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ to not so much as used to support accelerated but to accelerate the readout for the full standard regulatory review, you're using a Bayesian disease progression model. Given that you're getting such a rapid clearance of Alzheimer's and that's linked to cognition in those patients who have that, do we have to assume that the follow-up is going to go out to the full 72 weeks? Or is there a possibility of early unblinding driven by efficacy in these patients?

So Andrew, you've asked a follow-up question here, an important one, on the potential even in the face of an accelerated review for accelerated approval, rather, for plaque lowering, whether we'd still be keen to get that kind of data a bit earlier by pulling forward an interim on TRAILBLAZER-2. We haven't ruled that out. We also don't have plans at this moment in time. I think we just need to see where we are and where the field is. But really, the -- maintaining a pristine Phase III trial would probably be a pretty high priority, particularly if accelerated approval gives the path for patients to have access to the medicine, then it becomes less urgent to get that data faster. So that's our current thinking. We've been working hard to make sure we have manufacturing capacity. I feel good about where we are to support launch and growth of donanemab and hopefully someday enter PG4 even to follow that. With respect to the commercialization of a P-tau diagnostic, there are different paths forward for an in vitro diagnostic, including a lab-developed test, or LDT, which can be done in a centralized location, for example, under CLIA.

I mean the first one on the national coverage decision, determination -- of course, that's important. When -- I think it was widely said that when the first approval came, it was quite broad an indication and then subsequently, the FDA working with the sponsor focused the patient population. I think there could still be opportunity for further focusing here. And that's one direction the experts at CMS may take. In that case, it could be requiring patients to have evidence of Alzheimer's pathology in the form of amyloid plaques or even tau pathology. As I said before, I think that matches our goals and what we think is right. It will take some time for that to play out probably over the next nine months or so and surely will be part of some of those discussions and share our data and thinking in the right way.

So with respect to the safety hurdle for donanemab or for any drug, really, it's having adequate exposures and duration of exposures in a broad population to be able to fully assess the benefit risk of a given drug. Now that's not a number that depends on the particulars of the drug, the population, of course, that you hope to treat the duration of therapy, of course, but also the particulars around the safety data and the efficacy data that you collect. So it would be nice and easy, I think, for sponsors and the FDA if there was a particular line in the sand that could be drawn. But as I said, it needs to be tailored for each drug. Based on our current thinking and analysis and discussions, as I said, I think we'll be there comfortably at the end of this year. Your second question was about -- I think it was about the duration of benefit as the TRAILBLAZER data mature. I commented on the duration of plaque lowering, which appears to be sustained. But I think, Geoff, you're getting at the duration of the cognitive benefit. We see a slowing of decline on average between that patients are still declining. You could ask, are the lines coming together or going apart? I think on some of the cuts to the initial data, there might have been a perception that the lines were not diverging at the later time points, I think, as I showed the additional statistical methods. And even as we look at the raw data, we're pretty comfortable here that we have lines that diverge over time. And therefore, I would expect that, that benefit of slowing would continue over time.

Let me just add just more general comment on pricing movement through the year, and I know we've had numerous conversations on this. And it does -- there does tend to be some volatility throughout the year. We do tend to see as patient flow through the health care system, more pronounced impact from the coverage gap in the second and third quarter of the year. So you see that dynamic throughout every -- really every year, as Mike said. And we built those assumptions into our full year guidance in terms of pricing dynamics for the year. And obviously, as we have more color and insight, we'll provide that. But right now, as we look at the full year estimate for U.S. pricing dynamic, it's consistent with what we previously discussed in terms of overall erosion. You saw 3% for the first half of the year, which is what you should expect for the full year.",159.0,72.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.0,-0.027777777777777776

So really wanted to kind of focus in on abemaciclib in prostate cancer and the update that was provided, I think in an abstract published at AACR, some of the details were provided with regard to the sort of threshold for moving forward as it relates to the hazard ratio. And it cites a hazard ratio of 0.64, 80% power. So with a P-value of 0.1 to, I think, continue advancing into the next stage of CYCLONE 2. So just wanted to clarify if that information is consistent and a driving force for moving forward, that would seem like a robust piece of information to have as we head into that. And then as incremental to that, just wanted to get a sense of the magnitude of the opportunity that Lilly believes this would represent for Verzenio going forward. And if there are, let's say, RB, so the retinoblastoma-related requirements for enrollment or any other biomarker requirements that could limit the size of the patient population. And then just as a follow-up. In terms of the NCD determination, just wanted to clarify if the pricing of the initially priced product would have any impact on Lilly's ability to independently price its own product, and if that's part of the reason why Lilly has argued for the products being treated independently as part of the NCD rather than as a class.",233.0,95.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.021052631578947368,0.031578947368421054,0.021052631578947368,0.0,0.031578947368421054,-0.010526315789473684

You're asking, Seamus, very smartly about the criteria to expand the study from our Phase II study to a Phase III study. I don't think we want to get into the very precise details on what that was. But you're correct that it was a very robust threshold. So we're excited to see that happen. We take Phase III starts very seriously at Lilly. We don't want Phase III failures. So when we have studies like this one, in any therapeutic area where we move from Phase II to Phase III without ever seeing the data, we set aggressive bars that data really have to match to move forward to Phase III.

I mean, as Dan said, we were incredibly pleased with this outcome and the recommendation by the DMC, and we set a very aggressive threshold on this adaptive design, and we're impressed that it met that threshold. And I think it just continues to be another example of how Verzenio differentiates from the competition. So the Phase III is open. It's already enrolling patients. We anticipate the results of the analysis in 2024. On the question on market size, so CYCLONE 2 is -- it's a metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer trial that really targets patients who have not yet received prior novel hormonal agent, so in earlier settings. So our initial research shows that the addressable market could be in the range of 25% to 50% of metastatic CRPC. So it's depending really a bit on how the market evolves with the use of NHAs in that earlier setting. So in the U.S., for example, based on that, we currently estimate between 7,000 and 14,000 patients would match that inclusion criteria for CYCLONE 2. And exciting in this space is that as long as being a high unmet need in a large patient population, there's also a long length of anticipated treatment duration. So this could be a treatment duration of up to two years or longer. So that's why we're particularly excited about this opportunity, is what it delivers there.

Our theory and I presented data today to support that theory, is that the amount of amyloid you remove and how quickly you do that is important for predicting outcomes.

It's doing everything that we expected it to do from a pharmacology safety and efficacy perspective. I think the data package that we presented at ASCO and that which we continue to see in the trial subsequent to ASCO, placed the drug in a vacuum on par with the best agents in development from our peers. But this is not a class of medicine that stands on its own period. This is really a development program. And I think as it relates to me-tooism, what I would say is that we're not interested in pursuing a me-too development program, and we stand by that statement. And frankly, our leadership position in breast cancer, in particular, with emerging Verzenio data as we've been talking about today, I think, put us in a unique position as it relates to this class of medicines. That all having been said, I also think we are a bit more cautious about the long-term role of SERDs in this landscape, and we're looking forward to some randomized data for the first time from some of our competitors later this year that I think will shed some light on where these drugs ought to fit in the overall treatment paradigm.",228.0,96.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.010416666666666666,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.0,0.03125

So first, just a follow-up with two parts on the Conrado model, one, do you know regulators view of this model?

I assume this is over 18 months. Would you expect that to continue to compound? I'm just wondering why only sort of 40% slowing when you've cleared all the plaque.

No, we don't have a regulator's view on the Conrado model. But we're encouraged that this model was built, as I said earlier, by the CAMD -- by data from the CAMD consortium and has been around for a while and used for various applications. What we're doing here, though, to be clear, is checking a patient's progression against what we predict their progression would be. So knowing all of their baseline factors, how much would the predicted to have progressed had they not been on drug versus how much did they actually progress. And so that's essentially what you're seeing in the graph. You're right, even with full plaque clearance, there's still some progression. There's only a 40% decrease. Now that's as big an effect as anyone ever has talked about in Alzheimer's disease, but surely, over time, we're going to need additional therapeutics for Alzheimer's beyond just clearing the plaque, at least in this stage of disease. And I think that's probably where tau therapeutics come into play. So that's how we think about it. I think earlier in the disease course, it could be quite different. Perhaps if you get it early enough, you could have 100% disease slowing in progression and in essence, no Alzheimer's, but that is yet to be proven.",237.0,98.0,3.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.030612244897959183,0.030612244897959183,0.061224489795918366,0.01020408163265306,0.0,0.0

Once again, Lilly had a very strong quarter growing our newest medicines around the world and continuing to advance significant potential new medicines in the late-stage development. While also building long-term opportunities through early-stage investments in technology and progress in early-stage programs. Q3 2021 was also a period where the resilience of our Company, our people and collaborators were tested by the pandemic. And again, they rose to the challenge on, personally recognize and thank my Lilly teammates for delivering such a strong overall performance. Innovating to maintain pipeline velocity, running our plans to meet the rapidly growing demand of medicines and continuing to serve our customers, whether be in person or online. Turning to our strategic deliverables on slide 4, Q3 revenue grew 18% compared to Q3 2020, or 17% in constant currency. This performance was driven entirely by volume. Volume growth was 17 percentage points. When excluding COVID-19 therapies, which includes revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and sales of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, revenue grew an estimated 11% for the quarter and year-to-date. Revenue attributable to our newer medicines grew over 35% and now represents nearly 60% of our core business this quarter, an important indicator for our long-term growth potential. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79% in Q3 or 79.3%, excluding for the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. Excluding this FX impact, our gross margin decreased by approximately 60 basis points compared to last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 30.5%, representing an improvement of over 400 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. And over 100 basis points of sequential improvement from Q2 of this year. We had a number of significant pipeline milestones since our last earnings call in August.  Including the FDA approvals for Verzenio and certain people with high-risk early breast cancer. And for Jardiance and collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Regulatory submissions for Tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes in the U.S. to which we applied a priority review voucher, as well as the EU, and Jardiance in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. We initiated a rolling submission in the U.S. for donanemab in early Alzheimer's disease and had positive Phase III readouts for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis. We also continue to augment our pipeline with these development opportunities as we continue to leverage external innovation to build our discovery capabilities with a focus on new modalities at Lilly. In Q3, we announced a research collaboration and licensing agreement with Lycia Therapeutics to utilize their proprietary protein degradation technology. Finally on financials, we distributed nearly $800 million to shareholders via the dividend this quarter. Moving to slides 5 and 6, you'll a see list of key events since our Q2 earnings call, including issuing the company’s first sustainability bond with proceeds allocated toward environmental projects, including pollution prevention, energy efficiency, and renewable energy, as well as social projects to increase access to essential services and social economic advancement and empowerment.  We announced a series of leadership and organizational changes this quarter. Recent positive data readouts this year led us to the natural decision to increase our focus on immunology and NeuroScience and to unify the Loxo Oncology and Lilly Oncology organizations. We believe these changes enhance our ability to execute on a broad range of exciting commercial and pipeline opportunities. I'd like to welcome Jake Van Arden, to Lilly's Executive Committee, and look forward to Ann, Patrick and Jake continuing their leadership in their new roles. They'll be focused on increasing our competitiveness in their therapeutic areas and growing our existing medicines while also launching our late-stage pipeline of new medicines which could benefit patients across a diverse set of medical conditions.  Similarly, I'm grateful for Ilias (ph) continued leadership and look forward to him leading our growing international business. Finally, I would like to thank [indiscernible] for his impact on our Company across more than three decades of his commitment to patients, to development of our industry-leading commercial capabilities and his relentless focus on execution and mentorship of countless Lilly leaders. Kudo (ph) thank you for your service to our Company. We have a deep leadership venture at Lilly. They're smart, they're energetic and experienced. And I know they're as excited as I am to take Lilly to another level in the decade ahead. Now I will turn the call over to Anat to review our Q3 results and provide an update on our financial guidance for 2021.",754.0,402.0,26.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,0.06467661691542288,0.012437810945273632,0.014925373134328358,0.0024875621890547263,0.0024875621890547263,0.05223880597014925
LLY,2021-10-26,2021-10-26,,2021-10-26,2021-10-26T09:00:00-04:00,0,2021-10-26,prepared,,Anat Ashkenazi,"Thanks, Dave. Slide 7 and 8 summarize financial performance in the Third Quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. Revenue increased 18% this quarter compared to Q3, 2020 or 11% excluding the items Dave mentioned earlier, representing strong momentum for core business, despite the impact of Alimta's OUS [indiscernible] We continue to be pleased with the strong volume growth across key brands like Trulicity, Paul's, Verzenio and Jardiance as our key growth products made up nearly 60% of our core business during the quarter.  Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined ten basis points to 79% in Q3. Favorable products mix excluding COVID-19 therapies, and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold were more than offset by lower gross margin on COVID-19 therapies. Total operating expenses grew eight percent this quarter, compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased one percent while R and D expenses increased 17% driven by significant investments in exciting late-stage pipeline opportunities, including the non [indiscernible], [indiscernible]and [indiscernible].  We also invested approximately $50 million in research and development for COVID-19 therapies in Q3, bringing our total COVID-19 R&D investment to approximately 350 million year-to-date. Operating income increased 37% compared to Q3 2020. And operating income as a percent of revenue was 30.5% for the quarter, an increase of 420 basis points compared to the prior year with sequential growth for second straight quarter. This increase was driven by revenue growth, outpace, and expense growth, and we expect continued margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Other income and expense were expense of $7 million for this quarter compared to income of 10 million in Q3 2020. Our effective tax rate was 14.3%, a decrease of 70 basis points compared with the same quarter last year.  The lower effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2021 was driven by a mix of earnings and lower tax jurisdiction, partially offset by a decrease in net discrete tax benefit compared to the same period in 2020. At the bottom line, we delivered strong growth as earnings per share increased 38% in Q3, 2021. On slide 9, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth, and we're encouraged by the growth seen across the world. This quarter U.S. revenue grew 26% compared to third quarter of 2020. Adjusting for revenue from COVID-19 therapies, revenue grew 14% in the US. This increase, driven largely by volume, was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, and Verzenio.  The higher net realized price in the U.S. this quarter was driven by lower utilization in the 340B segment. Unfavorable changes to estimates for rebates and discounts for Trulicity in the third quarter of 2020 and modest list price increases, partially offset by increased rebates to maintain broad patient access for our medicine. Our year-to - date U.S. net price decrease of 1% is in line with the low-to-mid single-digit guidance we gave last December, and our full-year outlook is consistent with those expectations.  Our 340B limited distribution program began September 2020, and so the fourth quarter of 2021 will be the first full quarter where its impact will also be including the base period when calculating year-over-year price changes in the U.S. Given the increase in variability in payer mix, we continue to quarterly variability in reported U.S. net price changes across our business. Moving to Europe, revenue grew 3% in constant currency, excluding the impact of the first full quarter of loss of exclusivity for Alimta. Revenue grew 16% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Taltz and Verzenio. We're pleased with the momentum of our business in Europe and expect continued growth, excluding Alimta.  In Japan, revenue decreased 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by the decline of post-patent products. Revenue in Japan continues to be negatively impacted by decreased demand for several products that have lost market exclusivity. Now, including Alimta as well as the by -- by the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, our key growth products grew 12% in Q3 in Japan. We expect improved revenue growth in Japan moving forward based on the uptake of these newer products. In China, revenue grew 30% in constant currency primarily driven by continued uptake of Tyvyt and Trulicity. We're excited by the significant growth we're seeing in China with sales of new medicine continue to drive growth there.  Revenue in the rest of the world increased 16% in constant currency, driven primarily by our key growth products. At the bottom of the slide is the price rate and volume effects on revenue for our September year-to-date results, which shows double-digit growth across all major geographies except Japan. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive strong worldwide volume growth. These products drove 15 percentage point of growth this quarter and continue to drive our overall performance and outlook. Slide 11 highlights the contributions of our key growth products.  In total, these brands generated nearly $3.9 billion in revenue this quarter, and made up 58% of our core business revenue. We are encouraged by the strength of our key growth products in Q3, collectively up over 35% compared to the same period in prior year. Trulicity, Verzenio and Jardiance all continued to outgrow their respective classes. and we're pleased with Taltz growth driven by increased access. On slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first nine months of 2021, we invested $7 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays, and capital investments. In addition, we returned over 2.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and have repurchased $500 million in stock.  We will continue to fund the growth of our key products and recent launches, invest in our pipeline, seek external innovation to augment our future growth prospects, and return capital to shareholders. Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on slide 13, we're updating our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. We're increasing the full-year revenue outlook by 200 million at the top end of the range, and 400 million at the lower end of the range to reflect additional COVID-19 antibody revenue. And the outlook for a core business. COVID-19 antibody revenue expectations are roughly 1.3 billion based on the existing U.S. government purchasing agreements for additional doses of etesevimab in Q3 and Q4.  The net impact of these changes is an update revenue range of $27.2 billion to $27.6 billion, up from the previous range of $26.8 billion to $27.4 billion. Our outlook for GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin percent remains unchanged. For research and development and SG&A, our guidance ranges remain unchanged. As we noted last quarter, investments in promising R&D opportunities and exciting potential launches are expected to push us to the top end of our guidance range for operating expenses. Our reported and non-GAAP operating margin guidance is unchanged, Excluding the impact of COVID-19 antibodies, non-GAAP operating margin remains approximately 31%. Our non-GAAP ranges for other income and expense and our expected tax rate remains unchanged as well.  On a reported basis, other income and expense is now expected to be expense in the range of 250 million -- 250 million, reflecting the impact of the charges associated with a repurchase of debt and net mark-to-market losses on investments in equity securities. In the Third Quarter of 2021, the 2021 effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 11% on a reported basis, reflecting the tax impact of the charges associated with the repurchase of debt and acquired IP R&D, as well as unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments on investments in equity securities in the third quarter of 2021. Finally, the non-GAAP range for earnings per share has been raised to 795 to 805, while the GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.38 to $6.48. At our Investor's Day in December, we will share our initial 2022 guidance.  Today, before I turn the call over to Dan for the R&D update, I'd like to provide a few reminders on the pushes and pulls across the P&L as we begin thinking about the next year. In Q3, we saw the initial impact of Alimta's OUS patent expiry in Europe and Japan. Next year, we will see its full-year impact, as well as the U.S. patent expiry, with limited launches from a single generic Company in Q1 before the full launch of generic entrants starting in Q2. As for revenue from COVID-19 therapies, we intend to reflect in guidance our expectations related to signed purchase agreements for COVID-19 antibodies.  Currently we expect minimal revenue from COVID-19 therapies in 2022 leading to more difficult year-over-year comparisons. As we do this year, we will provide commentary on our financials excluding the impact of revenue and certain expenses from COVID-19 therapies to enable more healthful year-over-year comparison of the performance of our core business [indiscernible] major use drugs price and reform, our 2022 and mid-term outlook continues to be mid-single-digit net price erosion in the U.S. and globally, is the impact of lower utilization of 340B segments moved into the base pace period as we enter Q4, 2021.  we continue to invest in our bright future as we advance promising R&D opportunities in scale up to support exciting potential launches from our late-stage pipeline. While these investments may pressure operating margin in the near term, they are critical to maximizing pipeline opportunities to help sustain top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion over the mid to long-term. Now I will turn over the call to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline.",1598.0,881.0,27.0,10.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,0.03064699205448354,0.011350737797956867,0.011350737797956867,0.0011350737797956867,0.0,0.019296254256526674
LLY,2021-10-26,2021-10-26,,2021-10-26,2021-10-26T09:00:00-04:00,0,2021-10-26,prepared,,Dr. Dan Skovronsky,"Thanks, Anat. Like 2020 before it, 2021 continues to be a very productive year for R&D at Lilly. Before I get into the broader portfolio update, I'll highlight several updates from our late-stage pipeline. Starting with Tirzepatide. We shared detailed results from tirzepatide SURPASS-4 Study at EASD this quarter. SURPASS-4 is the largest and longest surpass trial completed to-date. And we were encouraged by the continued hemoglobin A1C and weight control, which participants experienced even past the initial 52-week treatment period, and continuing up to 2 years. Looking at slide 14, this shows the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1C over time during the study.  A1C reduction plateaued by roughly 24 weeks and was maintained at 52 weeks and thereafter, to 104 weeks across all the Tirzepatide doses. While in the insulin glargine comparator arm, A1C began to increase after 52 weeks. Durability of A1C control is a challenge for type 2 diabetes treatments. While the 104-week data isn't a definitive answer as to whether Tirzepatide could potentially offer even longer-term durable blood glucose control, these data certainly are encouraging. Moving to Slide 15, as you can see, weight loss plateaued at approximately 52 weeks and was maintained thereafter, such that at 2 years, weight difference at the highest dose was approximately 15% compared to insulin glargine.  We've seen in previous incretin therapy trials conducted with GLP-1 s a further increased impact on weight reduction in participants with obesity without type-2 diabetes compared to studies in participants who do have type two diabetes, such as this one. It will be interesting to see if this trend also extends to the dual agonism of Tirzepatide, which has demonstrated weight reductions in type two diabetes trials beyond what has been shown by GLP-1s to-date. We clearly are excited about the weight loss potential here and we believe the data to date bode well for upcoming readouts in obesity, starting with surmount one which reads out next-year. Tirzepatide represents a new class of medicines.  And we're focused on continuing our significant investment for patients with type two diabetes, obesity, and related metabolic disorders who may benefit from Tirzepatide. Moving to slide 16, today we announced the U.S. submission for Tirzepatide and Type II diabetes, and that we used a priority review voucher with the intention of bringing this investigational treatment to patients as quickly as possible. We are delighted that the continued progress for this novel dual agonist incretin and hope to obtain approval in the U.S. by the middle of next year. Moving to donanemab, we have several important updates for this program. First, in the U.S., we initiated a rolling BLA submission to the FDA for accelerated approval in early Alzheimer's disease.  We intend to complete the submission in the next few months and expect regulatory action in the second half of 2022. We've also completed the original planned enrollment of 1,500 participants for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2. And based on the pre -specified 18-month primary endpoint, expect to have topline results by the middle of 2023. We've added a separate single arm addendum for safety exposures to TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, which has already enrolled more than 300 patients and is continuing to enroll rapidly. This addendum will provide us with additional safety data to support the rolling submission. Moving to TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, this is a prevention study for cognitively unimpaired individuals who already have Alzheimer's brain pathology but don't yet have clinical symptoms. We're excited to report that we have already initiated screening.  This pioneering trial has multiple novel elements to reduce research subject burden, including the use of our phospho-tau217 blood assay currently in development to help detect Alzheimer's disease pathology in the patient screening process. Video call technology for assessing cognitive function in the subject's home, and a large network of infusion centers that allow subjects to select the site most convenient to them in a decentralized clinical trial paradigm. We also announced today our plans to conduct a head-to-head Phase 3 study comparing donanemab to Aducanumab to assess superiority of brain amyloid plaque clearance in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.  The co-primary endpoints will evaluate complete amyloid plaque clearance as measured by [indiscernible] pure FAT and PET scan, and will assess superiority on bringing amyloid plaque clearance in the total population, and also the intermediate [indiscernible] population. This study TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4 is expected to begin enrollment this year. And we expect to share primary endpoint data in the second half of 2022. We're encouraged with the progress we've made with the [indiscernible] and with its potential to positively impact patients with high unmet medical need. We have of course, followed progress in the Alzheimer's disease landscape since our last call, and are watching closely as CMS 's national coverage determination process plays out. We're committed to facing the challenges of effectively communicating donanemab 's, clinical data, and value proposition and to ensuring that the diagnostic and patient management ecosystems are adequately well - prepared. Given the current environment, we think it's reasonable to have modest expectations for the scale of patient impact for anti-amyloid therapies available under accelerated approval prior to the readout of their definitive Phase III data. Assuming potential accelerated approval for donanemab in the second half of 2022, are expected TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 phase three readout by mid-2023 would follow quickly, meaning the window of accelerated approval without definitive Phase II data is likely to be brief. Assuming positive Phase three results, we should be confident in the mid and long-term opportunity for donanemab if approved. Moving on to Verzenio. In-line with the expectations I outlined last quarter, we were pleased with Verzenio 's recent FDA approval as the first and only CDK4/6 inhibitor, in combination with endocrine therapy, for adult patients with HR-positive, HER2 -negative, node-positive early breast cancer, who are at high risk of recurrence with the Ki-67 index of greater than equal to 20% as detected by an FDA-approved test. This approval in the Adjuvan setting represents the first new addition to endocrine therapy and Adjuvan treatment of HR-positive QAR2 -negative breast cancer in nearly two decades.  We're delighted to bring this important new treatment option to patients. Also, we recently shared updated data from the entire monarchE study at the ESMO Virtual Plenary meeting and co-published these data in Annals of Oncology. These data, which reflect additional follow-ups since our last public presentation, highlight the robustness and the effect size we're seeing for Verzenio in the Adjuvan setting. Notably, with a median follow-up of 27 months, we are pleased to see both IDFS and DRFS benefit extend beyond the two-year study treatment period. These data are not only important for patients, but also to help dispel concerns that the curves would come back together over time.  We're clearly observing -- we've clearly observed continued separation of the curves, if not expanding separation. Since the Adjuvan approval two weeks ago, there's been questions regarding why the FDA approval applied only to a subset of the study population. As previously communicated, overall survival was a secondary outcome measure for the monarchy study. And an important component of the FDA's review. But we do not typically publish immature overall survival data, we feel it's valuable to address these important questions about the difference between the enrolled study population and the approved indication. As a result, while the overall survival data remain immature, we do plan to publish the [indiscernible] data from the additional follow-up analysis, with cut-off of April 1, 2021, in a medical journal in the coming days.  These data will show what we have observed thus far for overall survival trends in the ITT population compared to the approved population. We'll continue to follow patients in the ITT population for more mature overall survival data. If positive OS trend emerges in the ITT population, we plan to work with regulators to expand our Adjuvan indication. Importantly, the collective results from Verzenio clinical development program have demonstrated a differentiated CDK4/6 inhibitor profile. And we look forward to continued investment in Verzenio for breast and prostate cancer and are excited about the opportunity to serve more patients.  Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 22 and Slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. They've been several important developments since our last earnings call, and I'll cover these by therapeutic area. In oncology, in addition to the exciting news for Verzenio, we continue our investment in Pirtobrutinib Phase III program with an additional study starting chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including fixed duration Pirtobrutinib plus Venetoclax and rituximab in relapsed or refractory patients. We plan to start a study in first-line treatment compared to bendamustine plus rituximab before year-end. We prioritize this first-line study rather than the head-to-head study evaluating superiority compared to brutinib as we think this first-line study could provide a faster pathway to bring Pirtobrutinib to patients in the first-line setting.  We expect the head-to-head brutinib CLL study to start in the first half of 2022. We look forward to sharing updated dataset from the Phase 1-2 BRUIN study at a medical meeting later this year, we plan to provide a regulatory update for Pirtobrutinib at our Investor Day in December. [inaudible 00:28:55] our oral [indiscernible], also moved into Phase 3, with the start of its monotherapy study compared to Exemestane or fulvestrant's. Finally, we also publicly identified and presented preclinical characterization for two new agents at the Molecular Targets meeting this month. LOXO 783, which is a highly mutant selective allosteric PI3K alpha inhibitor, and LOXO 435 which is a highly isoform -selective FGFR3 inhibitor.  We look forward to filing IND for both programs in 2022 and subsequently moving them into the clinic. In Diabetes, In addition to the Tirzepatide update, we obtained U.S. approval for Jardiance and HFpEF, presented detailed results from the emperor preserved study at the European Society of Cardiology and submitted for HFpEF in the US and Europe. We're excited about the opportunity Jardiance has to improve outcomes for patients across type II diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. We also started Phase II studies for our GLP-1 non-peptide agonist in collaboration with Chugai in type II diabetes and In obesity, and look forward to sharing some Phase I data from this molecule in December.  In immunology, we were delighted to have multiple positive Phase 3 readouts for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis, and look forward to the readout of the maintenance data from the ADvocate 1 and 2 studies in the first half of next year, ahead of global submissions expected by the end of 2022. We're pleased with our progress in immunology this year with positive Phase 3 readouts for mirikizumab and lebrikizumab, and look forward to sharing more about our next-generation of early phase immunology assets in December. In neurodegeneration, our anti-tau antibodies Zachatenamab recently concluded its Phase 2 study in early symptomatic Alzheimer's. Zachatenamab failed to meet the primary endpoint and was unable to modulate tau spread in the brain. The placebo population progressed as expected.  While this negative outcome was disappointing. And we're discontinuing development for Zachatenamab, we remain committed to Tao as a high conviction target in Alzheimer's disease, and plan to continue studying Tao biology, including inhibition of tau aggregation with a small-molecule OGA inhibitor currently in the clinic. In the pain therapeutic area, in collaboration with Pfizer, we discontinued the global clinical development program for tanezumab, following receipt of a complete response letter from the FDA for tanezumab in osteoarthritis pain and a negative opinion adopted by the CHMP.  And finally, the FDA expanded the emergency use authorization for Bamlanivimab and Aducanumab administered together to include post-exposure prophylaxis in certain individuals for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To recap, Q3 was another positive quarter for R&D at Lilly, continuing the positive momentum we've seen with a steady stream of significant pipeline advancements over the last couple of years. As we move closer towards our goal of delivering more faster best-in-class treatment options to patients in areas of unmet need. Now, I'll turn the call back to Dave for some closing remarks.",2055.0,1085.0,45.0,24.0,14.0,6.0,2.0,10.0,5.0,2.0,0.041474654377880185,0.022119815668202765,0.012903225806451613,0.005529953917050691,0.0018433179723502304,0.01935483870967742

Before we go to Q&A, let me sum up the progress we've made during the quarter. We have seen continued strength in our core business through the first 9 months of the year, with double-digit volume-driven revenue growth net of COVID-19 therapies and strong performance across key brands. We're pleased to see sequential and year-over-year operating margin expansions, as well as strong non-GAAP earnings growth. We have made significant progress developing new medicines. And Q3 was another important quarter for our pipeline as we announced the submission of Tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes, the initiation of a rolling submission for donanemab in the U.S. for early Alzheimer's disease, key life cycle approvals, and submissions for Verzenio and Jardiance, and positive Phase 3 readouts for lebrikizumab.We returned nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends in Q3, reflecting confidence in the ongoing strength of our business. As we move toward the close of 2021, we are confident in our long-term growth prospects. While the past year has seen tremendous advances in our late-stage pipeline, at our Investor Day in December, we look forward to sharing information with you regarding the next generation of assets that we believe will enable us to sustain the flow of innovative medicines to patients and augment our future growth prospects.

I guess the first one for me is just on some of the 2022 comments. know you're not giving formal guidance yet, but should we be thinking about margin expansion next year from the roughly 30% or so margins that are implied in this year's guidance? I'm just trying to get my hands around how meaningful of a step-up an OpEx we should be thinking about supporting new, these major new launches coming next year. And the second one was just one related to bibs rollout of aduhelm, it's obviously been a challenging launch.  Are there learnings here or just changes about how you're thinking about your go-to-market strategy for donanemab and I know Dan, you made some comments in the remarks, but should we be thinking about much in the way of revenue at all for donanemab.

And until there is definitive phase three data, we do believe that we should really expect modest use of these medicine. Now fortunately, as Dan said, for donanemab, this confirmatory data comes quickly in mid-23 for travelers are all too. And so this will be the opportunity to really help patients on a more significant scale. Now, some of the opportunities here, certainly pursuing accelerated approval is really important, both to provide early access. but also to let us begin addressing some of these infrastructure challenges ahead of the Phase three data. We need to build out the diagnostic ecosystem, particularly PET scans and blood tests. We need to make sure that there's adequate infusion capacity. And then very importantly, we need to ensure that there's reimbursements so that the appropriate patients can have access to donanemab. So these are going to be our areas of focus now through our phase 3 window. We're confident in our ability to address these infrastructure challenges over time. And I would say by clearing plaque faster and deeper, we believe that as well as identifying the right patients, we've optimized the chances for showing compelling benefits in the Phase III, which is we said is what was going to show significant uptake in the class.

For donanemab, would you expect completion of the rolling submission by the end of this year, and is there a regulatory threshold you need to hit in terms of the safety exposure, I'm just trying to think of the number of patients that you have to get exposed to it and then for Zachatenamab, what are the next steps here? Is it moving to another anti-tau asset altogether, or do you want to optimize monotherapy Zachatenamab, or maybe even move forward in combination with donanemab?

The first is just on the timing of the completion of the donanemab rolling submission. I think you can assume we chose our words carefully here in the call prepared remarks on the timing, you're driving out like what's the regulatory hurdle with respect to safety exposures. You're right, that's the key gating factor on timing. You've heard we've enrolled a lot of patients in the clinical trials, including patients in safety addendum. So, we're extremely confident we'll reach that safety exposure hurdle.  I guess, looking forward, there's probably two risks or question marks. One is just around the timing of exactly when do databases get locked and data get cleaned and submitted to the FDA. So that's why we're a little vague on timing here. I think the second one of course that we don't know and won't know until all that data is in, is what are the safety that actually show. And so the assumption here, of course, is that they continue to be consistent with what we've seen in Phase 2. So if those things work out, then I think that'll be the opportunity to talk a little more specifically about the data.  With respect to zagotenemab, look, I think we have here a very potent anti-tau antibody designed against what we believe is an important species of aggregated tau delivered at a relatively high doses for any monoclonal antibody, and we were unable to slow the spread of tau progression in the brain. So as present, I don't see a path forward for this antibody and I would be reluctant to invest in really any anti -tau antibody, given what we've seen here, Tau is still a great target, it's just hard to hit it with a monoclonal antibody, I think, given that most of the tau that we care about is inside of cells.",335.0,155.0,3.0,6.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01935483870967742,0.03870967741935484,0.05161290322580645,0.0064516129032258064,0.0,-0.01935483870967742

I think as you look at donanemab what's incredibly important is that we had a positive phase 2 study that cleanly met its primary endpoint, showing cognitive benefits for donanemab, as well we're able to share that we had limited duration dosing to plaque clearance and so we believe that this is going to be important for the decisions that physicians and payers make. So I believe the donanemab data is incredibly strong. And then as I said, following quickly the Phase 3 confirmatory data, which I think is important, and all of this being published in the New England Journal of Medicine. So as we're talking to thought leaders and physicians, I do believe that they see the strength of the data that we brought forward in donanemab, and I think that's been a challenge that they've had with some of the competitive space. So I do think that data is one thing on their minds. I think it's well the NCD is playing a role, obviously that will be resolved before we launch and that will be ready for any of the potential out comes there. And I have been working closely with them along the way to make sure that they understand the donanemab data, particularly the rapid clearing of plaques as well as the limited duration dosing that offers we think benefit to them as well. So, it's been a good conversation with them. So far, we really look forward to seeing what they have to say CMS has the same in January and then launching with the strong datasets as Dan said in the second half of next year.",304.0,122.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.07377049180327869,0.02459016393442623,0.02459016393442623,0.0,0.0,0.04918032786885246

First, it's commonly said that this upcoming decision will pertain to the whole ABA class. I struggle to see how that can realistically be the case, because that decision will be made on only 1 Company's mixed Phase 3 data, and there's still other really important informative Phase 3 datasets that are on the come. So wouldn't be NCD, whatever it is initially potentially be revised later as CMS has more information from these additional trials. And then second, if this is indeed a decision that pertains to the whole class, and presumably Lilly has a view on what will happen in January. Do you expect CMS will say that Aduhelm and the class more broadly should be covered in a way that will be commercially meaningful. One can envision that there could be lots of restrictions that might impact to limit the commercial market opportunities.",165.0,72.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.06944444444444445,0.013888888888888888,0.027777777777777776,0.0

So CMS has been clear that the NCD, as they are running the process is to cover the class. Now as I said, we are actively participating in the process, including we provided oral comments in July. And additional written comments in August, and we and I'm sure others as well have been meeting with CMS throughout the process to share our specific data and ensure that the differences in these medicines are understood. And so we've asked them really to evaluate each drug based on their own data. And this is, I think, as I said, particularly important considering that there are some differences between these. We share the data later in the air subsequent to the original readout that the degree of donanemab plaque clearance relates to clinical benefit which I know is very important to CMS in this decision as well as the limited duration dosing. So we really look forward to seeing what they have to say in January, and what readout will look like. We do acknowledge there's a lot of skepticism in the national discussion. And so we do really hope and we'll continue to influence that we think it's drugs should be evaluated by CMS, by payers and prescribers on their own data. It is possible that NCD, the NCD will narrow for the patients most likely the benefit that's a possibility out of this. But that's really aligned with the goals that we've had on our clinical trial designs, which has long been to use the diagnostic tools to make sure that the right patients are getting treatment. So we'll look forward to the readout in January. We'll continue to stay very engaged in this.

Obviously, there's a lot of talking and discussing going on in Washington about how to Mig medicines more affordable. I think we've been pretty consistent in our view that both as Lilly and I think I can speak for the industry here we are for progress. We're not for the status quo and the centerpiece of almost every part of legislation being discussed which is I think good news for seniors is some reform to the Part D benefit. That is certainly highlighted in representative Peter's Bill. It's in HR-19, it was in the aggressive widen effort. It's I'm sure in the Senate Finance effort now, and I think that's good news. The contours of that are all kind of different, but the general idea is that industry would pay additional costs into the system, that that would reduce monthly out-of-pocket costs, both below and above the catastrophic phase cap -- catastrophic costs as well as eliminate the donut hole.  I think we're basically for all those things and we think that's a good set of initiatives. Where the debate sort of kicks in is around how to pay for that, or whether pay for from the industry should go to other healthcare priorities. And of course, we have clear positions on that. One piece of Peter's Bill we don't like is the retroactive CPI Cap. I think that's punitive and unfair. It also is disproportionate on some types of medicines versus others. So I think the industry is aligned, [indiscernible] we don't care for that. Although in general, the idea of a CPI regulator on forward price increases is something people have gotten used to talking about.  And then the thing we do, put our foot down and firmly opposed and why we're so against HR3 and other efforts, is taking money out of the pharmaceutical industry for other priorities. Isn't drug pricing a big enough problem? Why don't we take the money out of pharmaceutical industry and give it to patients who want to buy our medicines. And that's a position we've had for a long time. I think it's been a busy week and into next week, probably negotiating out this package, but we're hopeful that some of these messages are resonating and we could land with a Part D reform and modest impact on the industry so we can keep innovating for the future.",425.0,183.0,5.0,9.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0273224043715847,0.04918032786885246,0.01639344262295082,0.01092896174863388,0.0,-0.02185792349726776

As you probably remember, we had some stocking that happened in the channel in the second quarter, and so part of what happened this quarter is just a modest work down of that inventory. I think the fundamentals of where we stand in the metastatic setting continue to look really strong. I like where we are in terms of NBRX share hopping around 30% hopefully we can continue to grow that. I think that we still haven't seen the entire class of CDK46 inhibitors returns of pre - COVID levels of prescriptions. And so that's obviously an important lever for growth going forward. Probably levered to things like mammogram volumes and other types of preventative care measures that get patients diagnosed and into doctor's offices. But we continue to grow our share of NBRX within the market. Turning to Adjuvan, obviously, we're very excited about launching this medicine for men and women with early breast cancer specifically Ki-67 high patients. It's a real opportunity as I think you've probably heard say before. It's about 8,000-10,000 patients. It's obviously a smaller opportunity than the entire study population that we enrolled in monarchy. And as you know, we'll be looking -- again, next year will be the next analysis of survival to potentially expand to that broader population, should OS trend in the direction that we and FDA want to see to do that. But we have a great opportunity ahead of us. I think certainly it's growth from where we stand today. It's a brand-new indication of real size in terms of both patient numbers and duration. In many ways, that -- realizing that is also linked to the prior comments I made about patients returning to the doctor for preventative care to get diagnosed at levels, hopefully that return to pre -COVID. We don't need that obviously to make headway going into next year, but I think for the long term, it's important for patients to make sure they get into the physician's office to get diagnosed.",358.0,174.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.028735632183908046,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.0,0.0,0.028735632183908046

We're looking very closely at the obesity opportunity for Tirzepatide. We're very excited about the weight loss that we solve in type 2 diabetes patients, of up to 14% weight loss, and the potential of that being even higher in the obesity population. Obviously, just a massive unmet need 110 million Americans live with obesity. Only about 3% of them are treated with some type of anti-obesity medication. So we think the opportunity is huge to really help people who live with chronic weight management issues. Now, with our program, we have four trials in us surmount obesity registration program.  Our first obesity trial will read out next year or SURMOUNT-1 We're very excited to see that that should happen in mid next year.

So very excited about -- with all these launches. I think they've done a nice job. I think not a surprise to us. We thought that what was holding back the current market was just the current products in the marketplace just didn't have clinically meaningful enough weight loss.  We thought if we had products on the marketplace that had clinically meaningful weight loss and those products were able to show good, clinical outcomes, overall medical outcomes for those living with obesity, that position for [inaudible 00:56:27] and payers would provide access for it.

So we won't be able to draw conclusions about that. But I'd point out that if we believe that plaque Luring is the appropriate surrogate and that question will certainly be answered in the next year to 18 months as we get data from a number of Phase three plaque-lowering drugs, so if it turns out that plaque lowering is an appropriate surrogate for predicting clinical efficacy, then I think that the degree and speed of plaque lowering could be the basis of comparison across different Alzheimer's drugs in the same way that surrogates in oncology to used to compare different drugs in a class, knowing that the long-term outcome trials would have to be extremely large and long duration, powered for clinical outcomes.

So Sintilimab, the PD-1 inhibitor from Innovent, we brought in to the Company in terms of ex-China right explicitly with the intent to use pricing as a lever to disrupt the U.S. market starting with the United States and potentially moving to Europe as well. And as we've said publicly over the past couple of months, the intent there is really through price predominantly versus other mechanisms such as rebating etc. There are certain customers out there, certain practices, and care models for which this is going to be an attractive tool for lowering costs to their system. And Unfortunately for the way the system is designed today, they are going to be many channels for which a lower-priced option actually isn't appealing. And so as you -- your question was about whether or not we intend to be a dominant player? It's hard for me to say that with any degree of assertion today. We will be focusing, initially, on the segments for which this is an attractive option, given the way that their payer dynamics work. And today that's not a majority by any stretch, but that will be our focus out of the [indiscernible] should [inaudible 01:00:27] be approved. Onto your second question about whether or not the data package that's been generated for the agent will have issues with prescribers in the United States. Our market research today suggests this won't be an issue.  But obviously we haven't launched the product yet, we haven't gotten it approved yet, so I can't say that with certainty that our market research suggests it won't be an issue. But really in front of us initially is just getting the drug approved, and I think as you know, that's something we hope for in the early part of next year.

Two of those, first thing with Umar's points around Sintilimab in the U.S. Essentially two parts on this one. First, any comments about FDA change in policy and use in China only patient population as basis of Commission, the United States, we've heard some things and conferences that suggest that might be some change there. And second, on the same point, you've kind of talked about price as the dominant note here. I guess the question is more around you thinking process You know, pharma has struggled for a long time in commercializing low-cost products and innovative products to the same Company. If PD1 should have a low-cost option, why not pulp why not lebrikizumab why should those not follow a deep discounting strategy giving the clinical profile versus other products in the same class. And 2nd question, given the recent impact of interchangeable Lantus, can you discuss a little bit how the insulin their fast-acting insulin market is different, assuming we will see interchangeable products there, how are the features of the market differ? And would that also be a market which is more amenable to adopting any interchangeable insulin?",207.0,100.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.02,0.03,0.04,0.0,0.0,-0.01

I mean, I think a couple of things come to mind here. First, I think in oncology in particular, it is infeasible quite often to run comparative studies. And so once an incumbent is established, it's very difficult to displace that incumbent. Maybe the one narrow exception might be what Jake highlighted with Sintilimab where you could have a more price-sensitive segment. And here we have analogous data from a different country that was conducted in a time-gap that was prior to other PD-1s being approved in that setting. And so that presents an opportunistic play.  We have of course also pursued this in insulin and Mike can comment on that in a second. But basically, our launch to the 30% discount to the other insulin glargine. We've pursued our own low-cost authorized generic of Humalog, now reducing the price to effectively 70% off the original brand. But here again, it illustrates the point Jake was making is that even in the retail side, it's not universally adopted. Today the half-price form of Humalog and the third off-price of insulin glargine that we provide have minority market shares and that's a little bit counter-intuitive. But of course, we all know the incentives of the supply chain which do tend to favor higher list price products, and that's I think where that shows up. Finally, you asked why don't we pursue this for our whole portfolio?  Well, I think the overriding thought for our portfolio was often to create differentiated datasets. And 1 thing different from [indiscernible] different from [indiscernible] and authorize generic, Humalog is that those aren't differentiated datasets. So they're more or less interchangeable. So when we create a new medicine, we're seeking to create something better. And in the main, that's how the system is set up and that favors typically an introductory price that's similar to other innovative competitors and then rebating and discounting to the channel to get formulary access and use. And that remains our main strategy.  Of course, if there were some big policy shifts that flattened gross to net or reduced, somehow, the incentives of intermediaries, we'd take a look at that. I think our goal would be to deliver lower cost points to consumers if we could. Right now, mostly the system rewards something else and that's how we are forward planning for the portfolio that Dan was talking about. Maybe Mike has any final comments on insulin and interchangeability.",446.0,203.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.009852216748768473,0.019704433497536946,0.024630541871921183,0.0,0.0,-0.009852216748768473

First of all, when we look at Semglee, it's only interchangeable with the reference product, which is Lantus, not Basaglar, so we do think it's going to have a more of an impact on Lantus versus Basaglar. I mean, you look at the mill time segments, that first reference product will be insulin aspart, not LifePro (PH). Now I think you also have to take a look at the assemblies interchangeable biosimilar.  I think many stakeholders in Washington believe that Semglee interchangeable insulin would launch at a significant discounted price. Now, that hasn't been the case. The net impact of assembly’s interchange will launch is actually the introduction of a higher-priced presentation, not a lower-price presentation. The new presentation is priced at $269 a vial versus $99 a vial of the original singly, which is a 273% increase. So I think what you're not going to see, at least what we haven't seen in the insulin biosimilar space is that the Semglee interchangeable will we're really disrupt the basal insulin market.  Rather, what we'll do is allow it to compete and kind of their traditional healthcare system that we know have gaps which we talked about earlier and which we've been trying to fill with our insulin value program and the senior savings model. When you look at in kind of pivot to the mealtime insulin market, mealtime insulin is a bit more complicated. They require more presentations than what you see with a basal insulin. So, premixes are human insulin are also included on the contract. So I think the mealtime insulin is a little bit different than what you see on the basal insulin.  But what we've seen to-date is that given [indiscernible] and our price point on interchangeability, we don't think it's going to be really disruptive to the system, but more work within the current system, which we feel that we can strongly defend. At the end of day, I think, to reiterate Dave 's point, I think it's better when we're focused on improvements. and with our Connected Care launch with BIF, with our weekly basal insulin, I think we're focused on really driving innovation and better patient outcomes.",382.0,175.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.022857142857142857,0.022857142857142857,0.005714285714285714,0.005714285714285714,0.005714285714285714,0.0

So at present, what we've seen is the total migraine prescription market has seen growth but it's driven primarily by the total acute new patient starts and additional concomitant use. With the injectable class, I do think that we're still experiencing headwinds from the pandemic and increased competition in the prevention space overall. We do see some variability of this across the markets, some OUS markets are returning really to pre - COVID growth levels. And while we've seen improvement in the volume of new patient starts, the CGRP MAB class in the U.S. is still about 13% below where we were with the start of the pandemic. So with the new competition and then appropriate treatment for acute and prevention, we're seeing that the market should continue to grow as patient's reengage in the system.  On your question on oral impact, I think it's still a bit early to -- early days in the launches to see how this has impacted the space in this way. So we'll watch that carefully. I think our belief is that with so many patients and so much unmet need, the opportunity for these medicines, particularly the MAB,remains significance.

As we move into 2022, we continue to build on this foundation and are determined to deliver on our long-term outlook to drive top-tier revenue growth, expand operating margins and innovate to develop and launch new medicines for patients that address significant unmet needs. Unpacking our 2021 performance on Slide 4, you can see the progress we have made on our strategic deliverables. Q4 revenue was 8% and was driven by volume growth of 11%. While when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 6% for the quarter and 10% for the full-year. This volume-driven performance is attributable to our key growth products, which grew by 28% and now account for 61% of our core business in Q4. On our non-GAAP, gross margin was 76.1% in Q4, a decrease of approximately 250 basis points, driven by increased sales of COVID-19 antibodies, which have a lower gross margin profile. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.7%, representing a decrease of approximately 130 basis points as a result of the lower gross margin percent just mentioned. For pipeline milestones, we have shared several important updates since our Q3 earnings call, including additional positive Phase III readouts for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis and lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis. The initiation of a rolling submission in the U.S. for pertibrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma and our submission of bebtelizumab to the FDA for emergency use authorization for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. We also continue to put our cash flow to work to create long-term value and recently announced our plans to make significant investments in new manufacturing sites in both North Carolina and Ireland. These investments will bolster the resilience and capacity of our supply chain as we launch new products to drive meaningful long-term growth. In addition, this quarter, we announced a strategic research collaborations with a focus on new modalities as we continue to augment internal discovery capabilities. Finally, on financials, we announced a 15% increase to the dividend for the fourth consecutive year. And in Q4, we distributed nearly $800 million to shareholders via the dividend and completed another $750 million in share repurchases. Moving to Slides 5 and 6, you will see a list of key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, business development and COVID-19 therapy updates we are discussing today or that were part of the discussion during our December 15 Investment Community Meeting.

Slide 7 and 8 summarize financial performance in the fourth quarter and full-year 2021. I will focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q4, revenue grew 8% and revenue, excluding COVID-19 antibodies, increased 6%, highlighting solid momentum for our core business. Full-year revenue growth was 10% on that latter basis. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 250 basis points to 76.1% in Q4. The decrease in gross margin percent was driven by higher sales of COVID-19 antibodies, with shipments this quarter of bamlanivimab and etesevimab, also having lower gross margin profile compared to bevalinuzumab sales in the base period. Total operating expenses grew 5% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, while R&D expenses increased 7%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage pipeline opportunities, including donanemab, pirtobrutinib and tirzepatide, which were partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 therapies. We invested approximately $40 million in research and development for COVID-19 therapies in Q4, bringing our total COVID-19 R&D investment to approximately $400 million for the full-year. Operating income increased 3% compared to Q4 2020 and operating income as a percent of revenue was 31.7% for the quarter, a decrease of 130 basis points. This decrease was driven by lower gross margin percent, partially offset by lower marketing, selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. Full-year operating margin was 29.9%, in line with our expectations. Other income and expense was an expense of approximately $7 million this quarter compared to an expense of $31 million in Q4 2020. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 10.3%, a decrease of 280 basis points driven primarily by net discrete tax benefits. At the bottom line, we delivered solid growth as earnings per share - 8% in Q4 and 20% for the full-year. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth, and we continue to be encouraged by the growth seen across key geographies. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 13%. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the U.S. This growth driven by volume was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, Verzenio and Olumiant. The net price decline of 2% in the U.S. this quarter was driven by lower realized prices for insulins, primarily due to changes to estimates for rebates and discounts. For the full-year, our U.S. net price decrease of 1% was in line with our expectations. Moving to Europe. Revenue in Q4 declined 3% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity for Alimta, revenue grew 11% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz and Verzenio. We are encouraged with the momentum of our business in Europe, and expect continued growth excluding Alimta. In Japan, revenue in Q4 decreased 14% in constant currency. Revenue in Japan continues to be negatively impacted by decreased demand for several products that have lost market exclusivity including Cymbalta and Alimta as well as by the COVID pandemic. With key growth products now representing 56% of total Japan revenue, we expect to return to growth beginning in 2023. In China, revenue grew 13% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume from our continued uptake of Tyvyt and Trulicity as well as the timing of supply for Cialis through the third-party selling the product. Q4 revenue growth was negatively affected by the updated 2022 NRDL price reductions on inventory already in the channel especially for Tyvyt. In 2022, we expect the NRDL price reduction headwind largely offset volume growth in Q1, but we also expect volume growth to accelerate throughout the year and exceed the impact of these price reductions. Moving forward, we are excited about the significant growth we are seeing in China, over 40% in constant currency in 2021, with improved access expected to continue to drive future growth. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 16% in constant currency this quarter, driven primarily by sales of neuro medicine. We continue to expect a mid-single-digit net price decline in 2022 for the U.S., Europe and Japan. In China, the expanded NRDL access for our products should lead to significant volume increase, but also high double-digit decline in price. As a result, we expect total company net price decline in the high single digit in 2022. At the bottom of the slide is the price rate and volume effect on revenue for all 2021, which shows strong double-digit volume-driven revenue growth across most major geographies. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove 14 percentage points of growth this quarter and continue to bolster our overall performance and outlook. Slide 11 further highlights the contribution of our key growth products. This quarter these brands generated over $4.2 billion in revenue and made up 61% of our core business revenue. In Q4, these newer medicines grew by 28% and Trulicity, Jardiance, Taltz and Verzenio all continue to outgrow their respective classes. We are particularly pleased with the continued market growth of both the GLP-1 and the SGLT2 classes, where Trulicity and Jardiance are market leaders. We are also encouraged by the strong uptake of Verzenio we saw in Q4, driven by the approval and launch of the adjuvant indication, which has led to an inflection in both new and total prescriptions. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2021, we invested 9.3 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately 3.1 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.3 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged as we continue to fund our marketed products and expected launches, invest in our pipeline, evaluate opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders. On Slide 13 is our 2022 financial guidance we issued in December. As I shared then, the financial impact from the loss of exclusivity of Alimta in Europe and Japan will continue in the first half of 2022. While the impact from Alimta’s U.S. patent expiry will start with the limited launch from a single generic company in Q1 before the full launch of additional generic entrants starting in Q2. We expect roughly 375 million of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies in Q1 from the shipment of the remaining doses attributable to last November’s U.S. Government Purchase Agreement. We continue to invest in our bright future, advance in promising R&D opportunities and preparing for exciting potential launches from our late-stage pipeline, which we believe will help drive top-tier revenue growth through at least 2030. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline.",1097.0,589.0,16.0,11.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.027164685908319185,0.01867572156196944,0.011884550084889643,0.0,0.0,0.008488964346349746

We delivered positive data on 5 molecules: tirzepatide, tenenumab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab, all of which have the potential to launch in the next two years, and we are excited about the potential of these molecules hold for patients. In addition, we launched and submitted several key new indications for in-market products, including important new indications for Verzenio and Jardiance. And also, we advanced our early-stage pipeline. Just a few weeks-ago, we provided an extensive R&D update across our therapeutic areas and shared our excitement about the next wave of innovation coming from Lilly. As a result, today’s R&D update will be brief and focus on the progress we have made since our last earnings call. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 31, and Slides 15 and 16 show a recap of 2021 key events and potential key events for 2022. In Diabetes, with the recent submission in Japan, we have now submitted tirzepatide across all major geographies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We look forward to potential approvals for this important medicine this year. We anticipate U.S. regulatory action in type 2 diabetes as well as the top line readout from SURMOUNT-1, both by midyear. In Japan, we submitted Jardiance for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and received approval for Jardiance for treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Moving to Oncology. We shared encouraging updated data at ASH for pirtobrutinib for both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. We continue to progress this molecule and initiated another Phase III study in first-line CLL comparing pirtobrutinib to chemoimmunotherapy. During our December meeting, we also announced the initiation of a rolling submission for pirtobrutinib for MCL in the U.S. We plan to complete this submission this year with anticipated regulatory action in early 2023, and we are excited to potentially bring this important medicine to patients on this accelerated timeline. For Verzenio, we received approval for high-risk early breast cancer in Japan for the Cohort 1 population study to monarchE and are pleased that this approval represents 90% of the intent-to-treat population. We have also made the difficult decision to terminate further enrollment in the Phase III study of Verzenio for HER2 positive early breast cancer in response to the changing treatment landscape and global enrollment challenges. Importantly, this decision does not change our commitment to and investment in breast cancer. In addition, we began a Phase III study for selpetatinib for the treatment of adjuvant RET-positive non-small cell lung cancer and we also dosed the first patient in the U.S. trial of our BCL-2 inhibitor. In Immunology, we announced positive top line data for our Phase III maintenance study of mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis. We are pleased that the study met all primary and key secondary endpoints, and we look forward to submissions in the first half of this year. We also announced positive top line Phase III results for lebrikizumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, and we are encouraged that data to date has demonstrated a competitive profile for treatment of atopic dermatitis. We await maintenance data for lebrikizumab in the first half of this year in advance of global submissions, which are expected by the end of 2022. Moving to baricitinib. We announced last week that based on top line efficacy results from two Phase III trials, we have decided to discontinue the Phase III development program for lupus. For atopic dermatitis in the U.S., we are in ongoing discussions with the FDA, but do not have alignment with the agency on the indicated population, which could possibly lead to a complete response letter. We expect regulatory action for this indication very soon. Finally, we have submitted baricitinib for alopecia areata in the U.S. and hope it will become the first medicine approved for patients living with this disease later this year. In our early phase immunology portfolio, we started a new Phase I study for CD19 antibody and we have discontinued our oral IL-17 inhibitor. Moving to neurodegeneration. In our early-phase pipeline, we announced that we have received breakthrough therapy designation for N3pG4, an additional amyloid lowering agent for which we intend to initiate pivotal trials by the end of this year. We have evidence that this therapy is completely and rapidly cleared amyloid plaque and we are exploring flexible dosing regimens, including subcutaneous dosing. For the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, we also began a Phase II trial for our oglic/nacase inhibitor, an oral small molecule targeting tau. While donanemab has been a primary focus for investors, we are pleased with the continued clinical advancement of the rest of our neurodegeneration pipeline. Now turning to donanemab, in December, we initiated two additional Phase III studies, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, our prevention study for asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease; and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4, our head-to-head plaque clearance study compared to add-a-helm. It has been less than one year since we published a positive randomized controlled TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, which demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits on endpoints of cognition and function. Since then, we have focused investors on the need for replication from our well-designed expanded Phase III study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, which is now fully enrolled and expected to read out in mid-2023. While a lot has happened in this space during this last year, and more events are likely before we get top line results next year, what hasn’t changed for us is the importance of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 readout and our confidence in both donanemab and the unique study design. Given the impact of this devastating disease, we believe that if TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 provides positive confirmatory data, we can’t see a scenario where there is not global reimbursement, patient access and broad use of donanemab. We noted last year that we had low expectations for the use of donanemab during the period between potential accelerated approval and the availability of confirmatory Phase III data in mid-2023. We are disappointed with the position that Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has taken in its draft national coverage determination decision, and those low expectations could now extend for some months beyond the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 readout if reconsideration of CMS coverage determination is required, given historical timelines for this process. While the accelerated approval pathway was instituted by the FDA to allow for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need, hence providing valuable access to more patients faster than what is available under clinical trials, the NCD is currently written essentially negates that patient benefit in Alzheimer’s disease. Still, we intend to complete our application for accelerated approval for donanemab yet this year, but we now move completion of the accelerated approval submission out of Q1. We expect further volatility and expectations as competitor Alzheimer’s disease trials read out prior to our definitive data. We remain confident in the differentiation of donanemab and in our uniquely designed TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study. And importantly, the long-term opportunity to help patients with donanemab remains unchanged. Lastly, with respect to our progress with COVID-19 therapies. Earlier this year, we submitted a request to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization for bebtelimumab for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 and for patients at high risk for progression of severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. This is the third antibody we have developed for the treatment of COVID-19, and authentic virus and pseudovirus assays demonstrate that bebtelovimab retains neutralization activity against Omicron as well as all other known variants of concern. We have produced several hundred thousand doses of bebtelovimab and stand ready to supply as needed if this antibody receives EUA from the FDA. In addition, we have also submitted a supplemental NDA for baricitinib for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and expect regulatory action by the middle of this year. Baricitinib currently has an EUA for this indication. We are proud of the therapies we have delivered to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will continue to do our part as public health needs emerge. In summary, Q4 was another productive quarter for R&D at Lilly, capping what was an outstanding year of pipeline progress on behalf of patients. Now I will turn the call back to Dave.",1397.0,698.0,26.0,15.0,11.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,0.03724928366762178,0.02148997134670487,0.015759312320916905,0.0057306590257879654,0.0028653295128939827,0.015759312320916905

We delivered strong revenue growth in our core business, propelled by our key growth products. We continue to invest heavily in our pipeline and made significant progress in 2021 generating positive Phase III data for five new potential medicines: tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab that we expect we will launch in the next two years. We also delivered positive data and launched important new indications for Jardiance and Verzenio, while we continue to bolster our pipeline through business development with a focus on new modalities. Finally, we returned $4.35 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. And for the fourth consecutive year, announced a 15% dividend increase. As we move into 2022, we are excited to continue the progress of turning pipeline value into cash flow, starting with the potential launch of tirzepatide and the submissions of donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab. These opportunities remind us that our purpose has never been more relevant and highlight the promise of turning science into treatments or cures for some of the most challenging human diseases like diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer’s, cancers and autoimmune disorders.

But how much did the NCD actually work into that calculus versus needs or requests from the agency for additional data? And then the second question, just really wanted to get a better understanding of where you guys think this SURMOUNT-1 data sets, where the thresholds would be. We are seeing 68-week data from Wegovy coming in at about 15% to 17% in a non-diabetic patient population. Just wanted to get a sense of some of the pushes and pulls that we should be thinking about in the context of the SURMOUNT-1 data set.

Look, I think, as I said, the purpose of accelerated approvals to try and get medicines and to help patients faster. Without access, that benefit is mainly negated, unfortunately, and clearly, a very frustrating period for patients to have approval of a drug and no reimbursement. So the CMS draft NCD proposal weighed heavily in our considerations around timing and clearly reduces some of the ability to help patients faster than we were hoping for the accelerated approval. With respect to the other part of your question, which is how about requests from the FDA or new data or anything like that, there are none of those factors here. We haven’t had such requests. So it is really about CMS and about our own team’s ability to just get all of the data together and get the right amount of safety data compiled in a way that the FDA can analyze. So we will continue to work towards accelerated approval yet this year, but no longer in Q1.",178.0,81.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.04938271604938271,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.037037037037037035

Those theories tend to play out when we looked at the novo semaglutides step program where those who didn’t have type 2 diabetes had six or seven percentage points greater weight loss than those that had type 2 diabetes. We don’t know what it is going to turn out to be for SURMOUNT-1. We do believe that it is going to be higher in the non-type 2 diabetes patient than what we saw in the SURPASS studies. Good thing is we don’t have to wait too long for those results. We expect those in the first half of this year. And so we will be patient and look for the results. And I think we will be excited by what we see.,163.0,70.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.04285714285714286,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,0.0,0.02857142857142857

The first one is around the N3pG4 in RLAD, you are starting a second agent fairly quickly. Can you talk about other distinguishing features for this product versus donanemab. Is it just that removes BlackFester, also the others? For example, is it removing preferentially parenteral plaque versus vascular plaque. And the second, you kind of mentioned your expectation for the NCD, but can you confirm to us that you do not expect the NCD to materially change in its final form versus a draft form? And if you can talk a little bit about the process of requesting a change to that entity once we have confirmatory data for the amyloid beta removing drugs.",127.0,56.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

On N3pG4, originally, we started working on this molecule because of antidrug antibodies that we saw and continue to see against donanemab. Because of those ADAs, we have dosed donanemab at pretty high levels and that, in combination with the formulation of donanemab, have precluded the ability of generating a subcutaneous dosing form. So that was an important consideration of those two things, I would say, for development of N3pG4. It binds the same epitope as donanemab, so our understanding and data suggests that it clears exactly the same types of plaques. That is important to us. I think we have seen compelling efficacy here in TRAILBLAZER from donanemab, and we want more of the same in the next molecule. So no differences here in type of plaque. I think speed of plaque removal, our expectations are it should be similar to donanemab, which is to say, quite rapid. And the big advantage here is likely to be around dosing and administration.",166.0,65.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.03076923076923077,0.015384615384615385,0.0,0.03076923076923077,-0.015384615384615385

Really what matters most to us is ensuring rapid availability of donanemab for patients with that confirmatory Phase III data. And so that is going to be our focus with CMS. We believe that well-designed and controlled registration trials like TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 should certainly provide sufficient evidence of clinical benefit for donanemab and that the CD is not needed or appropriate for donanemab. We are also going to see confirmation with CMS really to your question, once this Phase III efficacy and safety have been established, that donanemab and other medicines with this level of verified evidence, would be fully covered by CMS, and we want that path for this coverage to be clearly laid out. As Dan mentioned, it may take some months after the Tyvyt 2 readout to work through that, we will certainly focus on that. We have been and will continue to meet with CMS to make our points known and to work through what that process is. And I think as Dan alluded to, what we believe is that with Phase III confirmatory data and ultimately, an FDA traditional approval, we cannot envision a reason why CMS would treat Alzheimer’s disease differently than any other class of medicines. I mean this would really be unprecedented. And I believe the pushback from the patient community from their caregivers and from those that advocate for them would be significant and CMS would have, we believe, no choice but to change it.

Maybe one follow-up on ondonanemab and then one other 1 unrelated. So in terms of - obviously, I appreciate what you are saying around the accelerated approval and kind of changing your time line there. I’m just wondering what TRAILBLAZER 4 and if there is any reason, I’m kind of wondering what the rationale for that trial is now given the limited uptake of Aduhelm to this point, we will get data later this year. But I’m just wondering if it makes - if there is any sort of change in strategy or thinking around the need for that trial? And what exactly that might accomplish? And then my second question is sort of unrelated. You mentioned around Olumiant, the updates from last week, but you also have submitted for alopecia areata.

You raised a good point on TRAILBLAZER 4, which is a head-to-head against Aduhelm. Of course, there was a lot of excitement in patient interest and investigator interest in this trial because there is two drugs compared to each other. So on the other hand, as you point out, from a commercial perspective, the importance of showing superiority to Aduhelm may have dramatically diminished. But that is okay. We are still committed to doing this trial. I think from a scientific perspective, there will be important conclusions. We have a hypothesis, for example, that the more rapid and deep plaque clearance could lead to greater improvements on biomarkers. I think those kinds of assessments can only be done in a head-to-head study.

So maybe specifically, how long should we think about post approval until you would expect broad coverage of tirzepatide? And when we maybe compare and contrast, I guess the last large GLP-1s launch of Ozempic, are there similarities or differences we should think about as hint kind of stay on the market today, the data you will have, et cetera, just to help us - I think we all think about this is a great long-term opportunity, but more just the near-term dynamics with that.

As we approach the tirzepatide launch, we will be planning for the long term and making sure that we set the foundations up strongly for long-term success. When you have a retail product like this that goes to nearly 100,000 primary care physicians as well as meeting broad access, there is little that you can do to really accelerate the launch in the first six months. We are also working to get access and having support programs so patients will have a good out-of-pocket experience at launch. And so I wouldn’t look for the first six months to see a real accelerated uptake of net revenue versus other GLPs in that first six months. I think that, that will be a focus for us of just laying a strong foundations, be in patient focus, getting access, driving awareness through a broad subset of physicians that will give us that foundation to be successful long term. And then on insulin, when we look at the Q4 results, we did have a, in particular, a greater-than-usual decline in our price. And that was really due to kind of a double whammy effect. We have a significant adjustments from our gross sales to our net sales. And so if our estimates are off just a little bit, that could have a significant impact on our net revenues. And so what we saw actually was that in the comparison period, in Q4 of 2020, they experienced some positive onetime gains. And then in this quarter, we saw some negative onetime adjustments. So that is what led to what looks like a greater-than-expected net sales decline. I think for our portfolio, we have provided guidance that we would be at about mid-single-digit decline. I think we will see that greater for insulin than our net portfolio, but I don’t see anything largely unexpected in 2022 versus where we have seen the trends over the last couple of years.

And using amyloid PET to monitor plaque reduction and then confirm clearance is incredibly important, we believe, for patients receiving these therapies. And incredibly important for the health care system because it provides clarity as to when you can essentially stopped dosing of medicine. Once you have cleared the target, we believe that is the time to stop dosing. And as you know, in our data, we have shown that 40% even clear their plaque in six months. So incredibly important and we believe that the value that, that brings to the health care system far outweighs any cost that it might bring. And we have done those analyses. So it is very, very clear that when you take into account all the costs of these medicines, the infusion, the safety monitoring, you are much better off with clarity of when that plaque is cleared and stopping dosing.

As well as the diarrhea management, which is a real phenomenon with Verzenio. We have protocols in place that allow it to be managed and it tends to be a short-term short-term side effect that can be managed. But there are a lot of physicians out there who have literally never written a prescription of Verzenio because they have been historically large Ibrance users.

When you look at historically, the agent just had kind of limited weight loss. And because of that, they didn’t really drive good help outcomes and that limited access, limited positions from writing that. So we think, first of all, just having agent like tirzepatide that could have significant and clinically meaningful weight loss is the first step of the evolution of the marketplace and the interest in that and we have seen that in market research. And then we have got to begin to build the evidence to show that significant weight loss for tirzepatide will lead to hard outcomes. And that is what we are doing in our extended indication focus. We have announced a heart failure HFpEF study. We announced in December a sleep apnea study as well as an important morbidity/mortality study or MMO study that will look at hard outcomes for other potential outcomes like CV and others, we will give you more information on that coming up. We also have a chronic kidney disease mechanism of action Phase II study that will help demonstrate why tirzepatide may work for that patient population and doing work in NASH. And so I think it is important for us to demonstrate. I think we are confident that with the level of weight loss that we will see with tirzepatide, but that should lead to hard outcomes, that should then lead to earlier use of agent like tirzepatide to really slow and disrupt the progression of obesity and really turn this into a more of a preventive versus waiting for the heart outcomes to show. But that is going to be the evolution of it.

So the first part of your question around the decision to file for mantle cell, you framed it as what is an unmet need versus regulatory feedback. And the answer really is both. So we have had a longitudinal conversation with the agency around this indication showing them our clinical data at various snapshots over time. And we got to a point where we had agreement on the key components of what an NDA could look like from a clinical package perspective. And so that informed our decision to file. In other words, this was not a sort of unilateral Lilly decision. This was done very much in concert with FDA. And I think they and us realized the unmet need of patients in the setting and the potential proposition of pirtobrutinib there. Obviously, the ultimate approval is subject to an FDA review. So nothing is done until it is done, of course. As it relates to the potential lag between a mantle cell approval and CLL approval, I think it is just too early to really comment because the latter, CLL is really subject to the enrollment dynamics of the Phase III program. And it is just a little too early days for us to really say exactly which one of those studies will be the first to read out and when, because it is so enrollment kinetics-contingent. So over the course of this year, we will have a lot more information about that, I presume and be in a better position to prognosticate about CLL timing.",260.0,112.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.008928571428571428,0.017857142857142856,0.026785714285714284,0.008928571428571428,0.0,-0.008928571428571428

I think first and foremost, if you look at the atopic dermatitis state, it is pretty much where psoriasis was a decade ago.

Obviously, we think there is a potential for the drug in the first line, and that is why we are running studies there. We have two studies that we are running in first-line CLL. One is, as you mentioned, a head-to-head study against ibrutinib. The other, which will take a long time to read out because of the natural history of the control arm. The other is a study we just recently started against chemoimmunotherapy. That study will read out much, much quicker. And, therefore, allow for the drug to be labeled in the first-line setting. And I think what we have learned, particularly from other newer entrants in this space is that you really need to generate a differentiating data set in some way, shape or form, and then have the labeled indications that allow physicians and patients to have choice. And I think, in particular, the Calquence acalabrutinib program has shown that you really actually don’t necessarily need direct head-to-head data to suggest differentiation or for at least physicians to perceive differentiation in different drugs, so long as you have a labeled indication that allows for on-label prescribing and reimbursement. So one of the reasons that we initiated the first-line chemo immunotherapy study was to have a path to that first-line label more quickly and allow patients and physicians to make choices.",258.0,122.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.00819672131147541,0.01639344262295082,0.00819672131147541,0.0,0.0,-0.00819672131147541

If tirzepatide is priced at a slight premium over Trulicity on a list basis, that could theoretically mean a massive increase on a net basis. So given where prices are paid in government channels for Trulicity, can you remind us what percent of Trulicity is Medicare, Medicaid and VA? And how different is that price versus your commercial price? And switching gears to donanemab for TRAILBLAZER 3, I was wondering if you guys had finalized the stat methodology for assessing the primary endpoint. I know a little while back, you had a nice poster on TRAILBLAZER 2 showing how the primary endpoints were assessed by basin analysis versus MMRN.

Obviously, I won’t be able to talk in too much detail around the list price for next price for tirzepatide. Maybe the best way to answer your question is that typically for a new product, you tend to get commercial access first, then Part D, then followed by Medicaid and other channels. And yes, the commercial net prices are typically higher than Part D and Part D is typically higher than Medicaid. So you will see kind of the evolution of any retail product to be a higher net price at the beginning of the life cycle. And then as the lower - if you reach volume in lower-priced segments, you will see that decline like we have talked about over - with Trulicity over the last couple of years. Now we will have extensive patient support programs in the first six months for tirzepatide. So again, I wouldn’t be looking too much at that for tirzepatide in the first six months.

So what kind of endpoint is appropriate for a population like that. In our view, we are looking at a progression metrics. So do they progress to a CDR rating that indicates that they now have impairment. So it is a bit of a binary outcome for each patient. Did they progress or did they not progress?

If you look at the Q4 performance of Olumiant, I think you should assume that the underlying business in rheumatoid arthritis outside of U.S. and atopic dermatitis continue to be strong. And in the U.S., the trend hasn’t changed either when it comes to rheumatoid arthritis. In the U.S., a significant chunk of sales from Olumiant is coming from COVID-19 in Q4 and a minor chunk outside of the U.S. as well. It is really hard to predict the pandemic, but we expect to see continued sales from Olumiant also in 2022 for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, at an enterprise level, we don’t foresee it to be material. For your second question in terms of atopic dermatitis, let me first reinforce that we are very confident when it comes to the risk benefit profile of Olumiant across all the indications approved and studied. And we conducted eight Phase III studies for atopic dermatitis in U.S. and outside of the U.S. And those were conducted in patients, moderate to severely ill patients suffering from atopic dermatitis in need of systemic treatment. And that is really where we believe Olumiant is bringing the biggest benefits to patients early on in the treatment data time. While FDA currently has a position of saving Olumiant for the refractory patients where we see the incremental value of Olumiant to be quite limited. And if that doesn’t change, it is likely that we will receive a complete response letter. And if so, we will continue to focus our efforts on the very successful launches that we have seen outside the U.S. for atopic dermatitis as well as a very strong rheumatoid arthritis franchise. We have - as well as preparing for, hopefully, an approval of Alopecia Areata in the U.S. and other markets later on this year. Moving on to mirikizumab. Yes, we had recently the readout of LUSN2 just prior to the end of last year. And we met the primary endpoint and all the secondary endpoints. And we didn’t only achieve statistical significance, but also clinically meaningful difference when it comes to clinical, symptomatic, hetologic and endoscopic measures. And we have also conducted the first study ever with an IL-23 P19 where we have demonstrated reduced urgency, which we know is a major concern today for both clinicians, but mainly for patients. So therefore, we are looking forward to submit mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis during the first half of this year. And most likely become the first IL-23 19 in this very important space and we have a big unmet need and with a profile that we believe is very competitive versus both currently approved medicines and other biologics and JAKs in development.",472.0,205.0,5.0,6.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.02926829268292683,0.024390243902439025,0.0,0.0,-0.004878048780487805

It is been an arena of influence from different parties agency, CMS, where it appears as if there is sort of instruction that have breadth of scope across multiple different antibody. So would you say that since we know that competitor data is upcoming for additional approaches later this year, does that impact your view on your approach and timing for filing a DMAB? And then a second question would be on tirzepatide, the anticipated transition in type 2 diabetes. Trulicity has been very strong. But can you perhaps give us a better sense about how you expect that transition to play out? I think broadly, there is confidence in the profile that tirzepatide eventually will succeed in continuing the franchise position in type 2 diabetes. But would you expect for the initial tirzepatide launch that to come primarily and importantly, from the incident population or will there be patient switching?

We have to take into account expectations for those readouts. I think from our perspective, those readouts could be challenging. Obviously, we designed donanemab as a molecule or dosing strategy, our clinical trial strategy, including who we enrolled and what endpoints we look at in order to maximize the ability to see a positive signal. Other trials haven’t done that. So therefore, it is obvious that we would think that those trials should have lower probability of success. . I think if those trials are not successful, competitor readouts fail either because see some of the boxes is just too noisy an endpoint. And that can go ways it could help or it could hurt. We saw that in the two aducanumab readouts or because they have too many patients who are outside the optimal window of tau pathology because they are not doing that or because they lower plaques too slowly. If any of those turn out to be correct and those trials turn out to be negative, I think that could further solidify CMS’s reluctance to reimburse these drugs under accelerated approval. It doesn’t really fundamentally change our thinking, though. As I said before, the key event for us is readout of our Phase III study. I think we have optimized everything for our chances of success. And regardless of competitor readouts, if we have a positive Phase III readout on top of our already first positive randomized controlled trial in TRAILBLAZER 1 that is a very good position for donanemab and our expectation is that is a drug that will become globally available to patients and highly used by patients.",292.0,135.0,8.0,6.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.05925925925925926,0.044444444444444446,0.044444444444444446,0.0,0.0,0.014814814814814815

We are going to be taken, again, from a long-term perspective on tirzepatide and Trulicity. Our goal is to continue to grow the market in type 2 diabetes and then really expand the class into the obesity market. Within type 2 diabetes, our goal not only is to expand the market, but continue to expand our share of market within the market. . When you look at the way we promote our products, we take a very patient-centric approach to identifying those patients who could best benefit from a product like tirzepatide. In our market research as we put the profile of tirzepatide up against the six therapies, including Trulicity, both payers and health care professionals and people who live with diabetes see the superior profile of tirzepatide. When you compare that Trulicity, our Phase III trials that showed greater weight loss, better A1c control and it is in exact same device as Trulicity. So there is obviously interest in the product, and they do see it as a superior product from Trulicity. Now what I believe will happen is that we will grow our overall share, and you will get a portion of patients who may have gone on Trulicity or may be on Trulicity and maybe out of control who needs greater weight loss or greater A1c control and those patients will grow on tirzepatide. So we do anticipate that there will be some conversion from Trulicity over two tirzepatide, but our focus is really going to be making sure that we grow the overall class and grow the overall share of market for the Lilly Ancrogen franchise. We don’t think it is appropriate to necessarily promote conversion of products, we are doing well on Trulicity. So it is not going to be a kind of internally focused conversion strategy. It is going to be very much a patient-focused product for those patients who are out of control or need additional weight loss tirzepatide can offer that. So we are quite excited about the opportunity to have two intro trends in our portfolio and grow the overall class.

Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave.",235.0,115.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.008695652173913044,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.008695652173913044

We are focused on driving adoption of our newer medicines, preparing for key product launches, delivering several global submissions for potential new medicines, all the while advancing our pipeline to power the next wave of growth. We are pleased with the progress we saw in the first quarter. Before I get to our results, I’d like to take a moment to address the tragic loss of life and the hardships we are seeing in Ukraine. Our Ukraine office is currently closed and operations are suspended. The safety of our employees and their families continues to be our top priority. We are working through logistical challenges in order to ensure supply of our medicines to those in need in Ukraine. Earlier this month, an initial shipment of medicines donated by Lilly including insulin arrived in Ukraine. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our partners, project HOPE and Direct Relief. Few of our clinical trial participants are in Ukraine. So while we are doing everything we can to ensure continuity of their medical care, there is minimal impact to our global trials. With regard to Russia, we have suspended investments, our promotional activities and new clinical trials there. Our Russian operations are now only focused on ensuring people suffering from diseases like cancer and diabetes continue to get the Lilly medicines they need. Should we generate any profits from our sales in Russia, we will donate them to organizations dedicated to humanitarian relief. Our revenue in Russia and Ukraine account for less than 1% of our total company sales in 2021. Moving to our results. You can see on slide four the progress we have made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Q1 revenue grew 15% or 17% on a constant currency basis and was driven by volume growth of 20%. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta due to loss of exclusivity, revenue grew 10% for the quarter. This volume driven performance in Q1 is attributable to our key growth products, which grew 24% and now account for 61% of our core business. With long IP runways for many of these products and less than 10% of our 2022 revenue exposed to patent expiry in the next five years, along with the potential launch of five new medicines over the next 18 months, the durability of our growth outlook is quite strong. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 76.1% in Q1, an increase of approximately 70 basis points. Excluding revenue from COVID antibodies, gross margin was approximately 80% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.4%, an increase of roughly 1,000 basis points, primarily driven by both higher gross margin and lower R&D expenses for COVID antibodies. In our pipeline, we have several important updates since our Q4 earnings call, including the U.S. and EU approval for Jardiance in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, as well as a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee for an early start to the Phase III trial studying Jardiance for chronic kidney disease due to clear positive efficacy. The U.S. Emergency Use Authorization for bebtelovimab for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. The recent U.S. submission of mirikizumab for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and a positive Phase III topline readout for SURMOUNT-1, the first of four global studies to evaluate tirzepatide for adults living with obesity or overweight. Dan will talk in more detail later, but we are very excited with the results of the Phase III SURMOUNT-1 topline readout. We believe there is significant potential for tirzepatide to build off the impressive results we saw from our clinical program in Type 2 diabetes and help people with obesity, a disease impacting over 110 million people in United States and approximately 650 million people worldwide. Obesity is a chronic and progressive disease that causes over 2.8 million deaths globally each year. The economic impact associated with obesity is more than $1 trillion in the U.S. alone. We believe addressing obesity could make a difference in millions of people’s lives, have a significant impact on public health and reduce healthcare costs. We are hopeful that we are entering a new era of obesity care, where people have medicines that can help treat their obesity and this is our first proof point on that journey. We continue to rapidly advance nucleic acid innovation at Lilly, building on our growing portfolio with the launch of the Lilly Institute for Genetic Medicines, a $700 million facility in Boston. We will develop novel RNA and DNA-based medicines, as well as push the boundaries of delivery technology to unlock difficult to treat targets in key strategic areas for us like neurodegeneration, diabetes and obesity. Finally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends in the quarter and completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases. On slide five and six, you will see a list of key events since our Q4 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and COVID-19 antibody updates we are discussing today. Now, I will turn the call over to Anat to review the Q1 results.",864.0,448.0,13.0,12.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.029017857142857144,0.026785714285714284,0.017857142857142856,0.002232142857142857,0.0,0.002232142857142857

Before I review the financial results for Q1, it is important to note that beginning this quarter, following directions from the SEC, presentation of non-GAAP measures will not include upfront charges and development milestones related to acquired in-process R&D and development. While this has no bearing on how we conduct our business, it will have an impact on how we represent -- how we present our non-GAAP measures. This change in presentation of financial results will have the effect of pulling into non-GAAP measures, certain charges that were previously reported owning our GAAP financial results. We expect this change will increase non-GAAP operating expenses and decrease non-GAAP operating margins and earnings per share. To help with year-on-year comparison of our non-GAAP measures, you can find a revised workbook in our Investor website, reflecting the updated presentation of our 2020 and 2021 results. Slide seven summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2022. I will focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q1, revenue grew 15%, excluding COVID -- excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta, revenue increased 10%, highlighting solid momentum for our core business. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 70 basis points to 76.1% in Q1 2022. The increase in gross margin percent was primarily driven by the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold in Q1 2021, partially offset by increased sales of COVID antibodies, which have lower gross margin profile than the rest of our portfolio and to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. Increase in manufacturing costs and logistics due to inflation had a modest impact on gross margin in Q1. Total operating expenses decreased 6% this quarter, which as a reminder, is now inclusive of acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 1%, while R&D expenses decreased 4%, driven by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by higher development expenses for late-stage assets. This quarter, we recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of $166 million or $0.15 of EPS, primarily related to purchase of the Priority Review Voucher. In Q1 2021, acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges were $312 million or $0.27 of EPS. Operating income increased 66% in Q1, driven by higher revenue, primarily due to higher sales of COVID antibodies, lower R&D expenses for COVID antibodies, and to a lesser extent, lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 33.4% for the quarter and reflects the benefit from COVID-19 antibodies revenue, as well as the negative impact of approximately 210 basis points attributed to acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Other income and expense was income of approximately $38 million this quarter, compared with income of $35 million in Q1 2021. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 10.3%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was driven by a lower net discrete tax benefit this quarter, partially offset by decreased tax expenses related to the implementation of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act required to capitalize research and development expenses. As the bottomline, we delivered strong earnings per share growth of 63% in Q1, inclusive of approximately 1500 basis points related to lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. On slide eight, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 31% and when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta, revenue grew 14% in the U.S. This growth was driven by volume, led by Trulicity, Verzenio, Jardiance, Olumiant, and Taltz. We experienced a net price decline of 1% for the quarter and continue to expect a mid single-digit price decline in the U.S. for the full year. As a reminder, a single competitor to Alimta launch in the U.S. in February and we expect broad generic entry in may result in a significant erosion of U.S. Alimta revenue. Moving to Europe, revenue in Q1 declined 13% in constant currency and when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta, revenue grew 14% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, Verzenio and Olumiant. We expect continued growth in Europe excluding Alimta. For Japan, Q1 revenue decreased 21% in constant currency, as our business there continues to be negatively affected by significant declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and Alimta. Key growth products now represent 65% of total revenue in Japan and we expect to return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023. In China, revenue grew 10% in constant currency. The NRDL access has driven significant volume growth for newer products like Tyvyt, Trulicity, Verzenio and Taltz, and has been partially offset by related price decreases. We expect this improved access to continue to drive future volume growth, more than offsetting the price decline. The recent COVID-19 outbreak in China and the subsequent protective measures that are currently being put in place to control the spread of the virus highlight the potential for commercial impact in China in the near-term, particularly for infused products, like Tyvyt. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 29% in constant currency this quarter, driven primarily by $95 million in revenue from the sales of rights to Cialis in Taiwan and Saudi Arabia, as well as by increased sales of key growth products. We continue to expect a mid single-digit net price decline in 2022 for the U.S., Europe and Japan, with the worldwide net price decline in the high single-digit driven by the expanded NRDL access for our products in China. As shown on slide nine, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove nearly 15% points of volume growth this quarter and continue to bolster overall performance and outlook. Slide 10 further highlights the contributions of our key growth products. This quarter these brands generated $3.9 billion in revenue and made up 61% of our core business revenue, growing 24%. We are pleased with the continued market growth of both the GLP-1 and SGLT2 classes where Trulicity and Jardiance are market leaders, as well as with the strong Taltz prescription growth. We are also encouraged by the significant uptake of Verzenio in Q1, driven by the approval and launch of the adjuvant indication, which has led to an inflection in both new and total prescriptions. On slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1 2022, we invested $2.4 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $900 million to shareholders in dividends and repurchased 1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, as we continue to fund our key market product and expect the new launches, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders. Slide 12 is the updated 2022 financial guidance. As I previously noted, our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures will now include IPR&D and development milestone charges. For guidance, we will include charges that have been incurred or realized as of the date of the earnings release and will not include any impact from potential or pending business development. We are providing information that should make this change as easy as possible to understand, as well as incorporate into modeling. As always, please let us know if there’s anything else we can do to be of assistance as you navigate through this transition. I do want to reiterate that margin expansion continues to be priority for our team. Consistent with prior communication, excluding IPR&D development milestone charges, we expect to drive further non-GAAP operating margin expansion over time. Getting into the numbers underline our updated guidance, there is several items of benefits first quarter results, which are not expected to recur. These include approximately $1.45 billion of COVID antibody sales, U.S. Alimta revenue of approximately $250 million that will be impacted by multi-source generic entrants in Q2 and beyond, a favorable effective tax rate and a one-time benefit related to the resolution of cefaclor patent litigation in Canada. I would also remind you that as we look ahead to the second quarter, the Q2 2021 revenue benefited from the sale of Cialis rights in China, which will provide roughly 2.5 percentage points of headwind to our topline growth in Q2. Starting with revenue, we are increasing the guidance range by $1 billion to now be in the range of $28.8 billion to $29.3 billion, reflecting the additional revenue for bebtelovimab sales in Q1. While project an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rate, we are expecting to offset it with stronger core business performance. We anticipate that any additional revenue from sales of COVID-19 antibodies to be limited begin in Q2 2022, while the U.S. Government has an option to purchase additional 500,000 doses of bebtelovimab no later than July 31st of this year, it is uncertain whether this option will be exercised, and therefore, it is not included in our guidance. Moving down the income statement, GAAP gross margin percent is now expected to be approximately 76%, while non-GAAP margin, gross margin is now expected to be approximately 78%. The majority of this 200 basis point reduction is due to the impact of Q1 bebtelovimab sales, which have lower gross margin and to a lesser extent an increase of approximately $100 million in logistics and manufacturing costs due to inflation. The range for R&D expenses has been increased by $100 million to be $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, driven by investment in our late-stage pipeline, primarily Alzheimer’s clinical development and investment to advance to diagnostics ecosystem. Our guidance includes acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of approximately $521 million, reflecting Q1 charges of $166 million, with the remainder primarily related to a charge associated with the buyout of future obligations that were contingent upon development, regulatory and commercial success of our Meudon selective PI3K inhibitor. This guidance does not include any impact from potential or pending business development transaction. GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 200 basis points to approximately 28% and 30%, respectively, primarily due to the negative impact associated with the acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges to date. Given the accounting change for acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges, in the inherent variability associated with such charges, our non-GAAP operating margin figure will not measure efficiency in the same way it has done historically. However, you contract our operating margin in the way you deem appropriate, knowing that we aim to expand operating margin over time, excluding acquired IPR&D and develop in milestone charges. Our Q1 2022 tax rate and EPS include a favorable impact from the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year is unchanged and assumed that this provision will be deferred or repealed over Congress, effective for 2022. If this provision is not deferred or repealed effective this year then we would expect the reported and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%. It is notable that while this provision favorably impacts certain tax items, which decreased our effective tax rate, we expect it will increase our 2022 cash payments of income taxes by approximately $1.5 billion. Based on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.70 to now be in the range of $7.3 per share to $7.45 per share and lower our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $8.50 to $8.30. That $0.35 reduction are non-core -- in our non-GAAP EPS range includes the 55% decrease due to the year-to-date acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges, partially offset by improved business performance of $0.20 attributable to the net benefit of Q1 bebtelovimab sales and increased investments in R&D. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.",1967.0,1047.0,17.0,14.0,25.0,3.0,3.0,16.0,4.0,4.0,0.01623686723973257,0.013371537726838587,0.02387774594078319,0.0028653295128939827,0.0028653295128939827,0.0028653295128939827
LLY,2022-04-28,2022-04-28,,2022-04-28,2022-04-28T09:00:00-04:00,0,2022-04-28,prepared,,Dr. Dan Skovronsky,"Thanks, Anat. Let me start with today’s exciting announcement. The positive topline results from the tirzepatide SURMOUNT-1 Phase III study. Participants without Type 2 diabetes who have obesity, or overweight with at least one co-morbidity achieved up to 22.5% weight loss at 72 weeks, which translates to a mean weight loss of 52 pounds. Tirzepatide is the first investigational medicines to deliver more than 20% weight loss on average in a Phase III study. Indeed most people on 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams of tirzepatide in this trial achieved 20% or greater weight loss and up to 63% of patients on 15 milligrams achieved this level of weight reduction. Obesity is a chronic disease that needs more effective treatment options to patients. We are working hard at Lilly to create new potentially innovative medicines, with the aim to modernize how this disease is approached. We hope that there is appetite can be Lilly’s first such medicine and the SURMOUNT program has been designed to test just that. I will cover the SURMOUNT-1 results in more detail, but first let me quickly provide an overview of the SURMOUNT Phase III program. The SURMOUNT program has enrolled more than 5,000 people with obesity or overweight across six studies, four of which are global registration studies. On slide 13, you can see key trial design elements for those four global registration studies. All four studies compared the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to placebo as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. SURMOUNT-1 was designed to evaluate treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo to provide weight reduction and safety data for people without Type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight with at least one co-morbidity. SURMOUNT-2 will provide weight reduction and safety data for people with obesity or overweight with Type 2 diabetes. SURMOUNT-3 will provide data on maximizing weight loss following an intensive lifestyle program. And SURMOUNT-4 evaluates maintaining weight loss. We expect the remaining three global studies to read out in the middle of 2023. Note that dose escalation in the SURMOUNT program is consistent with that of the SURPASS program for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes with tirzepatide. Patients start with 2.5 milligrams of tirzepatide and move up every four weeks in 2.5 milligram increments to reach their target dose. In SURMOUNT-3 and 4, study participants who escalate go into the maximum-tolerated dose of either 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, patients escalating the maximum-tolerated dose provides opportunity to evaluate the full potential for weight reduction. Studies vary in duration from 72 weeks to 82 weeks -- 72 weeks to 88 weeks and SURMOUNT-1 will continue through 176 weeks to evaluate whether tirzepatide can actually slow the time to onset of Type 2 diabetes in participants who had pre-diabetes at the time of entering the clinical trial. We believe this will be important additional information for patients and physicians. SURMOUNT-1, a large trial which enrolled over 2500 participants met its co-primary study endpoints and also hit on all pre-specified key secondary endpoints. On slide 14, you can see the first co-primary endpoint in the SURMOUNT-1 study, where tirzepatide delivered up to 22.5% mean body weight reduction in adults with obesity or overweight. With a mean baseline weight across the study of 231 pounds, this translates into a mean body weight reduction of 52 pounds on the 15 milligram treatment arm of the study. Along with the impressive results from the 10 milligram dose, which showed 21.4% mean body weight reduction, we were also very pleased to see how well the 5 milligram performed with a 16% mean body weight reduction also at 72 weeks for the efficacy estimate. Moving to slide 15. Tirzepatide obviously achieve the second co-primary endpoint of driving at least 5% weight reduction, clearly the vast majority of subjects, including greater than 96% of participants in the 10-milligram and 15-milligram arms achieved this level of weight reduction. We are really excited that a key secondary endpoint is SURMOUNT-1 showed up to 60% of patients achieved at least 20% body weight reduction at 72 weeks, again using the efficacy estimate. This is compared to only 1% for participants who achieved greater than 20% weight loss on placebo as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Moving to slide 16. You can see the safety profile from the SURMOUNT-1 study. Tirzepatide was well-tolerated in study participants with the overall safety and tolerability profile similar to incretin-based therapies approved for the treatment of obesity. As in the SURPASS program, the most common reported adverse events were GI-related, generally mild to moderate in severity and usually occurred during dose escalation. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were between 4.3% and 7.1% for tirzepatide treatment arms, compared to 2.6% for placebo. The overall treatment discontinuation rates range from roughly 14% to 16% in the tirzepatide arms compared to over 26% for placebo. The minimal weight loss seen in the placebo treatment group combined with the observed placebo discontinuation rate of 26% demonstrates the limited efficacy of diet and exercise alone and highlights the significant unmet medical need for people with this disease. We will continue to evaluate the SURMOUNT-1 study data and are planning to present findings at a medical meeting in the second half of this year. Of course, we plan to submit our manuscript to a top tier peer reviewed journal. As Dave mentioned earlier, obesity is a chronic disease impacting over 110 million Americans and there is great need for more effective treatment options. While our current alignment with the FDA is to complete the four SURMOUNT global registrational studies prior to submission, we believe the impressive results from SURMOUNT-1 warrant further discussion. Based on our existing robust dataset, we are looking forward to reviewing the data with the FDA and discussing the potential for an expedited path forward for this indication. Moving to the rest of the portfolio. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 27th and slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. There have been several other important developments since our last earnings call and I will cover these by therapeutic area. In diabetes, along with our partner Boehringer Ingelheim, we are proud of the expanded indication for Jardiance as a treatment for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which has been classified as the single largest unmet need in cardiovascular medicine. Jardiance is now the first and only heart failure therapy to demonstrate statistically significant risk reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure regardless of ejection fraction. We also announced the Phase III trial study in Jardiance for chronic kidney disease will stop early due to clear positive efficacy. The recommendation was made by an independent data monitoring committee and while we have not yet seen results from this interim analysis, we are excited about the potential for this new indication and expect to share detailed results from the upcoming primary analysis at a medical meeting in the second half of this year. Last month, we began dosing patients in the first of five Phase III trials for investigational weekly insulin basal insulin FC or BIF. The trial compares weekly BIF to insulin degludec where patients are currently treated with basal insulin. We intend to start the other four Phase III trials later this year. You also see we have advanced our long-acting Amylin receptor agonist to Phase I development in obesity. Shifting to immunology, we presented mirikizumab induction data from LUCENT-1 at the Europeans Crohn’s and Colitis Virtual Congress, demonstrating superiority over placebo for the primary and all key secondary endpoints. These data show patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis achieved statistically superior rates of clinical remission compared to patients taking placebo, with nearly two-thirds of patients responding to mirikizumab. The results indicated improved symptom relief, including decreased bowel urgency and resolution or near resolution of inflammation. Building upon the positive outcomes from LUCENT-1, we look forward to sharing maintenance data from LUCENT-2 later in Q2. We are also excited to announce that we have submitted to the FDA and expect submissions in Europe and Japan in Q2. Mirikizumab has the potential to be the first-in-class L-23p19 inhibitor treatment for people with ulcerative colitis. Last month at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting, we shared lebrikizumab monotherapy data showing more than 50% of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis experienced at least 75% reduction in disease severity at 16 weeks. Additionally, at the revolutionizing atopic dermatitis conference, we shared data showing 70% of patients receiving lebrikizumab combined with topical corticosteroids achieved at least 75% improvement in overall disease severity. We believe these data could help establish a competitive profile for lebrikizumab and we are looking forward to further data from our maintenance studies in the first half of this year to provide insight into the durability of efficacy. Global submissions are expected by year end. Moving to baricitinib. The FDA review for alopecia areata is underway and we are pleased to note that the FDA has granted priority review designation. As expected, we also received a complete response letter from the FDA for baricitinib atopic dermatitis indication, as we were not in alignment with the agency on the indicated population. Finally, in immunology, we have discontinued the Phase II study for IL-2 in all sort of colitis to do a lack of efficacy based on interim analysis. The safety was consistent with that observed in previous studies and this decision does not impact the ongoing or planned studies for IL-2 in SLE or atopic dermatitis, as each disease state evaluates a different clinical hypothesis. Moving on to neuroscience. In the National Coverage Determination issued earlier this month for monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid. We share the disappointment of patients and their caregivers, with this NCD, and we know more generally that the innovation in new medical areas really always starts with data that are less proven and more debated, and may proceed initially through regulatory mechanisms such as accelerated approval. We believe that Medicure’s decision to CED in such circumstances is in conflict with FDA’s and Congress’s intent of expedited regulatory pathways and is likely to have a stifling effect on innovation for new medical areas, causing harm to patients that are waiting and in need of new medicines. That said, we are continuing with our rolling submission to the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway. We intend to complete our initial submission yet in Q2, enabling a potential regulatory decision in early 2023. We believe it would be beneficial for donanemab to obtain accelerated approval proximal to the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase III readout in mid 2023, which would enable parallel discussions with CMS regarding outright coverage and expedited review time for full FDA approval. We believe that given the thoughtful and robust design of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, if the study is positive, it should meet the high level of evidence criteria set forth by CMS in the NCD decision. At that time, we will advocate for CMS to reconsider outright coverage of donanemab. As we have stated previously, it’s inconceivable to us that one substantial evidence of clinical benefit has been established for any Alzheimer’s medicine, people with the disease won’t have access to it. Our view of the mid- and long-term opportunity to help patients with donanemab remains unchanged. Shifting now to oncology with pirtobrutinib. We are also working on a rolling submission here under the accelerated approval pathway. In this case for mantle cell lymphoma. Here, we also expect to complete our initial submission in Q2. We received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding the submission for sintilimab, which was in line with our expectation after the Oncology -- Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting earlier this year. Along with Innovent, we are assessing next steps for sintilimab in the U.S. Further in the oncology pipeline, we started two additional Phase III studies. The first is an additional study evaluating Verzenio in HR positive HER-2 negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant following progression on a CDK46 inhibitor and endocrine therapy. The second is CYCLONE 3, evaluating Verzenio in earlier lines of prostate cancer. We have also advanced our next generation RET inhibitor to Phase I development and we have discontinued our Aurora A kinase inhibitor as we did not see sufficient monotherapy activity to warrant further development. Similarly, in our pain therapeutic area, we have decided to discontinue development of EPIREG and TGF Alpha, because it did not meet criteria for proceeding. Finally, as Dave mentioned earlier, the FDA authorized bebtelovimab for emergency use for certain non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Bebtelovimab neutralizes OMICRON including the BA2 sub limit -- lineage as demonstrated by sudo virus and authentic virus neutralization assays. As you can see, Q1 was another busy, but successful quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly.

We delivered solid sales growth, driven largely by volume from our key growth products, which represent 61% of our core business. We continue to see opportunity for meaningful operating margin expansion over time, excluding the impact of acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. We made significant progress developing new medicines with exciting advances, including for Jardiance and HFpEF, the EUA Authorization for bebtelovimab, the submission of mirikizumab and ulcerative colitis, as well as positive Phase III results for tirzepatide in obesity and Jardiance in chronic kidney disease. Finally, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase. We are committed to invest for the long term to advance promising R&D opportunities and support launches to bring groundbreaking therapies to patients diagnosed with some of the most challenging diseases facing human kind, like diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer, cancer and autoimmune disorders. With the progress we have seen to-date, we remain extremely confident in our long-term growth prospects.

I think the market opportunity is, kind of remains what we thought before, we see it as a sizable opportunity and when we look at the just the massive numbers of people who live with obesity over 100 million people in the U.S., 650 million people globally contributes a burden of over $1 trillion globally. We do think it’s a huge opportunity. It should be perceived as a -- and treated as a chronic illness. It not only has health implications. But if you live with obesity, it’s a very visible disease unlike others that really brings with it some unfortunate stigma into society that really hurts individuals both physically and emotionally. And so there is a need to treat this disease. The market is not going to develop overnight. We have to increase awareness that this is a chronic disease that needs to be treated. We do need to establish and grow the access for it. So we are looking long-term to this. I think it’s important for us to be able to build the foundation, build the knowledge that this is a chronic disease, get that appreciated by healthcare professionals and payers and then grow the market. So we are going to look long-term. We are investing obviously not only in tirzepatide but early -- many early assets, because we do think this is a need in the marketplace that we need to focus on, and obviously, we are quite delighted by SURMOUNT-1, not only the high dose. I mean, obviously, when we saw the 52 pounds of weight loss at the high dose on average, we were wowed by that, but I am also as excited about the 16% weight loss at the 5 milligram, because everyone -- we look at the averages, but there is no averages out there. Every individual is different and we need to have a medication that at different doses offer different weight loss and so I am very pleased about the dose profile and the weight loss profile across all the doses. As Dan said, we have originally on the -- on your filing question, we have aligned with the FDA on four trials for the SURMOUNT-1, 2, 3 and 4 program. But given the huge market need and given this data, we do think it warrants a discussion with the FDA about whether we can find a path to accelerate it to the marketplace to meet this need. The SURMOUNT-1 data is great. We also have over 4,000 patients in the SURPASS-5 Global Restoration studies that provides a lot of good information on the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in the diabetes population to go along with SURMOUNT-1. So we look forward to that conversation. I think when we -- when you look at, I think your last question was, are we more excited about diabetes and obesity. I think we are equally excited about both of them. Obviously, we will focus our attention on diabetes first, still a huge massive unmet need. We have unfortunately only half of people who live with Type 2 diabetes in good control. So we will focus on that and then we will focus long term on obesity as I have said earlier.

So, first, do you agree with that, and second, is if you do, how are you guys thinking about the size and scope of obesity outcome study?

Of course, we believe and there is really quite a bit of evidence that weight loss will lead to really strong benefits in outcomes across a variety of diseases. Obviously, cardiovascular disease is near the top of the list, but many others as well. We know a lot from bariatric surgery, which has shown that it can reverse Type 2 diabetes or prevent the onset of diabetes. It can reduce cardiovascular risk. It can decrease even mortality when you get weight loss. That’s really in the range of what we saw in this trial. So we are excited about the potential to change those outcomes. Of course, as you point out, we have to demonstrate that. We will do that over time. But given where we are in our understanding of this disease process and given the depth of unmet medical need in obesity, I don’t see that data as a gating factor for user reimbursement of the drug.

The -- I wouldn’t look backwardly at the fact that with that obesity agents up to this point really haven’t been able to secure good access, at the weight loss levels that you were seeing 5%, 6%, 7% weight loss. No one was able to produce or no one has produced health outcome benefits at that level of weight loss. So it makes sense for payers not opening access for those probably more cosmetic than true health benefits. But if you are looking at a product like tirzepatide that can deliver up to 22.5% weight loss, we do believe and there’s good data out there to suggest that’s going to really improve and lead to the good health outcomes. We have to produce that over time and we will do that. But I don’t think that will limit us from gaining access in the meantime. I think when you look at novel access [inaudible] under at 20 million, 25 million, people who live with obesity in the U.S. having access. So I think we can continue to build on that. I think there was a real big win for obesity access recently with the Federal Health employees gaining access for obesity agents. So I think that’s a important trend. Also understand that we are -- we have -- we are dedicated to produce a series of trials that we hope will demonstrate and we expect to demonstrate good outcomes with tirzepatide for sleep apnea, HFpEF, as well as our outcome study that will include cardiovascular. Now those are indications right now that do have access. So both Part D you take sleep apnea, for example, that has good coverage in both commercial and Part D. So we do expect that we show good outcomes there that for those people who have obesity and sleep apnea that we should be able to gain access for it. So we think we do believe that access will start off and where it is today and grow it over time.

Our view of our program in the landscape hasn’t really changed all that much in light of the recent announcements. Obviously, as it relates to the two most recent trial readouts, we have yet to see the actual data, though at least in one case there were some directional clues given by company management. I think largely speaking we saw those studies as sort of underpowered Phase II trials, and I think in many cases, what we are hearing qualitatively from those companies suggests exactly that. In other words, trends in the right direction but underpowered studies. Our initial second lines randomized trial that we are recruiting right now is a fully powered Phase III study.

Just a quick question, Dan, this is a very large Phase III program that you are conducting for obesity and more broadly, but the statement that you will be pursuing a potential faster path to market with regulatory authorities on the basis of SURMOUNT-1 data is, it’s certainly intriguing. How do you see the likelihood of success and is the real separation there the 20% threshold, do you really think that’s the potential game changer or is it something else in the data that we have yet to see that you think is unique and compelling? And then, separately, just wanted to follow up on the -- your comments on the Alzheimer’s side of things.

Seamus, I mean, let me start with tirzepatide and sort of the comments that I made on the regulatory path. The FDA has clear guidance on what’s required to get an indication for anti-obesity drug and those guidance documents form the basis of our previous discussions in alignment with the agency. Our base case based on those has been and really continues to be the submission will require the full package of Phase III data from this trial -- from this program. On the other hand, as I said, I think, we were impressed and delighted with the data that we got from SURMOUNT-1. It’s a very large Phase III trial as you pointed out and there are a number of elements here that encouraged us to open the door for additional discussion with the FDA. You asked what is it specifically. Maybe I will highlight two or three things. First, the efficacy, as you pointed out, the more than 20% weight loss is really unprecedented level of weight loss in the field and I think that’s exciting for patients and addressing a very significant unmet medical need. Second is the safety and tolerability data that we got. I think there is a pleasant surprise there if you look at how well tolerated this drug was, how few discontinuations we had, and as I pointed out, more discontinuations for treatment on placebo made more than on the active arms of the drug, just indicating that people tolerate this why I want to stay on the drug and appreciate the weight loss benefits they are getting. So the very good safety and tolerability profile that we are seeing, combined with the extraordinary efficacy profile, I think, is a major step in that argument. The last piece, of ,course is that we don’t see this data in isolation. This builds on a very significant Type 2 diabetes program, which of course, involves many patients with Type 2 diabetes and obesity and demonstrated safety and efficacy in that setting as well. So we will see how that goes and I think to circle back to Chris’ question, when do we learn more, as we have discussions with regulators. If we learn more and we see that there is an opportunity for expedited path here, we will be as forthcoming with investors as possible. Your second question here was around Alzheimer’s and where we are thinking about our profile versus competitors and when those competitor readouts, what are we going to be looking at. I think we have a number of design elements in TRAILBLAZER 2 that we spoke about previously that we think could be very important, probably, starting with our use of biomarkers to select patients not just amyloid positivity, but also win doing in on patients with intermediate tau levels. So these aren’t patients who have too much tau in the brain, because we think there beyond the point where anti-amyloid drugs will help them nor are they patients with no tau in the brain because we think those patients won’t progress even on placebo, and therefore, won’t get benefit from a drug. So we think selecting those patients will give us the opportunity to see better efficacy in a more homogenous background. Second, we think we have a drug that lowers amyloid faster and to a steeper degree and that should translate to improved benefits. And then third is some of the statistical differences in our analysis plan focusing on a composited measure ADRS, which we are excited about and things should be more highly powered to see a larger effect size. So all of those things combined lead us to a point where even if competitors trials are negative, and I think, there’s a reasonable chance one or both could be, we won’t be discouraged. What I expect to see though is when we look at the totality of data from competitor readouts prior to ours, we will see evidence that lowering amyloid in general is having a positive effect on solving cognition and function. Even if some trials on some endpoints at some time points hit or don’t hit statistical significance, I think it’s that totality data that will encourage us, and then as I said, our trial’s designed to hit. So that’s what we are hoping for and that’s what we expect middle of next year.",743.0,333.0,15.0,12.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,0.0,0.04504504504504504,0.036036036036036036,0.015015015015015015,0.006006006006006006,0.006006006006006006,0.009009009009009009

This is Alice Nettleton on for Tim Anderson. Hey, just on tirzepatide, so based on your product and novo to the go, the weight loss is impressive, but with based products that still about 30% to 40% of patients who placebo who don’t achieve at least 5% weight reduction, which is quite a high percentage and it almost seems to suggest a resistance mechanism of some sort to circular. So is there any mechanistic rationale or predictability for those who don’t respond? Thank you.",94.0,40.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.1,0.025,0.0,0.0

I think you are right, in past studies of different medications for weight loss. There have been a lot of patients who didn’t respond. That’s not the case with tirzepatide. So we are really delighted that at the 10 milligram and 15 milligram dose, more than 96% of patients had at least 5% weight loss. So this drug is working to some extent in the vast majority of patients in this trial and nearly two-thirds of the patients at the highest dose are getting 20% weight loss, which is really a life-changing level. So I think you are right. Patients are -- have variable degrees of resistance to anti-obesity mechanisms. But I also think that this combination of GIP and GLP that we have in tirzepatide is such a powerful mechanism that it overcomes those resistant patients for the most part.

It’s how I maintain my physique. Well, I am joking. So, donanemab, I have two questions. One, have you been able to finalize the stack line with FDA? And also given your confidence in donanemab, I am curious why it would not make sense to have a CDR Sum of the Boxes endpoint in there in TRAILBLAZER for the head-to-head versus. And then, separately, just a quick one, I noticed your slides mentioned the IL-2 conjugate in ulcerative colitis has been removed and I couldn’t tell if it’s being discontinued in that because this trial is barely started less than six months ago.

I think we have been public about our stats plan. I think the focus on ADRS is well warranted by all of the data that we have collected by a pretty detailed statistical analysis, many of which have been published on past trials, which just show this is an outcome that performs better from a statistical perspective then things like CDR Sum of Boxes, while still capturing both function and cognition. So CDR is noisy and also appears unreliable. If you look across sister studies, for example, the two solanezumab studies or the two aducanumab studies, CDR Sum of Boxes can move in opposite directions in different studies whereas ADLs and ADAS-Cog, the two components of ADRS are much more reliable, move together show consistent effects. So that’s where we are, I think it’s an evolution of endpoints and we will do our best to justify that with regulators once we have our data. Why wouldn’t we have CDR Sum of Boxes was the second part question. Well, of course, we do. It’s -- will be a gated secondary for sure, and I think from our perspective, the worst case scenario is that we are held to achieving ADRS and CDR Sum of Boxes. That’s okay. If that happens, I hope and expect that we will have a good chance to hit CDR Sum of Boxes. But, of course, we are going to put what we see is the least noisy, most reliable, most formative endpoint first in our statistical analysis, which is ADRS. With respect to IL-2, you are right. This was a pretty fast in and out in ulcerative colitis. We were pleased to enroll this Phase II study pretty quickly. We triggered interim analysis based on a certain number of patients with a certain amount of follow up and based on that analysis and pre-specified criteria, we do not see enough efficacy to proceed. So it fail that futility analysis. We dropped that indication, wind down that particular study in ulcerative colitis, but two other indications persist.",357.0,161.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.031055900621118012,0.043478260869565216,0.006211180124223602,0.012422360248447204,0.0,-0.012422360248447204

So, just to be clear, has FDA or other regulatory body encouraged Lilly to file early based on the SURMOUNT-1 results? So that’s the first question.

I think there are some things here that are quite a bit more positive than maybe most people would have expected. Certainly, the level of efficacy here that was achieved was I think higher than most expectations, as well as the tolerability. So the adverse events from nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, lower probably than what most people would have expected treatment discontinuations particularly lower. So I think on the whole, we have a data package that does exceed expectations. So it’s really at the top end of the range of what we thought might be possible for a drug tirzepatide.

We have been interested in biology of other incretins and incretin like pathways for many years, maybe a decade now or more. Amylin is one of those pathways. We have worked on dual Amylin calcitonin receptor agonist. This is a pure Amylin agonist. We are exploring these and other similar mechanisms as complements likely to tirzepatide. I don’t expect any of these mechanisms to offer this kind of weight loss, 22.5% weight loss. But I think it may be for some patients who desire even additional weight loss that you could stack one of these mechanisms on top of tirzepatide. But clearly, we have raised the bar and we will look through our Phase I and Phase II portfolio now with even higher criteria for progressing. I think to a new weight loss mechanism now is going to have to be in the very high 20s I think to be an exciting advance beyond tirzepatide. Maybe adding something to tirzepatide could accomplish that and offer the majority of patient’s efficacy similar even better to a bariatric surgery.

The -- when you look at diabetes versus obesity, it’s hard to compare, I think, to suggest that because the nature of the diseases that you will have like similar discontinuation rates or our length of therapy. When you look at when someone starts Trulicity in Type 2 diabetes, they only have a fraction of the beta cell health of someone who is normal before the onset and the run-up of pre-diabetes and diabetes has lowered the functioning of the beta cell and so what you have in diabetes is that beta cell health continues to decline and then at some point, you may have to go on insulin. We don’t believe that it will have that same dynamic and obesity that the effect of weight loss with someone who lives with obesity is not going to have that same effect of kind of wearing off with the beta cell health that you see for Trulicity and our GLPs in diabetes. So we do believe that the weight loss will be more durable and that patients will be well motivated to stay on therapy.

So we do remain confident in donanemab and believe that TB-2 and our overall TRAILBLAZER program have extensive data and so as we review the requirements in the NCD, we believe our data should be sufficient to meet the high level of evidence criteria set forth by CMS if TB-2 as positive. Obviously, we will need to review this data with CMS and gain their agreement. So we will do that very quickly. Our intention is as soon as we have that data to request reconsideration for national coverage and we believe that having two positive pivotal trials should meet that high level of evidence. As far as CMS, we have engaged with them throughout the process and so we will continue to do so moving forward. And there’s a number of statements in the NCD that we will see clarity on to gain additional clarity as we move forward. But, yes, we do believe that we should meet that high level of evidence, but pending those discussions with CMS.",196.0,82.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.06097560975609756,0.012195121951219513,0.06097560975609756,0.0,0.012195121951219513,0.04878048780487805

So a lot of you will have question in the duration of therapy. Have you talked to payers about once you reach a point, where maybe some of your co-morbidities are gone and you are on drug, if they are going to be still reimbursed therapy? And then the second question for you is, like, when you think about this data now that you have in-house is very robust. What new trials might you think about or new indications whether it would be obesity without comorbidities or other indications might you want to start, now that you sort of have this in-house and it’s clear?

And when we are having discussions with payers, they do -- they are excited about the obesity class, if we can demonstrate outcomes. And if they have a patient who has seen benefits from an anti-obesity medication, they actually want to work with us to make sure that those individual stay on therapy in order to get and maintain the weight loss they have seen and so I think there will be opportunities for us to partner with payers to ensure that we can maintain individuals on chronic medications. I think our expectation is that people do need to stay on tirzepatide long term in order to get the -- and maintain the weight benefits and we will be working with payers to make sure that we can maintain that weight loss, so people can get the outcomes that they need.

I mean, I think, that we are going to talk about and in today’s discussion obviously we will internalize this data. We will -- this is, as we said earlier, this is an important therapeutic area for us, massive unmet needs and one that we are looking to play the long-term game on. So when you put those together, we obviously are, we will be very thoughtful and aggressive and if we do feel that there is additional need for trials on tirzepatide that can provide insights to payers and healthcare professionals, we will do those trials.

In Q2, we achieved a number of impactful pipeline milestones, including approval and launch of Mounjaro in the U.S., the FDA submission and acceptance of dononumab as well as pertibrutinib and positive top line results for lebrikizumab and EU and Japan submissions for mirikizumab. This pipeline progress underscores the breadth and depth of our exciting long-term outlook. Perhaps the headline story for Lilly in the second quarter was the launch of Mounjaro in the U.S., where initial uptake has been strong. We're hearing a great deal of enthusiasm from the field and we're excited about the potential for this new medicine to provide A1c and weight loss benefits to adults living with type 2 diabetes. We remain focused on gaining broad open access for Manzaro and expect the full impact of this medicine for patients and our business to be realized over time as that access is achieved. Turning to Q2 financial results and progress on our strategic deliverables, we saw a relatively flat top line performance in constant currency. As strong volume-driven growth for key products like Verzenio, Jardiance and Trulicity was offset by lower prices as well as for Alimta patent expiry in key markets around the world and last year's sale of Cialis rights in China. Volume for this quarter grew a robust 10%. When excluding revenue from Alimta, the sale of Cialis rights in China and COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 6% compared to Q2 2021. In Q2, our newer medicines contributed 18% to volume growth and now account for 67% of our core business revenue which we believe, together with our robust pipeline is the most important indicator of the strength and durability of our growth outlook. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79.8% in Q2, an increase of approximately 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.5% which includes a negative impact of approximately 680 basis points attributed to acquire in-process R&D and development milestone charges. At our investment community meeting in December, we outlined 5 potential new medicines that could launch over the next 2 years which could serve as catalysts to driving top-tier growth through the decade. There have been important pipeline development since our Q1 earnings call for all 5, including the U.S. approval and launch of Manzaro in type 2 diabetes and a positive CHMP opinion in the European Union. FDA acceptance and priority review designation for donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. FDA acceptance and priority review designation for purtaprutinib in mantle cell lymphoma for patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor. -- submissions for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis in the EU and in Japan, positive top line 52-week data for lebrikizumab in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. And we also announced U.S., EU and Japan regulatory approval for Olumiant in alopecia areata. Last month, we announced plans for a $2.1 billion investment in 2 new manufacturing sites here in Indiana to support increasing demand for existing products as well as demand for potential new medicines in our pipeline. This announcement followed Lilly's recent investments in new facilities in Massachusetts, North Carolina and Ireland and will further expand Lilly's manufacturing network for active ingredients and new therapeutic modalities such as genetic medicines. These investments underscore our confidence in the growth of our portfolio in the company. Finally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends to our shareholders in Q2. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 earnings call, including several important regulatory clinical and COVID-19 antibody updates. As previously announced in Q2, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. government to supply 150,000 doses of beptalizumab for approximately $275 million in an ongoing effort to provide COVID-19 treatment options for patients. Doses of beptalizumab valued at approximately $130 million were shipped in Q2 and the remainder of that order will ship in Q3. Today, we are announcing that in collaboration with the U.S. government, we intend to begin making beptilizumab available for purchase by states, hospitals and certain other providers through a sole distributor agreement. This will happen later this month which is prior to the anticipated depletion of the U.S. government's currently available supply. As we move from large ad hoc federal government purchases, the sales and distribution of COVID-19 antibodies to a broader set of purchasers, we will now integrate estimated sales into our forward guidance. As we have said previously, we don't see COVID-19 antibodies as a major long-term driver of growth for the company. Nevertheless, we will continue to do our part where we can to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic with the last monoclonal antibody treatment standing that neutralizes against the Omacron variant.",787.0,404.0,15.0,5.0,11.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.03712871287128713,0.012376237623762377,0.027227722772277228,0.0049504950495049506,0.0,0.024752475247524754

I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. We had a few notable items impacting the year-over-year financial comparisons. Foreign exchange rates had roughly 300 basis point impact on revenue this quarter as we saw Q2 revenue declined 4% or 1% on a constant currency basis. In Q2 of 2021, we sold our rights to Cialis in China resulted in $170 million of onetime revenue impact. And this quarter, we also saw the full impact of the loss of exclusivity for Alimta in Europe and Japan and have started to see the impact of multiple generic entrants in the U.S. [Operator Instructions]",112.0,57.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.03508771929824561,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.0,-0.017543859649122806

So when excluding revenue from Alimta, the sales of Calistri in China in Q2 of last year and COVID antibody total revenue grew 6%, highlighting the solid momentum for our core business in the second quarter. We expect that this growth rate will accelerate in the second half of the year. Moving on to gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 50 basis points to 79.8% in Q2 of 2022. This increase in gross margin was primarily driven by product mix and the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold, partially offset by lower realized prices. Increase in logistics and manufacturing costs due to inflation had a modest negative impact on gross margin in Q2. Total operating expenses increased 14% this quarter which as discussed on our Q1 earnings call, are now inclusive of acquired in-process R&D and development milestone charges following guidance from the SEC. -- acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges represented nearly 1,200 basis points of the Q2 OpEx growth. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 4%, driven mostly by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expenses increased 8%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies. This quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges of $440 million or $0.46 of EPS primarily related to a charge associated with the buyer of substantially all future obligations that are contingent upon the development, regulatory and commercial success of our mutant selective PI3K alpha inhibitor. In Q2 2021, acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges were $43 million or $0.04 of EPS. Operating income decreased 32% in Q2, primarily due to higher acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 20.5% which includes the negative impact of approximately 680 basis points attributed to these charges. Other income and expense was expense of approximately $13 million this quarter compared with income of $5 million in Q2 of 2021. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 14.2%, a decrease of 10 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. The -- this decrease was driven by favorable tax impact related to the implementation of a provision of the 2017 Tax Act related to the capitalization of R&D expenses, offset by the tax impact of nondeductible development milestones. At the bottom line, earnings per share declined 32% this quarter to $1.25 per share. The most significant driver of the year-over-year decline was the impact of acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges which had $0.46 negative impact in Q2 of this year compared to $0.04 in Q2 of last year. On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume and revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 6%. Excluding revenue from Alimta which declined significantly due to broad generic entry in May and COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the U.S. This volume-driven growth was led by Trulicity, Verzenio and Dorian. We experienced a net price decline of 8% for Q2, driven by lower realized prices for Humalog, ALIMTA and Forteo due to higher rebated segments, making slightly larger portion of the business, higher contracted rates and the list price reduction for insulin lives for injection this year. Lower realized prices for Taltz were also a driver due to the impact of changes to estimates for rebates and discounts, largely driven by favorable adjustment in the base period and to a lesser extent, continued pull-through of existing access. For the first half of 2022, net price decline in the U.S. was 4% and we continue to expect mid-single-digit net price decline for the full year. Moving to Europe. Revenue in Q2 grew 1% in constant currency. Excluding revenue from Alinta which lost exclusivity in June of 2021, revenue grew 12% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Jardiance, False and Verzenio. For Japan, Q2 revenue decreased 22% in constant currency as our business there continues to be negatively affected by significant declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and Alimta which both faced generic entry beginning in June 2021. Key growth products represented 69% of total revenue in Japan and grew 11% in Q2 on a constant currency basis. We continue to expect a return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023. In China, revenue declined 32% in constant currency, driven by the impact of the NRDL formulary access, resulting in lower realized prices, partially offset by increased volume for certain newer products, including Verzenio, Tyva, Trulicity and Taltz. We also experienced a price decline for Humalog due to the impact of volume-based procurement. We expect improved access to continue to drive future volume growth more than offsetting the price decline over time. With the latest COVID-19 outbreaks in China and to subsequent protective measures intended to control the spread of the virus, we have seen lower volume than we otherwise would have expected in Q2, particularly for infused products. For Tivit, we are also seeing the impact of increased competitive pressures. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 3% in constant currency, primarily driven by increased sales of key growth products. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit net price decline in each of the U.S., EU and Japan and a double-digit price decline in China, resulting in a worldwide net price decline in the high single digits. As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove 18 percentage points of volume growth this quarter and continue to underpin our overall performance and outlook. Slide 10 further highlights the contribution of our key growth products. This quarter, these brands grew 20% or nearly 24% in constant currency, generating $4.3 billion in sales and making up 67% of our core business revenue. We continue to see further growth opportunities for these products. For example, we're extremely pleased to see the strong trajectory of Verzenio driven by the adjuvant indication, including recent acceleration in new to brand share of market. In the injectable incretin market, we see significant opportunity for further class growth as these medicines currently make up only 25% of total prescription in the U.S. branded diabetes market and have the prospect of expanding the market through the earlier usage for glucose control and weight loss in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Trulicity is experiencing accelerated demand in many international markets due to market growth and the limited availability of competitor GLP in select markets. We are working to meet this increased demand, while also implementing actions in select countries to manage growth and minimize patient impact. This outlook for Trulicity is included in our guidance. Lilly is thrilled to have both Trulicity which has the longest length of therapy of any GLP-1 and Mounjaro which could offer a step change in innovation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic indications as option in this class of medicine. Given the excitement and significant interest with the FDA approval of Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes, I'd like to briefly provide an update on what we're seeing and hearing in terms of early launch. After U.S. approval in mid-May, our full scale launch began in mid-June. Our commercial team is prepared, energized and observing a high level of engagement across channels as we roll out a patient-centric approach to launching Monga for patients with type 2 diabetes. The financial results you see from Anjar today reflect significant utilization of samples were accepted and co-pay assistance program to get patients off to a strong start. Pierre negotiations are progressing as expected and we're taking a disciplined approach to establish Monza's access and are focused on delivering the same broad open access which we achieved for Trulicity. As we remain focused on strong execution, we're encouraged by the prescription trends from Mounjaro, including the most recent IQVIA data, shown over 20% share of market for new-to-brand prescriptions in the Type 2 diabetes injectable incretin class. We are also pleased to see that total Lilly-Ntabren share in the type 2 diabetes injectable incurring class has grown nearly 12 percentage points since the launch of Mounjaro. Given the heavy utilization of co-pay cards as we build out access for Mounjaro, prescription trends will likely provide a more accurate measure of launch uptake than net sales over the next few quarters. We are pleased with the initial uptake of Mounjaro which is at the high end of our contemplated scenarios. We do not anticipate supply constraints for the U.S. launch of Mounjaro and we will monitor U.S. uptake to determine the appropriate timing for OUS launches. As a reminder, over the last several years, we have made significant investments to grow our global manufacturing capacity to support Manja volume, including our new RTP side in North Carolina which will come online in 2023. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. For the first half of the year, we invested $4.5 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent as we continue to fund our key marketed products and expected new launches, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders. Slide 13 is our updated 2022 financial guidance. Our full year revenue outlook is unchanged. And -- it now includes an additional $400 million of headwind from foreign exchange rates since our previous guidance update for a total impact of roughly $700 million of FX headwind for the full year compared with our original guidance. This incremental headwind is offset by additional forecasted revenue from our COVID-19 antibody betolizumab which includes $275 million from the U.S. government agreement announced in June of this year as well as estimated revenue from the inception of non-U.S. government distribution that Dave mentioned earlier. As we look ahead, Q3 will mark the first full quarter impact of Alimta U.S. fab Nexi. In addition, Q3 of 2021 revenue benefited from Ilunion COVID-19 sales that will provide roughly 2.5 percentage points of headwind to our top line growth in the quarter. Our outlook for gross margin, SG&A and research and development remains unchanged. While the range is unchanged, SG&A does include additional commercial investments for selected key growth products in the second half of the year. Our guidance now include acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges of approximately $610 million, reflecting total charges in the first half of the year. We have had no material acquired IP R&D or development milestone charges at this point in Q3 and this guidance does not include any impact from potential or pending business development transactions in the second half of the year. GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 100 basis points to approximately 27% and 29%, respectively, primarily due to the negative impact attributable to foreign exchange rates and acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges to date. Our non-GAAP range for other income and expense remains unchanged. On a reported basis, other income and expense is now expected to be expense in the range of $500 million to $600 million, reflecting the impact of net losses on investments in equity securities during the second quarter. Our tax rate and EPS in the first half of the year still includes a favorable impact of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year assumes this provision will be deferred or repealed by Congress, effective for 2022. We -- if this provision is not the further repealed effective this year, then we would expect a reported and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%. Based on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.34 to now be in the range of $6.96 to $7.11 per share and lowered our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.25 to be in the range of $7.90 to $8.05. The $0.25 reduction in our non-GAAP EPS range is driven entirely by the impact of foreign exchange rates as the impact of EPS of acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges for selected -- and selected products are offset by impact of additional sales of baptilozumab.

Looking across Lilly R&D, I continue to be quite encouraged by the potential we have to turn cutting-edge science into life-changing medicines for patients. This potential is becoming a reality in the late-stage portfolio, where I'll focus my remarks today. But also it's becoming more and more evident in our earlier-stage projects and I look forward to providing updates on some of these assets in future quarters. Given updates we provided at ADA in June, including detailed results from Surmont 1, I'll focus today's R&D update on the late-stage progress since our last earnings call more generally. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of August 1 and Slide 15 shows potential key events for the year. I'll cover both of these slides by therapeutic area. Starting with Immunology; along with our partner, Insight, we're proud that Olumiant has now been approved as a first-in-disease systemic treatment for adults with severe alopecia areata in the U.S., EU and Japan. Alopecia areata is a significant unmet medical need and we're delighted about what this medicine could mean for people living with this disease. We also announced top line data from the lebrikizumab Phase III monotherapy maintenance studies in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis which showed 80% of lebrikizumab responders maintained improvements in skin clearance and disease severity at 52 weeks. Data supported both once every 2-week and once every 4-week maintenance dosing with consistent and durable responses. We believe the potential for a once every 4-week maintenance dosing regimen could be an important point of differentiation for patients and healthcare providers. Lilly's planning submission of lebrikizumab to the FDA in 2022, followed by submissions to other regulatory agencies around the world. Almirall has rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis in Europe and is planning for submission to the EMA in 2022. Shifting to mirikizumab. We presented results from the Phase III maintenance study LUCENT-2, at the DDW meeting. This study showed that for patients who responded to treatment on mirikizumab in the 12-week induction period, 50% of patients who received mirikizumab maintenance therapy achieved clinical remission at 1 year compared to 1/4 of patients randomized to placebo. In addition to the U.S. regulatory submission of mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis that we announced earlier this year, we have now submitted in the EU and Japan. Also noted here in Immunology is a Phase II start for a BTLA agonist antibody in SLE and our new KB103 inhibitor shown in Phase I. Our IL-2 conjugate is now listed under its nonproprietary name, RespegAltusleukin. Moving to diabetes. We're thrilled that Manjaris now approved in the U.S. is the first and only GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. We're pleased to have received a positive CHMP opinion in the European Union and we're hopeful for a full approval by the EMA later this quarter. We presented the exciting detailed results from Surmont 1, evaluating truzepatide for treatment of weight management and participants with obesity or overweight at ADA with simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. New data included an exploratory analysis that showed roughly 40% of patients achieved at least 25% weight reduction on the 15-milligram dose compared to less than 1% of patients on placebo. Additionally, we saw meaningful reductions in blood pressure and lipids as well as reduction in fat mass that was nearly 3x greater than that in lean mass. Encouraging data also showed that for those patients who had prediabetes at the start of the study, over 95% returned to normal glucose levels. The efficacy, safety and tolerability data in Surmont 1 exceeded our expectations. Based on our existing robust data set for tirzepatide, we've now engaged with the FDA and we'll have a meeting soon to evaluate whether there's a potential path forward to registration for chronic weight management based on Surmont 1, combined with data from the SURPASS program. We'll continue to communicate to investors as there are material updates. We continue to expand our clinical program for tirzepatide and we've now initiated our Phase III study evaluating tirzepatide for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. We also have become -- we also begun a new trial called SURPASS EARLY which evaluates the long-term safety and efficacy of tirzepatide compared to standard of care when initiated early in the course of type 2 diabetes. Later this year, we'll begin surmount 5, a head-to-head study comparing weight reduction for tirzepatide versus semaglutide 2.4 milligrams. And finally, later this year, we expect to initiate Surmount MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality and obesity study. Moving to our weekly basal insulin Fc, also known as BIF. We've now initiated a second Phase III trial Q2 which is evaluating BIF compared to DEGLIDEC in adults with type 2 diabetes who are starting basal insulin for the first time. Our Phase II GGG triagonist is now listed under its nonproprietary name, Retitrutide. Also in this area, 2 assets have now entered Phase I clinical development, our dual amylin calcitonin receptor agonist or DACRA and our PNPLA3-SIRNA. In oncology, we are announcing today that the FDA has accepted the filing for partabrutinub in mantle cell lymphoma for patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor with priority review designation under an accelerated approval pathway. Improved treatment options are needed for this challenging disease and we're encouraged that this potential new medicine could be available to patients in early 2023 -- in early phase oncology, we've moved our mutant-selective PI3-kinase alpha inhibitor into Phase I development. And finally, moving to neuroscience. We're also pleased to announce the FDA has accepted the filing for genimab for the treatment of early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and has granted priority review designation under an accelerated approval pathway. We continue to look forward to the top line results of the Phase III confirmatory study, Trailblazer ALS 2 by mid-2023 which, if positive, will form the basis of our application for traditional regulatory approval. You also noticed we're now referring to N3PG4 by its nonproprietary name Rimtenatak. We plan to initiate the Phase III program for remternatac in the coming weeks. As you can see, Q2 was another productive quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly.

We're encouraged by the performance of our key growth products which now represent 67% of our core business. We expect to see this grow over time as we work to launch more innovative medicines like Manzaro. Excluding the impact of acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges, we expect to see operating margin expansion from both revenue growth and driving further efficiencies in our business. We saw significant progress in our pipeline this quarter with the approvals of Manzaro in type 2 diabetes and Illumina in alopecia areata. We also saw progress on our next wave of potential growth catalysts with the FDA acceptance of danonumab as well as pertibrutinib and positive top line readout for lebrikizumab and additional submissions for mirikizumab. Finally, we returned $900 million to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. Looking to the future, we are confident in our long-term growth prospects as we are focused on developing groundbreaking therapies in areas of significant unmet need as well as driving exceptional execution for our recently launched medicines, so they reach patients who need them. Before we close, I'd like to comment as well. This is Kevin Hern last call as Head of our IR team. And before I turn the call over to him to moderate the Q&A session, I'd just like to thank him on behalf of our shareholders, our board and of course, our executive team and employees.

What we've seen -- first of all, we're incredibly excited about the very robust launch we've had with Manzaro. We're also excited about the source of business that we're seeing. 72% of Monday's is coming from new patients into the entrain class. We think that's very important for accelerating class growth and we have seen class growth both at total prescriptions, new-to-brand and NTS accelerate since BonCharles launch. Of the 28% of the volume that's coming from switches, only 30% of that is from Trulicity and 70% is from other GLPs. And so as a result, as Anat indicated earlier, we're actually seeing Lilly incretin share market growing which is the sign that we -- of a robust solid foundation that we're laying. And so the NBRx have increased our share by the Lilly share in the injectable market by 12% and new to treatment starts by 10%. So we're very happy. We're growing the class and the market share at the same time. Your second question around payer dynamics, it's going as expected for us. We're trying to stay very disciplined. I think our focus is to set ourselves up for long-term success, not short-term success. -- and that's what we're doing. So it's going as expected.

You’re pointing out that correctly that we intend to pursue a number of related indications for tirzepatide. Some of them have overlapping patient populations. Most of the indications we pursue have a base of patients that either have obesity as a pre-existing and sometimes causative condition such as obstructive sleep apnea or heart failure in people with obesity, other indications might be a mix of type 2 diabetes and obesity representing a large number of patients such as NASH. So where applicable safety exposures from similar proposition can be used to support submissions. Of course, some of those programs are staggered in time.

I guess, basin the feedback you've been getting on that surmountidata, I guess is there any change in terms of how you anticipate payers will approach obesity? I guess the heart of the question is, do you anticipate we're going to really need to see some of the CV morbidity mortality data before we can think about broad coverage for obesity medications? Or are you seeing payers potentially more interested in covering these type of products given some of the profile that kind of emerged from that study? My second question was one for Dave. I guess, on just in healthcare reform. I know you love answering these questions. But I guess, as you guys just been so involved in this process.

The SURMOUNT 1 data was phenomenal data for patients and physicians who treat obesity. We -- I think there's a combination of effects that will affect employers and the government to increase access for obesity agents. One is the data we produce. And I think, obviously, the first data we're producing is the weight loss as well as the factors like lipids and blood pressure. And the data we produce so far has been stellar. So I think the better data we produce and Surmont 1 through SMA4 is just going to help us in the short term. Long term, we think there's a lot of comorbid conditions associated with obesity like CV and heart failure and sleep Pactia and the better data we support there will open up those indications where are highly have a lot of overlap with obesity. And so we're excited about those trials and seeing those data as those trials complete. And then lastly, the more we can drive consumer interest in this, that puts pressure on employers and the government to be able to gain access for this. And so I think we've got strong plans on all 3 fronts and we're excited about the first data disclosure we've had on obesity.

I think everybody probably on the call has a good grasp of what's in this package, Difficult to speculate on probabilities but certainly a lot higher than a month ago that something crosses the line. There may be some adjustments to this as they go through that parliamentary process and whatever changes might occur or still to come in the center in the house. But if what we're looking at passes, maybe that's your question, as you know, we've been for the Part D forms, I think they're good incremental changes, particularly capping annual out-of-pocket and getting rid of the donut hole concept. Unfortunately, they don't improve the concept of facing patient cost sharing on net pricing which we were hoping it would. But by itself, we would support that. The CPI adjustment is not really an issue as probably everyone on this call knows, there's already lots of CPI capping that goes on in the commercial marketplace. And with CPI being where it is now as well. I think list prices in the drug business are not nearly as fast as the rest of the economy. But the negotiation piece is a problem. And I think in the short term, speaking for our company but probably the industry, it doesn't do much. They don't really start until '26 anyway. But in the midterm, there will be, of course, some products that will have attenuated life cycles. And I think that will cause some headwinds for the industry and we'll see if any Lilly products get caught up in that. But probably, to me, the most damaging thing about it is it sends a signal to investors and capital allocators like us that small molecules and particularly small molecules in diseases that require stepwise development like cancer, where we start in stage at later stages and work our way to adjuvant or even in some orphan conditions really aren't wanted and are worth a lot less. So, we'll focus our resources on other areas of innovation. We've got plenty of those. And so will the rest of the sector. And I think that's really a miss for the patients that probably want better oral cancer drugs in the future and orphan disease drugs.

Dave, I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on the comment that you made there with regard to orals, how do you see that impacting your efforts to bring forward oral diabetes drugs? And is it more a benefit to complex oral therapies that aren't small molecule per se but perhaps a more peptide oriented. I know you guys are working on some efforts along those lines. So just interested to know if the legislation would imply that as well from a small molecule perspective, we see a number of oral GLP-1s seeking to come to market. at some point in time? And then separately, just on Dan, on the glucagon mechanism, I see BBG listed in 2 Phase II clinical trials but mazetide, your Axos modulin product is listed just in sort of the Phase 1 in diabetes.

Each project will have to be evaluated one by one. But I think you will probably see 10 years down the line, fewer small molecule oral products developed in the industry than would have been otherwise the case if this bill passes. -- again, that to me is the miss. And I think it -- there's still probably quite a bit of advantage in oral small molecules in sort of large primary care indications, especially if in the case of like GLP, we could accept that weight loss will provide broader benefits for the earlier question about when sort of the belief system tips over and people just accept that chronic weight management could for health like reduced blood pressure is good for cardiovascular risk. And I think those products will be evaluated one by one and big opportunities, I think, will advance and do well. They'll have attenuated life cycle in the government business and that will have to be factored in but we'll look at that. What I was referring to is more, I think, in narrower revenue opportunities, it just gets a lot harder. And when -- by kind of construct, your new indications can't be compressed forward because of the way we develop drugs in some of these diseases, that's a problem. And I don't think that was well thought through and there will be a long-term implication to that. One other thing I probably should say is this bill raises $300 billion for the federal government off the back of the industry, probably cost the industry at least $0.5 trillion and only about $50 billion of that, like 10% is going back to patient benefit support. And I think that's another tenant when we were leading pharma literally was to make sure whatever came out of the industry went back to patients.

We previously said that we have 2 in clinical development, mazdutide which is our oxyntomodulin that's glucagon plus GLP-1 and retitrutide which is our ABG which is glucagon GLP-1 and GIP 1. You're right that the ACG molecule is a head and development that's in Phase II and the oxyntomodulin is still in Phase I. I think they're both viable as next-generation weight loss products. But to be clear here, it's a very high borrower looking for a major step change above the really remarkable results we saw in Surmont One.

Of course, we always reach for our competitors' success on clinical trials. We want great data so that we can have great drugs to help patients. I think the novo they pass the interim analysis but didn't stop the trial for efficacy is fine. I think there's really pretty significant differences here between tirzepatide and semaglutide that we just have to remember, a different mechanism, a different degree of efficacy on various outcomes, different trial designs, different populations to some extent. So we don't change our design of our SURMOUNT MMO study. We don't change our thinking about probably success. As Mike said earlier, we're highly confident in this mechanism. -- based on all of the data that we've seen, of course, starting with a quite dramatic weight loss which should be a benefit on morbidity and mortality from obesity.

So the fact is bottom line is we remain convinced about the mid- and long-term opportunity for donanemab and the Alzheimer's portfolio. Our focus right now is obviously on the rapid availability of donanemab for the appropriate patients through the accelerated approval pathway and then reconsideration with Phase III data. And we remain optimistic that with -- particularly with traditional FDA approval, FDA -- or sorry, CMS would not continue to limit coverage for on-label treatments. Now obviously, you mentioned competitor readout. As we've noted on prior calls, there is a chance that we'll see mixed results in some of these readouts due to the differences in the medicines and their trial designs. And as you know well, we have some unique design features in TV2 and a medicine that demonstrates rapid and deep plaqclearance. So we won't be discouraged if others miss their primary endpoints. And so we'll be following that closely, obviously. But in the near term, of course, we have to acknowledge that patient access will be very limited under the current CMS and CD with accelerated approval. But what that does do with the accelerated approval is really enable us to engage quickly with CMS following that Phase III data and hopefully drive reconsideration at that point. And it also allows us to accelerate the traditional approval through a supplemental BLA. So what we'll do in the near term, following a potential approval and the accelerated pathway is use that time to build out the diagnostic ecosystem to help physicians with the referral process and infusion systems.

The question is, what is the depth of the information exchange between DSMBs and sponsors at that time? For instance, if a study is continuing past an interim look, is the conversation only 3 words, study is continuing? Or is it more expensive? Or does it depend?

We've been really successful in our diabetes portfolio in driving the growth and utilization of Trulicity. At the same time, we've seen accelerated market growth. And we have seen in some select markets, the amplified demand for Trulicity because semaglutide is not available in full extent in a number of markets. In terms of where we've seen volatility in where that is occurring. And so we're evaluating the local situation is quite dynamic and we're ramping up as much as we can to need this amplified demand.

I understand where your question is going and we probably don't weigh in specifically on what others might do or see but I'll tell you how we run DSMBs and how we think about them generally across the industry. There's a couple of principles at play here. First, of course, is independence. This is not something run by the sponsor. And I think that's an important consideration for patient safety. We don't see the data they see and we're not privy to the discussions as a rule. The second is that we do set for DSMB's rules in advance by which they should make decisions. Those could be very simple rules in some cases, like hit statistical significance with a certain alpha on the primary endpoint or they could be more complex rules looking for consistency across secondaries or subpopulations or a higher bar of efficacy on the primary so that you're sure that you have a compelling effect that varies from study study and sponsor to sponsor. I'm sure. The third thing is that the recommendations that DSMBs get back to sponsors are often prespecified. So we'll tell the DSMB if it meets these criteria. This is what you tell us. And if it doesn't, this is what you tell us. And they usually are a matter of fact, without color that could compromise the integrity or cause one unblinding of an ongoing study. So I hope that's helpful in understanding how DSMBs work. I think at many companies, if there is a surprising recommendation for the DSMB such as to stop a study, there will often be a process where the sponsor or 1 or 2 representatives of the sponsor are unblinded so they can confirm the DSMB conclusion before taking action. But that wouldn't be typical for a simple study continuous kind of decision.",320.0,136.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.007352941176470588,0.007352941176470588,0.04411764705882353,0.0,0.007352941176470588,0.0

David, thanks for your question on the launch of Manzaro outside of the U.S. and our thoughts around that. One of the key aspects of how we take a look at launching outside the U.S. It's typical for most product launches across pretty much all therapeutic areas to have some lag to U.S. launches, either through -- because of regulatory approval and process but also pricing and reimbursement -- and it can take up to a year to get reimbursement in a number of markets. So the volumes in that first year of launch are somewhat limited.

Now what you would expect when you have a new product like Monger especially with endocrinologists that they don't always see naive patients. They have a good bolus of patients who are already on GLPs. And so when they -- when we talked to them about Montero, they're excited about the opportunity to actually switch some of the patients who are not performing or not at goal at the current GLP. And so I think early on, you'll see like a higher percent coming from switches versus naive. And so today, we have 72% that is naive. If you look at at Trulicity, that's in like 88%.

We too are pleased with how this has gone so far this year. I think to your question on why and where it goes from here. On the why, I think it largely comes down to the clinical data from the MONARCHY study itself. I think the data are demonstrable and when physicians and patients see them, they quickly want to integrate the drug into their practice. Now in addition to that and this is something we hoped would see happen, we think we're seeing some share gains in the metastatic setting as well, particularly among physicians who historically used other CDK4/6 inhibitors are gaining experience with Verzenio by utilizing it in the adjuvant setting and then starting to use it in the metastatic setting where perhaps they hadn't been before. So that was part of what we hoped might happen. I think we're seeing that happen a little bit so far this year. That having been said, in terms of where we go from here, I'll just say 2 things. One, we continue to interact with physicians who are still not yet aware of the MONARCHY data. And so that's, of course, good and bad. It's bad because there are patients who are appropriate for the medicine that should be on it. It's -- but it is opportunity to continue growing in the labeled indication that we have currently -- and on that note, as we've talked about in the past, we're hopeful that we have the opportunity to expand the indication to the enrolled trial population for MONARCH and we're awaiting that analysis of overall survival, as we talked about in the past. So yes, we're pleased with how it's going. We see plenty of opportunity ahead to continue the momentum.",312.0,128.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0625,0.03125,0.015625,0.0,0.0,0.03125

And then how you expect maybe that to evolve? And then separately, maybe coming back to the drug pricing question but from a different angle, it would appear that Lilly could be one of the main beneficiaries from lower out-of-pocket costs on that side and you think about sort of improvement in compliance.

On the cash pay side, we expect the percent of cash paid to follow our percent access in the marketplace. What we've seen so far, again, I reiterate what I said earlier, that we have both Part D and commercial access for Humana, Express Scripts on the National Preferred Formulary and Cigna. If you add that up, that's a little over 20% of the national lives.

Carter, I think you're pointing out something as I mentioned, we would be supportive as a freestanding measure of the Part D reforms that are in this reconciliation package for a bunch of reasons. One, it does, I think, more fairly distribute the burden of the industry pay for into Part D. Today, the way the donut hole math works, if you go back a couple of years, we had a lot of earnings calls, we had to describe that. There's this really disproportionate contribution from the industry inside the donut hole. So commonly used medications like in diabetes and cardiovascular, have a pretty big hit on that. That gets smoothed out. So now that drugs that hit the catastrophic pay more and it's more of a balanced contribution independent of drug type, that's a good thing for companies like Lilly, that have more commonly used drugs. The other thing though you're pointing out and I think this really would affect a product like Verzenio for us primarily is patients who get thrown into the catastrophic have this uncapped 5% contribution today. And we know that not only do patients discontinue and you mentioned about compliance rates which are better in oral oncology in Europe than the U.S., for instance. But I think also you'll see more initiation because physicians and their families screen themselves out of even qualifying for an appropriate medication for themselves because of financial burden and maybe go to chemotherapy instead of a more targeted therapy. So that presents another way in which we can both improve healthcare in America but also prospects for medicines at Lilly max. So those are good things. As I said, on balance, we still don't like it for the negotiation side but those are positive elements.",304.0,141.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.03546099290780142,0.0425531914893617,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,-0.0070921985815602835

And so this will study putting – starting patients who are naïve or very early in their treatment versus standard of care.

So first one is on the accelerated approval application for genenimab and whether that's an opportunity to gain more insight about acceptability of iADRS which is our primary endpoint in the Phase III study. It may not be an opportunity actually because the accelerated approval is not contingent on an understanding of the cognitive or functional benefits of denetumab which we saw in the Phase II trial. Instead, the accelerated approval is just simply contingent on a demonstration of lowering amyloid levels. So I'm not sure we'll get into a deep discussion of that, although clearly, it's relevant in terms of the confirmatory study, Trailblazer 2. The second question that you raised was with respect to remternatug, the NTBG4molecule. This is a next-generation antiplaqueor plaque-removing antibody designed to attack the same power glutamate residue that donanemab goes after. We’ve seen robust ability of this molecule to clear plaques in patients. Remember that a liability or potential liability of genitimab is antidrug antibodies. And so we’ve also noted that this molecule doesn’t have that issue. So given the potent robust clearance of plaques combined with lack of ADAs, we think this is amenable to alternative dosage forms that could be more convenient to patients.

On the commercial front, we drove strong volume-based growth of our recently launched medicines, including Mounjaro, which has seen an impressive initial uptick. At the same time, we advanced our late-phase pipeline progressing towards potential launches of 4 new medicines by the end of next year while also investing in our early-stage pipeline and new modalities like gene therapy. To meet the growing demand for our products and prepare for future launches, we have also continued to invest in expansion of our manufacturing footprint.  I'd highlight 2 areas of high unmet need where Lilly is progressing new medicines to improve patient outcomes, obesity and Alzheimer's disease. In obesity, we are pleased that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for tirzepatide for adults with obesity, enabling us to potentially bring this promising medicine to patients even sooner. We're also initiating SURMOUNT MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality and obesity study to evaluate improved outcomes for patients with obesity.  In Alzheimer's disease, our Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2study for dunenumab continues to progress towards a top line readout in mid-2023. And we continue to work with the FDA to pursue an accelerated approval based on our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ data. We also announced completion of our submission for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis in both the U.S. and the EU. With already completed submissions for donanemab, pertibrutinib, mirikizumab. We are excited by the potential to launch 4 new medicines between now and the end of 2023. We are experiencing an unprecedented rate of new product launches for Lilly and undoubtedly 1 of the most impressive rates in our industry.  Turning to our strategic deliverables on Slide 4. Q3 revenue grew 7% in constant currency. Worldwide volume grew a robust 14%. Key product growth grew 19% and now account for 70% of our core business revenue, a reflection of the youth and durability of our marketed product portfolio. We're encouraged to see the continued global adoption of products like Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance and our anchor [indiscernible] medicines, including Mounjaro and Trulicity.  Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79% in Q3, which is in line with the same period last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.9%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 90 basis points attributed to acquired in-process R&D and development milestone charges.  For pipeline milestones, we shared several important updates since our Q2 earnings call, including FDA Fast Track designation for tirzepatide for adults with obesity, with completion of a rolling submission expected by mid-2023; EU and Japan approval for Mounjaro for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; U.S. and EU submission of lebrikizumab for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis; and FDA accelerated approval for Retevmo in RET fusion-positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors regardless of tumor type and traditional approval in adults with locally advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer.  Dan will discuss this in more detail later but we are excited to have announced the acquisition of Akros, which aims to accelerate efforts in gene therapies that promise to restore, improve and preserve hearing for patients living with disabling hearing loss. This acquisition demonstrates our continued commitment to advancing genetic medicine at Lilly. And finally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends to our shareholders.  On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q2 earnings call, including several important personnel, COVID-19 antibody and ESG updates. We announced the upcoming retirement of Steve Fry, our Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Diversity, following more than 35 years at our company. I'd like to thank Steve for playing a key role in advancing our diversity, equity and inclusion agenda and leading our efforts to be the premier employer in our region and our sector.  We also welcome Eric Dozier, who will succeed Steve. Eric has nearly 25 years of experience at Lilly and a strong track record of developing people and teams that deliver impressive business results. I'm confident he is the right leader to progress our people strategy, which is vital for Lilly to achieve our ambitious growth objectives ahead.  In August, we began to make our COVID-19 antibody beptilizumab available for purchase to states, hospitals and certain other providers through a sole distributor. In Q3, we shipped an additional 600,000 -- or 60,000, I should say, doses of beptilizumab to the U.S. government for approximately $110 million. These are to be used for the financially vulnerable patients through a product replacement program. At this time, we are not anticipating any further U.S. government orders for beptilizumab.  With regards to our ESG efforts, we published our inaugural sustainability bond allocation and impact report, highlighting the allocation of approximately EUR 128 million across a range of sustainability projects since the issuance of the sustainability bond in September of '21.

Before I review the financial results for Q3, let me highlight a change in how we expect to communicate our acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. In mid-October, we filed an 8-K with the SEC to provide investors earlier clarity on the impact from acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges for Q3. In future quarters, we generally expect to provide this information for quarterly updates on our Investor Relations website.  Now moving to our results. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the third quarter of 2022 and I'll focus my overall comments on non-GAAP performance. A few notable items affected year-over-year comparisons in Q3. Foreign exchange rates had a roughly 430 basis point impact on revenue this quarter as Q3 revenue grew by 2% or 7% on a constant currency basis. We recognized $86 million of revenue related to a sales collaboration agreement for the rights to sell and distribute Mounjaro in Japan; we experienced the first full quarter impact of Alimta's U.S. Fed expiry; and the increase in sales of COVID-19 antibodies and the decrease in sales of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19 impacted our results.  When excluding revenue from Alimta, which is now off patent across the EU, Japan and the U.S., COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, revenue grew 9% for the quarter or 14% in constant currency, highlighting solid momentum for our core business. Gross margin was roughly flat year-over-year, the impact of lower realized prices and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs were offset by favorable product mix, including the impact of lower sales of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19 and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.  Total operating expenses increased 1% this quarter. Growth in marketing, selling and administrative expenses and R&D expenses were largely offset by lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges that reduced operating expense growth by nearly 350 basis points. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, primarily driven by the increased cost associated with the launch of Mounjaro, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expenses increased 6%, driven by higher development expense for late-stage assets, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies.  Operating income increased 6% in Q3, primarily due to higher gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 28.9%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 90 basis points attributable to the acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges.  Our Q3 effective tax rate was 10.7%, a decrease of 360 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by the favorable tax impact related to the implementation of the 2017 Tax Act. At the bottom line, earnings per share increased approximately 12% this quarter to $1.98 per share. Acquired IPR&D and development milestone charge and a negative impact of $0.06 in Q3 2022 compared to $0.17 in the same period last year.  On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, foreign exchange movements primarily related to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar, decreased revenue by 4%.  Moving to our performance by key geography. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 11% driven by volume growth of 15%. Excluding revenue from Alimta, COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, revenue in the U.S. increased 20% driven primarily by key growth products. U.S. volume growth was partially offset by a net price decline of 4%, driven primarily by lower realized prices for Humalog due to segment mix and the list price reduction for insulin Lispro injection.  Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 11% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Jardiance, Verzenio and Taltz. We are encouraged by the momentum of our business in Europe and expect continued growth as the impact from the patent expiry for Alimta, which lost exclusively in June 2021, received from base period comparison.  For Japan, Q3 revenue decreased by 2% in constant currency. The growth of our newer medicine and revenue related to a sales collaboration agreement for the rights to sell and distribute Mounjaro in Japan was more than offset by the continued impact of declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and Alimta, which both face generic entry in June 2021. We expect a return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023 as we continue to scale our key growth products and the impact of patent expiration subsides.  In China, revenue declined 10% in constant currency as we continue to be impacted by the Zero COVID policy measures. We're also seeing the impact of increased competitive pressures for Tyvyt from local competitors with NR DLXs. In addition, we experienced the first full quarter of the pricing impact of volume-based procurement for Humalog. As we expect to maintain a high level of access for our innovative portfolio, we believe our volume should accelerate to drive net growth in the future.  Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 6% in constant currency in Q3, primarily driven by customer buying patterns. The year-to-date growth of 8% in constant currency in this region is more representative underlying trends.  As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust waterwide volume growth. These products drove approximately 18 percentage points of volume growth this quarter and continue to underpin our current performance and future outlook.  Slide 10 further highlights the contribution of a key growth product. This quarter, these brands grew 19% or 25% in constant currency, generated $4.6 billion in sales and made up 70% of our core business revenue. Products like Verzenio, Taltz in dermatology and Jardiance have outpaced competitors growth and are leaders in new-to-brand share of market within their respective classes.  In the injectable incretin market, we continue to see significant opportunity for further class growth. In addition to Mounjaro successful launch in the U.S., Trulicity has continued to experience strong growth globally. To date, our incretin manufacturing production is ahead of our internal plan, and we remain focused on sustaining this performance.  Strong demand for Trulicity, partially due to ongoing limited availability of competitive GLP-1, continues to challenge our ability to meet expanding demand in most international markets. In those situations, we're working hard to supply market demand will minimize an impact to existing patients, including communication in these markets not to initiate new patients on Trulicity. In the U.S., script volume remains robust. And while we build more capacity, wholesalers may experience intermittent restocking delays of Trulicity orders.  Moving to Slide 11. We're pleased with the rapid uptake of Mounjaro in the first 4 months since launch. Approximately 70% of Mounjaro's new therapy starts are patients naive to the type 2 diabetes injectable incretin class and less than 10% for switches from Trulicity. We are progressing peer negotiations and have more than doubled the level of access to approximately 45% of total commercial and Part D lives. And as we expand access, the proportion of paid script should start to increase.  Our focus is to make Mounjaro available for type 2 diabetes patients, and we intend to take actions designed to ensure access and supply for these patients. These actions may negatively impact prescription volume, but are not expected to impact net revenue. We have seen unprecedented demand for Mounjaro's type 2 diabetes launch in the U.S., bolstered by strong efficacy and a positive customer experience. Availability of competitor's incretin also is a key factor as we assess Mounjaro's demand and supply.  To meet this rapidly growing demand across our incretin business, we have plans to add substantial additional manufacturing capacity. In 2023, we expect the RTP site in North Carolina to become fully operational and that capacity, coupled with additional actions and extensions in other sites, will result in doubling Lilly's incretin manufacturing capacity at the end of 2023.  On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. For the first 9 months of the year, we invested $6.8 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders in dividend and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities are to fund our key marketed products and expected new launches, bolster manufacturing capacity, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders.  Slide 13 is our updated 2022 financial guidance. Our full year revenue outlook now includes an additional $300 million of headwinds from foreign exchange rates since our previous guidance update for a total impact of roughly $1 billion of foreign exchange headwinds of revenue for the full year compared to our original guidance. Our outlook for gross margin, SG&A and research and development remains unchanged.  Our guidance now includes acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of approximately $670 million, reflecting total charges in the first 9 months of the year. We have not recognized material acquired IPR&D or development milestone charges to date in Q4. And this guidance does not include any impact from the potential acquisition -- for business development or acquisition in the remainder of the year, including pending acquisition of [indiscernible]. Our non-GAAP operating margins remain unchanged at approximately 29%.  On a reported basis, operating margin is now expected to be approximately 26%, driven by the intangible asset impairment for our GBA1 Gene Therapy due to change in estimated launch timing. Our non-GAAP range for other income and expense remains unchanged. On a reported basis, other income and expense is now expected to be expensed in the range of $600 million to $700 million, reflecting the net impact of net losses on investments in equity securities during Q3 2022.  Our tax rate and EPS in the first 9 months of the year includes a favorable impact of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year continues to assume this provision will be deferred or repealed by Congress, effective for the full year 2022.  Assuming this deferral repeal occurs before the end of the year, we expect our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 22%, which includes the cumulative tax impact of immediately expensing research and development costs for the full year 2022. If this provision is not deferred or repeal effective this year, then we would expect our reported and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%.  Based on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.46 to now be in the range of $6.50 to $6.65 per share and lowered our 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.20 to be in the range of $7.70 to $7.85. The $0.20 reduction in our non-GAAP EPS range is driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates as well as the $0.06 impact from the incremental acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges in Q3.  Now before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to provide a few thoughts on the pushes and pulls across the P&L as you begin to think about next year. Starting with revenue, we're confident in the growth outlook of our core business. We expect to build on the positive momentum across our pre-growth products, including the continued strong launch of Mounjaro and launches of new products. While we anticipate that initial revenue from our next wave of potential launches will be modest in 2023 with only partial year revenue, we do expect the donanemab, pitubrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab will serve as additional catalysts for continued growth.  In 2023, we will see the full year impact of the Alimta's patent expiry in the U.S., where new generics have eroded Alimta sales starting mid-Q2 and we anticipate a low single-digit headwind from foreign exchange rates. As for revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, we will continue to make bebtelovimab available for purchase. However, the demand for these therapies will depend not only on COVID-19 case counts but also on evolving variants and available therapies. We continue to believe that COVID-19 antibodies will not be a major driver for long-term growth for Lilly.  We will invest in our future as we advance promising R&D opportunities, expand our manufacturing capacity and support the potential launch of multiple new products. Assuming inflation persist, we expect to see that impact in 2023 as well. Also, we will be making a significant investment in one of our most important assets, our talented workforce, through increases in compensation that are partially due to inflation pressures, but also to ensure we have the right capabilities to deliver on the promise of our future growth.  While these investments will slow our operating margin expansion in 2023, they are critical to maximizing pipeline and new launch opportunities to help sustain top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion over the mid- to long term. We look forward to sharing more details on our 2023 guidance call on December 13.  Now I'll turn over the call over to Dan to highlight progress in R&D.",2170.0,1172.0,28.0,18.0,28.0,0.0,3.0,12.0,4.0,1.0,0.023890784982935155,0.015358361774744027,0.023890784982935155,0.0,0.002559726962457338,0.008532423208191127
LLY,2022-11-01,2022-11-01,,2022-11-01,2022-11-01T09:00:00-04:00,0,2022-11-01,prepared,,Daniel Skovronsky,"Thanks, Anat. 2022 has been another outstanding year for R&D at Lilly. In addition to Mounjaro approval, we have now completed regulatory submissions for 4 new medicines that could all launch by the end of 2023: portibrutinib, mirikizumab, lebrikizumab, and denetimab. In addition, we advanced our early-stage pipeline with promising next-generation assets in all of our key areas. Plus we've continued to improve our capabilities and advance our projects in our growing nucleic acid medicine portfolio.  Before I share an R&D update for our core business, let me briefly add to Anat's update on COVID-19 antibodies. While we've made bebtelovimab commercially available, we're also closely watching the emergence of new highly mutated strains. Based on pseudovirus data, we do not believe that bebtelovimab will neutralize against the new BQ variants. However, we do have potentially broadly neutralizing antibodies in our labs that we can consider bringing forward if there is a need and an aligned path forward with health authorities.  Moving to our core R&D portfolio. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 28, and Slide 15 shows potential key events for the year. I'll cover important developments since our last earnings call by therapeutic area.  Starting with diabetes and obesity. We have several updates for tirzepatide. For type 2 diabetes, in addition to the U.S. approval of Mounjaro in Q2, we're pleased to announce recent approvals in the EU and Japan. For chronic weight management, we're pleased that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for tirzepatide. Fast Track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new therapies to treat serious conditions that have the potential to fill an unmet medical need.  We plan to initiate a rolling submission this year that will be primarily based on the results from the SURMOUNT-1 trial, which is complete; and SURMOUNT-2, which is expected to be complete by the end of April 2023. Assuming positive SURMOUNT-2 results, we expect to complete the rolling submission with these data in mid-2023 for potential regulatory action as early as late next year. We're working hard to bring tirzepatide to adults living with obesity as soon as we can.  We also presented the trial design of tirzepatide SURMOUNT-MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality in obesity study. SURMOUNT-MMO evaluates treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo in adults living with obesity without diabetes and measures the effects of tirzepatide on a broad set of outcomes beyond traditional cardiovascular events. As our primary endpoint, we are measuring the occurrence of a cardiovascular event from a 5-point CV composite that includes all-cause mortality. We've also incorporated key secondary endpoints, including traditional MACE 3 events, reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and adverse renal outcomes.  In SURMOUNT-MMO, we are studying both primary and secondary prevention of events in a broader at-risk population more representative of that seen in clinical practice. The SURMOUNT-MMO study has now initiated, and we look forward to sharing the results in the future. SURMOUNT-MMO is just the latest addition to tirzepatide's development plan. where our goal is to not only demonstrate chronic weight management but also to demonstrate improvement across multiple outcomes as a result of weight loss. We're extremely confident in tirzepatide's potential to impact health outcomes of patients living with type 2 diabetes, obesity and other obesity-related metabolic outcomes.  Transitioning to the rest of our diabetes portfolio, we started 2 more Phase III studies for our weekly basal insulin FC and expect to start the fifth and final registration study in the Quint program in the coming months. We also received FDA approval for the Tempo Smart Button and medical device and key component of Lilly's forthcoming Tempo personalized diabetes management platform. We're excited to begin to introduce this platform to the marketplace this year.  Moving to oncology. In line with expectations previously communicated, we've now performed another interim analysis for MONARCH-E, our adjuvant high-risk early breast cancer study of Verzenio in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of adult patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative node positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. The results of this analysis will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium next month.  We're excited by what we've seen and we look forward to sharing the data publicly. Verzenio is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor approved in the adjuvant setting, and we are enthusiastic about Verzenio's ability to substantially reduce the risk of developing incurable life-threatening metastatic disease.  We also announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval to Retevmo for pretreated adults with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a RET gene fusion regardless of tumor type. And also granted traditional approval for Retevmo in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with a RET gene fusion as detected by an FDA-approved test. We're grateful to have the opportunity to deliver meaningful clinical benefits to more patients across more tumor types with Retevmo.  We also began dosing patients in our fifth Phase III study for pirtobrutinib. This latest trial is a head-to-head study evaluating pirtobrutinib against ibrutinib in BTK inhibitor-naive patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. As a reminder, pirtobrutinib is currently under priority review at the FDA and for mantle cell lymphoma previously treated with a BTK inhibitor with regulatory action expected in early 2023. We also continue to have discussions with the FDA about potentially accelerating the approval pathway for CLL in patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor.  Switching to immunology. We presented detailed week 52 results from the lebrikizumab Phase III monotherapy studies in patients with moderate to spare atopic dermatitis at 2 recent dermatology conferences. The maintenance data showed that lebrikizumab provided robust and durable skin clearance with improvements in itch, sleep and quality of life amongst patients who achieved a clinical response in the 16-week induction period.  Notably, the results also suggested that less frequent dosing of lebrikizumab can provide similar improvements to once every 2-week dosing. Based upon the data we've collected across our trials in over 2,000 patients, we believe lebrikizumab could become a first-line biologic for treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, a disease where there's significant need to provide new options for a large and diverse patient population.  As part of our efforts to reach a diverse patient population, we've recently initiated an innovative clinical trial to evaluate lebrikizumab for people with skin of color who have a disproportionately higher prevalence of atopic dermatitis and often struggle with more severe forms of the disease. We have now submitted a BLA to the FDA. And Almirall, who holds rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for dermatologic indications in Europe, has submitted to the EMA for authorization. We expect regulatory decisions in both the U.S. and the EU by the end of next year. Together with Almirall, we look forward to potentially bringing this important medicine to patients who suffer from this chronic disease.  Shifting to our efforts in genetic medicines. You'll see that we have now advanced our ANGPTL3 siRNA to Phase II development in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This is our first siRNA asset to advance to Phase II. And with this molecule, alongside our Lp(a) siRNA, where we shared proof-of-concept data last year, we're optimistic about the prospect of improving cardiovascular outcomes using our portfolio of genetic medicines.  Within gene therapy, we're excited about the opportunity to help patients with fatal neurodegenerative diseases, where we're advancing our Prevail Therapeutics programs. We particularly look forward to sharing biomarker results from our progranulin gene therapy program at an upcoming scientific meeting for frontal temporal dementia.  Building on our gene therapy experience with Prevail, we're thrilled to welcome Akouos and their talented team who will bring a transformational gene therapy approach to treating genetically defined hearing loss. Hearing loss is an area of severe unmet need that historically has not been a focus of pharmacologic development. And we believe treatment of sensory neuronal hearing loss through gene therapy delivered to the inner ear is an area ripe for technologic advances for the benefit of patients.  Finally, let me turn to Alzheimer's disease, where there have been a number of important developments since our last call. As a company dedicated to the fight against Alzheimer's, we were pleased to see the positive top line Phase III results for lecanemab. Following dunetimab's TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, this lecanumab study may further support the benefit of removing amyloid plaques for people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.  These data certainly reinforce our confidence in donanemab and the forthcoming readout from our Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study, which is expected by the middle of 2023, and which, if positive, will form the basis of our application for traditional regulatory approval. In the meantime, we continue working with the FDA to seek accelerated approval in early '23 and based on our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ data.  The availability of and access to safe and effective therapies is important to slow the devastating impact on the estimated 6.5 million Americans and 35 million people worldwide living with this disease and their loved ones. While we acknowledge the hard work ahead to bring these therapies to patients in need, we are excited and we are confident in our Alzheimer's disease portfolio and the potential impact our drugs can have on patients.  Accordingly, we initiated TRAILRUNNER-ALZ, the first trial in our Phase III program for Remternetug, our next-generation anti-amyloid antibody. Remternetug has demonstrated deep and rapid amyloid plaque clearance and provides the opportunity to explore flexible dosing regimens for patients.  Finally, in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4, our head-to-head trial comparing donanemab to aducanumab on amyloid plaque lowering in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, we have now achieved positive results on the co-primary endpoints of amyloid lowering as expected with a consistent safety profile to previous donanemab studies. For this study, the incidence of ARIA-E in the donanemab group was 21.1%, with 2.8% of donanemab-treated patients showing symptomatic ARIA-E, suggesting the potential that rates of plaque clearance are not directly linked to rates of ARIA development. We'll share the detailed results at the upcoming CTAD meeting in late November, including the relationship between the degree of amyloid plaque removal and plasma phospo tau, as well as radiographic area.  While we focus most of our markets today on late-stage assets, you also notice we have a number of developments across our early-stage portfolio as shown on the slides. Across the pipeline, Q3 was another productive quarter at Lilly.

Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made in the third quarter. We continue to grow our recently launched medicines, including Mounjaro's strong U.S. launch. At the same time, we continue to advance our pipeline, progressing towards potential launches for 4 new medicines by the end of next year, while also internally and externally investing in our early-stage pipeline and discovery capabilities. With the progress we've made, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects.

I guess the first is just on gross to net trends we should be thinking about from here. I think you're talking at this point about 45% access. Can you talk about just where that will be trending as we look out into maybe early 2023 and when do you think you'll be at a point where the drug will have similar access to what we see with Trulicity currently?  And then my second question in Mounjaro was on manufacturing capacity given what's been really an exceptional launch so far. It sounds like you're in a position to double capacity by end of '23. I guess the kind of bigger picture question I'm asking is, do you see any capacity issues that could limit uptake at all of Mounjaro as we look between now and when that additional facility comes online?",150.0,59.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.03389830508474576,0.03389830508474576,0.0,0.01694915254237288,-0.01694915254237288

As we guided before launch, we recommended that you look at more revenue. It was a better indicator of our performance than net revenue. We took 2 decisions that were really focused on looking at generating long-term value for Mounjaro. First, we decided to put in place a bridging program that would bridge people who have type 2 diabetes with a low out-of-pocket cost of $25 until they achieved formulary access on their insurance. We were confident that we were going to build, and we still are confident that we're going to build good broad access for Mounjaro.  But we wanted to make sure that we had a bridging program in that then allowed us to be disciplined and patient as we gained access. We wanted to make sure that we look for the long term, not the short term. If you're too short term-focused, then you're going to be driven to gain access quickly and not make the right pricing decisions. So we thought the bridging program tied with the disciplined negotiation approach was the best approach. And that's the one we've taken and that's the 1 we've held true to during our launch.  So what we'll see is net price will increase as we gain payer access. In the third quarter, we had 22% of people with commercial and Part D insurance had formerly access Mounjaro. As of October 1, that jumped to 45%. And what we anticipate is we'll still take a disciplined moderated approach to make sure we get the best access for the right price point. And we're still very confident that we will grow and we'll achieve broad access in the upcoming future.  We are also adjusting our bridging program to further ensure that it's utilized for people with type 2 diabetes, which will impact new start volume but should impact net revenue. So we expect over the upcoming quarters that net price will grow for Mounjaro. As it comes to supply, our supply chain has performed exceptionally well since launch. We're taking actions to maximize production supply for our current facilities while we ramp up our new manufacturing facilities that you referenced.  The U.S. Mounjaro launch is really unprecedented with a viral nature given just tremendous patient satisfaction and the visible results that people experience that really spark many conversations with them, the type 2 diabetes community, which then brings greater interest in the type 2 diabetes committee, our community for Mounjaro. But it is a dynamic situation, given the uncertainty of competitor GLP supply and that Mounjaro patient prescription abandonment long-term adherence and dose titration rates have it yet with steady-state, which are all important forecasting assumptions.  So given the dynamic nature of this, it's reasonable to assume that weekly production forecast won't perfectly aligned with weekly demand each week. So this will produce some intermittent delays in meeting wholesale orders for some dosing strengths as we ramp up our supply chain. If this happens, our teams will work hard to avoid or minimize any short-term impact for people that with type 2 diabetes. But stepping back and taking a look at the longer-term picture, we're in a great position.  Mounjaro's launch is going extremely well because patient experiences have been tremendous, and they have a high interest in the product profile.

I know you've got it to year-end, but just maybe help us think about anything you can do to kind of bring that online sooner.

So we're confident in our ability for our manufacturing personnel and our leadership there. And as I said before, we're very confident in the long-term potential of tirzepatide. With the bridging program, I think your question was more around kind of off-label use of Mounjaro and how much it was.  As you know, Mounjaro was approved in the U.S. for patients with type 2 diabetes, and we have just excellent processes in place to ensure that all promotional activities are in line with our approved label. We're pleased with our disciplined on-label promotional execution. The launch of Mounjaro has been very disciplined and in line with everything that we wanted. So we've been encouraged by both patients and physicians prescribing experiences, and this has driven a very high interest in Mounjaro.  We haven't -- we don't have perfect data to suggest what diagnosis a patient has. The best data that we have is to look at the -- whether those individuals who are starting Mounjaro, whether they have previously been on a diabetes medication or not. Given that our promotion is focused solely on type 2 diabetes, we would expect to see the majority of people use Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes, and that's what we've seen.  While we see fluctuation from week to week in the third quarter, we saw about 2/3 of new patients starting Mounjaro with a history of type 2 diabetes medications.

There are many that we can consider. As you point out, weight loss and restoration of sort of normal metabolism, which we think may be possible with tirzepatide is going to have benefits in a lot of metabolic- and obesity-related diseases. So how do we pick which ones to pursue and when.  I think initially, our thinking has been around generating a body of data that shows that a drug such as tirzepatide when driving weight loss lead to downstream health benefits. So that's what drives the MMO study. We have a heart failure study, a sleep apnea study that are all ongoing. When we think about adding more, sort of where can we see improvements in that medical understanding of the dangers of obesity and the benefits of weight loss and restoration of normal metabolism.  That's how we think about it rather than how big is this patient segment or how big is the next patient segment, noting that almost all of those patient segments will already have obesity as an underlying disease, which we expect to have indicated next year, as I commented earlier.

Actually, with obesity, it's actually kind of counter to what typically happens to the product. Typically, you get it out, it has a finite patient segmentation, you try to explain that with additional indications. Actually, with obesity, you're going to have the broadest indication for people who either have a BMI of 27 with a risk factor or a BMI over 30, which is a massive population in the U.S. and globally.

So with regard to the North Carolina facility, expanding manufacturing capacity, in terms of API versus the actual pens and fill-finish manufacturing, can you just update us on what really is the potential expansion of manufacturing there? It's my understanding that the potential bottleneck is going to be more related to the pen manufacturing.  And it's my understanding also that this is largely the Trulicity pen and the Trulicity pen is going to be the main manufacturing point for pretty much all of your biologic capacity as well as for Trulicity. So just trying to get a better understanding of that. And then second, just on the insulin. There are a number of questions around the change to the penny rule and how Lilly and competitor, Novo, are going to manage through that as many of the insulins could actually be sort of paying the Medicaid fees for the benefit of actually providing insulins.

So just to step back on capacity, we did make some comments today related to this. And we've taken actions in the quarter to slow demand internationally on Trulicity, primarily because of the constraints by a competitor, which have shifted demand to Trulicity internationally. Should that happen domestically, of course, that will -- I think we're just trying to give a fair balance to say that, that would be an increase in demand we'd have to manage too as well.  But we are producing above our plans right now. We see that continuing. And the next step-up, Seamus, that we expect in capacity will be North Carolina, which will happen towards the end of next year. Just for clarity, there's actually 2 sites in North Carolina. One we announced in 2020 and one more recently down the road in Concur near Charlotte. That second facility will also come online beginning in '24 with some capacity and really '25 more fully. So the company has taken some pretty aggressive investment steps, and those steps in North Carolina are focused on what we'll call the parental filling and the drug finishing process which is the device that is used for Trulicity, but also Mounjaro.  We take a platform approach. So that device is also used for other Lilly biologics. And gives us flexibility to match supply and demand more agilely. Although Mike's comments were well placed earlier that it's not perfect, like inside of 90 days, we can't perfectly match every skew of demand to every SKU produced. But it does give us a lot of agility. Those 2 sites in North Carolina, I'll point out, I think as Anat said, are huge.  So the first one will literally double our global capacity when it's online, and the second side is a similar size. So we've taken some big CapEx decisions, and it looks well placed given the early uptick in Mounjaro, which looks quite substantial. Those do not speak to the API side. API is a different supply chain. We've also taken actions to expand that capacity. It's currently not the bottleneck and is not expected to be the bottleneck, which is the peptide synthesis process we use.  Of course, big caveat around all this is, of course, things can go wrong. Regulatory approvals are required to bring the new sites online in an on-time fashion, but that's our current outlook. And as Mike said, long term, we're extremely confident we can supply a massive volume of Trulicity and Mounjaro. But these step-ups do take a little bit of time. And should we have a lapse in competitor supply, that will challenge our ability to meet demand. I think that's the main message from today.  As it relates to MCAP, you're right, that beginning in January of '24, for the cap on payments or rebates to Medicaid programs for medications that have a CPI penalty that pushes them above 100% rebate will be lifted, and we will be required to pay states to use our product in that situation. We have not announced our plans to deal with that, although we're formulating plans to deal with that.  And of course, the best thing to do is keep inventing new things, which reset that calculation. And as you know, we've got a Phase III program for weekly insulin and we're progressing efforts on glucose-sensing insulin. We've got, I think, an exciting new approval on Connected Care as well. So all those efforts, I think, are the long-term approach tactically we'll manage through that event at the end of '23, early '24.",626.0,295.0,7.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,9.0,0.0,1.0,0.023728813559322035,0.02711864406779661,0.0,0.003389830508474576,0.010169491525423728,-0.003389830508474576

Starting with how we think about obesity and in general as much as possible here, our strategy has been to mimic the body's own response to food. So incretins are hormone submitted by -- secreted rather by your gastrointestinal tract in response to eating then lead to satiety and increased calorie expenditure and decreased food intake. That's how they work and GID is one of the major incretins.  So it made sense to pursue a strategy of agonism of that hormone and probably we'll wait and see Amgen's data to understand if antagonism could also have a surprising effect different than the biological effect of acreages normally in humans. With respect to GGG and, I think BCG is our next-generation incretin that's further ahead in development. We've previously communicated that we expect to have internal Phase II data yet this year and use that data to make a decision whether this proceeds to Phase III or not. In which case, we might wait for mastatide data.  That thinking is still consistent and on track for yet this year. The second line of question here was around donanemab discrete dosing strategy, and you're referring here to the notion that we pioneered that once plaques are clear, you can stop taking a plaque-clearing antibody. That was based on our understanding of the biology, nothing to do with antidrug antibodies.  But certainly, we see it as a benefit for patients to not have to continue to take a drug in the absence of having the target or the disease in their brain that's still ongoing. It's pretty specific idea to donanemab, Remternetug and antibodies that are specific to plaques because once the plaques are gone, they're something for the antibodies to do. Our own data that we've shared show that there is no reversion really of adverse biomarkers in patients who've come off therapy. So so far, the data that we have in hand, though it's still early, supports cessation of dosing as appropriate.

Was it because formulary access at the national level may not immediately translate to paid Rx for certain downstream customers of payers because additional negotiations may be required, I thought that might be a factor and this will help us better understand how to think about the 45% coverage that you have as of October 1.  And then second, with respect to ex U.S. sales prospects, I'm not sure if you provided this yet, but could you talk about how we should think about sales to Mitsubishi in the fourth quarter sequentially?

In terms of overall commercialization of Mounjaro outside of the U.S., I think one of the aspects that's important for us to determine is ensuring that whenever we enter a market that we can ensure that we can appropriately supply Mounjaro to type 2 patients in any given market.

As you may know, for most markets outside the U.S., it takes time and there's typically a lag between approval and also gaining access to patients for reimbursement.

And so the prospects of an oral anti-obesity product is very attractive. So we're very encouraged by that opportunity and are excited by our NPA program. As it comes to the positive CV study, if Novo is able to get that with semaglutide, to me, it's -- it's more of an opportunity to show the benefits of the products in the class.  I think any additional benefits that are represented by whether it be our trials or Novo trials are going to help the class and help more payers and more health care professionals take action on the product. And so I think their trial will provide good information and good data for health care professionals and payers. And while our trial is a little bit different, and we think is a little bit broader in nature, we think that will also expand it.  So to me, it's not a comparing our study, the SURMOUNT-MMO study versus SELECT, it's more new information is going to be good for the class, good for health care professionals.

Of course, the big action might relate to Troa and the government coverage in the U.S. or similar efforts ex U.S. And those will be more binary.

First, on Remternetug, on the time lines on clinic trials, potentially this drug could be launched as early as '25 under accelerated approval 1 year or so post the introduction of Roche subcutaneous. Do you expect the evolving Abeta data to result in removing of the existing NCD in order to allow it to compete effectively? That's the first question. Obviously, at that point, you will only have the Abeta-lowering data, but it will be subcutaneous potentially?  And then second question, just going back to your oral GLP-1 agents, you're about to unblind both diabetes and obesity Phase II trials. Could you talk to how you look at the commercial potential for this market? It strikes me that the DPP4 market is worth about $13 billion, and that's on top of whatever [indiscernible] is doing.

Obviously, we're excited that we've initiated the Phase III program. And as you noted, we've started the first study, which is to assess amyloid lowering. We have a broader Phase III program that we're initiating as well, looking at the clinical endpoints as we've done for donanemab, but we're excited about what we're seeing so far with Remternetug, which was the next generation.  And so you're going to see us continue to invest in the AD platform going forward based on donanemab's compelling data and then where we're seeing early, it was on Remternetug. And as you said, it offers the convenience of an additional dosing form that we think will offer a lot of convenience to patients. On your question around the NCD, obviously, we hope now that CMS, we now have the Phase II data from donanemab, which clearly showed clinical benefit as well as clearance of plaque. Now we have the lucanumab data, a large Phase III study also showing clinical benefit. Certainly, it's our position that this is time for CMS to reconsider this decision.  So certainly, we would hope that this is resolved before Remternetug reads out. Obviously, the time line though, is not clear. So what you'll see us do, and I'm sure is doing the same as soon as we have that Phase III data requesting reconsideration and moving forward with the evidence that's demonstrated today, we cannot see a reason that CMS will continue to prevent Alzheimer's patients from getting these medicines.  And as we've said in the past, we believe CD really is very restrictive method to provide to the patients who have this disease and also leads to disparity we've seen in care for Alzheimer's disease.

When Rybelsus launched, we expected it to grow the class, not impact the injectable market, and that's exactly what happened. It was more additive to the class. And then as Mounjaro is launched, we only see 1% of Mounjaro's demand coming from Rybelsus or oral GLP. So I think you're right. I think it is additive versus attractive, and we're very pleased with the opportunity.  I think in the oral market, what's going to be key is Rybelsus has some interactions with water and food, which have some dosing limitations, which can impact the efficacy of the product, if it's not followed closely as well as there's a gap between the efficacy of oral Rybelsus and injectables.

And clearly, patients, families, care partners highly value a delay in loss of independent stabilities. And so a 20% to 30% slowing of the disease initiated in the earliest stage of the disease should mean additional time in the more functional less impaired stages. So we're excited about those results, and we do think that they're clinically meaningful in this space.  And so we look forward, as we've said, to what we'll see with donanemab. There are many reasons that we're extremely confident about donanemab and those haven't changed. So obviously, it's a positive Phase II study that we were able to produce the choice of the endpoint that we have in our study, as you commented, patient selection strategy and then importantly, the speed and the depth of plaque clearance. So we remain very confident in what we'll see out of our upcoming readout on TD 2.  And then your question on, I think that just as we've said in the past, we believe that is the most robust endpoint in this space. And we've always believed that can be a bit of a noisy endpoint, and so indexing on exact numbers is probably not the best move there. But on TRAILBLAZER-ALZ, we powered it for Idris. We showed a 32% slowing, which we definitely see as clinically meaningful. And we believe that Idris will always perform closest to the truth.

And then I'll -- I think your last question there, Tim, was on ARIA rates, which I'll maybe take as well. So again, I think I've said before, there's a number of factors here that can help us in predicting results of amyloid lowering drugs. Probably the most important one in our view is the degree of amyloid lowering and there, we're really pleased with what we've seen with donanemab. But lecanumab is probably also a pretty powerful amyloid-lowering drug.  Certainly a positive readout from a Phase III of one of these 3 drugs has got to increase your odds of success of 1 of -- or both of the other 2. But I just sort of remind us all that Alzheimer's has been a risky area with studies that are sometimes hard to predict. So we take some caution. Of course, we'd love to see more positive studies and more news for patients -- good news for patients.  I think before I turn it over to Anne for the other question, I just sort of take ARIA-E and lecanemab data. I think it's a little bit hard to do cross-trial comparisons of rates for a couple of reasons that I think are important, maybe we can talk more about at our scientific presentation at CTAD. Just sort of noting that TRAILBLAZER is probably the first time anyone's ever done within trial comparison of 2 different drugs to be able to compare ARIA.  Why is that important? When you're looking at 2 different trials, first of all, you have different patient populations. I think we'll probably learn over time that ARIA rates depend on the stage of disease and are more common in patients with more severe brain pathology. I think that's likely to be true. Second, even in the same population, how you measure ARIA can be very different in different trials, for example. Lecanemab has different timings of MRI than donanemab has used if you have more MRIs or earlier MRIs as we do, I think.  You're more likely to pick up more radiographic ARIA. So that's another caution on cross-trial comparisons. However, I do see ARIA rates as important, particularly the symptomatic ARIA that results in serious consequences in some patients. And that's probably what we need to focus on is the serious events rather than radiographic ARIA.

Here, we're trying to go even beyond that observation and demonstrate what we believe to be true, which is that correcting obesity and correcting metabolism in these patients can have a wide range of benefits. And so that's why we've done 2 things there. We've gone beyond the traditional cardiovascular endpoints. This is primarily a cardiovascular drug. It's a drug that corrects metabolism. And we think that will have broader benefits, including, hopefully, and importantly, all cause mortality.  And then second, we've got to a broader population so that we can show the benefit in that group. So that's our thinking here. And I think it's a natural evolution of this class of drugs as we go forward. With respect to ANGPTL3, you ask about our Phase II and what do we do if we get a positive result. Of course, the reason we do these Phase II trials is to look for promising drugs for patients.  I think in cardiovascular, you rightly point out that it's a high-risk area with big Phase III studies that sometimes carry risk into them. In this case, there's a reasonable understanding of this mechanism and how to translate from 2 to 3 -- Phase II to Phase III. But still, what we're focused on is finding a large effect size drug here. And if we can see a big effect in Phase II that would predict a positive strong signal in a Phase III cardiovascular outcome study then that's exactly what we'll do. In terms of whether that's a thing Lilly does alone or partners, it's probably premature to talk about anything like that.",360.0,155.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.01935483870967742,0.03225806451612903,0.04516129032258064,0.0,0.0064516129032258064,-0.012903225806451613

So we talked -- you talked about the whole call, I think, about supply and trends. But can you talk a little bit about the individual dosing like what doses are being used the most? And if you do incur like higher than what you predict demand, what dosage levels might be greatest impacted. I think you had 30% switching and 70% new. So it's the low doses that would go first or the mid doses? And second, on Alzheimer's, we're hearing a lot of doctors say that you have the mind share of the for Abeta class drugs. Can you talk a little bit about what you think is the most important thing that resonates with doctors? Is it subcu? Is it frequent dosing, is it the magnitude of benefit as we think about the speed of uptake once full drug's reimbursed?",152.0,66.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.0,0.0

I think dosing titration in the real world is different than our clinical studies and the clinical studies we needed to test, what the dose response was going to be 5, 10 and 15. So in our clinical studies, we titrated every 4 weeks up to additional doses in order to be able to have expedited trials and show the benefit. In real world, what you see is that people will start on a dose, they start at 2.5, they go to 5.  And then what we're seeing is that physicians will hold there and see how they respond and 5 milligrams provides really good efficacy for people living with type 2 diabetes. If they need more, then they'll escalate the dose. It may not be at the 4-week mark, it maybe at a 3-month mark. So those trends are still established in the marketplace, but the vast majority of our volume is in the 2.5 and 5 milligrams.  I want to make sure you're not reading too much into my earlier comments around shortages at any particular dose. My comments earlier were just saying, hey, there's a lot of factors that's going on. There's a lot of dynamics. You've got to plan your manufacturing down at the SKU dosing levels a month or 2 ahead of actually when it's for us. And so will every dose line up perfectly with what the demand is needed for that week in the marketplace. It may not. And if it does, then a dose or 2 may not be able to get the order that week, and then we'll adjust quickly. And our team work very closely and very hard to make sure it doesn't impact patients.",291.0,128.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0390625,0.0234375,0.03125,0.0,0.0,0.015625

And I think -- as I reflect on that question, which is a good one, I think it's built over the decades that we've been investing in the Alzheimer's space. So we've been at this for more than 30 years, invested quite a bit of time and resources in this. And I think it led to, first of all, diagnostics being significantly evolved in this space with the launch of and that we have Tauvid, and then we also intend to launch a PTAL blood diagnostic next year, which could really improve access and diagnosis of these patients.  And so I think it starts out there with showing our commitment to making sure that the right patients on these therapies. And I do believe that, that was one of the pivot points for how we now have successful trials in this space by the ability to really confirm that people have this diagnosis. All of that learning over the years, all of the insights from the trials that we've had, some of the setbacks that we experienced led to the first positive trial that has happened in this space with the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and showing both significant and rapid clearance of amyloid plaque, but then most importantly, to everyone showing that, that truly slows the progression of the disease.  And so it's really, I think, some of that mind share is built on the commitment that we've shown to the space, the commitment we've had to making sure that patients truly get diagnosed in that. And that's what we're spending a lot of time in the first few months certainly of next year, as we work towards access for these patients is to make sure that we can drive early and accurate diagnosis.  We're so pleased with how donanemab has continued to perform. As I said, we believe, and I think lecanemab results reinforce what we saw in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ is that clearance of plaque is the key to this disease. And we know that donanemab does that. We look forward to sharing the TV4 data at CTAD. I think you'll see how that reinforces what we saw in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and then the design and what we believe will be the performance in TV2.  So I think that we deserve that mind share, but I think it's been earned over many years of supporting and investing in this space that has led to positive trials for us and for others. So it's rewarding, I think, for many of the scientists here to see the culmination of this. So -- but again, exciting times, cusp of real meaningful movement for people with Alzheimer's disease.

We delivered top and bottom line growth in 2022 despite the impact of the Alimta LOE in the US and significant FX headwinds and delivered another remarkable year of pipeline progress. We began 2023 with multiple updates to our late-stage pipeline. In our Q2 2022 earnings call last August, we announced the filing of submissions for two assets with the FDA under an accelerated approval pathway, pirtobrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma and donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Last month, we received response from the FDA on both these assets. On January 19, we announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter for accelerated approval of donanemab due to the limited number of patients with at least 12 months of drug exposure. There were no other deficiencies cited. We will continue to work with the FDA to evaluate the best pathway to make this potential treatment option available to patients and look forward to results next quarter for the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase III confirmatory trial, which will form the basis of donanemab's application for traditional approval. We have consistently stated that, we would expect very limited uptake before CMS supports coverage. At the time we submitted for accelerated approval, we had hoped that there would be more movement from CMS to provide access to these medicines for people with Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, this has not yet materialized. We maintain conviction that given the impact of this devastating disease and significant unmet need, positive confirmatory data and FDA traditional approval should be sufficient to support global reimbursement and patient access necessary for broad use of donanemab over time. Also in the month of January, we received FDA approval for Jaypirca, the first and only non-covalent BTK inhibitor, for adults with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic therapy, including a BTK inhibitor. Jaypirca is a highly selective kinase inhibitor, is novel reversible binding mechanism and pharmacology may allow for extended targeting of the BTK pathway, following treatment with a covalent BTK inhibitor. We are pleased with the recent approval of Jaypirca and we remain confident in the long-term opportunity for donanemab. We also look forward to the potential launch of two of our immunology assets later this year with mirikizumab and lebrikizumab and of tirzepatide for obesity. This current wave of new launches along with the ongoing focus and progress in our next wave of R&D innovation underpins our long-term outlook to drive top-tier revenue growth and expand our margins over time. On slide 4 you can see the progress we've made on our strategic deliverables. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue on a constant currency basis grew 10% in Q4 and 5% for the full year. Volume in our core business, again, excluding COVID-19 antibodies, grew 13% in Q4 and 12% for the year. This volume-driven performance was attributed to our key growth products, which grew 21% last quarter. For pipeline milestones, in addition to the recent FDA approval of Jaypirca, we have shared several important updates since our Q3 earnings call. Positive Phase 3 readout and FDA and EMA acceptance of the regulatory submission for Jardiance for adults with chronic kidney disease, the initiation of a rolling submission in the US for tirzepatide in obesity, and FDA granting a Fast Track designation for tirzepatide in obstructive sleep apnea. We also continue to put our cash flow to work to create long-term value. In late January, we announced plans to invest an additional $450 million for expansion of our Research Triangle Park manufacturing site in North Carolina, to further augment our manufacturing capacity for the years ahead. On the business development front, we closed the acquisition of Akouos to expand our gene therapy capability and we entered into a strategic research collaborations with a focus on new modalities and technologies. Finally, we continue to return capital to investors. In Q4 we distributed nearly $900 million to shareholders via the dividend and we announced a 15% increase to the dividend for the fifth consecutive year. Moving to slide 5, you'll see a list of the key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, business development and ESG updates we are discussing today or that were discussed during our guidance call on December 13. One item I'd like to highlight is the collaboration we announced in December with EVA Pharma to deliver a sustainable supply of affordable high-quality insulin to at least one million people living with diabetes in low to middle-income countries, most of which are in Africa. This is an important collaboration with a local company to produce low quality -- or low-cost high-quality medicines. Strengthening capacity and building self-reliance for insulin manufacturing within the African region will provide a more sustainable supply in the long term. With this agreement, Lilly will sell insulin API to EVA Pharma at a significantly reduced price and provide pro-bono technology transfer to enable EVA to formulate fill and finish insulin vials and cartridges. We're proud to be a part of this novel arrangement, which aligns with our 30x30 goal of improving access to quality healthcare for 30 million people, living in limited resource settings annually by 2030. Now, I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q4 and full year 2022 results.",897.0,476.0,18.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.037815126050420166,0.008403361344537815,0.0063025210084033615,0.0063025210084033615,0.0,0.029411764705882353

Slide 6 and 7 summarize financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2022. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. As Dave mentioned, we're pleased to report 10% growth for our core business in Q4 on a constant currency basis, driven by strong volume growth. A couple of notable items affected year-over-year comparisons. The first is COVID-19 antibody revenue in Q4 2022, which compared to the prior year declined 96% from approximately $1.1 billion in Q4 2021 to $38 million in Q4 2022. Biptimozumab is currently not authorized for emergency use in any US region and we continue to expect no COVID-19 antibody revenue for 2023. Second is the continued foreign exchange headwinds compared to 2021, which resulted in a 45-basis point dampening of revenue growth in Q4. Key growth products grew by 21% and accounted for 70% of our revenue this quarter. For the full year 2022, revenue excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies grew 2% or 5% on a constant currency basis. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 80.5% in Q4, an increase of approximately 440 basis points, primarily driven by lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by lower realized price and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs. Total operating expenses declined 1% in Q4, lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges were largely offset by higher marketing, selling, and administrative expenses and higher R&D expenses. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 3% in Q4, primarily driven by costs supporting the launch of new products and indications, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expense for the quarter increased 5%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Operating income declined 7% compared to Q4 2021, driven by lower revenue, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Operating margin for Q4 was 27.4%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 330 basis points attributed to acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Full year operating margin was 27.8% an increase from 26.8% in 2021. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 7.3%, bringing our full year 2022 effective tax rate to 10.3%. As we shared during our guidance call in December, we had assumed that the 2017 Tax Act provision for requiring capitalization, amortization of research, and development expenses for tax purposes would be deferred or repealed by Congress in late 2022. However, no legislative action was taken related to this provision, which resulted in a lower effective tax rate for 2022 versus the guidance range previously shared. In addition this provision did increase our tax payments in 2022 by approximately $1.2 billion. At the bottom-line earnings per share declined 4% in Q4 and increased 7% for the full year. On slide eight, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth across key geographies. This quarter US revenue declined 10%. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the US. The swap volume-driven growth was led by Verzenio, Mounjaro, and Jardiance. Net price was flat in the US this quarter. For the full year, the net price decrease of 3% in the US was in line with our expectation. Moving to Europe. Revenue in Q4, increased 8% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Jardiance Trulicity and Verzenio. We remain encouraged with the momentum of our business in Europe. In Japan, revenue in Q4 decreased 6% in constant currency. Revenue growth in Japan continues to be negatively impacted, albeit less so than in prior quarters by decreased demand for several products that have lost patent exclusivity including, the Alimta and Cymbalta. We expect to return to growth this year, as we scale key products and launch Mounjaro. In China, revenue grew 2% in constant currency, as continued volume growth was mostly offset by lower realized prices for Humalog, as a result of the volume-based procurement process and for products listed on the NRDL as well as by COVID-19 disruption. Revenue in the Rest of the World increased 11% in constant currency this quarter, driven by approximately $130 million of onetime revenue associated with the sales of the company's right to Alimta in Korea and Taiwan. As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth, contributing 15% points of volume growth this quarter. As mentioned previously, the decline in COVID-19 antibody volume, was substantial in Q4 2022 and was largely offset -- and largely offset volume growth from key products. While we will face similar prior period headwinds from COVID-19 antibody revenue through the first three quarters of 2023, our long-term growth prospects are underpinned by our innovative pipeline and key growth products including Mounjaro. Slide 10, further highlights the contributions of our key growth products. This quarter these brands grew 21% or 27% in constant currency generated $5.1 billion in sales and made up 70% of our total revenue. While Lilly's incretins portfolio understandably generates high interest, we continue to see tremendous growth both in percentage and absolute terms, for other key products including Verzenio and Jardiance. Verzenio sales in the quarter grew 100%, driven mainly by the edge of an indication. Jardiance sales grew 42% and the product retains the leadership position, in a competitive market globally. Demand for our incretins portfolio remains strong both for Trulicity globally and Mounjaro in the US, and we remain focused on bringing additional capacity online to meet this robust demand in upcoming launches. In terms of supply, as mentioned in our guidance call in December, given strong demand for incretins products. There have been intermittent delays at wholesalers and pharmacies and receiving certain doses levels of Mounjaro and Trulicity in the US. We continue to update the FDA on the situation, and the FDA has been posting to his website details regarding affected doses and expected timing. To meet this rapidly growing demand across our incretins business, we have announced plans to add additional, substantial capacity in the years ahead. The most proximal of these efforts, is our RTP side North Carolina where progress continues as planned and we look forward to the start of production later this year. Moving to Slide 11. Mounjaro's strong launch uptake continues, underpinned by differentiated efficacy profile, and positive customer experiences. For Q4, approximately 75% of Mounjaro's new therapy starts, are patients new to the type 2 diabetes injectable incretins class and further 10% of switches from Trulicity. As we mentioned in our Q3 earnings call in early November, we took actions in Q4 to reinforce the intended use of the Mounjaro savings program, by type 2 diabetes patients. We indicated at that time that these actions could negatively impact new prescription volumes, but were not expected to impact net revenue. As anticipated, we believe the new prescription volumes beginning in late November were impacted by these actions with some week-by-week volatility driven by end of year seasonality. We continue to build payer access for Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. As of January 1st AXIS [ph] stands just over 50% for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D. Regarding the percentage of paid scripts. For Q4 we estimate the percentage of paid script from Mounjaro to be approximately 40% with paid script defined as those prescription outside the 25 non-covered co-pay cards, but inclusive of the 25 covered co-pay card. As we expand payer access, the proportion of paid scripts should continue to increase. On slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2022, we invested $9.6 billion to drive future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investment. In addition, we returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and are oriented towards achieving our strategic deliverables of top-tier revenue growth and speeding life changing medicines to patients. We do this through investments in our current portfolio to drive new launches, investment in our manufacturing capacity in our future innovation through R&D and business development. And we returned capital to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Slide 13 provides an updated 2023 financial guidance. The only change we've made from the guidance we provided in December is to update our effective tax rate, which result in an updated EPS range. During December guidance call, we shared that the effective tax rate for 2023 would be approximately 16% based on the assumed deferral or repeal of the tax provision requiring capitalization of R&D. Since this provision was not deferred or repealed in 2022 and given the uncertainty around if and when such action will take place in 2023, we have updated our tax rate from 16% to approximately 13%. This update to our effective tax rate results in new EPS range of $7.90 to $8.10 on a GAAP basis and $8.35 to $8.55 on a non-GAAP basis. Regarding FX rates there has been a general weakening of the dollar since we set our initial 2023 financial guidance last year. However, we're not adjusting guidance for FX changes at this time as we're only one month into the year and FX markets can be quite volatile. As I shared in December, the most significant headwind in revenue growth in 2023 versus 2022 will be the impact of COVID-19 antibody sales. This year-over-year comparisons will be most pronounced in Q1 2023 given that we had $1.5 billion of COVID-19 antibody sales in Q1 2022. To a lesser extent the loss of exclusivity of Alimta in the US in Q2 2022 will also impact year-over-year growth in the first half of 2023. Still the midpoint of our 2023 revenue guidance range represents roughly 7% of growth or 50% growth for our core business excluding COVID-19 antibodies. This year holds tremendous promise for us to help patients as we execute on the current wave of potential launches while maintaining our commitment to invest in and progress future innovation. We expect this ongoing focus on disciplined execution and investment will help drive top two revenue growth through 2030. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan, to provide an update on our pipeline.",1634.0,902.0,20.0,17.0,19.0,1.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.022172949002217297,0.018847006651884702,0.02106430155210643,0.0011086474501108647,0.0033259423503325942,0.0033259423503325942

We advanced our late-stage assets of tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab to key regulatory submissions and we obtained the approval for Mounjaro. We launched Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes in mid-2022. As Dave shared, we received an approval last week for pirtobrutinib now known as Jaypirca. By the end of this year, we also have the potential to launch two new immunology assets with mirikizumab and lebrikizumab. And for ganitumab, we're looking forward to our Phase III readout mid-year, which if positive will form the basis of our submission for traditional approval. In 2022, we also gained clarity on the next wave of assets that have entered or will soon enter Phase III registrational trials. Those are our SERD in breast cancer, our weekly insulin for diabetes, remternetug in Alzheimer's disease and as shared in our December guidance call, we now have Orforglipron and Retatrutide in diabetes and obesity. Given the updates we provided in mid-December, today I'll just briefly highlight progress since our last earnings call. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 30th and slides 15 and 16, show a recap of 2022 key events and potential key events for 2023. Starting with diabetes and cardiometabolic disease, in November, we shared results from the EMPA-KIDNEY Phase III trial, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as the largest and broadest SGLT2 inhibitor trial in CKD to-date. The results showed a significant benefit of Jardiance, in reducing the relative risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death by 28% compared with placebo in people with chronic kidney disease. The overall safety data were consistent with previous findings confirming the well-established safety profile of Jardiance. CKD is a leading cause of death worldwide, affecting over 850 million people globally and 37 million in the U.S. We've submitted to the FDA and EMA for approval and expect to make submissions to other regulatory agencies in the coming months. In January we started QWINT-1, a Phase III study comparing fixed dose escalation of Lilly's weekly insulin to Insulin Glargine, in insulin-naive type 2 diabetes patients. With this initiation all five studies in the QWINT Phase III program are now underway. Moving to earlier stage assets in our Diabetes and CV pipeline, in Q4 we advanced two assets into Phase II, that aim to lower Lp(a), a well-known risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The first is an oral inhibitor, a small molecule that disrupts the interaction between the apoA protein and the lipoprotein particle and the second uses siRNA to disrupt the production of apoA in the liver. We shared proof-of-concept data on the siRNA asset during our December 2021 R&D Investor Meeting. This is our second siRNA asset to advance to Phase II, following our ANGPTL3 siRNA, which entered Phase II earlier in 2022. We also recently moved an siRNA asset targeting ApoC-III in cardiovascular disease into Phase I. Our genetic medicines portfolio is advancing and we remain optimistic about the prospect of improving cardiovascular outcomes with these molecules. Lastly, we discontinued our Phase I KHK inhibitor. In oncology, we're of course pleased with the recent approval of Jaypirca and we look forward to continuing the substantial ongoing development program for the molecule in the years ahead. Jaypirca is the second product approved from our 2019 Loxo Oncology acquisition, which reshaped our oncology efforts at Lilly. Loxo at Lilly's growing NME portfolio now includes a number of emerging assets shown in our pipeline, including our FGFR3 program which recently dosed its first patient. Also, in Q4, we dosed the first patient in EMBER-4, our second Phase III trial for imlunestrant, our oral SERD. EMBER-4 will study imlunestrant in the adjuvant setting. As a sequential monotherapy in patients who previously received two to five years of adjuvant endocrine therapy for ER-positive HER2-negative early breast cancer with increased risk of recurrence. Lastly turning to Verzenio. As noted in our guidance call at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December, we shared the latest interim analysis for monarchE, our adjuvant high-risk early breast cancer study of abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of adult patients with HR-positive HER2-negative node positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. We've now submitted an sNDA to the US FDA to potentially expand our adjuvant indication beyond the currently indicated Cohort 1 KI-67 greater than 20% population. In immunology, we're looking forward to potential FDA approvals later this year for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis, which we expect in the first half of the year and lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis, which we expect in the second half of the year. Looking earlier in our immunology pipeline, as mentioned in our guidance call, we presented exciting proof-of-concept results for our PD-1 agonist antibody peresolimab in rheumatoid arthritis at the ACR conference in November and we have now initiated a global dose-ranging Phase IIb study. Moving to neuroscience. We've advanced into Phase II our P2X7 inhibitor for chronic pain. Lilly acquired rights to this asset from Asahi Kasei Pharma in early 2021. With regards to donanemab. As Dave mentioned, the sole efficiency cited by the FDA to our submission for accelerated approval was a number of patients with at least 12 months of drug exposure. The Phase II TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial on which the accelerated approval application was based, allowed patients to complete their course of treatment with donanemab when they reached a predefined level of amyloid plaque clearance. Due to the speed of plaque reduction that we saw, many patients were able to stop dosing as early as six months into treatment, resulting in fewer patients receiving 12 months or more of donanemab dosing. We remain confident in the potential donanemab as a new treatment for people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and look forward to sharing results from the Phase III TRABLASER-ALZ-2 study in Q2 of this year. In summary, while 2022 was an outstanding year of pipeline progress, we're fully focused on the work we need to do in 2023 to make our next set of potential medicines a reality for patients. We look forward to providing additional updates throughout the year. Now I turn the call back to Dave.",1054.0,518.0,18.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.03474903474903475,0.009652509652509652,0.011583011583011582,0.003861003861003861,0.0,0.025096525096525095

We delivered strong revenue growth in our core business, propelled by our key growth products. We launched Mounjaro for patients with type two diabetes, while advancing and expanding our development program for tirzepatide, including the start of the SURMOUNT-MMO outcome study and the initiation of a rolling submission for chronic weight management. In 2022, we submitted regulatory applications for important pipeline products like mirikizumab, pirtobrutinib and lebrikizumab. And in 2023, we've already received approval for Jaypirca and are poised to advance donanemab in the regulatory process assuming positive data from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ-2 Phase III study. In addition, we continue to invest in our pipeline, our capacity, our capabilities and our people. Finally, we returned $5 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. And for the fifth consecutive year, announced a 15% dividend increase for 2023. With continued growth in Mounjaro and our key products, including Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz, we expect our core business revenue to grow by mid-teens in 2023. We are energized by the launch opportunities before us this year and no strong launch execution is key to our long-term success. Taken together, we believe that we are well positioned to deliver top-tier revenue growth through at least 2030 and to deliver on Lilly's mission to make life better for people around the world.

So, it looks like the net price dropped to gain in 3Q to 4Q. Can you just walk us through what specifically drove this, and just update us on how you expect this to trend over the course of the year? And then just maybe looking sort of out to the future of your obesity portfolio, beyond 4G [ph], do you have any interest in mechanisms that target the sort of the mitochondrion coupling side of the equation, that would be helpful.

I think the best way to answer that is to take a look at what we saw as kind of our Mounjaro paid scripts in Q4 and then how we think that will progress over '23. In the fourth quarter, we classify about 40% of Mounjaro scripts as paid, which we defined as patients that aren't supported by our $25 non-coverage savings program. In our savings program, as we discussed at launch was designed to bridge people living with type 2 diabetes to access. As we discussed in the Q3 earnings call, we have adjusted a program to better ensure, it's being used for people living only with type 2 diabetes. These adjustments included removing our $25 non-covered benefit from our savings card for new patients. We didn't make any adjustments for existing patients who are seeing these cards are set to expire on June of this year, June 30. As expected, these changes have reduced new patient start volume, while increasing the percent of new patients with a history of diabetes treatments and the percent with formulary coverage. I think the way I would look at our savings program right now for new patients is that, we have graduated from the bridging program and now are kind of the type of savings program, really focused on covered patients that you would do in kind of a normalized cycle of a product. So thus we expect that Mounjaro's percent of paid scripts and a net revenue per script to increase through 2023, as we continue to increase access and grow new starts. We remain disciplined in our access discussions so we can maximize long-term value. From the start, our value our approach was to make sure that we capture value in the long-term versus the short term and we've remained very disciplined on that. We have just over 50% access for lives in Part D and commercial segments for people living with type 2 diabetes We're very pleased where we're at on the access front and where the way our contracting has turned out at this point. So hopefully that helps provide some color to our gross to net in Q4.

I can assure you we're not done innovating on behalf of people with obesity. There's a lot we can still do. I think keep your eyes open for more to come from Lilly labs on incretins and related types of mechanisms, but also broadly interested in a variety of new non-incretins-based mechanisms. You specifically asked about one mitochondrial uncoupling but there are several others, I think that also have promise for patients. I just sort of put a note of caution though treating obesity we need to have a very high bar for the types of medicines we develop, remembering that this is a chronic often lifetime disease and highly prevalent population. We need medicines that first and foremost are extremely safe and really highly well tolerated for patients.

Is it still reasonable to think about a net Mounjaro price that could be above that of Trulicity as we look out to 2024 or whenever you achieve kind of comparable payer access. And then my question was on donanemab. I know there wasn't a huge revenue opportunity tied to the accelerated approval. But I think you had talked about using that gap between accelerated approval and full approval to really ramp physician education and infrastructure, et cetera. How do you kind of manage through that now I guess where we're going to have maybe a full approval that could be occurring closer into a CMS decisions?

I can't get into roles about our net price for obvious reasons but maybe I'll address the question this way. I mean if you look at – when we have - when we reach – we think we'll reach broad access for Mounjaro and reach ultimately similar access levels that we have for Trulicity. There's nothing differently about how we'll promote or how to support patients on Mounjaro versus Trulicity. So at the end of the day it will come down to our net price negotiations with payers.

So as you said, the accelerate approval is not going to provide access for the vast majority of patients. So it doesn't impact us in that way. And obviously, accelerate approval would have made it maybe a little bit easier to do some of the things that we wanted to do, but there's still a great deal that we can do actually have been doing to make sure that the healthcare system is ready for these medicines. So we begin working on that, things such as developing the diagnostic ecosystem are incredibly important, making sure that there's better integrated Alzheimer's disease pathways to make sure that physicians can properly identify refer infuse these patients. So that's the area of focus right now. Certainly diagnostics are a key area of focus for Lilly. We've continued to expand our PET network to make sure that we're ready for patient diagnosis. And then as well we continue to be committed to PTAL blood tests and intend to launch that this year.

So Dan, I wanted to ask you if you could talk a little bit about where you see the oral GLP-1 space developing and how your product is likely to be positioned. A little bit of this I think is also what you think the unmet need is outside of where the, sort of, very robust weight loss that we see from Mounjaro is.

But clearly obesity is a huge problem in the US and around the world. I think 100 million Americans potentially with obesity and reaching one billion people around the world pretty soon. That's probably not a market that even all of the interested companies could address solely with injectables. So just given the scope of the problem around the world we're going to need orals. Ultimately it's our goal to have orals that can match the safety tolerability and efficacy of injectables. I think our oral GLP-1 is our first attempt in this space and has really good prospects for meeting that initial goal. But then noting of course that the injectables are going to get better over time and the orals will catch up as well. The second part of your question was how do the orals catch up. And I think you're sort of alluding to an obvious issue, which is right now our oral GLP-1 and other orals in the space are single mechanism, single incretin agonists. I think, we've seen with great drugs like Trulicity and competitive products what single agonist against GLP-1 can achieve. It's not as good, I think, as what can be achieved with dual agonism for tirzepatide or hopefully even triple agonism with GGG. And so you can bet, we're working on oral solutions that can bring additional incretin activity to patients in a pill.

Dan I know you have SURMOUNT-4 coming up which is the maintenance study but how has your thinking evolved if at all on the potential duration of tirzepatide use either based on longer exposure from clinical studies or in the real world? And do you think that could inform payer discussions. And then Mike on Mounjaro a moving target, but how does the prescriber base as of today compare with Trulicity.

And for such diseases patients often need to take therapy for chronically -- potentially life of the disease here. A lot of times in medicine that doesn't happen of course, people come off of therapies, because either the therapy is working, and they think they don't need anymore or there's a benefit they can't see. I'm not sure either of those are the case for a drug like tirzepatide. People clearly can observe the benefits that the drug is having on their health. And perhaps unfortunately, but not different really than any other drug that we have for any other disease. When you stop taking the drug, it's likely that it can no longer work, and patients may see that as well. So I think those factors will combine to have a pretty long duration of therapy. We have to wait and see in the marketplace maybe Mike has some early signals from patients, but still pretty early on.

But qualitatively what we hear is what patients who've used Mounjaro, what they like and what they realize once they start using it is that it really does reduce the appetite, and they enjoy the benefits of reducing appetite. It helps them lose their -- lose weight and stop being as consumed as much during today about 80%. And we do know that when -- what we heard from our investigators and our studies is that when people stop taking Mounjaro that their appetite goes back to the level, it was before. So that's something very noticeable something that a patient values from taking the therapy and then when they stop the therapy, they then see this reversed. And so we do believe that people are going to stop, and see if they can lose weight if they can great. But I do think that they're going to see a very powerful signal very quickly to reinforce going back on the product. So I do think that will help reinforce the chronic use of tirzepatide for type two diabetes, and eventually for obesity if we get approved. The question on Trulicity. Mounjaro if you look at Mounjaro's use right now and compare it to how many customers are using that versus Trulicity at this time, it's a lot broader population than we saw with Trulicity is because the market is a lot bigger a lot more people are riding the treatment. If you compare Mounjaro to the number of Trulicity riders today there are more people riding Trulicity just, because it's been on the market longer. They've gone through the adoption curve and Trulicity has better access, access and especially in Medicaid that drives additional prescribers to use that.

The prior data would certainly suggest that. If so, relative to lecanemab, doesn't that create a potential risk benefit conundrum for FDA assuming efficacy comes in around the same levels. I guess the bottom line here is there a regulatory concern to contemplate maybe this is why FDA issued the CRL they want to see the full results from your second study.

Maybe I'll answer the second part of the question first, which is around, why did the FDA issue the CRL. I think that the FDA regulations actually suggest that FDA should list all deficiencies in the CRL. We were pretty explicit copying some of the FDA's own words here to investors about what was in the CRL. It didn't discuss issues like ARIA it was focused on the 12-month exposure. So nothing further to speculate there. I think your question on rates of ARIA-E and ARIA-H comparing across drugs is a complicated one. We did this head-to-head study against aducanumab. I think it's important to use studies like that to compare rates of ARIA, because we've learned that grades of ARIA are highly dependent on the type of patients who enroll the stage of disease and underlying pathology, baseline characteristics of their brain scans, which are different across lecanemab trials and genetimib trials, as well as exactly how you do the MRIs and read them. So I'm personally not going to get worked up about rates of asymptomatic radiographic-only ARIA in any drug. I don't think anyone really understands what that means. What we should be focused on though is rates of symptomatic ARIA. So patients who have ARIA that turns into something they experience, not just a radiographic binding and particularly rates of serious adverse events resulting ARIA. We know that in some patients ARIA can be dangerous even fatal as we've seen from lecanemab experiences. So that's what we'll be looking out for.

We can't comment on specifics on the FDA interactions, but we're expecting that site to start producing this year and it's progressing towards that goal. I will mention important to think about -- when we talk about RTP, I think because of the proximal nature of when this site is going to come online. Obviously, this is the next large node that's going to come online in terms of capacity for incretins portfolio. But we are making substantial investments beyond RTP. So, we've announced a second site in North Carolina, very large site in Concord, when we've announced the expansion of the RTP site additional sites in India – or north of Indianapolis and a site in Ireland. And as we look at our capital investments in manufacturing sites this year alone, it's probably the largest we've ever had doubling what we had in 2022. We're looking at about $3.3 billion of investment just this year. So we're looking at substantial expansion of capacity really across the globe to support not just Mounjaro obviously, but the rest of the portfolio and we have visibility into what's coming as well as the fact that, as we've talked about before we have several products that are part of the same manufacturing network, and the same auto-injector platform.

I mean you look at the massive size of the obesity market 110 million people in the US, 650 million people globally but you really see that the historically that the obesity market has really been slow to develop. And it's really because the treatments haven't been adequate. So, the kind of – the question we had going into this market, was if a safe and efficacious treatment was developed would consumers and health care professionals and payers be interested in using it? Well, based on what we've seen in the marketplace over the past year and on a market research it's clear that consumers and health care professionals will adopt an efficacious safe anti-obesity medication if patients can have access to it. So it does come down to payer access, and we're highly focused on doing that. Noble recently stated in their call that 40 million Americans have access to obesity and the way, they talked about it what's payer access and employers opting into that. So if that's where we're at today that would be a great starting point for access. We're deep into conversations with payers to understand the market and all that. Access discussions haven't started yet, but will shortly. But our focus long term is to improve access for diabetes medications. We are investing significantly to demonstrate the potential health outcome benefits, where people using tirzepatide, who live with obesity. We're also investing in Phase III programs for people, who live with obesity and sleep apnea, or heart failure and they should unlock large segments access for people who live with obesity in commercial and we hope Part D. In addition, in my career, I've seen the power of consumer interest in helping to improve access for medication. And what we've seen over the last year is that, people who live with obesity are highly engaged and willing to do much access effective treatments. They will have an important walls with employers and the congressional representative advocate for access. So, while I think it will take time to establish our ultimate actions goal, I'm more encouraged than ever are potential unlock the obesity market and help a lot of people.

Maybe a little better potency and certainly better drug properties including, no ADAs and formulation things. So the rationale here is to give improved dosing options to patients.

On the IRA side of it, it will benefit patients who live with diabetes who use GLPs and are Medicare Part D the outpace cost will go down. We have I would say a small or moderate impact on GLP sales or just probably lower rates of abandonment than what we'd see at higher out-of-pocket costs. As it comes to the oral DPP4 the perceptions of oral DPP-4 have really declined over the last five years and really being replaced by ST2s and GLP lose. So I don't see much of an impact of DPP-4s going off path in the US or other markets.",113.0,50.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.08,0.02,0.0,0.0,-0.06

I was just thinking more about some of the launches that are coming up but I know the maybe a little bit out. But for Mirikizumab and I always get this wrong, sorry. But for UC, can you just talk a little bit about given how much promotion there's been for [indiscernible] as you move into also Crohn's with data reading out soon. Like how do you see like competing in that market? Can you start launching? Do you have to be DTC heavy because it seems like they're very prominent. Like what about the launch dynamics. And then second for lebrikizumab the same question here. Atopic dermatitis is getting pretty crowded. What kind of pushes and pulls might you need to use to get quicker uptake in atopic derm?

If we look at the 52 weeks, we have more than 50% clinical remission and we see statistical and clinically meaningful improvements across both clinical, symptomatic, endoscopic and histologic endpoints. What I think is important that if you look at the patient populations with ulcerative colitis, we saw the same results across the bionaive and the bio failure patients. So I think we're extremely well positioned for the launch here. We also demonstrated on a factor but it's extremely important for patients or agency. More than 40% of patients were either completely or almost our urgency at week 52. So therefore, we believe we have a first-in-class asset here that probably initially will be used mainly second line for those that haven't responded appropriately to TNFs and similar. But we believe that long-term, we are positioned for a first-line placement in treatment of ulcerative colitis. And yes, so the outlook for mirikizumab. It's exciting from a competitive landscape perspective, we don't have bad to have data. But if we compare the data we have seen so far, we believe that mirikizumab compares very favorable both versus what's currently in the marketplace as well as what's in the pipeline with other companies across JAK inhibitors S1Ps and other IL-23s as well. So exciting to launch mirikizumab the first half of this year. When it comes to lebri, I think actually, we are uniquely positioned to really upgrade the expected outcomes of patients with atopic dermatitis. We have here an asset that is actually targeting the most relevant cytokine when it comes to treating atopic dermatitis, IL-13 and it does that with a high binding affinity, high potency and a slow off rate. And I think that probably explains the data that we have seen so far. We're extremely pleased with the Phase III data, and we sold more than 80% of patients achieving skin clearance at Week 16, maintaining that at Week 52, but also very importantly, statistical and clinically meaningful improvements across both each, which is probably the most disturbing factor for patients with atopic dermatitis, sleep and quality of life. And we saw similar results across both the Q2W and Q4W formulation. We actually believe that lebrikizumab has the potential to become a first-line biologic. It's important to have in mind that we announced the submission at the Q3 earnings call, and we expect that traditional regulatory pathway. Yes, we will not launch until most likely Q4 of 2023. But a lot of excitement from both health care providers and tier community as well on the payers to get leverage to the market.",462.0,211.0,9.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.04265402843601896,0.023696682464454975,0.037914691943127965,0.004739336492890996,0.0,0.018957345971563982

We're off to a strong start in 2023 with volume-driven revenue growth led by our incretin portfolio, Verzenio and Jardiance. At our Q1 earnings last year, we shared exciting data from SURMOUNT-1, the first of our tirzepatide obesity Phase III trials. Today, we're excited to share the positive top line results for the SURMOUNT-2 Phase III trial for tirzepatide, which examine the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in chronic weight management in a type 2 diabetes population. SURMOUNT-1 set a new bar for weight loss possible from a pharmacologic agent in non-type 2 diabetes population with obesity or overweight in a Phase III trial. And SURMOUNT-2 does the same in the type 2 diabetes population. Before discussing our financial results and pipeline updates, I'd like to also note the actions Lilly announced on March 1 to improve insulin affordability in the United States. We are proud to have led these efforts to make it easier for people to access Lilly insulin, including through the broad implementation of our $35 out-of-pocket cap and a significant reduction in list price for most of our most commonly used insulins. That said, there remains substantial opportunity and need to reduce existing systemic barriers to insulin access and affordability. Bringing affordable insulin to those who need it will require action and engagement by all stakeholders in our health system. But together, we can create real change to improve access and affordability for people who use insulin. Moving to our results. You can see this on Slide 4 that the progress we've made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Q1 revenue, which includes sales of COVID-19 antibodies -- sorry, excluding sales from COVID-19 antibodies grew 10% or 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth of 18%. Volume growth in Q1 was underpinned by Mounjaro, which is leading the new product category, which also includes Jaypirca, and we expect it will include additional products in the months and years to come. The new product and growth product classifications represent an evolution from our prior designation of key growth products. We believe that these classifications will help investors see the performance of both our newest products in addition to those with ongoing growth potential. In the first quarter of this year, the new product category contributed $574 million of revenue, and the new product and growth product categories combined to contribute 20 percentage points of volume growth in Q1. These products as well as expecting -- expected upcoming product launches reinforce our belief in the strength of Lilly's growth outlook throughout this decade. Last Monday, we broke ground at the site of our two new manufacturing facilities in Boone County, Indiana. We also announced a further $1.6 billion investment in addition to the previously announced $2.1 billion investment in this project to expand Lilly's manufacturing network for active ingredients and new therapeutic modalities. And our progress continues as planned towards production starting later this year at our Research Triangle Park site in North Carolina. On the business development front, this past week, we entered into agreements to sell the rights of our olanzapine portfolio, including Zyprexa and the rights to These two transactions will enable us to further focus our time and effort on our next-generation medicines. In our pipeline, we've had several important updates since our Q4 earnings call, including label expansion for Verzenio in advanced breast cancer in the U.S.; for mirikizumab approval in Japan and a positive CHMP opinion in the EU as well as the FDA's issuance of a Complete Response Letter in the United States; regulatory submissions in the EU for tirzepatide for chronic weight management and in Japan for lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis; and a positive Phase III top line readout for SURMOUNT-2, the second global study evaluating tirzepatide for adults living with obesity or overweight, which will enable completion of our rolling submission with the FDA under Fast Track designation. Dan will discuss this further, but we are excited with the top line results of the Phase III SURMOUNT-2 trial. As shared late last year, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA and initiated a rolling submission for tirzepatide in chronic weight management based on the results of the SURMOUNT-1 trial. And we aligned with the FDA that completion of the submission would come following the SURMOUNT-2 readout. We anticipate completing our submission to the FDA in the coming weeks. We believe addressing obesity could make an enormous difference in millions of people's lives, significantly impact public health and reduce health care costs. We are encouraged by this important next step in the journey to redefine obesity care. Finally, this quarter, we distributed $1 billion in dividends and completed $750 million in share repurchases. On Slide five, you'll see a list of key events since our Q4 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and other updates we are discussing today. Now I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q1 results.",830.0,451.0,18.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.03991130820399113,0.004434589800443459,0.011086474501108648,0.004434589800443459,0.0022172949002217295,0.03547671840354767

Slide six summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2023, and I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q1, revenue declined 11% versus Q1 2022. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenues increased 10% or 12% on a constant currency basis, highlighting solid momentum for our business despite a substantial headwind from a loss of exclusivity in the United States, which did not yet face meaningful generic competition in the base period. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 230 basis points to 78.4% in Q1 2023. The increase in gross margin percent was driven primarily by lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by lower realized prices. Total operating expenses increased 15% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses associated with recent and upcoming product launches and indications. R&D expenses increased 23%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets. This quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&D charges of $105 million or $0.10 of EPS. In Q1 2022, acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges totaled $166 million or $0.15 of EPS. Operating income decreased 38% in Q1, driven by lower revenue, primarily due to 0 sales of COVID-19 antibodies this quarter, paired with higher R&D and SG&A expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 23% for the quarter and reflected a negative impact of approximately 150 basis points attributable to acquired IP R&D charges. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 12.8%. This represents an increase of 250 basis points compared to the same period in 2022, driven primarily by the tax impact of the new Puerto Rico tax regime. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $1.62. On Slide seven, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue declined 14%. As a reminder, COVID-19 antibody revenue in Q1 of 2022 totaled approximately $1.5 billion compared to zero in Q1 of this year. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, U.S. revenue grew 19%, driven by robust volume growth for Mounjaro, Verzenio, Trulicity and Jardiance. We experienced a net price decline of 5% in the U.S. for the quarter, driven primarily by Humalog and Trulicity. As we move into the second half of 2023, we expect U.S. pricing headwind versus prior year will ease considerably driven by Mounjaro access and saving cards dynamics. Europe continued its steady growth trajectory with revenue in Q1 growing 8% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Verzenio, Trulicity, Jardiance and Taltz. Volume in Europe increased 13% in Q1. For Japan, Q1 revenue increased 7% in constant currency as the base period impact of generic competition to Cymbalta and Alimta waned, and we continue to see strong robust growth in our newer medicines led by Verzenio and, to a lesser extent, Jardiance. Moving to China. Revenue declined 1% in constant currency with volume growth of 19% offset by net price declines. Volume growth was driven by Verzenio and, to a lesser extent, increase in shipments of Olumiant. Price declines were largely driven by Humalog, which was added to the volume-based procurement scheme in Q2 of last year. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 9% in constant currency, driven by the sales of rights to Cialis in Taiwan and Saudi Arabia for $95 million in Q1 of 2022, partially offset by growth in Verzenio, Mounjaro and Jardiance. Slide eight shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As Dave mentioned earlier, we have evolved a prior product categorization from key growth products, which included 10 key products launched since 2014 to now focus on 2 categories, the first called new product and the second called growth product. The new product categories led by Mounjaro and also includes Jaypirca, and we expect to expand to include new products in the coming months and years. The growth product category is made up of select products that have been in the market for several years with continued exclusivity. As you can see, the new and growth product categories contributed over 20 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter, which was largely offset by the previously mentioned decline in COVID-19 antibody revenue. While the lack of revenue from COVID-19 antibody will be a headwind to growth throughout the year, the most substantial impact was in Q1. As I mentioned earlier, in Q1 2022, we realized approximately $1.5 billion of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, representing 75% of the $2 billion sold in the full year 2022. Slide 9 provides additional perspective on the trends and specific highlights across our product categories. I'll speak more about Mounjaro shortly, but first, let me highlight the continued outstanding performance of Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 60% in Q1 as the long-term monarchE follow-up data shared at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium last December and the recently expanded label support continued uptake in adjuvant breast cancer. Verzenio is now the standard of care in its Category 1 NCCN listed for high-risk adjuvant breast cancer. Jardiance also continued its outstanding performance with worldwide sales growth of 38% for the quarter. In Q1, we were pleased to announce that based on the results of the Phase III DYNAMO trial, the FDA accepted the supplemental New Drug Application for Jardiance for children 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes. And lastly, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of Trulicity's performance in a growing and dynamic incretin market. Worldwide sales of Trulicity grew 14% in Q1, anchored by the product's robust efficacy and safety profile, coupled with the convenient and easy-to-use device. Looking more holistically at Trulicity and Mounjaro together, U.S. revenue for these two products grew 59% in Q1 2023 versus Q1 2022. Moving to Slide 10. Let me share some commentary and context on Mounjaro's performance for the quarter. We are pleased with the positive momentum over the course of Q1 as it means more patients with type 2 diabetes are realizing the substantial benefits of treatment with Mounjaro. While the trajectory of prescription growth shifted following our actions in Q4 to reinforce the intended use of Mounjaro savings program by type 2 diabetes patients, we have continued to see a positive overall trend. Our focus is on driving new-to-brand growth while continuing to expand access. In Q1, we initiated our first Mounjaro direct-to-consumer TV campaign, and we continue to steadily build access from Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. As of April 1, access stood at just under 60% for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D. We estimate that the percentage of paid scripts for Mounjaro in Q1 was just over 55%, up from approximately 40% in Q4 2022. As a reminder, we define paid scripts as those prescription outside the $25 non-covered co-pay cards but inclusive of the $25 covered co-pay card. Looking forward to Q2 and the rest of the year, we expect continued improvement in access in the proportion of paid scripts and in new-to-brand prescription. On Slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1 2023, we invested $2.7 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned just over $1 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $700 million in stock. Slide 12 represents our updated 2023 financial guidance. Starting with revenue, we are increasing the revenue guidance range by $900 million to now be in the range of $31.2 billion to $31.7 billion. Since announcing our 2023 financial guidance in December, the U.S. dollar has weakened against most major currencies. We have updated our full year revenue outlook based on recent spot rates. This FX update is driving approximately $650 million of the $900 million increase in our revenue guidance. The remainder of the increase is attributable to underlying business performance. Our guidance for gross margin as a percent of revenue remains unchanged. In terms of operating expenses, we are increasing the range of marketing, selling and administrative costs by $100 million to reflect our updated exchange rate assumptions. This results in an updated range of $7 billion to $7.2 billion. We are also increasing the range for research and development expenses by $100 million, driven by updated exchange rate assumptions and investments in our late-stage portfolio. This results in an updated R&D range of $8.3 billion to $8.5 billion. We have incorporated IP R&D charges that have been incurred or realized as of the date of earnings, which totaled $105 million. Consistent with prior quarters, we have not included any IP R&D charges associated with potential or pending business development transactions. Additionally, the recently announced agreements to sell the right of our linsepene portfolio and have not been included in guidance. Each transactions will be factored into our financial guidance after it closes. Other income and expenses and tax rate guidance remain unchanged. Based on these changes, we are raising our full year reported EPS guidance to now be in the range of $8.18 to $8.38 per share and raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $8.65 to $8.85. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.",1494.0,777.0,13.0,12.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,0.01673101673101673,0.015444015444015444,0.011583011583011582,0.0,0.0,0.001287001287001287

Let me start with today's exciting announcement, the positive results for tirzepatide in the SURMOUNT-2 Phase III study. Tirzepatide met the co-primary study endpoints and also hit on all prespecified key secondary endpoints. Participants with obesity or overweight and with type 2 diabetes achieved up to 16% weight loss at 72 weeks, which translates to a mean weight loss of 34 pounds. Additionally, 86% of people taking 15-milligram tirzepatide achieved at least 5% body rate reduction. This was in line with our expectations based on our SURPASS-3 data in a similar population. With this SURMOUNT-2 data, we now have two positive Phase III trials for tirzepatide in obesity, 1 in patients without type 2 diabetes and 1 in patients with type 2 diabetes. We now look forward to completing our rolling submission to the FDA in the coming weeks. I'll cover the SURMOUNT-2 results in more detail, but first, let me spend a few minutes providing an overview of the SURMOUNT Phase III program. The SURMOUNT program has enrolled more than 5,000 people with obesity or overweight across 8 studies. On Slide 13, you can see key trial design elements for the core SURMOUNT-1 through four studies as well as the more recently announced SURMOUNT-MMO and SURMOUNT-5 studies. Five of the six studies compare efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to placebo as an adjunct to reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity, while the most recently posted trial, SURMOUNT-5 compares tirzepatide to 2.4-milligram semaglutide. As a reminder, SURMOUNT-1 was designed to evaluate treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo for people without type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight with at least 1 comorbidity. And it delivered up to 22.5% mean body weight reduction. SURMOUNT-2, which we're reporting today, evaluated treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo for people with obesity or overweight and type 2 diabetes. SURMOUNT-3 will provide data on maximizing weight loss following an intensive lifestyle program and SURMOUNT-4 evaluates maintaining weight loss. SURMOUNT-5 is an open-label trial that will enroll 700 adults who have obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities without type 2 diabetes and will compare the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to semaglutide 2.4-milligrams. Finally, SURMOUNT-MMO is our Phase III morbidity and mortality and obesity study to evaluate improved outcomes for patients with obesity. We expect the next two studies, SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 to read out later this year, while SURMOUNT-5 is anticipated to complete in the first half of 2025. SURMOUNT-MMO, as an outcome study, will take several more years to complete. On Slide 14, you can see the first co-primary endpoint in the SURMOUNT-2 study where tirzepatide 15-milligram delivered 15.7% mean body weight reduction in adults with type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight. With a baseline weight across the study of 222 pounds, tirzepatide treatment led to a mean body weight reduction of 34 pounds on the 15-milligram arm of the study. We're also very pleased to see how well the 10-milligram tirzepatide performed with a 13.4% mean body weight reduction, also at 72 weeks for the efficacy estimand. Results for the treatment regimen estimand were similar to the efficacy estimand and are detailed in this morning's SURMOUNT-2 press release. Moving to Slide 15. Tirzepatide achieved the second co-primary endpoint of achieving at least 5% body weight reduction. SURMOUNT-2 showed up to 86.4% of patients achieved this level of weight reduction at 72 weeks, again, using the efficacy estimand. This is compared to 30.6% of patients on placebo as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Furthermore, over half of all participants in the 15-milligram treatment arm achieved at least 15% weight loss. It has been previously observed in incretin obesity trials that weight loss in a type 2 diabetes population is less than weight loss seen in a non-type 2 diabetes population, a finding consistent with the results we've now reported from the SURMOUNT-1 and SURMOUNT-2 trials. The average weight reductions reported in the SURMOUNT-2 trial in patients with type 2 diabetes range from 7% to 8% less than those seen in SURMOUNT-1, which was an exclusively non-type 2 diabetes population. There are a number of potential mechanisms that may explain this effect, including the weight gain-promoting effects of some classes of anti-hyperglycemic medications used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, improving insulin sensitivity with tirzepatide treatment, gender differences between 2 populations and diminished caloric loss effects of glucosuria. These differences manifested as we expected, and the SURMOUNT-2 top line results represent the most robust weight loss seen in a Phase III pharmacological clinical trial consisting entirely of type 2 diabetes patients with obesity or overweight, and we are highly pleased with these results. Moving to Slide 16. You can see the safety profile from the SURMOUNT-2 study. Tirzepatide was well tolerated in the study participants with the overall safety and tolerability profile similar to incretin-based therapies approved for treatment of obesity. As in SURMOUNT-1 and the SURPASS program, the most commonly reported adverse events were GI-related, were generally mild to moderate in severity and usually occurred through dose escalation. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 3.8% and 7.4% for the 10- and 15-milligram tirzepatide treatment arms, respectively, compared to 3.8% for placebo. The overall treatment discontinuation rates were 9.3% and 13.8% in the 10- and 15-milligram tirzepatide treatment arms compared to 14.9% for placebo. We look forward to sharing more data from SURMOUNT-2 at the American Diabetes Association meeting in June and to submitting the results for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Obesity is a widespread and chronic disease in need of more effective treatment options. The FDA Fast Track designation that tirzepatide received for obesity reflects the seriousness of the condition and the substantial unmet medical need. With impressive trial results now in hand for SURMOUNT-2 and SURMOUNT-1 studies, we look forward to completing our rolling submission to the FDA for tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities in the coming weeks. With respect to regulatory action in Europe, as Dave mentioned, we have already completed our submission to the EMA for chronic weight management indication. The EMA submission was initiated based on the results from the SURPASS trial program in type 2 diabetes and the SURMOUNT-1 Phase III trial in obesity. We expect to have a European Commission decision in the first half of 2024. In addition to all the work on tirzepatide for obesity, we also disclosed earlier this month on clinicaltrials.gov the initiation of a bioequivalent study to compare the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide administered using the existing auto-injector device and a new test device. We expect to work on tirzepatide and other injectable incretins for a long time. And we intend to explore different presentations for these medicines to meet our goal of bringing the benefits to as many patients as possible as quickly as possible. Moving on from tirzepatide to the rest of the portfolio. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 24, and Slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. There have been several important developments since our last earnings call, and I'll cover these by therapeutic area. Continuing within diabetes and metabolic disease. Earlier this month, we began recruiting for the first Phase III clinical trial for orforglipron, our oral GLP-1 non-peptide agonist. This ACHIEVE-4 trial is an open-label study of orforglipron compared with insulin glargine in adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity or overweight at increased risk for cardiovascular events. This is the first in what will be a broader series of studies for orforglipron. It is the largest and longest trial in the program, which is why we chose to initiate this trial first. Enrollment is now underway and we expect patient dosing to recur shortly, after which orforglipron will be placed with our Phase III assets on the summary slide. You'll also see we have advanced our Relaxin long-acting molecule to Phase II development for treatment of heart failure. Shifting to immunology. It was a quarter of mixed progress for mirikizumab, our IL-23 P19 inhibitor. We were pleased with the approval in late March in Japan for mirikizumab under the brand name for adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. A few days later, we were similarly pleased with the positive CHMP opinion from the EMA. However, regarding mirikizumab's regulatory path in the United States, we announced earlier this month that we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. The letter did not cite any concerns regarding the safety or efficacy profile of mirikizumab but focused exclusively on certain aspects related to the proposed commercial manufacturing of mirikizumab. We remain confident mirikizumab's Phase III data and its potential to help people with ulcerative colitis. We look forward to working with the FDA to address the manufacturing questions in order to achieve our goal of bringing mirikizumab to patients in the U.S. Also in our late phase immunology portfolio, we completed the regulatory submission in Japan for lebrikizumab for patients with atopic dermatitis. Moving earlier in our immunology pipeline, during last month's American Academy of Dermatology meeting, we shared data from the single-dose Phase II trial for eltrecabart, our CXCR1/2 antibody in patients with hydroadonitis The data showed good tolerability and clear separation between eltrecabart and placebo, along with a reduction in abscesses and nodules, reflecting reduced disease activity. Lastly, in immunology, we've removed REsPEG-Aldis leukin from our pipeline. In February, following the top line data announcement from the Phase II study in systemic lupus , we informed our partner, Nektar Therapeutics that we do not intend to advance the asset into Phase III development. Moving on to neuroscience. Last month, we announced that our last active solanezumab trial, the antiamyloid in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease study or A4 study did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. The A4 study was conducted through an innovative public-private partnership, and we were thankful for the time and effort of the clinical study staff, participants and study partners. This study formally concludes our clinical development of solanezumab. The A4 results, while disappointing, were not a surprise, given the advancements in our understanding of Alzheimer's disease since the study initiated almost 10 years ago. Solanezumab only targets soluble amyloid beta and does not clear plaque. Denenimab and rimternatug, on the other hand, have been specifically designed to bind to and clear amyloid plaque, and we now understand that substantial plaque clearance is required in order for anti-amyloid drugs to show clinical efficacy. Accordingly, we were pleased to share new data for duninimab and during the International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease in late March. For denetimab, we shared data from our Trailblazer EXT, a Phase II long-term follow-on study of Trailblazer ALS. While study limitations include a relatively small number of patients, the data showed encouraging trends and the longer-term effects on amyloid and tau levels and clinical progression. We also disclosed the trial design and objective for Trailblazer Phase IIIb study to expand the science and understanding of ARIA in relationship to amyloid lowering through imaging and blood-based biomarkers in different dosing paradigms. This study will leverage enhanced MRI sequences as well as blood-based biomarkers and other patient characteristics that may predict ARIA. And we'll investigate the effect of different dosing regimens on the frequency and severity of ARIA. Of course, we expect the next key milestone for genenumab will be later this quarter when we obtain the results for our confirmatory Phase III TRAILBLAZER ALS 2 trial. We look forward to sharing these results and to advancing the regulatory process for assuming positive data from this trial. This quarter, we also shared the first clinical data from [indiscernible] from a Phase I multiple ascending dose study, which highlighted the potential speed and depth of amyloid plaque lowering in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These data on amyloid clearance, safety and tolerability supported our decision to move this asset into Phase III, and we look forward to sharing further updates as the program progresses. You'll also notice we have a number of developments in our early-stage neuroscience portfolio with a Phase II entry for our GBA1 gene therapy asset in the Gaucher disease type 1 indication along with 2 Phase I pain asset entries and 1 Phase II pain asset discontinuation. Shifting now to oncology. Just yesterday, Jaypirca received a positive opinion from the CHMP for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. In early March, the FDA approved an expanded indication for Verzenio for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with HR-positive HER2-negative node positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. High-risk patients can now be more easily identified with the removal of the Ki-67 score requirement for patient selection. Moving earlier in our oncology pipeline, we presented data from our Phase I study of our KRASG12C inhibitor as part of the AACR meeting last week. These data show promising efficacy and the potential for a differentiated safety profile in combination with pembrolizumab. We're working on finalizing dose selection for our drug in combination with pembrolizumab. And at AACR, we also showed data from CYCLONE 1, a single-arm unblinded study, which was the first to investigate Verzenio in prostate cancer. This early study informed the design of our CYCLONE 2 adaptive Phase II/III trial, which last year cleared our preset threshold to advance to Phase III and for which we expect to read out as soon as late this year. Q1 was another busy and productive quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly.

Our core business, which excludes COVID-19 antibody revenue, grew 10%, driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio, Trulicity and Jardiance. This growth was achieved despite headwinds related to pricing, to generic erosion of Alimta in the U.S. and a moderated but still negative foreign exchange impacts. In the coming quarters, we expect the impact of COVID-19 antibody revenue in the prior periods will ebb, while our new product and growth product categories of medicines will drive continued revenue growth and meaningful operating margin expansion. While the quarter was not without some challenges, which I am confident we'll overcome, we made meaningful advances in our pipeline, including the approval of an expanded label of Verzenio, the first approval of mirikizumab in Japan, submission of tirzepatide for obesity in the EU and positive results from our second Phase III trial for tirzepatide in obesity. We also demonstrated leadership to improve insulin access and affordability for millions of Americans. Lastly, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase. We remain committed to both executing on the significant opportunities before us and to continuing the important and often difficult work to discover, develop and bring to market innovative medicines to address some of the greatest areas of unmet medical need.

Dan, can you just give us your thoughts on, I guess, what many investors are sort of viewing as the potential Goldilocks scenario that would be necessary to really successfully compete with lucanumab. I'm sure you have your own thoughts on this that are quite detailed. So just wondering how you believe the sort of commercial opportunity and/or really the clinical opportunity is likely to play out once we see the data, assuming the study is positive.",84.0,35.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11428571428571428,0.02857142857142857,0.05714285714285714,0.0,0.0,0.08571428571428572

I'll start sort of on the data expectations and how it might fit in and maybe Anne will add some things on commercial opportunity. So I think we had very compelling data in Phase II, 32% slowing of disease progression. If in Phase III, we can replicate those kinds of results, this will be a very important and meaningful drug. I know it's interesting for investors to sort of speculate on competition between 2 different pharma companies. It's not exactly how I think about it. I think there's a huge opportunity here for patients. The challenge is not really about competition. It's about how do we help the medical system better identify patients, diagnose them and move them into treatment regimens, of course, requiring reimbursement. I think the two drugs, however, have some important differences. Dunanumab targets specifically amyloid plaques. We think that's the relevant species to hit in Alzheimer's disease. I think we were pretty confident about that in the past, probably the solanezumab data, which targeted just soluble adds even more confidence to that statement. As a result of hitting just amyloid plaques, that allows us to have fixed duration dosing regimens as an option for patients. Let's see how the data turn out. But I expect that many patients will be able to stop dosing even as soon as 12 months. That's a big difference than being prescribed a drug that you might have to take the rest of your life. And I think that could be exciting and important for patients. So lots of ways for donanemab to win. I think the most important thing, though, is showing consistent strong efficacy like we did in Phase II and then getting this drug approved and bringing it to patients.

And I think it's important to remember, it will take time to build this market. And so as Dan said, we're investing in these efforts now, building awareness of diagnostics, the awareness of treatments are coming, making sure that the health care systems are ready for these medicines and that the care pathway is set up, and then most importantly, as you said, that patients have access and reimbursement. And just to echo his comments, I don't think we really think of this as a cost of drugs we need to fight over market share. It's an opportunity to build a new class on behalf of disease, driving awareness, driving diagnosis and then getting access.

On the branding question, obviously, yes, we're not going to provide any clarity on that. I think if you look at the kind of pros and cons on 1 versus 2 brands, the pros are, it is a more efficient supply chain and manufacturing for 1 brand, for 2 brands or some access benefits. Also, you have an empty vessel for the commercial promotion of our obesity indication with the 2-brand scenarios. So that's kind of the puts and takes on that part. On the supply, I think maybe I'll answer the overall supply question because I'm sure there may be other questions on there. We talked last year that our focus was to double capacity by the end of this year, and we're progressing toward that goal. Our manufacturing team is working hard every day and directly delivering over our manufacturing plan this year. We believe that our channel inventory for Q2 will be a bit better for what we saw in Q1. And obviously, as you bring up, the important milestone is us bringing our first [indiscernible] brand fully online this year. The manufacturing team is progressing toward that goal.

Can you just maybe talk about bigger picture what you've been seeing in the incretin market? It seems like we first had this nice very strong ramp of Mounjaro, and then we saw a further step-up in category growth with NOVOS capacity issues being resolved. So I guess when you're seeing kind of the underlying demand that's out there, is that changing at all how you think about either investing in the space or just your go-to-market strategy for both Mounjaro and then tirzepatide obesity when that's approved? I'm just trying to get a sense of just are you -- I think we're all surprised by the volume trends, just how you're kind of adapting within Lilly to kind of think about that beyond just the capacity side, more of the investment side.

With our savings card changes as well as our continued focus of our promotion on only for people with type 2 diabetes, for someone to -- for a new patient to come on to Mounjaro, to have a low out-of-pocket cost, they have to have formulary access. We are only contracting for diabetes access for Mounjaro. So at this point, our assumption is that the vast majority of new people who are new to Mounjaro have type 2 diabetes. On the incretin market, yes, it's really growing both across type 2 diabetes. It's really surge as well as on the obesity front. We plan to aggressively promote and offer this product in both disease classes and invest appropriately to the opportunity. We're not surprised by the market growth in type 2 diabetes. We think there's a big opportunity to really help people who have type 2 diabetes early in the course of treatment to improve their long-term health outcomes. And then as the SURMOUNT-2 data demonstrated, there's just a tremendous unmet need in the obesity market. And we're not surprised by Wegovy's uptake after the resupply and relaunch. And I just really think it really points to the tremendous opportunity that we have to really help patients and meet the needs of the marketplace. So really no changes for us.

And then more importantly, how should we think about gross to net post approval in obesity? Is it reasonable to expect another kind of step down temporarily? Or would that not be the case?

On the gross to net progression for Mounjaro, I think it's best to look at our paid TRxs, which we define as those patients who's not supported by our $25 noncoverage savings program. That was our original program at launch. You see from the slide that Anat presented early on that we have seen just really good growth of the paid TRxs over time. If you take a look at the growth from Q1 versus Q4, it was a 55% growth in paid TRxs. If you look at the point in time of the week before we started the saving card changes to last week, we've increased paid TRx growth by almost 2.5x. So we're very happy with that. That's the trend we need to see to improve gross to net. Now at the same time, we look at kind of what we've defined as unpaid scripts, which is those that are supported by the original $25 noncoverage savings programs, those are decreasing. So really, that's the 2 trends you need to see to lead to improved growth to net of paid scripts increasing and unpaid scripts decreasing. Also, we expect those trends to continue. We also have a milestone coming up at the end of June when the original $25 noncovered savings card are set to expire. With chronic weight management approval, we'll talk about that -- and pricing at the appropriate time after approval. With regards to our submission, chronic weight management, our plan, as Dave said, the team is taking this data right now and working feverishly to submit that in the coming weeks.

And when we look at the opportunity within, let's say the chronic weight management marketplace, it's easy to look at the number of people who live with obesity both in the U.S. and globally, and look at, boy, this could have a big impact on health care costs. But I think if you look more at the real true potential that we focus so much on weight loss, but when you look at not only the -- what does weight loss really provide, there's over 200 complications associated with living with obesity. And as we get more and closer to the marketplace and look at our modeling, we do think that this is going to relieve and reduce the risk of complications associated with obesity, and there will be medical cost savings associated with using these agents, which will, I think, be of great societal value. Also, when you look at the quality of life results that we saw from SURMOUNT-1, they were remarkable. And at times, it's hard to quantify those in a cost-effectiveness model. But in real life, those impact patients significantly. And I think it really does highlight how important these treatments are to people who live with obesity.

Maybe just to add, I think the latest data from the Medicare Trust is that we're spending about $1 trillion a year as a country on obesity-related complications and comorbidities. I don't think we always do a very good job of thinking about buying pharmaceuticals as an investment and future savings in our health. Maybe we do better when it's acute like COVID. I think we spent tens of billions on COVID therapies and didn't question it as much. But here's -- I think even in the most rosy forecast, we're not going to sell $1 trillion of obesity drugs. So the question is more like, over time, can we demonstrate that treatment today reduces cost downstream? We're highly confident that, that will be a multiple of 5x, 10x savings for whatever people invest in the medicines. We have to prove that. That's our job as an innovative company is to do the outcome studies that demonstrate that. I think our competitors are doing the same thing, and that will be good for the field. And as I've said before, it's hard to imagine by the end of this decade that everyone doesn't just accept that pharmacologic treatment for overweight and obesity should be the standard of care, and it will save this health care system trillions of dollars over time. So that's our position and we need to fight for that position. We also need to do the work. And right now, we are talking about weight loss numbers, not outcomes.

Probably just starting with maybe correcting a misperception in the field around ARIA rates, I think we don't really know what asymptomatic ARIA means is sort of an incidental finding on an advanced brain scan. We don't want to over-index on that. We want to focus on symptomatic ARIA. And symptomatic ARIA rates, that's what the patient experiences is adverse is a range from sort of 5% to 10% or less across the class. We don't understand all the factors that could cause 1 patient of symptomatic ARIA and another patient to have a symptomatic ARIA, which we see is not a problem. That's what we want to understand better in this study. Are there things that we can see on baseline MRIs or on blood biomarkers that might predict who's going to have those symptomatic ARIAs? And then are there adjustments to dosing that you could have in those patients so they can still get the benefit of the drug without getting the symptomatic ARIA? I don't see this as a study where there's a positive outcome or a negative outcome. It's not a binary thing here. What it's going to do is add to our understanding of how best to identify patients and how best to change dosing in patients who have the highest risk that overall, that should lead the field to have more comfort using these drugs, the entire class of drugs probably in more responsible ways.",268.0,119.0,5.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.04201680672268908,0.03361344537815126,0.06722689075630252,0.0,0.0,0.008403361344537815

And the second one is that when you think about tirzepatide development in other settings like sleep apnea, et cetera, there are a lot of indications that you could still go after but haven't officially announced When you look outside of diabetes or obesity, what is the criteria for selecting tirzepatide development versus, say, the oral versus GGG, et cetera?",117.0,49.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,0.0,0.0,0.0

Starting with your question on SURMOUNT-4, sort of asking what are our expectations and implications of what happens when people come off this drug, I think unfortunately, tirzepatide is probably like every other drug we have, which is requires you to take it to continue to get the benefits. That's the expectation we have for blood pressure drugs and lipid-lowering drugs and probably we should have that for some time for drugs to manage obesity. What does that mean in the real world for patients? My expectation is many patients may try coming off the drug completely to see what happens. Maybe some will be successful in maintaining their weight, but many of them will probably experience some regression of their weight back towards baseline. And this could prompt them to come back on the drug. That's probably natural and we can expect that, although Mike will comment in a second on commercial dynamics. In terms of other indications, we really look at things that could have a big impact via weight loss. There's never been a drug like tirzepatide that can cause this amount of weight loss. So mostly, we're looking through literature on things like bariatric surgery and seeing what kind of benefits that can lead to or diet and exercise. And that's how we've gotten to a few indications that you mentioned, sleep apnea and heart failure, among others. In terms of which drug could be best right now, of course, we have the most confidence around tirzepatide, but there might be some indications where a drug like redatrutide, which adds glucagon and call it GGG, could be better. For example, glucagon has profound effects on fat in the liver, so maybe that plays better for complications of obesity related to liver disease like NASH. Orforglipron, on the other hand, our oral, unlikely to have as much weight loss as profound metabolic improvements as tirzepatide does because it doesn't have any GIP, which is an important constituent of tirzepatide. But on the other hand, the ease of use may make it more applicable to some broader, more primary care indications. So that's a little bit of thinking on how we sort those out.

On the commercial side, as we launch into the chronic weight management market for tirzepatide, we'll be very upfront with payers and health care professionals and consumers that this is a chronic disease and a chronic medication that needs to be adhered to long term. When you look at how this product works, one of the most important aspects of it is that it controls and reduces appetite. When someone tries to gain -- to lose weight via diet and exercise, as someone is successful in losing weight, the body actually works against that and tugs it the opposite way by increasing the appetite. That's why these agents, tirzepatide does work because it does reduce the appetite. So while on therapy, we anticipate that the appetite will be lowered and maintained. And then if stopped, then the appetite will increase. Now this is something that unlike most drugs, you don't know if you stop taking like a statin or something else, you don't really feel any effects. We do think that, that will be a noticeable effect that will begin soon after stopping therapy even before you start seeing weight gain. So I think we think that will be an important kind of signal for a patient to understand that this is a chronic disease and needs to be treated long term. As it goes into the -- maybe 1 other aspect on the additional indications, we talk a lot about access and the need for in order to get access into Part D. And obviously, that will be an important thing overarching. But these additional indications are important for the senior population. Complications run with living with obesity, and they emerge into complications when you reach Medicare like type 2 diabetes, like sleep apnea and like heart failure. And so we believe these are important indications to study because we think these are important health conditions. But also commercially, we think this is important because this will help us get access for these really important complications that are really important to the senior population. So commercially, we think these are really important.

But let's just play it out if sema is selected because it's a small molecule 9 years from launch, et cetera. What will happen in the commercial market? Nobody knows because in the draft guidance, there really isn't a lot of clarity about how the government proposes to effectuate the so-called maximum fair price to the consumer level. They're entertaining a few ideas, it appears, from their initial guidance. I think we're expecting more regulatory, either definitive regulatory statements or proposals for comment in the coming 90 days, Umer. But I can tell you what we'd prefer is that since we're not a party to that transaction as manufacturers in this example, not us, but someone else, we would probably need a third party to determine, is that a valid Part D prescription? Is it eligible for the maximum fair price? And then to step in and match that transaction up post hoc. We did something like that when the donut hole was created, and it worked pretty well with third-party administrators. This is what we've suggested that the administration will be the best thing. And in that scenario, you would not have a wholesale price reduction to reach the maximum fair price. You would do it after the fact, and I think in that way, be able to keep the two segments, commercial and government a little bit more separate. That has obvious advantage for the industry and probably for payers as well and maybe for patients, creating certainty and lack of arbitrage across physical distribution channels.

As we take a look at the chronic weight management market internationally outside the U.S., it's a significant opportunity. We already see significant utilization of current therapies that don't provide as much weight loss and benefit and still providing significant commercial opportunity and also access to patients. A lot of that is happening in many markets out of pocket. At the same time, there are markets that are already moving towards reimbursement, U.K. and other markets in Europe, already looking at ways to reimburse, especially in the higher BMI categories of obesity. And so this will play out over time on both as we look at data and outcomes to drive further an expansion of access.

I know you are trying to thinking about doubling this year, but longer term, you have talked about double of Trulicity. If you look at consensus numbers or what Street is projecting, even that may not be enough. So how are you thinking about increasing the capacity in the longer term for Mounjaro?",64.0,27.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.0,-0.037037037037037035

Right now, we have the unique situation of having a product so useful, we can't make enough of it really. And I think when we expand the label, it will continue to put pressure on that. I suspect this whole category will have supply pressure for some time. We're basically in an all-of-the-above moment here in terms of investing in capacity and thinking of alternative ways to expand use and make this -- fulfill the need that's out there. So we've made certain announcements we've talked about the RTP site this year. Our sister site in North Carolina, really the following year beginning to produce, that's of equivalent size. We've also made additional capacity investments in the original RTP site, which will expand the numbers further. And then today, we're talking about other delivery systems that could be providing even more capacity available for global demand fulfillment. So we're on a road map here that we're excited about in the endpoint. I think we'll probably all be a little more frustrated and impatient in the short term with the rate of expansion. But rest assured, the line is going up into the right at a pretty steep angle in terms of our volume and output, and we expect that to continue for several years to come. So working hard on this problem, happy with the progress, need to make more progress, and we've got plans to do that from here. I'll also just close that comment by just punctuating a little bit the importance of the orforglipron program in terms of meeting -- fully meeting the demand that could be something like hundreds of millions of patients per year, oral solid. We know the globe has massive capacity. It's cheaper and easier to make, and that product has a lot of promise clinically but also significant profits in terms of addressing needs, particularly middle-income markets in China and other very large opportunities. And with that, let me close the call today, and thank you all for participating in this earnings call once again and your interest in Lilly and what we're doing. It's been an eventful and productive start to 2023, and we -- as we execute on our innovation rate strategy and bring all these new medicines to patients. I want to thank you again for dialing in.

We advanced our R&D pipeline, progressed our ambitious manufacturing agenda and delivered strong financial results. Our business saw an acceleration of revenue growth driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. As base period headwinds from COVID-19 antibody revenue and Alimta's loss of exclusivity recede, we do expect strong growth to continue in the quarters ahead. Lilly has made substantial progress in advancing our pipeline of innovative medicines in recent years, but the past few months have been particularly noteworthy. In early May, we shared the top line results of the Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial, which showed donanemab treatment slowed clinical decline in Alzheimer's by 35%. While differences in enrollment criteria and study design make cross-trial comparisons difficult, this represents the greatest percentage cognitive slowing in a primary end point of any disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease treatment reported to date, and the only Phase II to Phase III replication to date. Three weeks ago at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Amsterdam and simultaneously published in JAMA, we shared the detailed results, including new analysis, which demonstrates the potential of even greater cognitive slowing in patients in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease. At the ADA scientific sessions in June, we shared positive Phase II data on 2 next-generation diabetes and obesity product candidates: orforglipron and retatrutide. And less than 2 weeks ago, we shared top line results from the SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 Phase III trials, which showed participants on tirzepatide following intensive lifestyle intervention or with continued tirzepatide treatment, achieved up to 26.6% mean weight loss. Dan will share more perspectives in his R&D update on these and other exciting areas of pipeline progress. Moving to our results. You can see on Slide 4 the continued progress made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Excluding revenue from Baqsimi and from the sales of COVID-19 antibodies in 2022, Q2 revenue grew 22% on 23% volume growth. Volume growth in Q2 was driven by Mounjaro, which leads our new products category. That category also includes Jaypirca and now Omvoh, which saw its first sales in Japan in Q2 and launched in Germany in July. In the second quarter of this year, new products and growth products categories combined contributed approximately 26 percentage points of volume growth. These products, coupled with potential upcoming launches, solidify Lilly's strong growth profile through this decade. We've had several important pipeline updates since our Q1 earnings call. For mirikizumab, approval in the EU and resubmission of our U.S. application with regulatory action expected by the end of this year. Regulatory submissions in the U.S. for tirzepatide for chronic weight management; regulatory submission of donanemab for traditional approval to the FDA and EMA following the positive Phase III results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial; and positive Phase III top line readouts for SURMOUNT-3 and 4 in the third and fourth global studies evaluating tirzepatide in chronic weight management. The second quarter also was productive for business development. We've commented in the past on our active exploration and pursuit of external innovation and are pleased to have announced agreements to acquire 2 clinical-stage companies in the second quarter: DICE Therapeutics and Versanis Bio. These companies operate in different therapeutic areas, and each is a fit with Lilly's strategy. We also closed the sale of global rights to Baqsimi, and the financial impact of this transaction is reflected in our Q2 results. After quarter end, we closed the sale of rights to our olanzapine portfolio, which will be reflected in our Q3 financial results. Both these transactions are now incorporated into our updated 2023 financial guidance. We continued to progress the most ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda in the 147 history of our company. We're happy to share that commercial production to support our incretin portfolio has begun at our Research Triangle Park site in North Carolina. Beyond the capacity expansion that will come as we ramp production at this site, we're also pursuing other near-term paths to expand access to our incretins to patients around the world. Anat will provide more detail on these efforts. And finally, we distributed over $1 billion in dividends this quarter. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and other updates we're sharing today. So without further ado, I'll turn this over to Anat to share our Q2 results.",746.0,391.0,20.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,0.05115089514066496,0.017902813299232736,0.005115089514066497,0.010230179028132993,0.0,0.03324808184143223

I'll focus my comments today on non-GAAP performance. In Q2, revenue increased 28% versus Q2 of 2022. Excluding revenue from Baqsimi and from COVID-19 antibodies in the base period, revenue increased 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis. This acceleration on revenue growth was achieved despite lingering headwinds from Alimta's loss of exclusivity in the United States, which occurred in the first half of last year, and the effects of which should normalize going forward. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was flat in Q2 at 79.8%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from product mix, including onetime revenue from the sales of rights to Baqsimi, which was offset by increases in manufacturing expenses related to labor costs and our investments in capacity expansion. Total operating expenses increased 14% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 18%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses associated with recent and upcoming new product launches and additional indications. R&D expenses increased 32%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research.  This quarter, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $97 million or $0.09 of EPS. In Q2 2022, acquired IPR&D charges totaled $440 million or $0.46 of EPS. Operating income increased 69% in Q2 driven by higher revenue, including revenue associated with the sales of rights for Baqsimi and lower IPR&D charges, partially offset by higher R&D and SG&A expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 27% for the quarter and reflected a negative impact of approximately 115 basis points attributable to acquired IPR&D charges.  Our Q2 effective tax rate was 16.1%. This represents an increase of 190 basis points compared to the same period in 2022 driven by the impact of the new Puerto Rico tax regime in the sales of rights for Baqsimi. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $2.11 in Q2, a 69% increase versus Q2 of 2022, inclusive of $0.43 of EPS associated with the sales of rights for Baqsimi.  On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue increased 41%. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Baqsimi, U.S. revenue grew 30% driven by robust growth from Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. Net price in the U.S. increased 2% for the quarter driven by Mounjaro access and savings cards dynamics. Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the U.S. decreased by low single digits, consistent with prior trends.  As I mentioned in our Q1 earnings call, we expect Mounjaro access and saving cards dynamics to have an even greater effect on reported U.S. price changes in the second half of this year.  Europe continued its growth trajectory with revenue in Q2 up 6% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz. Volume in Europe increased 12% in the second quarter. For Japan, Q2 revenue increased 7% in constant currency as we continue to see robust growth in our newer medicine, led by Verzenio, and to a lesser extent, Jardiance, Olumiant and Mounjaro, the last of which launched in Japan in April.  Moving to China. Revenue increased 20% in constant currency with volume growth only minimally offset by price declines. Volume growth in Q2 was driven by Tyvyt and Verzenio. We are pleased to see our China business return to growth. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 19% in constant currency as volume growth of 20% was driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance.  Slide 9 shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you may recall on our Q1 earnings call, we simplified the categorization of our products with a focus on 2 categories: new products and growth products. As you can see, the new and growth categories combined contributed 26 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter. The volume growth for all others category was driven by the sale of rights to Baqsimi. The lack of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies compared to the base period was a milder headwind to growth in Q2 compared to Q1 and will continue to be a modest impact to prior year comparisons.  Slide 10 provides additional perspectives across our product categories. I'll speak more about Mounjaro shortly but first, let me highlight the continued outstanding performance of Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 57% in Q2 as OUS volume grew 82%, while U.S. volume grew 47%. Jardiance also continued its strong performance with worldwide sales growth of 45% for the quarter.  There have been 2 notable regulatory approval for Jardiance in the last 2 months. In June, the FDA approved Jardiance for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in children 10 years and older, making Jardiance the first and only SGLT2 inhibitor approved for this patient population. And in late July, Jardiance was approved in the EU for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease. After almost a decade on the market, Jardiance continues to demonstrate its importance to patients across a number of cardiorenal metabolic conditions.  Trulicity performance has held up well in a growing and dynamic incretin market. In Q2, we saw worldwide Trulicity revenue decline by 5% as modest volume growth was more than offset by price erosion. In international markets, Trulicity volume continues to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to health care professionals not to initiate patients on Trulicity. We remain confident that Trulicity will continue to be an important option for HCPs and patients in years to come.  Moving to Slide 11. I will share some perspective on Mounjaro's performance. We continue to be pleased with the strong momentum of Mounjaro as more type 2 diabetes patients benefit from the medicine. Mounjaro's revenue in the U.S. grew to $960 million for the quarter. In Q2, we continued to make progress in expanding access to Mounjaro, and access reached 73% on July 1 for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D. We estimate that the percentage of paid scripts from Mounjaro in Q2 was approximately 67%, up from approximately 55% in Q1.  As a reminder, we define paid scripts as those prescriptions outside of the $25 noncovered co-pay card but inclusive of the $25 covered co-pay card. Since the $25 noncovered co-pay card program expired in June 30, we would expect the proportion of paid script next quarter to be 100% under this definition.  Looking forward to the rest of the year, we expect continued growth in new-to-brand prescription as well as ongoing improvement in access.  Lastly, regarding the demand and supply outlook for incretin. We're pleased that commercial production has started at our RTP site in North Carolina. Even as we ramp up capacity at RTP, we believe supply will likely remain tight in the coming months and quarters due to significant demand.  Given the expected global demand for tirzepatide, as we mentioned on previous earnings call, we are moving forward with different presentations to bring tirzepatide to more patients faster. To this end, we initiated a bioequivalent study in early April for a multi-dose quick pen device. In many OUS markets, we expect to launch tirzepatide first in valve form later this year and transition to a multi-dose quick pen as approved and available in these markets starting in 2024. The launch of the valve and quick pen presentations for tirzepatide will leverage existing manufacturing assets and capacity. We're excited about the opportunity to expand the number of people we can help in the short term and long term with these additional options.  On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first 6 months of 2023, we invested $5.7 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, capital investments and business development outlays. In addition, we returned nearly $2.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.  Slide 3 presents our updated 2023 financial guidance. Given the strong performance in our underlying business as well as revenue from the sales of rights for Baqsimi and olanzapine, we are increasing our 2023 revenue guidance by $2.2 billion to a range of $33.4 billion to $33.9 billion. Approximately $1.5 billion of this increase is driven by business development activities, including the sales of rights for the olanzapine portfolio and Baqsimi, while the remainder reflects strong underlying business performance.  Our updated FX assumptions based on recent spot rates are listed and represents a de minimis impact to the updated guidance. Our guidance for gross margin as a percent of revenue has increased to approximately 80% driven by the sales of rights for Baqsimi and our olanzapine portfolio.  We're also increasing the range of operating expense guidance for the year. Marketing, selling and administrative costs are now expected to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion with the increase driven by additional investments in recent launches in preparation for launches of new medicine and line extensions expected later this year.  The range for research and development expenses has been increased to $8.9 billion to $9.1 billion, reflecting positive dynamics across our portfolio, including success in events in our early-stage assets, positive enrollment trends in our late-stage studies, broadening of the clinical program for next-generation incretin, and expected incremental expenses from business development activities.  We have incorporated IPR&D charges that have been incurred through Q2 2023, which totaled $202 million. Other income and expense and tax rate guidance have also been updated. OID is now expected to be between $0 million and $100 million in income, up from prior guidance of $100 million to $200 million in expense. We've also increased our estimated effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%, up from approximately 13%, reflecting the impact of the sales of rights for our olanzapine portfolio and Baqsimi.  Based on these changes, we have raised our full year reported EPS guidance to now be in the range of $9.20 to $9.40 per share and raised our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $9.70 to $9.90.  Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.",1656.0,847.0,20.0,9.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,0.023612750885478158,0.010625737898465172,0.012987012987012988,0.0011806375442739079,0.0,0.012987012987012988

Since our last earnings call, we've had a few major readouts across our therapeutic areas, and we've announced several business development transactions. Let me start with the data that we shared in June at the American Diabetes Association. We presented over 40 abstracts across our portfolio and shared data during 2 ADA-sponsored symposia. The first was for the Phase III results from the SURMOUNT-2 study of tirzepatide in adults with obesity or overweight in type 2 diabetes, which was simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. And the second symposium was for the results from 2 Phase II trials of retatrutide, our GIP/GLP glucagon tri-agonist in adults with obesity and overweight as well as in people with type 2 diabetes. The retatrutide results in obesity and type 2 diabetes were simultaneously published in New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet, respectively. We also shared an oral presentation on our Phase II trial results for orforglipron, our once-daily, non-peptide oral GLP-1 in adults with obesity or overweight. These results were simultaneously published in New England Journal. We also presented results from a Phase II trial of orforglipron in patients with type 2 diabetes, and these were published in the Lancet. Clearly, we're proud of all of this data in diabetes and obesity portfolio. Since we discussed the top line data for SURMOUNT-2 tirzepatide trial during our last earnings call, I'll focus my updates today on the Phase II data shared for orforglipron and retatrutide, starting with orforglipron on Slide 14. The orforglipron presentation highlighted safety and efficacy data across 6 dose arms in our Phase II study in obesity. With an overall mean body weight at baseline of 109 kilograms, orforglipron demonstrated an average of up to 14.7% body weight reduction at 36 weeks. At the second highest dose tested in the study, 75% of participants reached a weight reduction goal of 10% or more. We also shared data showing a dose-dependent decrease in systolic blood pressure and an overall improvement in lipid levels. The most common adverse events were GI-related and generally occurred earlier in the trial during the titration phase and were mostly mild to moderate. While we've not yet shared the dosing details for our Phase III studies, these Phase II results have informed our approach on dose escalation. We also presented data at ADA from a similar Phase II study of orforglipron in people with type 2 diabetes, the results of which are highlighted on Slide 15. Orforglipron demonstrated a mean reduction in hemoglobin A1c at 26 weeks of up to 2.1%, and over 90% of participants on the highest 3 doses achieved A1c levels less than 7%. We initiated Phase III trials for orforglipron in both obesity and type 2 diabetes in the second quarter, and we look forward to those results in 2025.  For retatrutide, the full results of 2 Phase II trials were presented during an ADA-sponsored symposium, which discussed efficacy and safety in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity as well as in people with type 2 diabetes. There's also a segment of the symposium focused on liver fat and NASH-related biomarker data in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which showed relative liver fat reduction of over 80% at 24 weeks for the is doses. Slide 16 highlights key results from the obesity Phase II trial in which retatrutide met the primary end point at 24 weeks, demonstrating mean weight reduction up to 17.5%. The safety profile of retatrutide was similar to other incretin-based therapies. In a secondary end point of weight reduction at 48 weeks, participants treated with the highest dose of retatrutide demonstrated a mean rate -- weight reduction up to 24.2% or almost 58 pounds on average. If confirmed in registrational trials, we believe that magnitude of mean weight reduction would represent a new high watermark for weight loss from a pharmacologic agent at this time point. It's also worth noting that the Phase II retatrutide trial in obesity was well balanced between genders with females representing just under half of all participants in the trial. This was intentional and is atypical for incretin clinical trials in obesity, which often have a higher proportion of female participants, a subgroup that typically experiences greater weight loss than males. Indeed, in the retatrutide Phase II obesity trial, the mean change in body weight for female participants at the highest dose was 28.5%. Given these encouraging results, we moved rapidly to initiate the Triumph Phase III program, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of retatrutide for chronic weight management, obstructive sleep apnea and knee osteoarthritis in people with overweight and obesity. These 4 Phase III trials will each run between 68 and 80 weeks. The trajectory of weight loss seen in the Phase II study reinforces our belief that retatrutide can potentially represent a further improvement and additional option for patients seeking pharmacological treatment for obesity and its complications. While retatrutide's Phase II results in obesity garnered much attention at ADA, the Phase II results in patients with type 2 diabetes are also very encouraging with participants receiving retatrutide achieving a hemoglobin A1c reduction of up to 2% on average in addition to meaningful levels of weight loss. I'm pleased to share that we plan to advance retatrutide into Phase III for type 2 diabetes. Moving to tirzepatide on Slide 17. We were delighted to announce in late July that SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 trials of tirzepatide in obesity met all primary and key secondary objectives. In key secondary objectives for both these studies, participants achieved similar mean weight reduction, 26.6% in SURMOUNT-3 and 26.0% in SURMOUNT-4. While these 2 trials were not required for our chronic weight management submission to the FDA, they provide important additional information regarding the role tirzepatide plays in maintaining or adding to the weight loss achieved with either intensive lifestyle intervention or pharmacotherapy in adults living with obesity or overweight. SURMOUNT-3 evaluated tirzepatide following an intensive lifestyle modification program and demonstrated that even in people who have a weight loss response to lifestyle intervention, tirzepatide provides significant additional weight loss. SURMOUNT-4 was a randomized withdrawal study in which all participants received tirzepatide for a 36-week lead-in period, at which point, half the participants were switched to placebo and the other half continued treatment with tirzepatide. This study demonstrated that those participants who continued on tirzepatide experienced continued weight loss, while those who switched to placebo started to regain weight. These data reinforce our understanding that obesity is a complex chronic disease for which multiple treatment approaches, including lifestyle modification and effective medications, are needed. We believe tirzepatide is well positioned to be one such treatment option. Accordingly, we submitted an application for tirzepatide for chronic weight management to the FDA during Q2. The FDA granted this application priority review designation, and we anticipate FDA action by year-end. Slide 18 shows select pipeline opportunities as of August 4, and Slide 19 shows potential key events for the year. I've covered the major updates in diabetes, including the advancement of orforglipron and retatrutide into Phase III since our learning -- last earnings call. Turning then to our neuroscience portfolio. 3 weeks ago with the AIC meeting in Amsterdam and simultaneously published in JAMA, we were excited to share the detailed results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study, highlighting donanemab's robust efficacy profile across a number of new analyses that reinforce our belief in the medicine's ability to meaningfully slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease, especially in patients earlier in disease progression. We cover the results in some detail during our AIC investor call so I won't cover that again, except to note that we submitted donanemab to the FDA and to the EMA for approval, and we look forward to FDA action before the end of this year. Shifting to oncology. Launch progress continues with Jaypirca and mantle cell lymphoma, and we are pleased to have the detailed chronic lymphocytic leukemia results from the BRUIN Phase I/II trial published in New England Journal in early July. Following the discussion with the FDA, we've now submitted an application for accelerated approval for Jaypirca in CLL patients previously treated with both a covalent BTK inhibitor and venetoclax based on the results from the BRUIN Phase I/II study. We expect FDA action by year-end. Also during the quarter, we completed the regulatory submission in Japan for pirtobrutinib for patients with MCL. We continue to study pirtobrutinib in multiple Phase III trials and look forward to the results from the BRUIN 321 trial in CLL, which we now expect to see before the end of this year, and it has been added to our key events slide. In other oncology developments, at ASCO in June, we presented new data from the Verzenio monarchE trial in high-risk early breast cancer. For the first time, we showed data demonstrating the efficacy of the medicine in this setting is not compromised when patients undergo dose reductions. We believe that the ability to manage Verzenio's side effects while preserving efficacy could be very important to ensuring that patients complete their 2 years of therapy. This is an emerging part of Verzenio's differentiation in this class. We're also very excited about last week's announcement regarding the randomized trial of Retevmo in treatment-naive RET fusion-positive lung cancer. As we communicated in the press release, this randomized trial was declared successful on its primary end point of progression-free survival, the first time any targeted therapy in lung cancer has ever shown superiority to a PD-1 plus chemotherapy regimen. While we remain disappointed by the low levels of genomic profiling done at the time of lung cancer diagnosis, we're hopeful that these data will continue to advance the practice of genomic-driven medicine. We look forward to sharing the full results of the study at an upcoming medical meeting. In our earlier-stage oncology portfolio, the combination experiment of our KRAS G12C inhibitor with pembrolizumab continues to mature nicely. And we're now working to initiate Phase III trials in first-line G12C-mutated lung cancer in the next 6 to 9 months. More broadly, we're excited to see the overall progress of our oncology portfolio. In addition to last week's Retevmo announcement, we expect another 7 randomized trial readouts in 4 to 6 new first-in-human trials across small molecules and biologics in oncology over the next 12 months. With the acquisition of Loxo Oncology 4 years ago, we catalyzed a change in the strategy and direction of oncology at Lilly, and we're seeing the fruits of these efforts. Finally, in immunology, we have several updates related to mirikizumab. A Digestive Disease Week in May, we presented new analyses from the Phase III LUCENT-1 and LUCENT-2 studies, demonstrating that remission of key symptoms of ulcerative colitis, including bowel urgency, was associated with significant improvement in the quality-of-life assessment in adults with UC. In Q2, we launched mirikizumab marketed as Omvoh in Japan as a treatment for adults with moderately to severe active UC. In late May, we received approval for Onvio in the EU and have subsequently launched Omvoh in Germany and planned additional launches in the EU later this year. In the U.S., we've resubmitted our application to the FDA. We now expect regulatory action by the end of this year. For lebrikizumab, our IL-13 monoclonal antibody under regulatory review for atopic dermatitis, we presented a new secondary analysis at the Revolutionizing Atopic Dermatitis Conference in May. This post-hoc analysis demonstrated improvement or clearance of face or hand dermatitis in adult and adolescent patients treated with lebrikizumab. These are parts of the body that are highly visible and for which dermatitis can be particularly burdensome and stigmatizing. We expect regulatory action for lebrikizumab in both the U.S. and EU later this year. Together with Almirall, our development and commercialization partner in Europe, we look forward to potentially bringing this important medicine to patients who suffer from this chronic disease. Looking earlier in our immunology pipeline, we're pleased in May to have the detailed results from our Phase IIa study of peresolimab in rheumatoid arthritis published in the New England Journal. These data were first presented as a late-breaking abstract at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting in late 2022 and represent the first clinical evidence that's stimulating the endogenous PD-1 inhibitory pathway could be an effective approach to treat rheumatologic disease. As you can see, Q2 was another productive quarter for Lilly R&D with important progress in each of our therapeutic areas.

This quarter saw an acceleration of revenue growth as our recently launched product portfolio gathers momentum. Excluding COVID-19 antibodies and Baqsimi revenue, we grew 22% driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. The quarter also saw a continuation of investment in our future growth in our manufacturing expansion, in late-stage medicines, in early phase capabilities and in business development. Notwithstanding these long-term investments, we continue to expect our revenue will grow more rapidly than our expense base in the coming years and see significant opportunity for margin expansion. We also achieved meaningful advances in our near-term pipeline with positive phase -- positive top line results, detailed data disclosures and submission of donanemab for traditional approval to the FDA and EMA, and completion of the tirzepatide submission in chronic weight management, alongside positive top line results from 2 more Phase III trials for the SURMOUNT program. We also shared data from 4 mid-stage clinical trials for orforglipron and retatrutide and initiated Phase III trials for both assets. Lastly, we announced several targeted business development moves intended to bolster our early- and mid-stage portfolio and our R&D capabilities, and we returned over $1 billion to shareholders via the dividend.

I assume we probably would get a question on the SELECT trial, and thanks for starting out the call with that. The SELECT trial read out as we expected. I think the results are great for the anti-obesity medication class. It should really support access for any payers who are on the fence of whether they should add anti-obesity medications or not. I think importantly, it should turn the conversation of the benefits of weight loss away from aesthetics and more toward the health benefit of people living with obesity. When you look overall, there are 236 obesity-related health complications. To name a few, obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes by 243%, coronary heart disease by 69%, hypertension by 113%, dyslipidemia by 74%. The overall cost of obesity-rated complications and comorbidities are massive, accounting for $370 billion in direct medical cost, over $1 trillion in indirect annual costs in the U.S. People living with obesity or overweight drive 2.7 greater health care costs than normal-weight individuals. The global health stakeholders really need to be moved beyond the debate and really move to action on the AOM class. With tirzepatide's potential to provide over 20% weight loss, it should provide great value for payers. We have a comprehensive real-world evidence plan and clinical plan to demonstrate tirzepatide's value, including our MMO OUTCOMES trial. Based on the SELECT trial results, we can't wait to see the results of tirzepatide/MMO study. We do believe that additional weight loss will matter. This is a fantastic day for people living with obesity. Now do I think most payers will adopt AOMs overnight because of SELECT trial? I don't think so. I think, as I said earlier, those who are on the fence, this will push them over.

In the first launch, like at the first phase of launch before we've made savings card and experienced supply spot outages, type 2 diabetes patients to Mounjaro did have better persistency than Trulicity, which is important because Trulicity historically has had the best compliance in the diabetes market.

So RTP is now live and producing for commercial purposes, and it's on line, in line with our expectations. So there are no delays. It's progressing as we had expected. I'm incredibly proud of the work that the manufacturing team have done to get us to this point. As Mike alluded, there will be a gradual increase in available capacity coming out of that site. We've mentioned in the past, it's a large site with multiple lines. They'll come online gradually and provide more products into the marketplace. As we think about 2024, I suggest we step back and look comprehensively at our manufacturing agenda and capacity plans. So RTP is one side. It's obviously of high interest just because of the proximal nature, and that's the first one that's launched out of the number of sites we have under construction. In parallel, we have been working and continue to work to expand capacity in existing sites. We're working with partners and CMOs to supplement capacity. And our strategy is, first and foremost, to have an internal build but then we supplement externally as needed. But we're also progressing with -- rapidly with our site in North -- the second site, North Carolina in Concord, which you recall we've announced last year. And that could potentially go live in terms of production in the second half of 2024, again, gradually. So we will see some relief of supply at the end of -- or towards the end of next year and then continue to grow from there. And as you know, this is -- these are not the only 2 nodes of capacity. We're also adding outside of incretin and for incretin, API capacity in Ireland as well as 2 large sites in Indiana. So we're expanding capacity broadly to support both the incretin portfolio but then the broader Lilly portfolio, and managing a broad set of networks outside of Lilly. So a complex manufacturing set of nodes that we're working towards. We'll comment on -- specifically on 2024 when we provide guidance in terms of what you should expect in revenue. But this is how you should think about the gradual increase in supply with both RTP, internal capacity elsewhere as well as CMOs. The additional presentation is meant to provide options for patients. And as we've said, we'll start launching outside the U.S. with these presentations will -- which should provide additional capacity as well. And as I stated earlier, the manufacturing facilities in line already exists within Lilly for, for example, the vial production. We have those facilities. We don't need to construct new ones.

Actually, of course, we expect tirzepatide to show a very important benefit, I think, on the MMO study. There are several important differences as you're alluding to. I think for the most part, though, they run in the opposite direction as you're suggesting, which would indicate a potential for an even larger effect size for SURMOUNT MMO. The most important difference is the drug itself. Remember that tirzepatide is a GLP/GIP coagonist, and GIP has some very significant benefits on weight loss and metabolic health overall. We've seen that in a number of different trials and confirm that with some interesting experiments on GIP monotherapy as well. So given the properties of this drug, given the level of weight loss we've seen in previous trials, given the important effects on blood pressure, on lipid profiles and on other biomarkers that indicate lower cardiovascular risk, we should be very confident in the large effect size coming out of the MMO study. There are some differences in the population. Our study includes both primary and secondary cardiovascular risk population. We also have a different primary end point, although, of course, we have the MACE as a secondary end point. Our primary includes 2 other events related to cardiovascular risk. Other than that, I would say that many of the patient characteristics are going to be quite similar. Our study is obviously much earlier. And as an event-driven study, it's going to take some time to read out.

Of course, there's been more attention on liver safety for orforglipron following the competitor announcement from Pfizer on 1 of their 2 oral GLP-1s. So we don't see any read-through from that. But of course, we've looked very carefully at liver safety. Maybe just starting at a high level, if you look at the supplementary data from the journal publication or you can see in the obese population that in terms of group averages, there's actually an improvement on liver enzymes with treatment of orforglipron. That's not surprising. We know that disease obesity is characterized in many patients by excess liver fat, which can cause inflammation and liver abnormalities. And when you reverse that, you see an improvement in liver function. Of course, when people come off the drug, they could get fat in their liver again and liver enzymes could go up. What we saw in this trial were a couple of patients scattered across arms, including placebo with excursions and liver enzymes, as you point out to -- I think there was one patient, with a bit of a higher excursion in liver enzymes on orforglipron that returned to normal levels while maintaining on therapy. That's generally not a pattern that we see in drugs that cause liver injury. But surely in Phase III, we'll keep an eye open for all possible safety consequences. I think I frequently caution investors on all of our molecules that Phase III is really the place where you can get surprised by any new safety findings. So we'll be watching liver safety closely, but not with any particularly heightened concern versus other adverse events that we'll also be watching carefully. This is a new molecule. This is the first time that we're exposing large, large numbers of patients to it for many years -- or many, many months, I should say, and we'll be monitoring safety carefully.",329.0,156.0,2.0,7.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.04487179487179487,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.0,-0.03205128205128205

We think we understand how the biomarkers from incretin therapy translate into cardiovascular benefits. Some of those biomarkers should be translatable to other mechanisms. But depending on how orthogonal those other mechanisms are, there could still be some uncertainty. One, I think, important understanding, though, is that obesity itself, including, I think, particularly where the fat is deposited in the body, so for example, virtual fat, particularly, is -- contributes to adverse health outcomes, including adverse cardiovascular outcomes. And therefore, reversing that should provide cardiovascular benefits across mechanisms. But obviously, when we get to orthogonal mechanisms, each one will need its own data to demonstrate that. Recently, our focus has been on mechanisms that could stack on top of incretin therapy to give additional benefits in which case there could be a good read-through from the incretin trough.

I mean, first of all, we need to build a long-term clinical and real-world evidence to support payers' decisions, and we're doing that. We're spending literally billions of dollars in clinical evidence to show what tirzepatide and our pipeline can offer patients who have obesity and payers with regards to medical cost savings. We're confident in our modeling that payers will see medical cost offset with tirzepatide. And so I think that will be an important piece of it. I think the other dynamic is a lot of times, we focus on the clinical story. But there is things beyond the economic analysis that I think will play a role. If you go and really discuss with people who live with obesity, improving their health is a top personal goal. Sadly, when we look at the data, 82% people live with obesity experience physical functioning reductions, while 77% experience reduced mental, emotional well-being. Patients using tirzepatide showed significant improvements in physical, mental and emotional well-being in the SURMOUNT-1 trial. And it's clear from the patient testimonies that we had in our SURMOUNT clinical trials that tirzepatide can meaningfully improve the lives of people with obesity. The massive interest that we see in obesity medications is really driven by the fundamental desire for people living with obesity to improve their health. People live with obesity should have a loud and powerful voice in this debate. And I think that's going to be a big component of payer decisions, whether that be an employer or be state or federal government. And so I think what you're going to see is over time, you're going to see data like the SELECT data, data like MMO or other clinical trials, continuing to build the case on economic side for these. While you're going to see the voice of people living with obesity who really want a better life, more hope for the future, who will be demanding access for these agents.

We really believe that we are positioned to launch a first-line biologic that actually has less frequent dosing than Dupixent.

I mean, just as we think about this over the long term, first of all, versus where we started the year, there is one change we're talking about today, which are these new presentations that we'll be launching beginning even this year into next year. It's important for people to know that the constraint we experience now is in the parenteral auto-injector space. So to the degree we move outside of that, using our multi-dose pen that's currently developed for insulin and we're redeveloping for tirzepatide or certainly the vial, which is quite accessible and high-volume systems available, we'll be able to make more than we had planned previously, just to be clear. That's on top of sort of an on-schedule expansion at RTP in the other North Carolina site as well as other internal nodes of capacity. So I think that's good news for Mounjaro. That all said, for the prior questions here, will that be enough to meet demand? I'm not so sure. So while the volume is moving up into the right, we need more. And does like today's news, will only expand the opportunity. So you're right to point out that other molecules, in orforglipron in particular, could play a big role in meeting global demand for obesity treatment and all the related complications because it's a completely different technology in that it's using oral solid, and there's quite a bit of capacity around the globe for that. Orforglipron is a complicated molecule to make. It's got many steps. But it puts us in using a different set of assets and processes than the current ones we're using. So that's an important program, particularly for global access and availability over the long term. Just to remember as well, 2 years ago, we were probably treating 10 million people globally with incretins. And the WHO is estimating there'll be 1 billion people with obesity and related conditions by 2050, I believe. So a long way away from getting all the way to that.

So if we -- I think you were referring to the Part D redesign associated with removing the coverage gap, but I'll also mention the negotiation. I wouldn't necessarily look at what the dollar amount is. But rather, you're right, there are going to be varying degrees of impact on products based on how quickly they move through the catastrophic phase. So just to give an example from Lilly. If you're thinking about an oncology product where patients get to the catastrophic phase very quickly, there is probably an additional cost associated with that for us moving from the previous 70% coverage gap to the 10% participation in the initial phase and then 20% in the catastrophic phase. For other indications, it might be the opposite. So there is a mix there. But then important to think about the fact that given that patients are now going to have a limit of out-of-pocket when they get to the pharmacy counter, hopefully, that should improve adherence and compliance to medications, which should drive, obviously, better health outcomes for these patients, but also as we're thinking about medication kind of adherence. So there's going to be some pushes and pulls of that part of the IRA.

TRx is sort of a lagging indicator, of course, that takes into account iterations of therapy. But what we're seeing on the NBRx side is about, call it, between 30% and 45% of prescriptions are in early breast cancer versus metastatic. And obviously, that number bounces around sort of week-to-week, month-to-month. So that's more or less in line with what we expected. So that's what's happening there. On the competitive dynamics in the adjuvant setting, now that we've seen the NATALEE data from Kisqali at ASCO, which by the way, were not really surprising to us, I think when you take a step back, and this is sort of both our opinion as well as what we've heard from thought leaders, we just really don't see what the Kisqali 3-year regimen is giving to patients to justify the additional year of therapy relative to the 2-year regimen that we've offered patients with Verzenio. Obviously, cross-trial comparisons notwithstanding, if anything, you see a marginally larger effect size with the 2-year Verzenio regimen in high-risk patients, obviously, the NATALEE study studied a larger population. The node-negative patients are at lower risk and frankly, not part of our indication. We didn't study those patients. I think to the extent that folks want to use Kisqali there, that's not really our business. Maybe it could be beneficial for those patients, I can't really say. I think the other thing, and Dan mentioned this in the prepared remarks, is that there's been a lot of talk in the past, of course, about the differences in the tolerability of these two agents. And I think one of the things that perhaps was somewhat surprising in the data we saw at ASCO with the high rate of discontinuations for toxicity of Kisqali, especially with many patients still on therapy. So that number, of course, will go up with more follow-up. So I think these 2 drugs, while they have different tolerability profiles in terms of what the side effects are, they actually have somewhat similar overall tolerance profiles. And importantly, the Verzenio tolerability can actually be managed with dose reductions without sacrificing efficacy. It's not clear that the same is true for Kisqali given the nature of those adverse events.

We delivered strong financial results continue to advance our R&D pipeline and invested in our future through several business development transactions.  As you can see on slide 4, we continue to make progress against our strategic deliverables this quarter. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, and COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 24%. Our new products and growth products combined contributed approximately 17 percentage points toward volume growth, with over 12 percentage points coming from our growth products.  Last week, we announced that the FDA approved Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults. This marks Lilly's first approval in the U.S. for a type of inflammatory bowel disease. And it's important for Lilly's growth in its immunology portfolio. In addition to the FDA approval for Omvoh, we had several other important pipeline updates since our last earnings call.  Specifically Jardiance was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease, at risk of progression. And we reported positive Phase 3 results from the VIVID-1 trial which evaluated the safety and efficacy of mirikizumab for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.  In Q3, we announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for lebrikizumab based on inspection findings at a third party manufacturer. The letter stated no concerns with the clinical data package, the safety or the label. We will continue to work with the third party manufacturer and the FDA to address the findings to make lebrikizumab available to patients as quickly as possible.  In terms of business development, we once again had a very active quarter. In Q3, we completed the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio, which will further enable us to focus on our current and new product launches. The financial impact of this transaction is reflected in the Q3 results. Additionally, within the quarter, we completed the acquisition of two clinical stage companies, adding to our Phase 2 portfolio, DICE Therapeutics and Versanis Bio as well as the acquisition of Emergence Therapeutics and Sigilon Therapeutics. We also announced that we reached an agreement to acquire POINT Biopharma, which, if approved, has the potential to expand our oncology capabilities into next generation radioligand therapies. And lastly, we distributed over a $1 billion in dividends this quarter.  On slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q2 call, including several important regulatory clinical and other updates we're sharing today.  Now let me turn the call over Anat to review our Q3 results.",434.0,228.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.021929824561403508,0.021929824561403508,0.013157894736842105,0.0043859649122807015,0.0,0.0

I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance.  We're pleased with the strong financial performance this quarter, highlighted by continued acceleration of revenue growth, representing robust momentum in our core business. Q3 revenue increased 37% versus Q3 2022. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and from the COVID-19 antibodies, revenue increased 24% in Q3. This represents a quarter-over-quarter acceleration of revenue growth, driven by Mounjaro and the continued strong performance of Verzenio and Jardiance.  Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 81.7%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio, the absence of COVID-19 antibody sales in Q3 2023, and higher realized prices partially offset by increases in manufacturing expenses. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12%, primarily driven by higher expenses associated with new product launches and additional indications, as well as compensation and benefit costs. R&D expenses increased 34%, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late stage assets and additional investments in early stage research.  This quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&D charges of $2.98 billion, which negatively impacted EPS by $3.29. In Q3, 2022, acquired IP R&D charges totaled $62 million, or $0.06 of EPS. Operating income decreased 71% in Q3, driven by acquired IP R&D charges, partially offset by higher revenue associated with the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio.  Operating income as a percent of revenue was approximately 6% for the quarter, and reflected a negative impact of approximately 31 percentage point attributable to acquired IP R&D charges. Our q3 effective tax rate was 84.6%. This represents an increase of approximately 74 percentage points compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the non-deductible acquired IP R&D charges incurred this quarter.  Other than the impact of acquired IP R&D, the underlying tax rate was consistent with previously providing guidance. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $0.10 in Q3, a 95% decrease versus Q3 2022, inclusive of an increase of $1.22 of EPS associated with the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio and a negative impact of $3.29 from the acquired IP R&D charges.  On slide 8, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume and revenue growth. This quarter U.S. revenue increased 21%. When excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and COVID-19 antibodies, U.S. revenue grew 32% driven by robust growth of Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. Net price in the U.S. increased 13% for the quarter driven by Mounjaro, access and savings cards dynamics.  Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the U.S. decreased by high single digits. As mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected Mounjaro access and saving card dynamics to have a meaningful impact on reported U.S. price changes in the second half of 2023, which was evident in Q3. Europe continued to post robust growth against this again this quarter. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine divestiture, revenue was up 7% in constant currency driven by volume growth of 11% primarily from Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz.  For Japan, Q3 revenue decreased 16% in constant currency. Excluding Mounjaro, which had a one time upfront payment associated with the sales collaboration agreement in the base period, revenue in Japan decreased 3% in constant currency, driven primarily by customer buying patterns related to [indiscernible]. Moving to China revenue increased 20% in constant currency with volume growth of 25% partially offset by price decline. Volume growth in Q3 was driven by Tyvyt and Verzenio. We're encouraged by the growth we have seen this year in China.  Revenue in the rest of the world increased 23% in constant currency, as volume growth of 28% was driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance.  Slide 9 shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you can see the new product and growth product categories combined, contributed approximately 17 percentage points of rolling growth for the quarter. The absence of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies compared to the base period was a headwind of nearly six percentage points to volume in Q3. This headwind will abate as COVID-19 antibody sales were minimal after the third quarter of 2022.  Lastly, revenue from the sales of rights to the olanzapine portfolio delivered nearly 22 percentage points of growth this quarter.  Slide 10 provides additional perspective across our product categories. First, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 68% in Q3, driven by robust volume growth. The continued positive momentum is driven by the early breast cancer indication with steady performance in the metastatic indication. Jardiance continued its strong 2023 performance with worldwide revenue growth of 22% for the quarter. As you heard earlier in Q3 Jardiance was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.  In Q3 we saw worldwide Trulicity revenue decline 10% as volume growth in the U.S. was more than offset by lower prices driven by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts in both periods, as well as unfavorable segment mix and higher contracted rebates. In international markets, Trulicity volume continues to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to healthcare professionals, now [ph] to start new patients on Trulicity.  Moving to slide 11, we continue to be pleased with the strong performance of Mounjaro, as more type 2 diabetes patients benefit from the medicine. Mounjaro revenue grew to just over $1.4 billion globally this quarter, up from $980 million the previous quarter. In Q3, we continued to make progress in expanding access to Mounjaro. As of October 1 access for patients with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. reached 78% in aggregate across commercial and Part D, including 85% access for commercial patients. This expanded access gives more patients the opportunity to start therapy on Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes.  As communicated last quarter, since the $25 non-covered copay card program expires on June 30, we now consider all prescriptions paid. As a reminder we define paid scripts as those prescriptions outside of the $25 non-covered copay card, but inclusive of the $25 covered copay card. We expect Mounjaro net price will continue to benefit from the higher percentage of paid prescription, but will also continue to face a headwind for more rebated volume as access improves.  Looking forward to the end of the year with increased access we expect to continue to see overall growth in prescription trends. In terms of Mounjaro supply, we're continuing to make progress in our manufacturing expansion agenda. Given strong demand, we continue to experience tight supply throughout most of Q3, which impacted results for the quarter. Most recently U.S. product shipments have increased and inventory levels at U.S. wholesalers have improved with all doses of Mounjaro now listed as available on the FDA shortage website.  While supply constraints have eased in the U.S., outside the U.S. Trulicity and -- outside the U.S. to Trulicity and Mounjaro supply remains tight, which materially impacted performance in these regions. With device assembly online at RTP, we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling capacity by the end of this year from where we were a year ago, and are gradually increasing production each quarter.  We're also continuing to focus on other parts of the supply chain, as demand is expected to remain high and production bottlenecks may shift over time. As we mentioned in last quarter's earnings call, we are moving forward with different presentation of Mounjaro to reach more patients around the world faster. We have launched with a single dose vial in Australia, and plan to launch in other markets outside the U.S. in the coming weeks and months.  The introduction of a single dose vial presentation in these geographies is intended to serve as a bridge to a multi-dose quick pen, which we expect will be available starting in 2024. We're also preparing for potential launch of tirzepatide for obesity in the U.S. this year. Our auto injector capacity and output continues to increase. And we look forward to bring tirzepatide to more patients in the months and years ahead.  On slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first nine months of 2023, we invested nearly $12 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, capital investments and business development outlays. In addition, we've returned nearly $4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.  Slide 13 presents our updated 2023 financial guidance. Guidance for the first four line items including revenue, gross margin percent, marketing and selling and administrative expenses and R&D expense is unchanged. I would note that we are trending towards the higher end of our estimates for gross margin and the top end of our ranges for operating expense categories. You'll see that we've updated guidance for acquired IP R&D charges, OID, tax rate EPS, to reflect the inclusion of IP R&D charges for completed transactions through Q3, and year-to-date results on equity investments and GAAP guidance. These updates do not include the effect of potential charges associated with pending or future business development transactions after Q3. We will provide our initial 2024 guidance when we report Q4 results.  Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.",1539.0,815.0,18.0,16.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,0.022085889570552148,0.0196319018404908,0.013496932515337423,0.001226993865030675,0.001226993865030675,0.00245398773006135

This quarter, we had significant pipeline progress as well as a high volume of activity at the major medical congresses, where we presented new data on multiple products across all of our therapeutic areas.  Starting with oncology, since our last earnings call, we announced top line results from the LIBRETTO-531 study evaluating Retevmo versus physicians' choice of multi kinase inhibitors as an initial treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer. As we presented at ESMO the study met its primary endpoint demonstrating a 72% improvement in progression-free survival compared to Cabozantinib or Vandetanib. These data should establish Retevmo as the standard of care for the initial systemic treatment of patients with progressive advanced RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer, and we have work to do to ensure that all of these patients are identified and properly diagnosed.  We also shared detailed data from the Phase 3 LIBRETTO-431 study at ESMO in October, showing that Retevmo more than doubled progression free survival compared to chemotherapy plus Pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic RET fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer. We hope these data in addition to others recently published, for other driver positive lung cancers will help accelerate genomic profiling at lung cancer diagnosis to guide initial treatment selection.  The results of LIBRETTO-531 and of LIBRETTO-431 were each simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Also at ESMO we should landmark five year results from a pre-planned interim analysis of the Phase 3 monarchE study, evaluating Verzenio in combination with endocrine therapy, compared to endocrine therapy alone, in patients with HR positive HER2 negative no positive early breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. The impact of two years of Verzenio treatment is observed well beyond the treatment period, reducing the risk of long term recurrence by 32% at five years.  These data reinforced two years of Verzenio plus endocrine therapy as the standard of care for high risk early breast cancer patients. Lastly, we shared data on imlunestrant, our oral SERD being studied in Phase 3 as a single agent and in combination therapy. The data shared included the first clinical data for imlunestrant in combination with everolimus or alpelisib as well as updated monotherapy from the Phase 1 EMBER study in patients with ER positive HER2 negative advanced breast cancer.  We hope that imlunestrant could be an important future endocrine therapy backbone, in certain settings of breast cancer. And these new data show that the medicine can be safely combined with other agents utilized with endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer.  Looking earlier in oncology pipeline, we shared preclinical data on three of our new pipeline agents at the triple meeting on molecular targets in cancer therapeutics in October. We shared preclinical data for first, a highly potent inhibitor of KRAS G12D, that is selective against wild type KRAS. Second, a highly potent and isoform selective pan-KRAS inhibitor, with activity against a broad spectrum of the most common activating KRAS mutations, and high selectivity of a wild type H RES and N RES. And third, a fully human monoclonal anti-Nectin-4 antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase I inhibitor.  These programs are among the next slate of oncology agents we expect to enter the clinic over the next year. They represent years of focused work to create potentially differentiated molecules against exacting target product profiles.  Turning to our diabetes and obesity portfolio, in Q3, we announced the FDA approval of Jardiance for treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression. In the EMPA-KIDNEY Phase 3 trial Jardiance significantly reduced the risk of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular deaths in adults with CKD. This approval adds to the treatment options for the more than 35 million adults in the U.S. affected by chronic kidney disease.  Since our last earnings call, we presented detailed results from the SURMOUNT-3 Phase 3 clinical trial at the obesity weight conference in October, with the results simultaneously published in Nature Medicine. Also in October, we presented detailed results from the SURMOUNT-4 study at EASD. These results will be subsequently published in a top tier peer reviewed medical journal.  Data from these Phase 3 trials of tirzepatide showed that participants achieved up to 26.6% total mean weight loss. The detailed results from these studies clearly show the importance of continued therapy for sustained weight management, and that if approved, tirzepatide could be an important part of obesity management, for those having difficulty maintaining weight loss with diet and exercise alone.  Our pipeline, as shown on slide 14, now includes a high dose tirzepatide NILEX in Phase 2, since we have initiated a study exploring higher doses of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Earlier in the pipeline, we presented Phase 1 data on Muvalaplin at the European Society of Cardiology Congress with simultaneous publication in JAMA [ph]. Muvalaplin is the first oral agent specifically developed to lower Lp(a) levels. In this Phase 1 study Muvalaplin was well tolerated by participants and resulted in dose dependent lowering of Lp(a) of up to 65%. Muvalaplin is currently in Phase 2.  As shown on slide 14, we've advanced our SCAP siRNA into Phase 1 for NASH. We've also completed our acquisition of Versanis and NASH Bimagrumab [ph] in Phase 2. We are excited about the potential combination of Bimagrumab and tirzepatide.  Lastly, we're happy to share that since our last earnings call the Retatrutide TRIUMPH Phase 3 core registration trials are now all actively enrolling to pursue simultaneous indications for chronic weight management, obstructive sleep apnea, and knee osteoarthritis.  Turning to our neuroscience portfolio, the FDA has shared with us that the Donanemab review will extend into Q1 2024 needing additional time to complete their review. We've completed submissions in Europe and Japan, and submissions to other global regulatory authorities are either completed or underway. Recently, at the clinical trials on Alzheimer's disease meeting, we presented new insights from donanemab development program during a symposium session.  As part of this symposium, we shared ARIA data from a pooled analysis that included more than 2000 participants dosed with donanemab, and explored ARIA E association across a number of baseline variables, highlighting a few key factors most strongly associated with ARIA risk, including baseline amyloid levels, evidence of a prior bleed and high blood pressure. Interestingly, this data also suggested use of antihypertensives decreased the risk of ARIA.  Additionally, we shared analyses from our open label addendum of over 1,000 patients treated with donanemab. These results included a post hoc analysis of patients with no brain tau, and demonstrated similar or even stronger biomarker results than our main TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study. In a separate post hoc analysis from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase 3 study, related to activities of daily living and independence, in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease we showed that compared to placebo, people treated with donanemab preserved more of their ability to perform many of the items measured, including their ability to make meals, to use appliances, keep appointments, perform pastimes, and be safely left unattended.  We also shared an update on our validation data for our Plasma P tau 217 test for identifying amyloid positive patients demonstrating robust performance of this immunoassay. We expect to have this test commercially available in a phased approach first, as a laboratory developed test by the end of this year.  As you recall, we use Plasma P tau 207 to identify pre symptomatic individuals for our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 trial. This is an event driven trial and we have now recruited a sufficient number of qualifying pre-symptomatic participants and expect to have efficacy results within three years. We're excited to announce today that our Otoferlin Gene therapy asset from Akouos has begun dosing patients in a Phase 1/2 trial for hearing loss.  In immunology, as Dave noted, we're happy to have FDA approval for Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults. This approval offers new hope for patients, who are searching for an effective option that can offer rapid and lasting improvements. Omvoh will be approved --available to patients in the U.S. in the coming weeks. We were also excited to have the Phase 3 readout for this molecule, mirikizumab in Crohn's disease. In the VIVID 1 Phase 3 study mirikizumab met the co-primary in all major secondary endpoints compared to placebo. Mirikizumab demonstrated clinical remission and endoscopic response for patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease through 52 weeks. We were thrilled to see that more than half of participants on mirikizumab achieved clinical remission at one year, and that robust efficacy was seen in both participants who are naive to biologic therapy, as well as participants who previously failed a prior biologic therapy.  Helping patients achieve long term clinical remission is a key goal for us in our pursuit of treatments for inflammatory bowel disease. These new data in Crohn's Disease build on the high levels of long term remission seen with mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis, and help reinforce the differentiation of this important potential medicine. This successful Phase 3 trial will be the basis of global regulatory submissions for Crohn's Disease.  As Dave noted earlier in Q3, we announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter for lebrikizumab, based on findings at a third party manufacturer. In Q3 we completed the acquisition of DICE and now reflect the two oral IL-17 assets, DICE 853 and DICE 806 in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of our pipeline respectively. Additionally, two new molecules began Phase 2 studies in immunology this quarter. First, our CD200R monoclonal antibody, known as Ucenprubart for atopic dermatitis, and second, our RIPK1 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis.  We've removed our BTLA monoclonal antibody agonist from Phase 2 in our pipeline, after the Phase 2a study failed to demonstrate efficacy. Q3 was another productive quarter for R&D at Lilly.  I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.",1652.0,902.0,19.0,15.0,12.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,0.02106430155210643,0.01662971175166297,0.013303769401330377,0.0022172949002217295,0.0011086474501108647,0.004434589800443459

This quarter revenue growth accelerated as our recently launched product portfolio continued to gain momentum, of course led by Mounjaro. Excluding revenue from the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio and the sale of COVID-19 antibodies in 2022, revenue grew 24%, driven again by Mounjaro, Verzenio as well as Jardiance.  By continuing to invest in recent and upcoming launches, late stage medicines and early phase capabilities as well as in business development, we are confident that we have positioned ourselves for growth now and in the coming years, with the opportunity for continued margin expansion. We achieved meaningful advances in our late stage pipeline, with the FDA approval of Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, as well as Jardiance for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease, and the positive Phase 3 VIVID 1 results for mirikizumab for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.  Looking forward, we are expecting regulatory responses before the end of the year on our submissions for pirtobrutinib, and accelerated approval in CLL as well as tirzepatide for obesity. In Q3, we completed several targeted acquisitions, intended to bolster our early and mid stage portfolio. Directly following the quarter we also announced an agreement to acquire POINT Biopharma which will further expand our R&D capabilities in oncology.  Lastly, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders via the dividend. A few weeks ago, we announced several leadership changes. Mike Mason, our Executive Vice President and President of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity will retire from the company at the end of 2023 after 34 years with Lilly. In his current role, Mike is overseeing tirzepatide, late stage development and an unprecedented type 2 diabetes launch. Mike leaves behind an enduring legacy that reflects his deep compassion for patients and his commitment to our people. With this being Mike's last earnings call, I would like to thank him for his many years of outstanding service to Lily and wish him all the best in his next chapter of life.  Patrick Johnson will assume leadership of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity. In addition to his current responsibilities as President of Lilly USA Dan Skovronsk, our Chief Scientific Officer and president of Lilly Research Labs will take on the additional role of President of Lilly Immunology from Patrick.

I have a question on obesity and persistence on therapy, which I think has been a big question mark. I know you haven't formally launched yet, but guessing you might have some idea, a best guess if nothing else. So in your view is this going to be like most other drug categories where persistence on therapy is often low? I think the rule of thumb is that at the one year mark 50% of patients drop off chronic medicines.  So really, the question is, if you took 100 patients who start on one of these contemporary obesity drugs, how many of that initial 100 would likely still be on therapy, let's say three or four or five years down the road.",125.0,63.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.07936507936507936,0.015873015873015872,0.0,0.0,-0.06349206349206349

Maybe I'll first answer with the data that we do have, because it's hard to speculate on what it's going to be for obesity. The best data we have for tirzepatide is in Type 2 diabetes patients who started Mounjaro prior to our savings card changes last fall Mounjaro persistency for those patients is tracking higher than those patients that were started on trulicity and Ozempic, over that same period of time.  So while it's too early to project the average length of therapy or how many out of 100 will still be on therapy after a couple of years, I think that this early data is encouraging. As for obesity, time was time was going to tell. I think we've all looked at Wegovy data, but I don't think this is the right benchmark at this point because of novel supply constraints. And there's been just a very dynamic market. I think, as you said, this -- having persistency on a chronic treatment isn't just an issue for anti-obesity medications. It's a goal for all chronic treatments.  I think what's different about obesity is that, on many chronic treatments, consumers don't feel differently or experience any acute impacts from stopping treatments. So what we've seen in this SURMOUNT clinical trials, with tirzepatide is that some consumers will feel their appetite increase and experience weight regain when they stopped tirzepatide. And so this should help reinforce treatment adherence, seeing in our market research how important it is for people who live with obesity to lose weight and maintain it.  I do think you're going to see just a high motivation as people have lost weight that they do want to maintain it. And we do know for our SURMOUNT program that, chronic use of tirzepatide is a good component, an important component of maintaining weight loss. So it's too early to project it. But I do think there's things that's rolling in favor of tirzepatide having a good length of therapy in the obesity patient.",354.0,152.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.03289473684210526,0.039473684210526314,0.013157894736842105,0.0,0.006578947368421052,-0.006578947368421052

Yeah, I like the way you phrase it all hands on deck moving forward on orforglipron. We're really excited about this molecule. In terms of, liver safety, I think we commented before that, what we saw in Phase 2 is what we thought would be probably be typical for a trial of that nature in this population.  So not a heightened level of concern, but always concerned about safety going into Phase 3 from a variety of factors, including for all small molecules, especially liver function. So it's routine in our Phase 3 studies across the portfolio to monitor liver function. And sure we're doing that in orforglipron, but not aware of any special precautions there.

You're citing the announcements we've made and as mentioned great progress is showing manufacturing agenda RTP sort of on track to deliver on its goal. But as we exit the year, and then that kind of in market volume following that Concord, which is a few hours away, and kind of a replica site also, well on track for coming online in '24. So that's good news in the ERMA [ph] presentation, which is -- what we call our auto injector, from trulicity, and the current presentation from Mounjaro in the U.S. We've announced previously that we're introducing now single use vial presentation ex-U.S., so that we aren't basically sitting on approvals and connect patients have access to the medication.  That will follow them by a multi use injector that uses different property, plant and equipment than what we're talking about here. So a couple of things to point out. You're noting kind of new greenfield site expansions. We've rightfully made a big deal out of. We're not done with those. I think you might hear more about that in the future. Of course, we are aggressively planning that and not banking on or forced upon to rescue us from this. We think that there is a need to take up parenteral incretin supply pretty dramatically from the current levels. And we plan to do that.  But that will be in a combination of the current syringe-based auto injector, the vial capacity, we've already talked about. The multi use injector, which will come online sometime next year, and is a highly efficient play for us because it uses current systems and different ones from the auto injector. And then there's third party agreements that have been ongoing in the background. And to point out here, we are not relying on one. We have a diverse portfolio of third parties, recognizing that, the probability of full supply from any one is probably less than one. But buying up as much capacity as available in all those systems.  So we've got a, I think the all hands on deck phrase was used earlier. I mean, this is really all hands on deck. And it's a problem we work every day. So we're not at all happy with the capacity. We've announced already, you'll see more. Some we don't announce that we'll just layer in to the volume we ship. And of course, long term new presentations like solid oral opens up even more possibilities, but we need to do everything we can now given the huge potential for global obesity treatment for our medicines to play a key role in that, and then ultimately impact hundreds of millions of people.  So a lot of work to do here yet ahead.

We think it's the right thing to do. And as we think about the growth in incretin, we're looking as we build up capacity, as David mentioned.  As we increase capacity both in the single use vial and introduce Mounjaro in additional markets as we have in Australia and we will continue over the next number of weeks and months in other markets and then transition towards a multi-use platform in quick time in introducing Mounjaro.

One that we've obviously spent a ton of time on and done a lot of internal analysis and a lot of planning on. We will have a whole suite of real world evidence and pragmatic trials so that we can answer this question clearly, for payers and other stakeholders. In our conversations with payers, while they're concerned about the short term budget impact, they do understand that losing weight will have benefits. It's not that hard of a sale, because they do understand the benefits are intuitive.  If you look at the total number of like obesity rate of complications, there's over 200. And you look at some of these are just really devastating and very costly, like type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia. And then when you look at the cost of these, on the U.S. alone, there's $370 billion in direct medical costs associated with obesity-related comorbidities, and over a trillion in indirect annual cost. When payers see that, people living with obesity and overweight, drive 2.7 times greater healthcare costs, than normal individuals, that data does get their attention.  And so I think over time will continue to provide health economics data, but also I think the voice of those living with obesity will be very important in this. This is a disease that, that really materially impacts someone's both health and mental functioning. And is really important for people who live with obesity. Their goal is to is to lose weight and maintain that so they can help their long term health benefits. And they're going to have a loud voice in this. I think both in commercial insurance as well as in states and the federal government. And so I do -- I am confident over time that we will see increase in access.  I think the most recent report shows that there's 50 million people in the U.S. that has access to obesity medication. So it will take time, but I think -- do think more and more payers are appreciating the value that anti-obesity medications especially when we get approval for tirzepatide will offer them.

What's next, and you see here today advancing another checkpoint agonist into Phase 2 is a lot of decisions about, okay, what's next to take immunology to the next level.

I, of course, say we have now I think more data on GLP agonism than anyone in the world and starting with tirzepatide, of course, which is a combo GLP1 GIP agonist and the head to head study against a pure GLP1 agonist and you can see some profoundly different effects here looking at, for example, efficacy relative to tolerability. It looks like the GIP is boosting efficacy while also reducing the side effects that limit tolerability. So that was our initial evidence in human trials that involved well now tens of thousands of patients have been on tirzepatide in trials.  And then we went out to sort of prove this point by creating a pure GIP 1 agonist that just agonizes GIP to see what that could do alone. And again we saw a very highly tolerated drug consistent with what we understand about the mechanism of GIP 1 that probably could suppress actually nausea, vomiting that lead to weight loss. So, I think human data trumps everything here, and we've got a ton of that. So we're pretty excited about gap agonism.

We progressed our pipeline. It advanced our external innovation agenda through partnerships and collaborations. We continue to invest in quality, the reliability and the resilience of our company's manufacturing infrastructure, and most importantly, delivered new life-saving and life-changing medicines to more patients. In 2023, revenue grew 20% for the full year and 28% for the most recent quarter, as our newly launched portfolio continued to gain momentum. This past year, we announced positive Phase IIIs for Donanemab, Tirzepatide, Mirikizumab And Pertibrutinib. We also announced a positive Phase II result for Orforglipron as well as Retatrutide and moved these two important molecules into Phase III. In terms of external innovation, in 2023, we continued to complement our pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations. These transactions included the acquisition of DICE Therapeutics, POINT Biopharma, Versanis Bio, Emergence Therapeutics, Mablink Biosciences, Immunotrac as well as Sigilon Therapeutics. We have several significant investments in manufacturing, including plans to expand capacity at the company's Research Triangle Park facility and the two manufacturing sites within the LEAP Innovation Park in Boone County, Indiana. Most recently, we announced plans to construct a new high-tech manufacturing site in Germany. This facility will further expand the company's global injectable product and device manufacturing network, including for our diabetes and obesity portfolio. Most importantly, this past year, we brought innovative new medicines to patients. In 2023, we received regulatory approvals for Zepbound, Jaypirca, Omvoh, in the U.S. -- in the EU rather, and an expanded label for Verzenio and two new indications for Jardiance. This progress will serve as a foundation to drive top-tier revenue growth and margin expansion over time. As you can see on Slide 4, we continue to make progress against our strategic deliverables in Q4. Revenue grew 28% with our new products growing by over $2 billion. Since our last earnings call, we achieved several key pipeline milestones in addition to the Zepbound and Jaypirca CLL approvals, today, we announced top line results for the Tirzepatide Phase II SYNERGY-NASH trial as well as the Verzenio Phase III CYCLONE two trial. Dan will talk more about this update -- in his update. In terms of business development, in Q4, we completed the acquisitions of Mablink Bioscience and POINT Biopharma, the latter of which expands our capacity and capability into Radioligand therapies. Lastly, we announced a 15% dividend increase for the sixth consecutive year and distributed over $1 billion in dividends in the fourth quarter.

Slide six summarizes financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2023, and I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. We are pleased with the strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our performance was highlighted by continued acceleration of revenue growth, driven by our new products and growth products. Q4 revenue increased 28% compared to Q4 2022. Excluding divestiture, this represents a quarter-over-quarter acceleration revenue growth driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance and the recent launch of Zepbound. For the full year, revenue increased 20% driven by robust volume growth of 16%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 82.3%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from higher realized prices, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 17%, primarily driven by higher expenses associated with launches of new products and additional indications as well as higher incentive compensation costs. R&D expenses increased 28%, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research as well as higher incentive compensation costs. In Q4, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $623 million, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.62. In Q4 2022, acquired IPR&D charges totaled $240 million or $0.23 negative impact to EPS. Operating income increased 29% in Q4, driven by higher revenue from new launches, partially offset by operating expense growth. Operating income as a percent of revenue was approximately 28% for the quarter and included a negative impact of approximately seven percentage points attributable to acquired IPR&D charges. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 13.1% compared to 7.3% in Q4 2022. The higher effective tax rate for Q4 2023 was primarily driven by a lower net discrete tax benefit compared to the same period in 2022 and the new Puerto Rico tax regime. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $2.49 in Q4, a 19% increase compared to Q4 2022, inclusive of the negative impact of $0.62 from acquired IPR&D charges compared to $0.23 in Q4 2022. On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 39% in Q4, driven by robust growth of Mounjaro, Verzenio and Zepbound. Net price in the U.S. increased 27% for the quarter, driven by Mounjaro access and savings cards dynamic as well as the onetime favorable change in estimates for rebates and discounts. Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the U.S. decreased by high single digits. Europe continued its trend of strong growth in Q4. Excluding $65 million in revenue associated with milestones received for the EU approval and launch of Revenue was up 11% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz. For Japan, we are pleased to see robust growth in Q4 as revenue increased 15% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Verzenio and Mounjaro. Moving to China, Q4 revenue increased 7% in constant currency with volume growth of 10% partially offset by price declines. Volume growth in Q4 was primarily driven by Pivot. We are pleased to see China return to growth in 2023. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 10% in constant currency. However, when you exclude the impact of the Q4 2022 sales of rights for Alimta Korea and Taiwan, sales grew 9% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Mounjaro and Verzenio. Slide nine shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you can see, the new products and growth product categories combined contributed approximately 15 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter. Slide 10 provides additional perspective across our product categories. First, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 42% in Q4 driven by robust demand growth and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. The continued positive momentum is driven by early breast cancer indication with steady performance in the metastatic indication. Jardiance continued its strong 2023 performance with worldwide revenue growth of 30% for the quarter. In the U.S., Jardiance revenue increased 29%, driven by increased demand. In Q4, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 14%. U.S. revenue decreased 18% driven by lower volume and lower realized prices. We experienced intermittent delays for filling orders of Trulicity. Starting in early December and going through January, all dose strengths of Trulicity were indicated as having limited availability on the FDA drug shortage site. We expect to experience intermittent delays orders of certain doses in the coming months. In international markets, Trulicity volume continued to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to health care professionals not to start new patients on Trulicity. Moving to Slide 11, Mounjaro continued its robust growth as more Type 2 diabetes patients benefited from the medicine. Q4 revenue grew to over $2.2 billion globally, up from $1.4 billion in Q3 2023. In the U.S., Mounjaro revenue of $2.1 billion in Q4, up from $1.3 billion in Q3 2023, benefited from a onetime change in SMS for rebates and discounts. Adjusted for this onetime change, sequential net sales in the U.S. would have grown approximately 30% in Q4. Since our last call, we further expanded patient access to Mounjaro. As of February 1, access for patients with Type 2 diabetes in the U.S. was 90% in aggregate across commercial and Part D, including 92% access for commercial patients. This expanded access puts Mounjaro near parity with established injectable Incretins and gives more patients the opportunity to start therapy on Mounjaro for Type 2 diabetes. Since the $25 noncovered co-pay part program expired on June 30, we now consider all prescriptions paid. Compared to Q4 2022, the Mounjaro net price in Q4 2023 benefited from this change to the co-pay part program in the U.S. Recall that after a change to the noncovered co-pay program in late 2022, patients already started on the $25 co-pay card could remain in the program until June 30. Today, commercially insured patients without coverage utilize the current noncovered co-pay program and pay roughly half the list price for Mounjaro prescription. Turning to Slide 12. In November, we received FDA approval for Zepbound for adults with obesity or those who are overweight and have weight-related comorbidities. We then announced on December five that Zepbound available at U.S. pharmacies, and we started building commercial formulary access before the end of the year. We are pleased with the early access of approximately one-third of commercial lives covered as of February 1. Access in this market will be more gradual as individual employers need to opt in to coverage after the typical formulary contracting takes place. We are focused on building formulary access and employer opt-ins, but we expect that it will take some time before we reach broad open access in this market. Meanwhile, the commercial savings for our program is available at U.S. pharmacies for those who do not yet have coverage. In Medicare Part D, weight loss drugs are still prohibited from reimbursement. In Q4, we recognized $176 million in sales for Zepbound with approximately 3/4 of that coming from initial channel stocking. The initial prescription trends we have seen are encouraging. On Slide 13, we provide an update on capital allocation. Looking forward to 2024 and beyond, we have confidence in our existing commercial portfolio, bolstered by the recent launches of Mounjaro, Jaypirca, Omvoh, and Zepbound and the potential launches of the Donanemab and Lebrikizumab, all of which we expect to serve as drivers for contained growth through the balance of the decade. On Slide 14, you'll see a summary of our outlook; outline our capital deployment decisions in relation to achievement of our strategic deliverables. We will invest in our current portfolio and in the future innovation through R&D, business development and a comprehensive manufacturing expansion agenda designed to drive revenue growth and speed life-changing medicines to patients. We will continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividend increases in line with earnings growth over time and share repurchases with excess capital. Moving to Slide 15, we highlight some of the dynamics that may impact our 2024 financial results. We expect continued robust revenue growth with revenue from our core business which excludes revenue from divestiture growing nearly 30% at the midpoint of our guidance range, driven by positive momentum to simply launch products. In Incretins, anticipated growth will be led by Mounjaro and Zepbound. In 2023, we made tremendous strides in expanding access from Mounjaro, and we entered 2024 with 90% of commercial and Part D lives covered. Zepbound coverage is off to a good start in its early December launch, and we expect both Tirzepatide to contribute substantially to Lilly's revenue growth in 2024. While we expect Mounjaro and Zepbound to be drivers of revenue growth, this will be partially offset by an expected continuation of the softer Trulicity sales trends that we saw in the second half of 2023. Recent revenue declines for Trulicity in the U.S. has been driven by supply tightness. Volume has also been impacted by our actions outside the U.S. As for supply outlook for Emberton, our manufacturer organization continues to execute well on the most ambitious expansion agenda in our company's long history. Given strong demand and time required to bring capacity fully online, we continue to expect demand to outpace supply in 2024. In late 2022, we showed our expectation that by year-end 2023, our capacity for Incretin auto-injector pens would double. This goal was achieved through significant efforts from our manufacturing colleagues and partners around the globe. In 2024, our capacity execution efforts will continue with equal urgency and will be accomplished not just through increased auto-injector capacity but also through alternative presentation like our multi-use Quick Pen, which received regulatory approval in the U.K. in late January. We expect our manufacturing site in Concord, North Carolina, will initiate production as early as the end of 2024, with product available to ship in 2025. And we are pursuing a host of the projects, internal and external, large and small, to further expand capacity. Now I'll provide a bit more context on the timing and pace of our Incretin supply plans in 2024. While we're continuing to expand supply every quarter, we expect the most significant production increases to come in the second half of the year. We expect our production of sellable doses in the second half of 2024 will be at least one and a half times the production in the second half of 2023. Note that while last year, our commentary focused on capacity of auto-injectors devices compared to 2022, we're now referring sellable doses produced, which is more relevant to patients and investors. Beyond Incretin, we look forward to progressing our launch project for two other medicine approved and launched in 2023, Jaypirca and Omvoh. Jaypirca was initially approved by the FDA in January 2023 for adult patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma under the accelerated approval program, received FDA approval also on the Accelerated Approval Program in December 2023 for adult patients with CLL or SLL that have received at least two prior lines of therapy. We look forward to the ongoing opportunity to help patients with this medicine as our best Phase III program continues. Omvoh was approved in October 2023 in the U.S. and earlier that year in Japan, Europe and other markets and represents a compelling new options for patients struggling with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. And in 2024, we look forward to potential U.S. launches of two more medicines, Donanemab and Lebrikizumab. We continue to expect FDA regulatory actions on Donanemab in Q4 2024 and remain confident in the substantial potential for Donanemab to benefit patients with Alzheimer's disease. With the current state of diagnostic and treatment readiness, initial uptake will be somewhat limited, and we expect Donanemab to contribute only modestly to growth in 2024 once approved. Lebrikizumab, which last year was approved and launched in Europe under the brand name by our partner, received regulatory approval in Japan in January. As for the U.S., we look forward to the potential proof of Lebrikizumab by the end of the year. We believe the efficacy, safety and dosing of Lebrikizumab can make it a compelling option for patients and prescribers in a large and growing market for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Given the expected timing of FDA regulatory action, we expect Lebrikizumab to contribute only modestly to revenue growth in 2024. Beyond our recently launched portfolio of medicine, we expect continued growth from Verzenio driven by the early breast cancer indication where the magnitude and maturity of our clinical data reinforces it as a standard of care treatment in node-positive high-risk early breast cancer. Jardiance has been another outstanding contributor to growth, and we expect revenue growth to continue in 2024 though at a slower price as strong growth may be dampened by pricing dynamics in the U.S. Outside the U.S., we expect an acceleration of growth in every major geography led not only by the anticipated launches of Tirzepatide but also continued strong growth of Verzenio, Jardiance, and Taltz. Lastly, we seek to create long-term value beyond this decade. We will continue to invest across our value chain, in our recent and upcoming potential launches, in our pipeline, and in our manufacturing footprint. Slide 16 summarizes our initial 2024 financial guidance. Starting at the top line, revenue is expected to be between $40.4 billion and $41.6 billion. Using the midpoint of the 2024 range, this represents roughly 20% growth or 29% growth for our core business, which excludes the impact of divestitures that took place in 2023. In terms of phasing of our revenue growth throughout 2024, while we don't provide quarterly guidance, we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, consistent with the increased availability of Incretin doses. In terms of pricing for our core business, which excludes divestitures, we expect a high single-digit percent price decline in 2024. The lingering base period impact of the Mounjaro non-covered co-pay card dynamics will dampen these price declines in the first half of 2024, with more significant price declines expected in the second half of the year. During this year, we are taking a streamlined approach to our guidance line items related to expenses. Rather than provide three separate guidance line items for gross margin, research and development costs and marketing and sale and administrative costs, we are presenting a single new ratio representing our margin after planned costs, calculated by subtracting R&D costs and marketing and administrative costs from gross margin and dividing that figure by revenue. We express this ratio as a percentage, and for 2024, we expect it to be in the range of 31% to 33% on a non-GAAP basis. While we are not providing a specific guidance number for gross margin as a percent of sales, our expectations remain consistent, but we will maintain gross margin of approximately 80% on a non-GAAP basis as productivity gains and volumes are offset by pricing pressures and the cost of new manufacturing facilities. As for our expense growth across key categories, we expect marketing and administrative expenses to again grow in 2024 though at a slower pace than revenues, with growth driven by marketing investments in our recently launched and upcoming launch products. We also expect R&D expenses in 2024 to increase, driven by growing investments across all phases of our pipeline as we invest for the future, with the majority of dollar growth driven by ongoing and new late-phase opportunities. We expect R&D expense to increase at a higher rate than marketing, sell and administrative expenses. Other income and expense is expected to be between $400 million and $500 million of expense, primarily driven by higher interest expense. Turning to taxes; we expect our 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 14%. Note that this rate does not assume or repeal of the provision of the 2017 Tax Act, requiring capitalization, amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Should such a change take effect, our effective tax rate for 2024 would be moderately higher. Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $12.20 to $12.70 on a non-GAAP basis. Consistent with our prior practice, we are not including any potential or pending acquired IPR&D and even milestone charges in our 2024 guidance, and we will provide updates each quarter from the impact of IPR&D on earnings per share as acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges are incurred. For guidance modelling purposes, we're currently estimating diluted weighted average share outstanding for 2024 to be approximately 903 million. We entered 2024 with strong momentum and a remarkable opportunity to help millions more patients with our medicines. For our investors, 2024 should be another exciting year, driven by expected revenue growth in our core business, near an approaching 30% and continued investments to drive future growth. Our outlook for top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion remains on track. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our continued progress in R&D.",2802.0,1484.0,38.0,30.0,22.0,5.0,5.0,16.0,5.0,5.0,0.025606469002695417,0.02021563342318059,0.014824797843665768,0.0033692722371967657,0.0033692722371967657,0.005390835579514825
LLY,2024-02-06,2024-02-06,,2024-02-06,2024-02-06T10:00:00-05:00,0,2024-02-06,prepared,,Daniel Skovronsky,"Thanks, Anat. I'll start with our progress against diabetes, obesity and complications thereof. Today, we announced positive results from SYNERGY-NASH. The Phase II study of Tirzepatide in adults with biopsy-proven metabolic dysfunction-associated Steatohepatitis, also known as MASH. As shown on Slide 17, the study met its primary endpoint with up to 74% of participants achieving an absence of MASH with no worsening of fibrosis at 52 weeks compared to less than 13% of participants reaching this endpoint on placebo. We are equally encouraged by results seen in the secondary endpoint, evaluating improvement in fibrosis. While the study was not designed to be statistically powered to evaluate improvement in fibrosis, the study results showed a clinically meaningful treatment effect across all doses on the proportion of participants achieving a decrease of at least one fibrosis stage with no worsening of MASH to placebo. The adverse events were consistent with those observed in other clinical trials studying Tirzepatide in people living with obesity or Type 2 Diabetes. The full SYNERGY-NASH results will be presented at a medical congress later this year. As you know, late last year, we received FDA approval on Zepbound, which marks Lilly's first approved treatment for obesity. This is a landmark occasion for patients and for the field as Zepbound is the first and only approved treatment activating two Incretin hormone receptors, GIP and GLP-1 to tackle on the underlying cause of excess weight. Also, in early-stage development, we have now advanced our glucose-sensing insulin receptor agonist for the treatment of diabetes into Phase I and our long-acting Atrial natriuretic peptide for treatment of heart failure into Phase I. We've advanced mastatide into Phase II for obesity as we've begun to dose patients in that study. We are pleased that early this year, our partner, Innovent, reported positive results in the Phase III GORE-I study of mastetide in Chinese adults with obesity. In helps the development and commercialization rights for in China and Lilly retains the rights to the rest of the world. Moving to oncology. Today, we shared that in the Phase III CYCLONE two trial, Verzenio added to abiraterone did not meet the primary endpoint of improved radiographic progression-free survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. For the study, we employ an adaptive Phase II/III design. And while the Phase II stage met the prespecified threshold for the independent data monitoring committee to recommend initiation of Phase III, the signal was not confirmed in the Phase III portion in a larger sample size. The overall safety and tolerability profile was consistent with the known profiles of the medicines. We anticipate sharing full results from the CYCLONE two study at a future medical meeting. Since our last earnings call, Jaypirca received approval under the FDA's Accelerated Approval program for the treatment of divergence with CLL or SLL who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL2 inhibitor. We also reported that the Phase III confirmatory trial intended to convert this approval to traditional approval, known as BRUIN CLL 321 met its primary endpoint, and we plan to present these data at an upcoming medical meeting. With the CLL and SLL approvals, Jaypirca is now the first and only FDA-approved non-covalent BTK inhibitor that can extend the benefit of targeting the BTK pathway in CLL and SLL patients previously treated with a covalent BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor. This was the second approval for Jaypirca in 2023 with the first in patients with MCL. We believe these two indications only represent the beginning of the eventual impact Jaypirca can have for patients, and we look forward to seeing the data from the rest of the Phase III program across CLL, SLL and MCI. In Q4, we completed the acquisition of POINT Biopharma, which begins Lilly's entry into radioligand therapy, a promising technology with potential to deliver meaningful advances against a range of cancers. We welcome our new Point colleagues to Lilly, and we look forward to building on their work to grow this capability at Lilly. 2024 is also poised to be a particularly productive year for new clinical starts in oncology, as we begin to see the results of the new oncology R&D strategy that we implemented about four years ago after the Loxo acquisition. Through a combination of internal discovery efforts and business development, we expect to put at least five new molecules into the clinic this year, a wild-type of selective KRASG12D inhibitor, a pan-KRAS inhibitor, two antibody-drug conjugates with two biasomere's payloads, one against Nectin-4 and one against folate receptor alpha and an actinium PSMA radioligand therapy. I'll speak in a moment about our clinical KRASG12C program, but you can see that we're putting real effort into developing a suite of restorative therapeutics. And we're excited to see those discovery efforts result in three potential medicines so far. Of course, we'll have to see which of these deliver on our target clinical profiles but we're optimistic about this early phase portfolio, and we've certainly diversified the modalities in our pipeline. In addition, we're excited that [ph]alomorasib, our KRASG12C inhibitor, has progressed into Phase II as we're finalizing dose selection under Project Optimus for the Phase III program, which we plan to start later this year. You can now see the full design of that study on clinicaltrials.gov. By way of reminder, we started this program years behind our competitors. And through focused effort behind what looks like a great molecule to us, we've made up the vast majority of that time. We believe we're now neck and neck with our closest competitors with a medicine that we hope to show combines better with PD-1. Lastly, in oncology, we terminated development of our RET inhibitor two as it did not meet our threshold to move forward with internal development. In immunology, we moved two new assets into Phase I, and we advanced our KV1.3 Antagonist for psoriasis into Phase II. Lebrikizumab was approved in the EU for atopic dermatitis under the brand name Akouos, which is marketed by our partner, Amaral there. In January this year, we were pleased to have Akouos approved in Japan. In neuroscience, in January, our wholly-owned subsidiary announced positive clinical results for the Phase I/II AK-OTOF-101 study which demonstrated hearing restoration within 30 days of a single administration in the first participant, an individual with more than a decade of profound hearing loss. The surgical administration and the investigational therapy were well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. These results highlight our commitment to help solve some of humanity's most challenging health care problems and make life better for individual patients. We now show OTP gene therapy in Phase II on our pipeline chart as we've begun enrolling younger patients in the Phase II portion of the study. On Slide 18, we highlight our select pipeline assets with updates since the last earnings call, and Slide 19 summarizes our key events for 2023. I note the key updates on each of these slides in my therapeutic area of comments. Turning to Slide 20. We'd like to highlight potential key events for 2024. As you can see, this year will be another important year as we look to progress our late-stage pipeline. In 2023, we initiated Phase III development projects for our next generation of Incretins, which are our oral agent glyprone and our novel weekly Injectable Tri-agonist, Retatrutide. These programs are progressing and enrolling well. We look forward to seeing the first set of Phase III results on next year. This year, we're planning to initiate a Phase III program in Type 2 diabetes for retatrutide, complementing the ongoing trials in obesity and related complications. Also this year, we are planning to initiate a Phase III program for Lepodiserin, our LPA-lowering siRNA therapy in cardiovascular disease. On Tirzepatide, we're looking forward to a number of additional key data readouts this year. Beyond SYNERGY-NASH, we expect to see results from the Phase III obstructive sleep apnea and Phase III heart failure studies this year. We note increased investor interest in the timing of SURPASS-CVOT, and we reiterate that we expect the data in 2025, notwithstanding the clinicaltrials.gov listing which will be updated soon to reflect our current assumptions based on event rate. By the end of 2024, we expect to have results of SURMOUNT 5, which is our head-to-head study of Tirzepatide compared to high-dose semaglutide in participants with obesity. We also expect the full Phase III program readout on our weekly basal insulin, insulin efsitora alfa alpha later this year. Moving to neuroscience. We're looking forward to FDA action and the potential launch of Erenumab in Q1 of this year, and we are progressing with regulatory reviews around the world. We've now launched a PT 217 blood-based diagnostic test, and we will continue to scale this throughout 2024. We'll also continue to partner with others in the field to ensure physicians have multiple tools to aid in timely and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In immunology, following the Mirikizumab positive Phase III data at Crohn's disease, we plan to submit to the FDA for this indication this year. Additionally, following the U.S. FDA complete response letter on Lebrikizumab, we expect regulatory action by the end of the year in the U.S. Finally, in oncology, as I mentioned before, we look forward to moving our KRASG12C inhibitor Olomorasib, Phase III later this year following Phase II dose selection. Lastly, we're looking forward to seeing the results of our inlinesterat Phase III study, EMBER-3 in participants with metastatic breast cancer in both monotherapy and in combination with Verzenio. This past year was busy and productive, and we expect more of the same in 2024 as we make meaningful progress advancing our pipeline for the benefit of patients. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.",1693.0,844.0,26.0,20.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.030805687203791468,0.023696682464454975,0.004739336492890996,0.004739336492890996,0.001184834123222749,0.0071090047393364926

Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the fourth quarter. Q4 revenue growth accelerated as our recently launched product portfolio continued to gain momentum. We achieved meaningful advances in our late-stage pipeline with the FDA approvals of Zepbound and Jaypirca. We continue to invest in recent and upcoming launches, late-stage medicines, early phase capabilities and in business development, all of which will serve as a foundation for future growth. In Q4, we completed the acquisition of POINT Biopharma and announced plans to build a new manufacturing site in Germany. We returned over $1 billion to shareholders via dividend. Lastly, in January, we announced that Jana Norton, our Executive Vice President of Global Quality, will be retiring at the end of July after 34 years of service. During her tenure, Jana has overseen significant expansion, modernization and improvements in our quality and manufacturing processes. I'd like to thank her for her many years of outstanding service to Lilly.

I think the ratio of lean to fat mass is an important thing to think about. Body composition, not by weight matters to patients, for example, in risk of Type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease, that ratio seems to be important. The good news is that for patients on Tirzepatide, that ratio appears to improve. As you pointed out, they lose far more fat mass than lean mass. And so in every trial we've done, at the end of the trial, if we measure body composition, it's better, a higher ratio of lean to fat than at the beginning of the trial. So we see this changing body composition as a benefit, potential benefit of Tirzepatide to be further explored. Of course, it's also a benefit we want to further extend. You've seen us try to improve the total amount of body weight loss. We're also trying to improve further improve, I should say, the change in body mass composition. And that's why you saw us acquire and experiment with drugs like [indiscernible] the number you quote from the Tirzepatide and semaglutide studies seem right to me.

And what we have seen so far in Phase II, if we can replicate those data in Phase III, we have an oral medicine here with a weight loss along the lines of the best competitive Incretin, not at the level of Tirzepatide, but that's the level of the best Incretin in the marketplace and with no food or water restrictions.

There's nothing bad in the data that would stop us from going to Phase III. In terms of having a better molecule, probably we do in -- of course, we don't have that kind of Phase II data here for retatrutide.

Still though, I think having a positive Phase II trial here with really a meaningful data and NASH obligates us to think about next steps. As I said, that's going to the FDA to talk to them.

However, when we look at the recent data for Mounjaro, it's encouraging and it suggests that patients that start therapy back in Q1 2023 are having a persistency at least along the lines of other injectable Incretins. For Zepbound, definitely too early. But we strongly believe that patients will be motivated when they see the benefits of the drug. And there will, of course, be many factors impacting both supply, macroeconomic and microeconomic, but we are convinced that there will be a final duration of treatment also for obesity since when we look into even [indiscernible] in Type 2 diabetes, more than a 12-month period of adherence is considered long.

We have so much data now on the benefits of GIP agonism from tens of thousands of participants in randomized clinical trials for Tirzepatide. So we're extremely confident here about the benefits of GIP agonism. Adding to that data, we have experimented with a pure GIP one agonist that doesn't have any GLP-1 and we reported the benefits there in our Phase I study. We're contrasting that here to a small Phase I study that was recently published with a drug that has both GLP-1 agonism and GIP antagonism. I noted in that publication, the GIP antagonism is at a much lower affinity. So it probably only starts to antagonize GIP at very high doses. It's probably a question for that company. But I noted at the high doses actually an increase in free fatty acids and complete attenuation of the decrease in triglycerides in the clinical trial. Those are some effects that we attribute to GIP.  And so I'm not surprised that antagonism of GIP is starting to have some negative effects once that kicks in. We also see GIP agonism as having positive benefits on tolerability, reducing potentially nausea and vomiting. Then again, I think maybe at the higher doses, you could probably see some hints of the opposite effect with antagonism.

As I mentioned on the earlier question related to Orforglipron, we are not -- we don't think of ourselves as capital-constrained, buying or building in the space. The reality is there just isn't built capacity that's available. Most of it that's being used is already deployed against the leading products in the GLP-1 space, at least any at scale and new capacity has a lead time of three to four years. So all of the things that are coming online now, like we mentioned today, are very large site in Concord, North Carolina. That's a big node of capacity for the sector and certainly for Lilly. I mean, that was announced two and a half years ago and it will just begin production at the end of this year. So that's the problem. And why is that? Well, of course, greenfield building is difficult, repurposing is difficult, but also these are technically complex facilities. There's not an infinite number of people who know how to set them up. And the supply chain for the machines that make the products is also constrained. So at this point, I don't think there's an easy way forward. And I think even in yesterday's announcements, we have a lot of questions about that. But I think even the purchaser or our competitors said it will take many years for them to be able to increase capacity within that purchase. So it's just not an easy problem to solve. I think that over time, it will ease. There'll be more capacity brought online by us, our competitor and maybe others, including third parties and new technology will emerge like Orforglipron or other oral options, that tap into a different asset base. So I know it's frustrating for investors, it's frustrating for us. It's even more frustrating for patients but it's just sort of the situation we're in is that we steady gains in manufacturing over the coming several years and perhaps bigger gains after that.",360.0,161.0,6.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,0.037267080745341616,0.06832298136645963,0.018633540372670808,0.0,0.012422360248447204,-0.031055900621118012

And the way we look at our business, it is a long-term business. It's not a business that changes every year or two. So we do look at the long-term horizon, both in terms of the commercial products as well as what's coming through the pipeline and as we think through the events of that next freeze, whether for our products or those of competitors, our way of managing through that is to bring new breakthrough innovation to the marketplace. So to raise the bar on our own innovation, we don't wait for that to occur or happen by competition, but to bring something into the market that provides a meaningfully improved outcome for patients. So in this specific example, you use the GLTs, Shirley True's appetite brought in a higher bar for weight loss for patients with chronic weight management. And [indiscernible], that Dan referenced in his comments, currently in Phase III has the potential to bring even further improved outcome for patients. So that's how we see that. In terms of capacity and one of the questions is on whether companies should be or shouldn't be building, given that there is a patent expiry at the end, we do look at that and we look at the long-term horizon. But certainly, the investments in a metro facility, for example, the ones we've just mentioned, whether it's in Concord, North Carolina or Research Triangle Park, between the two of them, it's about a $4 billion investment, are certainly a good investment of our capital, given that size of opportunity over the long term. I will say that as you think about potential for either generic or biosimilar entry in this space, in general, it will require quite a massive investment in capital. Just the sites that I've mentioned today in the call and we've talked about for the past year or so total about $11 billion, and that's on top of already substantial network we have around the globe, primarily in the U.S. and Europe for production.

We achieved several key pipeline milestones, including the positive Phase III results for tirzepatide in moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea, the approval of our multi-dose KwikPen delivery device for Mounjaro in Europe, submission of mirikizumab in the U.S. and in the EU for moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, the resubmission of lebrikizumab in the U.S. for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and the initiation of our Phase III study for lepodisiran, evaluating efficacy and reducing cardiovascular risk. Lilly's top priority is to ensure we execute on our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda. We recently signed an agreement to acquire an injectable medicine facility from Nexus Pharmaceuticals in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. This state-of-the-art facility has been FDA approved, and we are targeting to initiate production at the end of 2025. We broke ground earlier this month on our previously announced parenteral manufacturing site in Germany. And in existing facilities, we are working to maximize output and productivity to meet demand. The recent EMA approval and upcoming launch of our multi-dose KwikPen delivery life for Mounjaro will unlock new supply capacity for Europe and other international markets. While we are also seeing meaningful progress in the ramp of new lines in existing Lilly and CDMO sites for the United States. We continue to make progress against our plans to increase manufacturing capacity, the most ambitious expansion plan in our company's history. Lastly, we distributed over $1 billion in dividends during the first quarter. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of the key events since our Q4 earnings call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other important updates. So now let me turn the call over to Anat to review our Q1 financial results.",411.0,212.0,10.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.04716981132075472,0.018867924528301886,0.009433962264150943,0.0,0.0,0.02830188679245283

First quarter revenue growth of 26% was driven by new products, primarily Mounjaro and Zepbound. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased from 78.4% in Q1 2023 to 82.5% in Q1 2024. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from higher realized prices, variable product mix and, to a lesser extent, improved production costs. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12% primarily driven by promotional efforts supporting current and future launches as well as increased compensation and benefit costs. R&D expenses increased 27%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research as well as a onetime charge of approximately $75 million associated with the termination of the Verzenio prostate program. In Q1, we recognized acquired IPR&D charge of $111 million, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.10. Operating income increased 63% in Q1 driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expense growth. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 11.9% compared to 12.8% in Q1 2023 driven by a larger net discrete tax benefit reflected in Q1 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. We delivered earnings per share of $2.58 in Q1, a 59% increase compared to Q1 2023, inclusive of the negative impact of $0.10 from acquired IPR&D charges in both periods. On Slide 7, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 28% in Q1 driven by growth of Mounjaro, Zepbound and Verzenio. Unprecedented demand for our incretin medicines led to wholesaler backorders of Trulicity, Mounjaro and Zepbound at quarter end. Realized prices in the U.S. increased 16%, largely driven by Mounjaro access and savings card dynamics. Moving to Europe. Revenue growth was once again strong, increasing 29% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume from Verzenio and Mounjaro as well as payments associated with the distribution and divestiture agreements. Japan revenue grew 2% in constant currency. Volume growth of 7% was driven by Mounjaro and Verzenio, partially offset by decreased volume for Trulicity and a partnership milestone in the base period.  Price declined 5% in the quarter. Moving to China. Q1 revenue increased 4% in constant currency. Volume growth was driven by Tyvyt, partially offset by Olumiant and Cialis. Revenue in the Rest of the World increased 31% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume growth from Mounjaro and to a lesser extent, Verzenio and Jardiance. Slide 8 provides additional perspective across our product categories. First, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales increased 40% in Q1, driven by continued volume growth in the early breast cancer indication. Jaypirca revenue increased to $50 million worldwide, representing an acceleration in sequential quarterly growth following the December 2023 approval for the CLL indication. We're looking forward to potentially making this medicine available to even more patients as future Phase III trials read out. Next in Q1, Mounjaro sales were $1.8 billion globally, and $1.5 billion in the U.S., up from $568 million and $536 million in Q1 2023, respectively. Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue for Mounjaro in the U.S. was impacted by a onetime benefit from changes in estimates for rebates and discounts in Q4 2023 as well as lower inventory in the channel in Q4 2024 and a strong demand. Access level across commercial and Part D were consistent with high levels we communicated on our last earnings call and near parity with established injectable incretin medicines. The demand for tirzepatide is very strong. And each week, hundreds of thousands of people fill scripts from Mounjaro and Zepbound. Yet we understand the frustration from those facing prescription delays or uncertainties yet in their medicine. While we are working tirelessly to ramp supply and expect meaningful increases in shipment volumes in the second half of the year, demand continues to outstrip even increased supply. We remain on track to meet expectations we set earlier this year, the production of saleable doses of incretin medicine in the second half of 2024 will be at least 1.5x the saleable doses in the second half of 2023.  In the short to midterm, we expect sales growth to primarily be a function of the quantities we can produce and ship. Outside the U.S., we're delighted that the multi-dose KwikPen delivery device from Mounjaro was recently approved in the EU, adding to the U.K. approval earlier this year. This approval applies to both type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management indication as they are under the single brand in Europe. While timing for launch will vary by country, we expect to start launching in the EU in coming weeks. In Q1, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 26%. U.S. Trulicity revenue decreased 30% driven by lower volume, primarily due to supply constraints and competitive dynamics. In addition, sales in international markets were impacted by measures we have taken to minimize disruption to existing patients, including communicating to health care professionals to not start new patients on Trulicity. Turning to Slide 9. We have seen exceptionally strong U.S. launch progress for Zepbound with over $0.5 billion in sales in Q1. We're rapidly building out access for Zepbound in the U.S. And as of April 1, we have approximately 67% access in the commercial segment. As a reminder, patients' access to this market is a two-step process typically require individual employers to opt in to an anti-obesity medicine rider following PBM coverage. We are continuing to focus on broadening access, both with PBMs and for employer opt-ins and early progress is encouraging. On Slide 10, we provide an update on capital allocation. Slide 11 shows updated 2024 financial guidance. Given the strength we're seeing in our business and projections for continued acceleration expected in the second half of the year, we're increasing our full year revenue outlook by $2 billion on the top and bottom end of the range to be between $42.4 billion to $43.6 billion. This increase is primarily due to the strong performance of Mounjaro and Zepbound and greater visibility and confidence into our production expansion for the remainder of 2024.  With this update, year-over-year revenue growth of the company is now expected to be approximately 26% at the midpoint or approximately 35% for the core business, which excludes the impact from global divestitures. Given the update to revenue guidance, we now expect the ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue to be in the range of 32% to 34% on a reported basis and 33% to 35% on a non-GAAP basis, representing further margin expansion. We're reaffirming guidance for other income and expense and tax rate, which now takes into consideration Q1 results. Based on these updates, and inclusive of Q1 IPR&D charges of $0.10 per share, we now expect EPS to be in the range of $13.05 to $13.55 on a reported basis and $13.50 to $14 on a non-GAAP basis. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight progress in R&D.",1128.0,581.0,14.0,10.0,7.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,0.024096385542168676,0.01721170395869191,0.012048192771084338,0.0,0.0034423407917383822,0.0068846815834767644
LLY,2024-04-30,2024-04-30,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T10:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,prepared,,Daniel Skovronsky,"Thanks, Anat. Let me start with our exciting announcement from earlier this month. That was the positive Phase III results from the SURMOUNT-OSA studies, which evaluated tirzepatide for treatment of adults with obesities and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea known as OSA. OSA is a sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by complete or partial collapse of the upper airway during sleep. OSA can have serious cardiometabolic complications contributing to hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and even type 2 diabetes. The need is significant. OSA impacts 80 million people in the U.S. with more than 20 million people suffering from moderate to severe OSA. We also know that a substantial majority, approximately 70% of people with OSA also live with obesity.  While there are pharmaceutical treatments for the excessive daytime sleepiness associated with OSA, tirzepatide could potentially be the first pharmacological treatment for the underlying disease. As shown on Slide 12, SURMOUNT-OSA was comprised of two separate trials run under one master protocol. Study 1 evaluated tirzepatide in participants not currently on positive airway pressure or PAP therapy, while Study 2 evaluates tirzepatide in patients who had used PAP for at least 3 months prior to the study and plans to continue PAP therapy during the entire course of the trial. A total of 469 participants were enrolled across these studies. Each study randomized participants to either maximum tolerated dose approved for tirzepatide, which can be 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, or to placebo. And patients were followed on therapy for 52 weeks. On Slide 13, we show the results of Study 1. For the efficacy estimate on mean Apnea-Hypopnea Index, or AHI, tirzepatide led to a mean reduction of 27.4 events per hour compared to a mean AHI reduction of 4.8 events per hour for placebo. This difference was highly statistically significant. AHI baseline values were 52.9 and AHI was reduced by 55% in the tirzepatide arm. We also saw a mean body rate reduction of 18.1% for tirzepatide treatment consistent with our expectations for the study. This was, of course, also statistically significant versus placebo. On Slide 14, we show the results of Study 2. In this population, for the efficacy [ estimand ], tirzepatide led to a mean AHI reduction of 30.4 events per hour compared to a mean AHI reduction of 6.0 events per hour for placebo. The baseline AHI was 46.1% in the tirzepatide arm and mean AHI reduction was 62.8%. Again, we saw impressive weight loss with a mean body rate reduction of 20.1% from baseline. These results were also all highly statistically significant. In both studies, the overall safety profile was similar to previously reported SURMOUNT and SURPASS trials. The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild to moderate in severity, with the most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse events for patients treated with tirzepatide being diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and constipation. Prior to the study readout, we noted investor questions about what level of weight loss we would see given several factors that were uniquely combined in the study of tirzepatide. First, the primary aim of the study was not treatment of obesity. Second, that the population was approximately 70% males, in whom weight loss can be harder to achieve with incretin medicines. Third, there's a particularly high baseline BMI in this population. And finally, the use of the 10- or 15-milligram maximum tolerated dose approach. We were therefore highly reassured to see weight loss observed across the two studies at 52 weeks was nearly 20% despite this difficult-to-treat population. Consistent with other Phase III studies of tirzepatide at the 52-week time point, we did not see weight loss plateau. We'll present detailed results of SURMOUNT-OSA during a symposium at ADA on June 21. Additionally, we plan to submit to the FDA and other global regulatory agencies beginning midyear. Moving to the other updates across our portfolio. Slide 15 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 26, and Slide 16 shows potential key events for the year. We're pleased to share that results were positive in QWINT-4, the first Phase III study of insulin efsitora alfa, our once-weekly basal insulin. This study evaluated efsitora compared to insulin glargine in adult participants with type 2 diabetes who are on multiple daily insulin injections. In the coming weeks, we expect to report top line results from QWINT-4 as well as QWINT	T-2 which is evaluating efsitora compared to degludec in adults with type 2 diabetes who are naive to basal insulin. Together, these are the first 2 of 5 studies in the efsitora Phase III program. Additional updates in our late-stage diabetes and obesity pipeline include results of the EMPACT-MI study, showing Jardiance had a 10% relative risk reduction in the primary composite endpoint of time-to-first hospitalization due to heart failure or all-cause mortality versus placebo, which did not reach statistical significance. We've completed enrollment for SURMOUNT-MMO with over 15,000 participants, and for both orforglipron studies in chronic weight management, ATTAIN-1 and ATTAIN-2, which together enrolled 4,500 participants. Finally, we've now initiated the [ TRANSCEND ] Phase III program studying retatrutide in type 2 diabetes. In the cardiovascular disease area, we're excited to have initiated the Phase III trial for lepodisiran, the subcutaneous injectable siRNA. This study will evaluate the efficacy in improving cardiovascular outcomes for participants with high lipoprotein A, who have cardiovascular disease or at a risk of heart attack or stroke. We are evaluating the efficacy of lepodisiran in both secondary and high-risk primary prevention. And we hope this will one day offer health care providers a treatment option for a broad group of patients at increased cardiovascular risk due to high LP(a) levels. Earlier in our diabetes and obesity pipeline, we've now initiated a Phase II monotherapy study evaluating eloralintide, our selective amylin receptor agonist in obesity. Turning to oncology. We made the decision to terminate for futility, the Phase III CYCLONE 3 trial evaluating Verzenio in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer following an interim analysis. This concludes development of Verzenio in prostate cancer following last quarter's announcement that the CYCLONE 2 study did not meet its primary endpoint. In early oncology development, we've initiated Phase I trials for two new assets. The first is our Nectin-4 ADC, which came from our acquisition of Emergence Therapeutics. The second is PNT2001, which came from our acquisition of POINT Biopharma. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in our oncology portfolio and expect 2024 to be particularly productive. Along with the Nectin-4 ADC and PNT2001 start, we expect at least three other new molecules to enter the clinic this year. We look forward to sharing more details with the investment community at an oncology-focused investor event hosted by the Lilly Oncology team. This event will take place on the evening of Sunday, June 2 in Chicago in conjunction with the ASCO annual meeting and will also be available via webcast. We plan to provide an update on our oncology strategy and pipeline opportunities. Additional details will be available soon regarding this event. Turning to Neuroscience. Last month, we announced that the FDA plans to convene a meeting of the peripheral and CNS Drugs Advisory Committee to discuss donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. We expect the advisory committee meeting will take place in mid-2024, but the exact date will be confirmed when it appears in the Federal Register. We expect the focus to be around the safety and efficacy profile of donanemab, along with unique aspects of the clinical program. We remain confident in donanemab's potential to offer very meaningful benefits to patients and look forward to addressing the FDA's questions in this form. Additionally, we made the decision to discontinue investigation of GBA1, our gene therapy assets in Gaucher disease type 2. Phase II studies in Parkinson's disease and Gaucher disease type 1 are still underway and have not been impacted by this decision. Finally, in immunology, we've submitted mirikizumab to the FDA and EMA for approval for use in adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. In the U.S., we've resubmitted lebrikizumab's application to the FDA for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. This is following a complete response letter based on inspection findings of the third-party manufacturer. As a reminder, the letter stated no concerns with the clinical data package safety or label. We expect regulatory action in the second half of this year. We're also announcing that in the coming months, we'll be initiating Phase III studies evaluating lebrikizumab in two new indications: chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and allergic rhinitis due to perennial allergens. Lebrikizumab will be the first biologic to be evaluated in Phase III for allergic rhinitis. We're optimistic about the potential of lebrikizumab to be an important treatment option in these patient populations as well as in atopic dermatitis. In earlier-stage immunology development, we've advanced our CD19 antibody into Phase II for multiple sclerosis.

Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress in our first quarter. Strong revenue growth in Q1 was driven by our recent product launches, primarily Mounjaro and Zepbound. We expect acceleration in revenue growth through the second half of the year as supply of incretin medicines continues to ramp. Significant advances in our pipeline include top line data from tirzepatide and SURMOUNT-OSA, approval of the KwikPen delivery device from Mounjaro in the EU, submission of mirikizumab and lebrikizumab as well as initiation of lepodisiran  Phase III study, as Dan just mentioned.

I just had a question, just was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on the capacity dynamics that are leading to the guidance raise today.

And as we've mentioned earlier in the year when we issued guidance, we said that we expect capacity and supply to ramp towards the second half of the year, and that's what we're seeing. Now as a reminder, we do have quite a large number of nodes across our supply chain that have to come online or ramp capacity. We are -- if you look at everything we have under construction, or ramping up, we have six sites right now between the two sites in North Carolina, a site in Ireland, two sites in Indiana, a site in Germany and then a seventh one that we just purchased, they are all either ramping up or under construction. And there are multiple nodes across that supply chain that have to become operational, which requires approval, et cetera, for three products, depending on which product runs on which line, that are planned throughout the year. Now that we're 4 months into the year, we have greater visibility into that -- into these nodes of capacity and feel more confident. Just as one example, the approval of the KwikPen in Europe that just came in slightly ahead of our expectation gives us additional confidence in our ability to launch KwikPen for patients in Europe. So it is across our sites globally as well as ramping up capacity with partners or CDMOs as well as in existing sites where we're making investments to expand where we can or ramp up capacity. So it's across our supply chain.",261.0,110.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.00909090909090909,0.00909090909090909,0.00909090909090909,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.0

When we look forward for the first half of 2024, it's important to have in mind that we also terminated the $25 saving card 6/30/2023, but patients that were on are grandfathered until 6/30/2024.

Yes, the abstract was accepted and will be presented at EASL early June. So that will be the opportunity to see the full NASH package from that Phase II trial. Like we said in the last call, really exciting data. We shared some of the top line. I think tirzepatide can have a profound effect on this disease. It's a Phase II trial. Next steps here are to discuss with the FDA what the best path forward could be for tirzepatide. You're pointing out, though, that we have another choice in retatrutide which, based on biomarker data from earlier studies, could also have a profound effect of this disease. That molecule has the addition of glucagon, which is likely to have additional benefits in the liver.

It's probably more of your job than ours to speculate on competitor readouts but I'll take a stab at it since you asked. I think on AMG 133, we've just seen really a small amount of data. So probably anything is possible and like you will be interested to see their results. Of course, there's arguments that can be heard about GIP agonism versus antagonism. We've placed our bets, and we like the data we got with GIP agonism. On CagriSema, of course, adding more agonism on different pathways on top of GLP-1 is a good idea. That's what we have with tirzepatide, is a dual agonist. So CagriSema makes sense. And you'll note that we've advanced our amylin agonist to Phase II. Tirzepatide already is a dual agonist. Retatrutide is already a triple agonist. There's probably more we could do here at Lilly. I think across our portfolio, in Phase I and Phase II, we have nine assets that are marked for diabetes or obesity. Many of them could lead to additive weight loss on top of established mechanisms plus two more in Phase III, of course. So we have a strong portfolio here.

Maybe first is the depth of clearance of Lp(a), we don't know how much you have to reduce Lp(a) to lead to benefits in cardiovascular outcomes and whether there's a threshold effect or a floor to this. So the depth of clearance is one. The second, as you asked about, could be frequency of administration or durability of action, those two being closely linked.

And we are incredibly confident in donanemab's potential and the fact that it offers very meaningful benefits to people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and just the overall approvability of the package. We do look forward to seeing there's questions. We haven't received those yet. I think that what we'll anticipate really is discussions around the safety and efficacy of donanemab. And those -- the safety and efficacy profile remain very consistent with what we published and presented. So nothing new there. We do expect there's a couple of unique aspects to our trial that we anticipate they'll want to discuss. One is around limited duration dosing. We think this is an incredibly important feature of donanemab, the chance to stop dosing when you've cleared the plaques. And donanemab clears them robustly and rapidly so we think that allows for this limited duration dosing approach. So we really do look forward to getting into that data and having the advisers see that and respond to it. Another unique aspect is assessing tau at baseline. This is important for the field that we understand the prognostic factor of tau, and that was able to be earned. But what we saw in the trial was all patients benefited regardless of tau level with those early in the disease doing even better. It's one of the reasons that we remain so enthusiastic about TRAILBLAZER-3. And while Dan didn't mention that in his remarks, I think we remain even more enthusiastic about the opportunity to intervene earlier based on what we saw in that early population, the people with low tau and those that had no tau with such strong biomarker results. I think you probably remember the data that patients in the earliest part of our study had a 60% slowing. And we believe that could be even stronger as you get into the earlier patients that are preclinical. But maybe just one remark. In the meantime, though, this is not time loss. We'll continue to make sure the health care system is ready. We're going to make sure that we launch into an even stronger market with potential approval.

But could you please discuss how Lilly is building out its manufacturing capacity and whether the company expects to be able to meet global demand in the Western world after launch in 2026?

I mean, first of all, it is true that orforglipron is a complicated large small molecule, a large small molecule, if you were, and there are many steps in the process. You can read about them in our patent filings, I think. But Lilly, maybe unlike other companies, we've made small molecules for a long time. We're capable of doing it. We understand how to put them together, and we've got a defined process to do it for orforglipron. So the API production, while a long process and maybe complicated relative to other small molecules, is something we're super confident in and have our arms around. The finish process is really the big advance over using injectables because here, we're just tablet stamping or tablet -- capsule making, which are dry processes we understand extremely well. I think the big gain here will be the fact that both for synthetic chemistry and capsule making and tablet making, there is already capacity on planet Earth that is significant. And so unlike the parenteral side where we've been talking about injectables, a new capacity needs to be built in which we're doing aggressively, as Anat commented on earlier. Here, there's a lot of partners we can access as well as our own substantial network for dry product finish and API production. So pretty confident here. Now will we stick the landing on exact doses and quantities in every instance? We're not guaranteeing that, but I think the picture will be quite a bit different should orforglipron prove to be safe and effective in the Phase III studies.

I think there's a number of opportunities for improvement over even an excellent drug like tirzepatide. We think about the quality of weight loss as one aspect. So for example, even on tirzepatide, we see the ratio of lean to fat mass approved as patients lose weight on these drugs. Could we make it improve even faster with the muscle stimulating agents like bimagrumab? But maybe that's under investigation. Tirzepatide is very well tolerated, but some people stop taking it because of GI side effects. Could we have drugs that have fewer side effects? Maybe that could be possible. Tirzepatide is given as a once a weekly injection. Most patients find that to be acceptable. But probably with less frequent injections, that could lower the burden on manufacturing and make it easier to use for patients. So that's another avenue of exploration. There are some patients who don't achieve their desired levels of weight loss even on a powerful drug like tirzepatide. And so that's another avenue. Finally, across different indications, and I spoke earlier of NASH, that are related to metabolic disease, there could be different activities that proved more or less beneficial for these other related diseases. So that's another avenue of differentiation. I think we're just at the beginning of probably what will be seen as a multi-decade investments in treating abnormal metabolism and all diseases that come with that.

And I expect that this will continue through the year, even with the significant ramp that we have, and we'll add more supply across different presentations, both with the auto-injector as well as the KwikPen. But even with that, I expect that the demand will be -- will outpace supply through this year. Potentially next year, obviously, we'll see. We'll continue to invest and ramp as we go into next year, but it could be quite some time. We talked earlier about orforglipron, should we have positive Phase III readout that provides another relief valve in terms of just offering a different presentation, as Dave mentioned, which utilizes a different set of infrastructure within our manufacturing organization available capacity globally. So it will be in a stepwise fashion. We'll continue to update investors as we progress through the year and coming years.",288.0,138.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.050724637681159424,0.0,0.007246376811594203,0.0,0.0,0.050724637681159424

Bimagrumab is a very different mechanism of weight loss versus incretins but one that we think could be important in combination with incretins. So bimagrumab, we think will likely have important effects on adipose tissue as well as muscle mass. And so our hope is to see increased muscle mass and increased ratio, I should say, of lean to fat mass by combining bimagrumab with incretins. In this present study, it's being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with semaglutide at different doses. So we'll see if weight loss effects on fat tissue stack and we'll see if effects on lean body mass that we're seeing in previous bimagrumab monotherapy studies work in combination with incretin.

We're really excited about bringing radiopharmaceuticals into the portfolio by way of the acquisition of POINT Biopharma, and we are supplementing that acquisition with additional work through our discovery labs and the ability to make these medicines ourselves. So I expect we'll have more to talk about in terms of additional medicines over the course of the next couple of years in addition to PNT2001. But specific to that question, 2001 is a PSMA-directed therapy for prostate cancer conjugated to actinium, the alpha emitter. And I think while actinium holds a lot of promise over lutetium, particularly in the context of creating double-stranded DNA breaks versus single stranded and the ability to perhaps drive more efficacy for patients of prostate cancer. I think one of the limitations of the existing agents is that they probably cause too much salivary gland toxicity to be real durable products. And so the POINT team designed a novel PSMA-directed ligand with increased tumor uptake relative to the salivary gland in order to drive more therapeutic index using actinium as the payload. So we're just getting started with the Phase I experience right now. So I don't have a lot to say about what we're seeing just yet. But the preclinical package looked really interesting and differentiated from the other PSMA ligands that exist out there. So we're looking forward to putting it through its Phase I paces, and we'll see what we have. Depending on the clinical profile, I think there's the potential to improve outcomes in patients that have already seen a lutetium-based agent maybe go ahead of that and compete with the lutetium-based agents or perhaps even go even earlier in therapy as PSMA expression really exists in the continuum of prostate cancer care. So more to come on that as we define the clinical profile in the Phase I.",327.0,162.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.024691358024691357,0.030864197530864196,0.0,0.006172839506172839,-0.006172839506172839

So that reference is not a number of devices, but number of sellable doses. And as we ramp up capacity for KwikPen, recall that unlike the single-use vial or the auto-injector, that KwikPen is a multidose device that has multiple doses available for patients. That comment referred to the second half of this year versus the second half of last year. So we're expecting that total saleable doses this year in the second half will be at least 1.5x where we were second half of last year. That remains unchanged. But the level of confidence we have in our ability to progress on each node of our capacity that's coming online or will get approved, et cetera, has just increased. There are multiple of these throughout the year. Multiple of these have occurred. Some will occur as -- I gave the KwikPen as one example. Think about a construction of a site, for example, Concord in North Carolina, which we said will become operational by end of the year, and we'll start seeing products next year. That construction has concluded. Lines are installed, and we need to run qualifications, get approval, et cetera. There are multiple nodes of these across our own manufacturing sites as well as external and that they all need to come online to get to where we need in terms of the full year guidance.

It's an exciting time here at Lilly as our growth trajectory accelerated in the second quarter. Our investments in advancing innovative medicine are focused on manufacturing expansion are bringing Lilly medicines to more people around the world. On Slide 5, you can see details of the financial performance in the second quarter and progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 36% in Q2 with our new products growing nearly $3.5 billion compared to the same period last year. U.S. demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound is strong and growing as access and supply continue to expand. While weekly prescription volume was volatile in the first half of the year due to challenges fulfilling high demand, our progress on supply gives us confidence in our outlook. Q2 saw impressive performance across other areas of the business as well. Excluding the sale of the rights to Baqsimi last year, non-incretin growth was 17% worldwide with growth spread across geographies, including 25% growth in the United States. And our $3 billion increase in revenue guidance reflects our expectation that momentum will accelerate through the balance of the year. We achieved several key pipeline milestones, including the approval of Kisunla, the brand name for donanemab in the U.S. for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, the approval of Jaypirca in Japan for people with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who are resistant or intolerant to other BTK inhibitors, the submission of tirzepatide in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity and the positive top line results from the SUMMIT Phase 3 trial evaluating tirzepatide in adults with heart failure with preserved injection fraction and obesity. Lilly now has a significant opportunity to create new medicines through a broad internal portfolio and active business development to support our long-term growth. In obesity, our strategy is to comprehensively address this global public health crisis, pursuing opportunities against every rational mechanism, indication and dosage form. We are investing broadly in this disease and now have 11 new molecules currently in the clinic across multiple indications. We're also investing in a wide range of late-stage Phase 3 programs. We recently shared the positive data of tirzepatide in OSA and -- Orforglipron, our oral GLP-1 small molecule, has a comprehensive Phase 3 program underway in diabetes and obesity with nine trials currently running and readout starting next year. With tirzepatide, our GIP/GLP-1 glucan try agonist. We have initiated a broad Phase 3 development program studying the molecule in obesity, OSA, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular and renal outcomes as well as type 2 diabetes. These readouts start in 2026. Our top priority remains executing on our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda. In May, we announced plans to invest an additional $5.3 billion in our Lebanon, Indiana manufacturing sites, bringing our total investment there to $9 billion. We believe this is the largest single investment in synthetic medicine active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing in the history of the United States. Importantly, this expansion will enhance capacity to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for Zepbound and Mounjaro. Since 2020, we have committed more than $18 billion to build, upgrade or acquire facilities in the U.S. and Europe, and we began to see the benefit of these investments. We are making near-term progress to ramp production, including at new sites like Research Trial Park, existing Lilly sites and contract manufacturing organizations. Our Concur North Carolina site is progressing well. We're in the process of running validation and expect this facility will initiate production by the end of 2024 with product available to ship in 2025. We also continue to make progress on different presentations for tirzepatide. We have now launched our multidose quick pen in multiple markets outside the U.S. with positive early indicators of patient adoption. And in Gordon's remarks, he will preview our plans to launch vials here in the U.S. Lastly, in terms of external innovation. In July, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Morphic, a biopharma company developing oral -- therapies for treatment of serious chronic diseases, including a Phase 2 asset being evaluated in inflammatory bowel disease. On Slide 6, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other important updates. As we announced in June, Anat Ashkenazi resigned as Lilly's Chief Financial Officer to become the CFO of Alphabet. We wish Anat well in her new role and thank her for your partnership and leadership of our financial organization in the last 3 years. We have named Gordon Brooks Interim CFO as an internal and external search for Anat successor is currently underway. Gordon has been with the company for 29 years and also serves as our controller and the leader of the corporate strategy group for the company. In other leadership news, Alonzo Weems, our Executive Vice President of Enterprise Risk Management and our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, will retire at the end of the year after 27 years of service. And Melissa Seymour has joined the company as Executive Vice President of Global Quality and a member of the company's executive committee following John Norton's recent retirement. I want to thank Alonzo for his many years of service and welcome Melissa to the Lilly team.

So, I'm on Slide 7, which summarizes the financial performance in the second quarter of 2024. Second quarter revenue growth of 36% was primarily driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound as well as Verzenio. When excluding revenue from the sale of rights to Baqsimi in Q2 of last year, revenue grew 46%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased from 79.8% in Q2 of '23 to 82% in Q2 of '24. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from favorable product -- and higher realized prices, partially offset by higher production costs. R&D expenses increased 15% driven by continued investment in our portfolio and in our people. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by promotional efforts associated ongoing and future launches as well as investments in our people. Operating income increased 90% in Q2, driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expense growth. The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 16.5% in Q2 of '24 compared with 16.1% in Q2 of '23. The Q2 '24 tax rate reflects a mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, while the Q2 '23 rate reflected the impact of earnings from the sale of rights for Baqsimi. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $3.92 in Q2, an 86% increase compared to the prior year. Q2 '24 results include a negative impact of $0.14 from acquired IPR&D charges compared to $0.09 in the prior quarter, Q2 of '23. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 42% in Q2. Volume growth of 27% was driven by Zepbound, Mounjaro and Verzenio, partially offset by sale of rights for Baqsimi in Q2 of '23 and declines in Trulicity. Realized prices increased 15%, largely driven by Mounjaro access and savings card dynamics. As noted in our Q4 -- Q1 2024 earnings call, unprecedented demand for our incretin medicines led to wholesaler back orders at the end of Q1. In Q2, we fulfilled the majority of these back orders, improving wholesaler stocking levels. We estimate that U.S. Mounjaro and Zepbound aggregate sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by channel stocking that we estimate totaled high teens to mid-20s as a percent of U.S. sales as we rebuilt inventory from extremely low levels in the spring and to account for the growth of these brands. We are pleased that the group's supply situation is reflected on the FDA shortage website, which currently shows all doses of Mounjaro and Zepbound, listed as available and the two lower doses of Trulicity as available. While wholesaler back orders in the U.S. have been reduced substantially, it's important to note that the pharmaceutical supply chain is complex, more so for medicines that require refrigeration and offer at several different doses. These factors may continue to result in variability in the patient experience at the pharmacy counter. While supply and demand has come into better balance, we expect increase in demand may result in periodic supply tightness for certain presentations and dose levels. We have a continued broad agenda to further increase supply, and we'll continue to look at all options. Today, we are excited to announce plans to further expand access to Zepbound with the launch of the 2.5-milligram and 5-milligram single-dose files in the coming weeks with more details to come at that time. In Europe, revenue grew 20% in constant currency, primarily driven by Mounjaro launch uptake in the U.K. and Germany. We also had strong volume growth from Verzenio, Jardiance, which was partially offset by decreased volume from Trulicity. Japan performance was strong in the second quarter with 15% revenue growth in constant currency. Volume growth of 21% was driven by uptake of Mounjaro and Verzenio. Moving to China. Q2 revenue increased 1% in constant currency. Growth was driven by -- Olumiant and Taltz, partially offset by Trulicity and Cialis. Mounjaro was recently approved in China for type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management. We have not yet announced expected launch timing in this market. Revenue in Rest of World increased 61% in constant currency, primarily driven by Mounjaro volume growth from demand and channel dynamics. Slide 10 provides additional perspective on performance across our product categories. Verzenio solid growth in the second quarter across major geographies with worldwide sales increasing 44%, driven by the early breast cancer indication. Jaypirca revenue increased to $92 million worldwide, which included a $19 million partner milestone payment related to Japan. Jaypirca continued impressive quarter-over-quarter growth, building on the brand's uptake from both the MCL and CLL patient populations. OMVOH is launched in the U.S. and 14 international markets with sales of $26 million in Q2. These launches continue to progress well with increasing patient starts. And in the U.S., we expect sales to accelerate as the product-specific code went live on July 1. Mounjaro sales in Q2 were $3.1 billion globally with $2.4 billion in the U.S. Revenue growth in the U.S. reflected continued strong demand as well as the improved channel dynamics discussed earlier. We're seeing solid uptake in Mounjaro outside the U.S., with sales in Q2 totaling $677 million. In the first half of the year, we launched the quick pen presentation in the U.K., Germany and the UAE. So far in Q3, we've also launched Mounjaro Quick Pen in Spain and plan to launch an additional market throughout 2024. In Q2, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 31%. U.S. Trulicity revenue decreased 36% driven by lower volume, primarily due to competitive dynamics and supply constraints, partially offset by improved wholesaler stocking levels on services. Turning to Slide 11. We have an update on the U.S. launch of Zepbound. We've seen exceptional growth trends for Zepbound that have accelerated as production has ramped leading to sales of over $1.2 billion in Q2. We are rapidly building our formulary coverage for Zepbound in the U.S. and as of July 1 had approximately 86% access in the commercial segment. We estimate over 50% of employers have opted into anti-obesity medicine coverage and see that modestly growing as we work to expand coverage. On Slide 12, we provide an update on our capital allocation. Slide 13 shows our updated 2024 financial guidance. We are raising our full year revenue outlook by $3 billion to be between $45.4 million and $46.6 billion. This increase is due to strong performance across our non-incretin medicines as well as Mounjaro and Zepbound. Additionally, we have improved clarity into the timing and pace of our production expansion and Mounjaro launches outside the U.S. We achieved a number of supply-related milestones in Q2 and have increased confidence regarding our expectation that production of salable doses of incretin medicines in the second half of 2024 will be at least 1.5 times the salable doses taken half of 2023. Based on the midpoint of the range, our updated guidance implies revenue growth of 38% in the second half of the year, below 31% in the first half. In the second half of the year, we expect a more significant growth in Q4 compared to Q3. Given the update to revenue guidance, we now expect the ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue to be in the range of 36% to 38% on a reported basis and 37% to 39% on a non-GAAP basis. For other income and expense, we now expect between $525 million and $425 million of expense on a reported basis, and between $400 million and $300 million of expense on a non-GAAP basis. Both ranges reflect lower expected net interest expense and the reported range reflects net losses on investments in equity securities through Q2 of '24. We have increased our estimated effective tax rate to be approximately 15%, driven by changes in our forecasted mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $15.10 to $15.60 on a reported basis $16.10 to $16.60 on a non-GAAP basis. Both ranges -- the updates mentioned earlier as well as acquired IPR&D charges through Q2 of $0.24. The reported range includes a charge in Q2 of '24 associated with anticipated litigation payments. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.",1336.0,662.0,20.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,0.030211480362537766,0.00906344410876133,0.00906344410876133,0.004531722054380665,0.0030211480362537764,0.021148036253776436

I'll start with comments on the Kisunla FDA approval, then the tirzepatide heart failure Phase 3 readout. Then finally, I'll cover the rest of the updates for the quarter. We are, of course, very excited about the FDA approval of Kisunla for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This followed the June Advisory Committee meeting where we had another chance to present and discuss the compelling data package characterizing the safety and efficacy of this medicine. We were pleased by the discussion of the FDA advisers, particularly with regard to our data supporting stopping of Kisunla therapy when amyloid plaques are removed to minimal levels. In our trial, nearly half of study participants completed their course of treatment with Kisunla in 12 months. We believe limited duration therapy, along with a once monthly infusion schedule, could result in lower patient out-of-pocket treatment costs and fewer infusions required. The vote was unanimously positive on all questions presented. Then a few weeks later, the FDA approved Kisunla, including labeling that physicians may consider stopping dosing of Kisunla based on reduction of amyloid plaques. Following the July approval, we launched Kisunla, and we're delighted to see that patients have already begun receiving this new Lilly medicine as part of clinical practice. We note that Kisunla is broadly covered for Medicare patients through approved CED registries. Regulatory reviews continue around the world with potential action yet this year in several countries. We're pleased to have recently received a positive opinion for genenimab from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan. And finally, our Phase 3 prevention study, TRAILBLAZER ALS 3, continues to progress as planned. Moving to tirzepatide. On Slide 14, you'll see the recent positive results of our SUMMIT Phase 3 trial, which evaluated tirzepatide for the treatment of heart failure with preserved detection fraction and obesity. This study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both primary endpoints for tirzepatide, maximum tolerated dose compared to placebo. In the first primary endpoint, tirzepatide reduced the risk of worsening heart failure by 38% compared to placebo as measured by a composite outcome of heart failure urgent visit or hospitalization, oral diuretic intensification or cardiovascular death. The median follow-up for this endpoint was 104 weeks. In the second primary endpoint, tirzepatide significantly improved heart failure symptoms and physical limitations compared to placebo as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questioner, KCCQ Clinical Summary score. Main changes from baseline in this measurement is 24.8 points for tirzepatide, while placebo was 15 points based on the efficacy as demand at 52 weeks. All key secondary endpoints were met in the study, including mean body weight reduction of 15.7% compared to 2.2% for placebo. The overall safety profile of tirzepatide in the SUMMIT trial was consistent with previously reported tirzepatide studies, including SURMOUNT and SURPASS. We will present detailed results at an upcoming medical -- and submit to a peer-reviewed journal. We plan to submit results to the FDA and other regulatory agencies starting later this year. In other updates across our portfolio, Slide 15 shows select pipeline opportunities as of August 6. Slide 16 shows potential key events for the year. I'll start with updates in cardiometabolic health, which is the new name of our internal business, formerly known as Lilly diabetes and obesity. In June, we published detailed results for our Phase 3 trials of tirzepatide for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity in the New England Journal of Medicine, and we presented results at the American Diabetes Association Meeting. All primary and key secondary endpoints were achieved in these studies. Notably, in one of our key secondary endpoints, as shown on Slide 17, tirzepatide demonstrated that up to 51.5% of participants met the criteria for disease resolution of sleep apnea. We've now submitted tirzepatide for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity to the FDA as well as the EMA. We are pleased that the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation, and we expect U.S. regulatory action as early as the end of 2024, which will be dependent on the FDA granting priority review. Also, in June, we published results in the New England Journal from our Phase 2 trial of tirzepatide for metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis, or MASH, with Stage 2 or Stage 3 fibrosis and we presented these results at the European Association for the Study of Donanemab. We are pleased to show that in a secondary endpoint, more than half of the patients taking tirzepatide achieved improvement in fibrosis at 52 weeks as shown on Slide 18. We're engaged with regulatory authorities on a potential Phase 3 registration strategy, and we're also encouraged by the potential read-through of these results to retatrutide, which also showed significant improvements in liver fats in Phase 2. This quarter, we also announced top-line data from two Phase 3 trials for our once weekly insulin called efsitora alfa, the QWINT-2 and QWINT-4 trials for the treatment of type 2 diabetes each met their primary endpoints of non-inferior A1c reduction. QWINT-2 compared to efsitora once-daily insulin degludec for 52 weeks in insulin naive adults. QWINT-4 compared efsitora to insulin glargine for 26 weeks in adult previously treated with daily basal insulin and at least two injections per day of meal time line. In both QWINT-2 and QWINT-4 efsitora, was safe and well tolerated. Detailed trial results will be presented in September at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting. We look forward to sharing additional data from the QWINT program later this year. We are pleased with our progress to provide breakthrough innovation to patients who require insulin, progressing our glucose-sensing insulin receptor agonist molecule in Phase 1 and investing in approaches aimed at disease modification for type 1 diabetes, such as -- cell therapy. In other late-phase updates, we've initiated Triumph outcomes, a Phase 3 trial evaluating cardiovascular outcomes and renal function for patients taking retatrutide. Earlier in our cardiometabolic pipeline, you'll see additional incretin molecules in Phase 1. Incretins are an important part of our portfolio strategy and having multiple molecules in clinical development offers us potential optionality as we look at opportunities to help patients across mechanisms, indications, dosages, formulations and treatment schedules. To highlight a few. GLP-1 NPA2 is a small molecule non-peptide agonist of the GLP-1 receptor designed for once daily oral administration. We expect this asset to move to Phase 2 later this year, so we now identify it on our pipeline slide whereas it had previously been listed as not disclosed. Given the diversity of indications to potentially pursue with incretins, we are excited about the possibility of having another oral option to help more patients with different diseases. We also highlight today the GLP-1 coagonist III, which is a next-generation dual agonist molecule and we are planning to explore weekly and monthly dosing given its longer halfway. Elsewhere in our cardiometabolic health portfolio, we have stopped development of our NRG4 agonist as the profile was insufficient for further clinical development. Turning to oncology. We are pleased that Jaypirca has now been approved in Japan for people with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who are resistant or intolerant to other BTK inhibitors. In early phase oncology, we've initiated the Phase 1 trial for a second Nectin-4 ADC. We view this as an important target and having two compounds in the clinic provides more opportunities to improve outcomes for patients. We've also initiated a Phase 1 trial for our ADC targeting the folate receptor. This asset, which came from our acquisition of Mablink is the next-generation construct design -- efficacy at all fully receptor expression levels and with an improved therapeutic index relative to existing agents. We're also announcing that we've terminated the LOXO-783 program, which targeted PI3 kinase alpha. We evaluated the ongoing clinical data from the program and compared the molecule to next-generation candidates that we have progressed from our discovery efforts. We believe our next molecules have greater potential to benefit patients and we look forward to putting our next candidate into the clinic in 2025 and sharing more about its profile later this year. In immunology, we've now submitted mirikizumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in Japan. We've terminated development for our GITR agonist, antagonists due to insufficient efficacy. We also announced our acquisition of Morphic. And pending completion of the deal we plan to reflect the oral alpha-4-beta-7 integrin inhibitor, MORF-057, in Phase 2 for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Finally, in neuroscience, our anti-tau small molecule OGA inhibitor, recently concluded its Phase 2 study in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. OGA failed to meet the primary endpoint of decreasing the change of baseline as measured by -- in either of the two dose levels tested. We're reviewing the data for presentation of detailed results of the study at the clinical trials in Alzheimer's conference later this year. While this negative outcome is disappointing, we remain committed to TAP as a high conviction target in Alzheimer's disease and plan to continue studying Taobao.

Exceptional revenue growth in Q2 was driven by Mounjaro, Zepbound and Verzenio. We are pleased with the ramp in production in the first half of the year and expect continued expansion ahead. Significant advances in our pipeline include the approval of Kisunla for Alzheimer's disease, the submission of tirzepatide for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity in the U.S. and Europe and positive results from the Phase 3 study of tirzepatide for heart failure with preserved injection fraction and obesity. We are investing in product launches, the advancement of our pipeline as well as our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda.

By our calculations, when we sort of look at the ASP averages, removing rebates, inventory, et cetera, relative to comments made yesterday on Novo's call, I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what you're seeing in the market with regard to average selling price. The prices look actually reasonably close to us with the tirzepatide franchise having higher sort of ASP per script, but not dramatically higher given concerns of real pricing deterioration. I guess the only question that I have here is, what are you seeing from an ASP perspective? And do you see this as kind of a natural evolution of this market as competition emergence as we saw with Ozempic historically and Trulicity in 2019?

So just on price streams, initial favorability in the first half of the year was driven by Mounjaro. That goes away in the second half of the year as the co-pay program moves out of the base period. In terms of pricing, we see stable pricing sequentially across quarters in '24. So, nothing unusual, Q1 to Q2 and our guidance Q3 and Q4 continue stable sequential pricing.

Just wondering if you're unit guidance for the at least 1.5-fold increase in sellable doses include the Zepbound bound star vials that you're rolling out in the U.S. or if that's a potential driver of upside? And then as we think about RTP, I know you continue to make progress there. The scripts suggests you're at about 1/3 of the way through the ramp to peak.

I would say the vials are part of that. But given the -- we have about 20 weeks left in the year. So, there's a limit to how much of that will ship anyway. But they certainly open up a node of the most constrained part of the supply chain, which is still finish in the final container closure and it uses different lines obviously, then syringes or cartridges. So, it just adds to our capacity, probably the most meaningful part of that will show up in the early '25 to be honest, as that new form ramps and details on that rollout will be coming in the coming weeks. As it relates to RTP, I wouldn't read through that the Q2 step-up in volume we shipped was primarily to RTP. That site is on track, and we are steadily escalating production per our goals. I also mentioned Concord is doing well against its time schedule, and we expect product out of that site end of this year, early next year.

You can see that we've invested thoroughly, I would say, in our Phase 3 portfolio is often pursuing multiple indications in multiple populations at once. Just being able to get to that point, I know investors have gotten excited about various releases of Phase 1 data. But it's still a challenging space to develop drugs and we usually wait until we've seen pretty robust Phase 2 data before we get too excited about a particular molecule. So that's the first thing.

I think when we look at the marketplace, about two are very important barriers. We have been extremely successful in gaining access across both Mounjaro, where we are currently 93% access in commercial and 89% in Part D. And similarly, for Zepbound, 86% after 7 months in the marketplace, that's quite significant. The second piece is the amount of outcome indications. We are investing heavily in both Mounjaro and Zepbound, and similarly for the Phase 3 assets of our Zepbound and retatrutide. So, I think, overall, we think that we are extremely well positioned to compete here. And we are not surprised to see that most of the firms are actually leaning into this very important space. But with the cost we have not had in the market today, the Phase 3 assets and what we referred in the prepared remarks, we are well positioned to compete today and tomorrow.

But here, we're highlighting our [indiscernible] 11 assets, all different targets. And maybe just a reminder, Chris, we had our Phase 1 MAD data for tirzepatide in 2016, that was 8 years ago. And that's a massive lead, I think, over other GIP/GLP agonists that are behind us. On the oral side, you can get more in category differentiation based on target engagement, safety profile, et cetera. But here, again, we have the most advanced program, and as Dan highlighted today, a follow-on program to add to that sort of portfolio we have there. And finally, one other, I don't know if it's barrier, but certainly is work to do is scaling manufacturing. The volume is really high in this category, probably will end up being one of the highest volume categories in the history of the industry.

Of course, we've been watching this carefully, not really out of concern that they're taking away our business. We've been largely supply constraint here, but rather the impact it's having on patient health. We often are able to secure samples from these kinds of compounding labs and analyze them in our own labs. And what we found for the most part, in most instances is this isn't kind of tirzepatide at all. Our drug is not available to compounders, rather they're purchasing either other chemicals entirely, which we often find or make producers of tirzepatide that is often full of impurities sometimes contaminated by bacteria.

We've taken public positions. We're obviously engaged with regulators and considering all kinds of legal actions and filed some. Of course, compounding is a long-standing practice under the 503A provisions of FDA, which is meant to customize doses for individual patient needs that we don't -- it's not clear to me medically what that would be for tirzepatide. But I guess that's legal in a sense. It's the mass production that's concerning. And we don't see a lot of that with our medicine more with the other one. But I think if we just step back and reflect them why the -- there's shortages because of parenteral manufacturing constraints in the industry and the lead companies. A lot of that constraint is investing and proving those processes are compliant with the GMP standards that the FDA and Europe or NX1 have enforced. And we agree, by the way, with that strict enforcement. So, it's a little odd that the answer to that constraint, which is about raising the standards of the industry to a sterile product is to create another industry that is non-sterile product. So, we're just pointing that out. And I think you can see Lilly on the front foot here over the coming months to address this. But ultimately, the real thing to address is the increasing coverage on insurance and increasing supply. We -- drive on supply. We'll step that up another notch with the availability of vials, and we need to work with primarily the government as well as employers to expand coverage. So OBC medicines are affordable.

This quarter, guidance went up by $3 billion, but it dropped down at a much higher leverage at $2.16 EPS, almost a 90% incremental margin. And my question is not so much what your operating leverage is going to be in 2025 or a forward year guidance. But instead, I'm basically asking if you annualize the momentum of your 4Q numbers per this year's guidance, the EPS upside implied to consensus could be almost as much as half of Lilly's entire full year EPS where it stands right now.

We haven't yet lend in to all of our promotional channels and incretins. You don't see, for instance, TV commercials in the incretins. We haven't done that looking at the -- given the supply situation. And in R&D, it takes time to scale R&D thoughtfully. So, it doesn't always move exactly in sync quarter-by-quarter with revenue. That said, our guidance for the year does indicate we will stay in the upper 30% range for the full year, with growth first half, if you look at the first half, as the two quarters' growth into the second half. And you should also expect to see within that mix, stronger sales and marketing growth as we get to new launches in the second part of the year and the R&D continue to scale the growth from what we've seen thus far.

We've seen some great progress with the launch of Mounjaro outside of the U.S. I think what you've seen in terms of growth in the earlier launch countries, such as the U.K., UAE and Saudi, UAE and Saudi are both key markets that make up rest of world, have already achieved a leading share and continue to drive momentum and overall market growth. And so, as you take a look at Q2, the main driver of that growth has been in Mounjaro in markets where we've already launched earlier in the cycle and majority of that coming from the Quick Pen presentation with a lot of that in the UAE. Some of that is channel dynamics similar to the U.S. At the same time, if you take a look at Q2 and the trajectory for Q2 relative to historical peak sales of any of our brand, has already surpassed that with a limited number of markets where we've launched. And so, as we look at the coming quarters, obviously, we just recently launched in Germany and now also Spain with Quick Pen presentation. We'll also look and monitor the demand and also supply capacity and expect to launch in new markets.

We're really excited about the opportunity to help patients suffering from NASH. I think the data that we shared in Phase 2 for tirzepatide appetite is really quite profound in terms of the size of effect we can have. There's a couple of issues in mass drug development that we're trying to tackle, probably the most significant of which is current standard of liver biopsy to identify the patients to enroll in these trials and also then measure the outcome. Liver biopsy is obviously an invasive procedure and difficult to find patients to consent to these trials and of course, there's risk to patients. We're working hard to develop noninvasive biomarkers that can be used to identify the right patients to enroll in mass studies and also potentially could be used as an outcome to know if a drug is working. My hope is that we could develop those kinds of biomarkers that could be used both purposes and could be suitable for accelerated or approval of mass drugs in the future. Of course, long-term traditional approval for Astra still requires demonstration of outcomes. So, in that environment, we have two drugs that I think could both be great mass drugs and we'll have to decide whether to invest in one or both of those drugs, depending on the regulatory path we see.

It's more the oddity of your main competitor being also your contract manufacturer and how to resolve that situation. There's also an industry structure issue. CDMOs are important for managing capacity across the sector. And if we ended up in an outcome where that sector didn't really exist, they all became captive of large pharma would really constrain, I think, availability in the development of medicines, particularly out of biotech. So, we've aired those concerns publicly and privately since the proposed transaction was announced, and we're waiting to see what happens.

But in the clinical trials, I think first of all, as I'm saying before, just take some caution on the small short Phase I trials. There's more to see. Most of the drugs that we've seen actually aren't different mechanisms that are GLP-1 agonists. In this class, I don't expect there to be differentiation in terms of efficacy, weight loss. You can pretty much dial in the amount of weight loss you want depending on how aggressively you dose it and what population. Tolerability is another issue that usually comes along with the efficacy. The faster you ramp to higher doses, the less tolerability you have. Then the different companies have to work through their own escalation of dosing to match the desired efficacy with some reasonable tolerability. The variable that links those two things together is often the half-life of the molecule. So shorter half-life molecules will give you bigger peak trough -- in the pharmacokinetics of the drug. And we think that's what -- that drives the tolerability issues. So, what you want is a long half-life molecule that can be dose escalated more smoothly. So that probably will be the differentiation rather than anything that companies are currently talking about in terms of efficacy. As I said before, it's a long road from early data to Phase 3 clinical trials like we have with orforglipron and we can expect some attrition. I'm pretty excited also about next-generation molecule. All of these ones that we've been talking about now are GLP-1s and will offer efficacy sort of in the range of injectable semaglutide. I think ultimately, we'd like to see drugs that offer efficacy and tolerability that exceeds that things that could combine multiple incretins like tirzepatide does and we are certainly working on orals that could also agonize GIP-1, for example.

And when we're looking into the preferences, the true drivers today is still the degree of weight loss and safety and tolerability. And when we look at the needs beyond that, it's actually the need of an oral, and an oral with an injectable-like efficacy. So that's probably the new that comes beyond what we're currently serving today and particularly to serve those patients that have a fear of injections.

We have a molecule Phase 2 called Aloralintide, which is a pure AML agonist, and we're evaluating that both as monotherapy and in combination with tirzepatide GLP clip. So that will be interesting to see. I don't have a strong preconceived notions about what to expect in terms of lean versus fat mass loss with that particular combination. Probably the people who have the most data about that would be the scientists at Novo since they've investigated cricalutide in combination with semaglutide. I think that brings us probably to another mechanism, which is dual amylin calcitonin agonism, which crugilatide probably is a dual agonist, and we have a molecule like that in Phase 1 called DACRA and we'll also investigate that and composition of biomass will be one of the aspects in which we evaluate it.

We delivered strong revenue growth. We advanced and expanded our pipeline and we invested in new product launches and continued expanding manufacturing network. On Slide 5, you can see details of our financial performance and progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 42% after excluding the impact of revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, which we divested in Q3 2023. New product revenue grew by over $3 billion led by Mounjaro and Zepbound. U.S. demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound has been strong and continues to grow as we expand both access and supply. U.S. sequential quarter-over-quarter prescription volume growth was 25% in Q3. All doses are available for order from Lilly in both the wholesale channel and LillyDirect Pharmacy Solutions. The launch of a single-dose Zepbound vials in the U.S. exclusively through LillyDirect's self-pay channel further expanded supply and access in the quarter. And finally, we remain on-track to exceed the production target of at least 1.5 times the saleable doses of incretin medicines in the second half of this year compared to the second half of last year. We continue to see strong performance across the balance of our portfolio in oncology, immunology and neuroscience. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, the non-incretin growth of the company was 17% in Q3. We achieved several key pipeline milestones this quarter, including the approval of Ebglyss in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The approval of Kisunla in Japan and Great Britain for the treatment of early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Disclosure of positive 176-week data from the SURMOUNT-1 Phase 3 study of tirzepatide in adults with pre-diabetes and obesity or overweight. And the recent presentation of positive data from the Phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 study, evaluating different dosing regimens for donanemab. Our manufacturing expansion agenda remains a top priority. In September, we invested nearly $2 billion to increase our manufacturing footprint in Ireland. This brings the total commitments to build, upgrade and acquire manufacturing facilities announced since 2020 to more than $20 billion. And beyond this $20 billion commitment, we also announced a separate $4.5 billion investment to develop the Lilly Medicine Foundry. This first-of-its-kind facility will be dedicated to research and development for manufacturing process design and to develop high-quality investigational medicines for our clinical trials. It will be located in Lebanon, Indiana, a short drive from the corporate headquarters. This investment underscores our confidence in our pipeline and the urgency we bring to bring our innovative medicines to patients around the world. In August, we closed the acquisition of Morphic Therapeutics, adding oral integrin assets to our early phase immunology portfolio. And lastly, we returned over $1.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. On Slide 6, you'll see key events since our Q2 call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other key updates. Last month, we appointed Lucas Montarce as Lilly's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Lucas has 23 years of experience at Lilly and has worked with the executive team and the Board for a long time. So congratulations, Lucas. Now, let me turn the call over to Lucas to review our Q3 financial results and provide an update on our 2024 financial guidance.",551.0,281.0,10.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.03558718861209965,0.010676156583629894,0.0035587188612099642,0.0,0.0071174377224199285,0.02491103202846975

The Slide 7 summarizes our financial performance in the third quarter, which is highlighted by strong revenue growth across our new products as well as our non-incretin medicines. As Dave mentioned, revenue grew 42% after excluding the impact of revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and was primarily driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound. Revenue from our non-incretin portfolio grew 17% after excluding the impact of revenue from the olanzapine portfolio. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 82.2%. Gross margin primarily benefited from favorable product mix and higher realized prices, partially offset by the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio in Q3 2023 and higher manufacturing costs. R&D expenses increased 13%, driven by continued investment in both our early and late-stage portfolio. We recognized $2.8 billion of acquired IPR&D charges, primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic Therapeutics. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 16%, primarily driven by promotional efforts supporting ongoing and future launches. Operating income increased to nearly $1.8 billion driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expenses growth. The effective tax rate was 37.6%, reflecting the unfavorable impact of non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges. Other than the impact of acquired IPR&D, the underlying tax rate was consistent with previously provided guidance. We delivered earnings per share of $1.18, up from $0.10 in Q3 2023. And this includes a negative impact of $3.08 from acquired IPR&D charges. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 46% with volume growing 35% driven by Zepbound Mounjaro and partially offset by declines in Trulicity. Realized prices increased 11% in the U.S., primarily driven by Trulicity, Humalog and Verzenio. While Mounjaro and Zepbound demand remains strong and growing, quarter-by-quarter revenue growth in 2024 has been impacted by supply and channel dynamics. As we highlighted in Q2, increase in supply led to higher shipments that allow us to fulfill the majority of wholesalers back orders, serving as a tailwind to sales. In Q3, we saw channel inventory decreased as wholesalers continued to navigate the complexities of high-volume cold-chain products across a dozen different dose and brand combinations. We estimate this inventory decrease impacted Q3 sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound by mid-single digits as a percentage of aggregate used sales of these products. Europe revenue grew 39% in constant currency when excluding the impact of the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio. This growth was primarily driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. We continue to be pleased with the Mounjaro equipment launches in Europe and are now launched in the U.K., Germany, Spain, and most recently Italy. Revenue in the rest of the world grew 45% in constant currency, driven by volume growth of Mounjaro and to a lesser extent, strong performance of Verzenio and Jardiance. Moving to China, revenue increased 17% in constant currency. This increase was driven by volume growth of Tyvyt and favorable pricing impacts for Humalog. Finally, Japan grew 17% in revenue in constant currency. Volume growth of 20% was driven by uptick of Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. The Slide 10 provides additional perspective of performance across our product categories. Mounjaro sales were $3.1 billion globally, with almost $2.4 billion of net sales in the U.S. We continue to see solid uptake of Mounjaro outside the U.S. with sales in Q3 totaling $728 million. Verzenio continued its growth trajectory with worldwide sales increasing 32%, driven by strong execution in the early breast cancer indication. Jaypirca worldwide revenue was $81 million. When excluding the impact of Japan collaboration milestones recognized in Q2, Jaypirca continued its sequential quarter-over-quarter growth trend, demonstrating sustained uptake in both the MCL and CLL patient population. Worldwide Omvoh revenue increased to $41 million. We are pleased with our progress gaining commercial access for Omvoh in the U.S. As of January 2025, we will have first-line access at two out-of-the three major PBMs. We were also excited to receive U.S. approval for Kisunla and Ebglyss in Q3. The Kisunla launch is underway and progressing, and the Ebglyss launch began early this month. We are pleased to have already secured formulary access for Ebglyss with one of the major PBMs. Worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 22%, driven by lower volume, partially offset by higher realized prices. The Slide 11 provides an update on the U.S. launch of Zepbound. We continue to see strong growth trends leading to sales of over $1.2 billion. We have broad formulary coverage for Zepbound. As of October 1, Zepbound has approximately 87% access in the commercial segment, and we are making ongoing progress expanding our employer opt-ins. We are in the early days of launching single-dose Zepbound vials in the U.S. exclusively through LillyDirect. 2.5 milligram and 5-milligram single-dose vials are currently available to self-pay patient at a 50% or greater discount compared to the list price of other incretin medicines for obesity. This offering helps even more adults living with obesity access Zepbound including Medicare beneficiaries and those without them. Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. On Slide 13, you can see our updated guidance for the full year. We are updating our revenue guidance range to $45.4 billion to $46 billion. The new midpoint range represents approximately 50% growth in Q4 2024 compared to the same quarter last year, demonstrating a continuation of revenue growth acceleration. We are investing heavily in increasing supply of tirzepatide and have been carefully balancing our demand creation activities and launches into new markets with our production to support continuity of care for patients. In Q3, we continued to be prudent scaling up and demand-generation activities. This is the driver for lowering the top end of the range. We continue to expect that we will exceed our goals to increase production of incretin saleable doses by at least 50% in the second half of 2024 compared to the second half of 2023. Now with all the doses of Mounjaro and Zepbound available, we will accelerate demand activities and while there is a lag to flow-through revenue, we expect to see the impact of these efforts in Q2 and into 2025. Lastly, we also expect new Mounjaro launches internationally to contribute to growing in Q4. Our expected ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue remains unchanged on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Other income and expense is now expected to be in the range of $425 million to $325 million of expense on a reported basis and is unchanged on a non-GAAP basis. We have updated our estimated effective tax rate to be approximately 17%, driven by the impact of non-deductible IPR&D in Q3. EPS is now expected to be in the range of $12.05 to $12.55 on a reported basis and $13.02 to $13.52 on a non-GAAP basis. Both ranges reflect the updated mentioned earlier, as well as acquired IPR&D charges through Q3 of approximately $3.1 billion. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.",1151.0,574.0,20.0,6.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.03484320557491289,0.010452961672473868,0.010452961672473868,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025

So let me begin by sharing some late-phase updates, including some exciting Phase 3 data that we shared at recent medical congresses. Starting with neuroscience. Yesterday, at the clinical trials in Alzheimer's Disease Conference, we are pleased to share positive results from our Phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 trial, which evaluated different dosing regimens for initiation of donanemab treatments to understand their effect on ARIA-E. In this trial, we tested a modified titration, which shifted one vial of donanemab from the first infusion to the third, as shown on Slide 14. We designed this modified titration to achieve identical total dose of donanemab administered in the first three months as does our standard dosing regimen, but we hypothesized that the smoother increase in dose could result in less ARIA. We are pleased to see in this trial that indeed by pharmacokinetic analysis, we achieved equivalent cumulative exposure between the modified titration and the standard dosing regimen. And as a result, we achieved similar levels of amyloid plaque removal and phospho-tau217 reduction. Importantly, we also confirmed our hypothesis on ARIA and showed that the modified titration reduced the incidence of ARIA-E to 14% compared with 24% for those receiving the standard dosing regimen. As well, lower frequency of symptomatic ARIA-E, lower radiographic severity of all categories of ARIA-E, and lower ARIA-E and ApoE 4 genotype carriers was observed using the modified titration as compared to the standard dosing regimen. We plan to submit a supplemental DLA to the FDA in the coming weeks for this modified titration. Our efforts on Remternetug continue to progress and we are starting a Phase 3 efficacy study of Remternetug focused on preclinical phase of the disease. Similar to our ongoing TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 trial for donanemab where we are trying to reduce the risk of progressions symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. In this upcoming Phase 3 registrational trial called TRAILRUNNER 3, we are evaluating a fixed duration of monthly subcutaneous administration of Remternetug, offering what we see as a potentially convenient option for this earlier patient population. We'll share more details about the study design of TRAILRUNNER 3 tomorrow at CTAD. Turning to Cardiometabolic Health. Last month we shared data from our remaining Phase 3 studies for our weekly basal insulin called Insulin efsitora alfa. As a reminder, the efsitora Phase 3 consists of five global registration studies, four of which are in adults with Type-2 diabetes, and one is in adults with Type-1 diabetes. We are pleased that each study met its primary endpoint of non-inferior A1c reduction versus insulin glargine or insulin degludec, which are the most frequently used daily basal insulins. In the studies evaluating efsitora in people with Type-2 diabetes, the results demonstrated that efsitora achieved meaningful A1c reduction with relatively low hypoglycemia rates. We were particularly excited with the results for QWINT-1 in which efsitora was administered via six doses using a single-use autoinjector. In this 52-week study in people with Type-2 diabetes, efsitora lowered participants A1c by 1.31% compared to 1.27% for insulin glargine. This impressive A1c reduction was achieved in low hypoglycemia rates. Actually, efsitora had approximately 40% lower rates of severe or clinically significant hypoglycemia than the daily insulin glargine. These data highlight the power of an easier-to-use dose form of a weekly insulin for people who are just initiating basal insulin therapy for the first time. We look forward to discussing the results from the QWINT Phase 3 program with global regulatory agencies. It has also been a productive quarter for our late-phase incretin programs. First, as shown on Slide 15, we shared positive 176-week data from the SURMOUNT-1 Phase 3 study of tirzepatide in adults with pre-diabetes and obesity or overweight, which demonstrated a remarkable 94% reduction in the risk of developing Type-2 diabetes. This is the longest duration tirzepatide data to-date, and we are highly encouraged to see that patients on the 15-milligram dose achieved sustained weight loss of nearly 23% during the more than three-year treatment period and that this weight loss was accompanied by a significant reduction in risk of developing diabetes. We look forward to sharing the detailed results next week at ObesityWeek. These results add to compelling data showing the benefit of the combined pharmacology of dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonism in several obesity-related complications, including Type-2 diabetes, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis or MASH, moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea, and heart failure. We are working quickly to bring tirzepatide to more adults living with obesity and its complications, and we are pleased to share that we expect U.S. regulatory action for tirzepatide in adults with obesity and obstructive sleep apnea yet this year. And that we will submit for U.S. approval for tirzepatide in adults with obesity and heart failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction before the end of this year. Another avenue to advance patient care is the maintenance of body weight reductions. We are conducting two Phase 3b weight loss maintenance trials. The first is SURMOUNT-MAINTAIN, which compares either tirzepatide 5 milligrams or tirzepatide maximum tolerated dose to placebo. The second is ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, which evaluates our oral GLP-1 orforglipron versus placebo after tirzepatide or semaglutide in participants who completed SURMOUNT-5, the 3b head-to-head study of tirzepatide versus semaglutide. We look forward to sharing the topline data readout for SURMOUNT-5 later this year. Next, in oncology. The Phase 3 EMBER-3 study evaluating our oral SERD, imlunestrant, in patients with second-line ER positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer was positive. The study evaluated three-arms, imlunestrant as a monotherapy, investigator's choice of endocrine therapy monotherapy, and imlunestrant in combination with abemaciclib. Based on the results from this trial, we expect to submit an NDA to the FDA by year-end, and we look forward to sharing detailed results at an upcoming medical meeting. The Phase 3 portion of the olomorasib first-line KRAS G12C lung cancer study is now underway. The first Phase 3 trial for this class of medicines in newly diagnosed locally advanced or metastatic lung cancer regardless of PD-L1 expression. This comes after recently defining the dose of the medicine in combination with standard-of-care regimens in consultation with the FDA under Project Optimus. We continue to believe we could have a leading agent in this class and look forward to execution of the late-stage program. Finally, in immunology, we're excited by the recent U.S. FDA approval of lebrikizumab as Ebglyss for adults and children 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Ebglyss provides a new first-line biologic treatment that targets a main cause of eczema inflammation that offers significant early skin clearance and itch relief with convenient once-monthly maintenance dosing following the initial phase of treatment. We recently shared compelling long-term data showing that lebrikizumab provides sustained disease control for up to three years in more than 80% of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who responded to Ebglyss treatment at 15 weeks. We have also initiated two Phase 3 studies of lebrikizumab in adults with perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. As we continue to expand our immunology portfolio to help more patients, we're conducting two Phase 3 studies evaluating Ixekizumab and tirzepatide together in patients with obesity or overweight in either psoriatic arthritis or moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases and can negatively impact disease outcomes. Taltz has already demonstrated strong efficacy in treating psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis and we are excited to see the potential for additional benefits for patients when combined with the significant and sustained weight loss offered by Zepbound. Slide 16 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 28 and Slide 17 shows potential key events for the year. I've already covered our late-phase progress, so now I'll quickly cover updates for the early-phase pipeline. Starting again with neuroscience. We recently initiated a Phase 2 study of an epiregulin antibody in chronic neuropathic pain associated with distal sensory polyneuropathy. We had previously shown this molecule in Phase 1 of the pipeline as an undisclosed mechanism in pain. We also have begun Phase 1 studies on two new neurodegeneration assets, an alpha-synuclein directed siRNA and a tau-directed siRNA. Earlier this morning at CTAD, we disclosed detailed results from our Phase 2 study of Ceperognastat, our oral GlcNAcase anti-tau agent. While neither dose slowed clinical decline in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, biomarker data suggests potential impacts on tau pathology, brain volume and neuroinflammation. Safety follow-ups for the study are ongoing. Turning to Cardiometabolic Health. In the coming days, we will initiate a Phase 2 study of Eloralintide, our long-acting amylin receptor agonist for chronic weight management in combination with tirzepatide in patients with Type-2 diabetes. And a Phase 2 study of Bimagrumab, alone or in combination with tirzepatide for chronic weight management in participants without Type-2 diabetes. We will also be advancing Volenrelaxin, our long-acting relaxin molecule into Phase 2 in adults with chronic kidney disease. We removed the Phase 1 APOC3 siRNA asset in cardiovascular disease as it did not meet our bar for continuing clinical development. In oncology, 2024 continues to be a very productive year for new clinical starts. Since the last call, we advanced three new molecules into Phase 1 studies. Our oral SMARCA2 or BRM inhibitor, our KRAS G12D inhibitor, and our Pan KRAS inhibitor. These three initiations bring the total new clinical starts in oncology in 2024 to seven, exceeding the goal we shared earlier this year to put at least five new potential medicines in the clinic. And we've done that across three different modalities, emblematic of our strategy to utilize therapeutic modality diversification to combat treatment resistance and improve patient outcomes. We expect this new slate of clinical programs will set us up for an exciting 2025 as we look to see which programs deliver differentiated and important early clinical datasets for patients. Finally, in early-stage immunology, we're also excited to initiate several new Phase 2 studies. First, we moved DC-853, an oral IL-17 inhibitor from the DICE Therapeutics acquisition into Phase 2 in adults with moderate-to-severe black psoriasis. And we removed DC-806 from the pipeline in favor of 853, which is a more potent molecule. Second, we are initiating a Phase 2 study combining Eltrekibart and Mirikizumab in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. In addition, we are terminating the Phase 2b study of Peresolimab in rheumatoid arthritis due to the overall benefit-risk profile of the molecule in this study. Finally, after welcoming our Morphic colleagues to Lilly in August, our pipeline now reflects the oral alpha 4-beta 7 integrin inhibitor MORF-057 in Phase 2 for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis and moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Q3 was an exceptionally productive quarter for Lilly R&D, and we're pleased with our important progress we're making for patients across all of our therapeutic areas. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.",1841.0,991.0,34.0,29.0,12.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.034308779011099896,0.029263370332996974,0.012108980827447022,0.0020181634712411706,0.0020181634712411706,0.005045408678102927

We had strong revenue growth across both Mounjaro and Zepbound as well as our oncology, immunology and neurosciences medicines. Significant advancements in our pipeline included approval of Ebglyss for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in the U.S., Kisunla for early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease in Japan and Great Britain, and positive data disclosures for Phase 3 studies of tirzepatide and donanemab. We are confident in Lilly's bright future. We have now launched in major geographies the cohort of medicines that we expect will serve as the driver of our growth through the balance of this decade. That is Mounjaro, Jaypirca, Omvoh, Zepbound, Kisunla and Ebglyss. We expect these products, together with our already launched products will contribute to strong growth of the company in 2025. In addition, we plan to continue to scale R&D and step-up our investment across manufacturing and commercial to support the successful launches of these medicines to help even more patients next year.

Just to kick off the questions, can you just help bridge a bit from the 3Q sales we just saw reported to the 4Q implied results. It's obviously a substantial step up in sales.

I think it's first important to emphasize that the overall performance and health of both Mounjaro and Zepbound are very strong. And then we saw a slightly accelerated growth in Q3 of more than 25% and also the market, the underlying market for both Type-2 and obesity continues to grow. And we took a more prudent approach than we anticipated in Q3, pretty much driven by the need to deliver a good consumer experience. That has been one of our triggers for any investments based upon the experience we faced in the first half of the year when a lot of the calls of our customer service center was about supply, actually more than 20%. We are now down to less than 1% of those being supply-related. So what we are doing right now is that we are investing heavily in our DTC effort, which we haven't done in the past, whilst supply allows us to invest strongly there, but it's not a demand issue. And similarly, we are fully leaning in on all the HCP promotional efforts, also providing samples in the marketplace to providers. So we remain very confident based upon the underlying trend in the marketplace today and also the growth of both Zepbound and Mounjaro in terms of TRx, NBRx, and TRx that we are after a good Q4.",229.0,91.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.04395604395604396,0.0,0.01098901098901099,0.0,0.0,0.04395604395604396

But I think first of all, there is a lot of lumpiness in channel stocking. I think all the sell-side analysts on this call have probably struggled with that as we have, exiting Q1, we can recall that we had a number of our dosage forms on back-order, and we pretty much reached a NATR of supply in the wholesalers. That was kind of restocked in Q2 and then we saw a drawdown in Q3. I think what we really don't control and don't attempt to, but as a reality is that downstream customers from Lilly, wholesalers and retailers, are making their own decisions about which of the 12 different dosage forms they want to stock and at what level. There are some physical constraints to that, cold-chain, capacity is constrained and their financial constraints, working capital that they're managing to. Those are their decisions to maintain their customer service levels. I think what we've done is sort of move our set point of how much stock we want to have on hand before we go initiate demand-stimulating activities, which we had more or less paused for Mounjaro in the first half and never started for Zepbound remembering we launched in December of last year. So I think the in-market data, you guys can all read, and you see Geoff yourself, and we do see acceleration of both brands in Q3 over Q2 in actual consumption. And our estimate is that will continue or accelerate as we add U.S. stimulation to that demand, which, as Patrik said, we're going to begin doing here really mid-November in earnest. And ex-U.S. demand is another factor that affects sales and that too we moved out launches by about a quarter just to make sure we had enough buffer. So when customers want a prescription, they could get it filled reliably. And I think that's an important thing for us to keep that trust going forward. So at a macro-level, is there a demand problem here? No, actually. Is there a supply problem? No, although if we had unlimited demand, there would be. So we're carefully gating those two things together. As we escalate supply in Q4, which, as I mentioned, we're going to beat the 50% growth number, you'll see us grow our demand stimulation as well. And I think that's really about Q4, but even more about Q1 of 2025 and continuing acceleration there. So business is super-healthy. We feel good about where we are. Obviously, there was some choppiness this quarter, but I think underlying growth here is as strong as we would have hoped.",466.0,200.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.01,0.02,0.015,0.0,0.015,-0.01

So from our perspective, we actually don't estimate there to be a huge financial impact of compounding on our business. But our major concern here has been driven by safety, but thousands of people in the U.S. are getting medicine that is not approved by the FDA for quality, safety or efficacy purposes.

And so, my guess is the FDA is concerned about that and they want to win this case and they're putting their ducks in a row to do so. There is an alternate, I guess, perspective that they don't care, but I think they do care. The other thing I'll say is we work closely with the FDA to approve new capacities. And it's important to note here we could do more with them, and we communicate this to them directly. They're not hearing anything here. They haven't heard from you already, but we have invested massively in parenteral filling capacity and API capacity. And a big part of the delivery schedule for that, which can take 2.5 years to 4 years is actually the regulatory process itself.

And I think we've said, I've said that probably the only way that a big chunk of those are served well is with oral products because of the production system efficiencies there versus parenteral filling of proteins. So it's important. Of course, we're in the lead there and we want to see our orforglipron be successful, but we need the data and then submission and launch would put that sometime something like less than 2 years from now. But I wouldn't characterize compounding as a crisis. It certainly isn't one for us. I think the problem is people are being harmed and duped, right? And so that's kind of what we'd like to see stop. But as Patrik said, we don't really see a financial impact on Lilly of compounding. I think that as an industry, we should probably be worried that if this grows and is allowed to continue, then it sort of creates this back to our generic world. But as I said, I think the FDA wants to stop that for good reasons, for public safety reasons and they'll do that. At the end of the day, FDAs use this as a product-by-product analysis. And right now, tirzepatide is not in shortage and therefore for mass compounding should not be permitted. There's a stay, etc. in the court, but we think that should be the state there.

Prior to moving into Zepbound, I think with Mounjaro, we have really good access and it's 93% and I think pretty much where we need to be across commercial and Medicare. In terms of Zepbound, I think we've made progress in record time here, close to 90% commercial access and we continue to see improvement in terms of employers opting. You're correct, we heard stories about some employers opting out, but the major trend is actually in favor of opting-in to the anti-obesity medications. So we are definitely north of the 50% and I think we will have some new data in the first part of 2026 since both the employers are making those decisions effective one-one in the new year to come. So I think we are very, very optimistic in that part of our business, but we're also continuing to make progress in terms of access for Medicaid. And just since we connected last time, we have gained six incremental states for Medicaid and most recently effective 10-1, we have California and Massachusetts. So big states are now covering more than 30 million lives, and we expect to continue to make progress in that space. And lastly, I would just emphasize the potential approval here of obstructive sleep apnea. The approval of obstructive sleep apnea will help us with employer opt-in because we know that outcome studies are critical to convince employers. But on top of that, it also opens up the door for access in Medicare, and with the decision that CMS announced back in April this year, we are confident that we will gain access also for OSA in Medicare.

Yes, I mean peresolimab is a really interesting mechanism for us and we were excited when we saw the Phase 2a data. It was a small number of patients, but had a relatively profound effect on RA symptoms, particularly in patients who had failed the previous biologics. So we sought out to replicate that in a larger Phase 2b study. Unfortunately, when we came to the end of that study, the benefit-risk that we've seen in the Phase 2a study was not fully borne out in Phase 2b. So just based on the overall profile, which includes both the efficacy and the safety of the drug, we decided not to pursue that. As to your question on a follow-on PD-1 agonist, we don't have one that we're pursuing right now. So that's I'll say about that.

Our position and expectation here around market share with respect to the adjuvant setting for Verzenio versus Kisqali hasn't really changed sort of pre-approval versus now. I think we have a very robust clinical data package with a lot of follow-up on our dataset, which is critically important for prescribers and a 2-year regimen where patients can finish their adjuvant therapy and move on with their life, hopefully remaining recurrence-free. That's a pretty compelling proposition. It has been, and I think is recognized as such in a variety of treatment guidelines that for the high-risk population, the monarchE patient population prefer Verzenio over Kisqali as standard-of-care. Those expert guidelines have weighed in over the past couple of months. I don't expect that to change materially. Of course, with a new market entrant, the percentage of patients in the setting who get any CDK4/6 inhibitor as adjuvant therapy could go up and that would benefit us and I expect that there will be some patients for whom Kisqali is a more appropriate choice, but I don't expect it to be a significant shift in our overall market dynamics. And of course, the node-negative population is not where we're indicated and not where we're used and that's a story for them to tell. On the second part of your question around Part D reform, it will have an impact. Of course, there's a push and pull here on the amount we have to contribute for catastrophic coverage being a downside, and of course, the co-pay cap, out-of-pocket cap on patients, and particularly in Medicare where that could be a tailwind on the brand. I think it's hard to know exactly where that will net out. It probably nets out sort of in the neutral range. I don't think it will end up being a headwind or a tailwind sort of in totality, but we have to see how that shakes out. On the last part of your question around negotiation list, I don't want to speculate on that. I don't think we have enough information yet given the evolving nature of all of the different medicines that could be up for negotiation to actually say one way or another, which ones will be there just yet.",405.0,183.0,1.0,6.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.00546448087431694,0.03278688524590164,0.03278688524590164,0.0,0.00546448087431694,-0.0273224043715847

And so, I just wanted to kind of get your thoughts on kind of that being the comparator.

But we are looking forward to the readouts of the orfo Phase 3 trials next year 2025. But I think overall, we see a significant opportunity here. It's going to be the first oral if we deliver along the lines as we saw in Phase 2 with an efficacy along the lines of an injectable along the lines of semaglutide. So I think that will really position us to scale globally. We are avoiding the cold-chain requirements, etc. But also in the U.S., we see an opportunity to further penetrate because we know that even if the experience with the auto-injector, once you have tried it is really good. We know that there is a need there in the marketplace that probably impacts 20% to 25% of the population. So I think there is a huge opportunity to expand. And when you refer particularly to be ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, I think there is an obligation on our side to really better understand how can you best keep patients on treatment for a longer period of time knowing that obesity is a chronic disease. That's why we're leaning in on some of MAINTAIN to see what is the lowest efficacious dose that you can keep patients on during a longer time. And similarly, with ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, we don't expect a major shift led by clinicians from injectables to orals.

We grew our top line, advanced our pipeline and invested in our supply chain to meet the increasing demand for our medicines. Most importantly, we delivered for patients by bringing life-changing medicines to more people around the world. In 2024, full year revenue grew 32% compared to 2023, exceeding our first-time guidance by $4 billion. Revenue grew 45% in the most recent quarter as our recently launched products gained momentum. Last year, we announced positive Phase III results for imlunestrant, insulin efsitora alfa and 3 additional tirzepatide trials. We also started Phase III programs for lepodisiran,  remternetug and olomorasib based on positive earlier phase data. We continue to complement our pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations. We acquired Morphic Therapeutics and announced a collaboration with OpenAI to invent novel antimicrobials. We opened the Lilly Seaport Innovation Center in Boston as a hub for Lilly's genetic medicines efforts and announced a new Lilly Gateway lab in the U.K. to collaborate with European research. We advanced our manufacturing agenda, announcing investments to expand our footprint in Indiana, in Wisconsin and in Ireland. Since 2020, our commitments to build, expand and acquire manufacturing facilities now total more than $23 billion. Importantly, we brought innovative new medicines to patients. In 2024, we received regulatory approvals for Kisunla, Ebglyss, and a new indication for Zepbound in OSA. This progress strengthens our portfolio of new products and enhances our capacity to drive top-tier growth and margin expansion. As you can see on Slide 5, we continue to make progress against our strategic deliverables in Q4. Revenue grew 45% and our new products growing by more than $3.1 billion, led by a strong uptake of Mounjaro and Zepbound. Q4 also saw a solid performance across oncology, immunology and neuroscience. Our business, excluding incretins, grew by 20% in the quarter compared to Q4 2023, excluding the onetime benefits of business development. Since our last earnings call, we achieved several key pipeline milestones. We received approval for a new indication of Zepbound and Omvoh. We submitted imlunestrant for metastatic breast cancer and tirzepatide for heart failure. We also announced positive Phase III results in the SURMOUNT-5 study, where Zepbound demonstrated a 47% greater relative weight loss compared to Wegovy. We strengthened our overall supply position and delivered on our production target to make 1.5x the salable doses of incretin medicines in the second half of '24 compared to the second half of '23. With more patients using Lilly Direct, the uptake of single-use Zepbound vials increased. We had no wholesaler back orders as we closed 2024, and wholesalers have been fulfilling orders from pharmacies at very high levels. We continue to augment our internal pipeline with external innovation, announcing plans to acquire Scorpion Therapeutics' mutant-selective PI3Ka inhibitor program. This transaction will add a clinical stage breast cancer asset to our oncology pipeline. And lastly, we returned $3 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In addition to that, we announced at the end of the year a $15 billion share repurchase program and the seventh consecutive 15% increase in our quarterly dividend. On Slide 6, you'll see a full list of key events since our Q3 call, including the milestones I mentioned here and several other updates.

Performance of our non-incretin portfolio was also strong as revenue grew 20%, excluding onetime payments related to business development. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 83.2% in Q4, primarily impacted by favorable product mix. R&D expenses increased 18% from continued investment in our early and late-stage portfolio. In total, we started 8 new Phase III programs in 2024 and advanced several new assets into the clinic. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 26%, mainly driven by promotional efforts to support ongoing and future launches. This includes U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising on Zepbound and Mounjaro and U.S. launch activities for Kisunla and Ebglyss. We also increased our commercial investment outside the U.S. to support international launches of Mounjaro. Operating income more than doubled, increasing to $5.6 billion, driven by higher revenue from new products. The effective tax rate was 13.2%. We delivered earnings per share of $5.32, inclusive of $0.19 of acquired IPR&D charges. This compares to $2.49 in Q4 2023 that includes $0.62 of acquired IPR&D. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 40% in Q4, driven by robust volume growth of 45%. Zepbound and Mounjaro were again the largest growth contributors, partially offset by declines in Trulicity. Realized prices decreased 5% in the U.S. due to favorable changes to estimate for rebates and discounts related to Mounjaro in Q4 2023. Europe revenue grew 82% in constant currency. We continue to be pleased with the uptake of Mounjaro and have now launched in all major European markets. In addition to growth from Mounjaro, European revenue benefited from onetime payment associated with the amendment of our alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. This was recorded in Jardiance's revenue in Q4. Excluding this onetime payment, Europe revenue grew 61%. Japan revenue grew 27% in constant currency. Volume growth was driven by Mounjaro, Omvoh,  Jardiance and Verzenio. In China, revenue increased 13% in constant currency.  Tyvyt and Verzenio drove volume growth. Mounjaro was recently made available in China and will proceed with a limited launch as supply becomes available. We expect modest initial Mounjaro sales in China due to supply limitations, a more meaningful contribution in the second half of 2025. Revenue in the rest of the world grew 46% in constant currency, driven by volume growth of Mounjaro and Verzenio. Slide 10 provides an update on our performance of new and growth products. New products more than doubled in Q4 to $5.6 billion, led by global Mounjaro sales of $3.5 billion and U.S. Zepbound sales of $1.9 billion. U.S. Zepbound performance is going very well. We began promotional activities this quarter, and we continue to see strong uptake. In Q4, Zepbound became the market leader in the anti-obesity market as measured by new prescriptions. As shown on slide 11, we combined U.S. incretin analog market, grew 45% compared to Q4 2023. We increased 3 percentage points in share of market in Q4 2024. Jaypirca worldwide revenue was $114 million, adding another solid quarter of sequential revenue growth. Worldwide Omvoh revenue increased to $57 million. With the recent FDA approval in Crohn's disease, we look to drive broader use in an additional patient population. The Kisunla launch is progressing well and prescriptions in the U.S. have been steadily increasing. While it is early, we saw positive momentum across key indications -- key indicators, including volume of diagnostic ordered, access in priority integrated health systems, coverage by Medicare and commercial plans and number of infusion sites placing orders. We are encouraged by the launch of Ebglyss in the U.S. We saw early positive receptivity and high levels of physician engagement. In addition, we expect commercial access with 2 of the largest pharma benefit managers beginning in March. We now plan on accelerating investment in commercial activities to drive new patient start. Growth products also performed well as revenue increased by 13% compared to Q4 2023. Verzenio's growth trajectory continued as U.S. total prescription grew by 15%. In addition to strong execution in the early breast cancer indication, Verzenio revenue benefited from increased U.S. wholesaler stocking at year-end. Worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 25%, driven by Mounjaro switches and to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. Moving to Slide 13 and 14, I will discuss our 2025 financial guidance. As previously shared, we expect 2025 revenue to be between $58 million and $61 billion. The midpoint represents approximately 32% growth compared to 2024. We anticipate continued U.S. incretin class growth, consistent with the trajectory of total prescriptions seen in 2024. We expect to launch Mounjaro in new markets outside the U.S. and Europe throughout the year. Mounjaro international revenue will contribute to overall performance more significantly in the second part of 2025. Given the uptake of newer incretins, we expect Trulicity volume to continue declining as fewer new patients are starting on Trulicity. We expect oncology, neuroscience and immunology to also grow revenue in 2025 as Ebglyss, Jaypirca, Omvoh and Kisunla launch upticks continue. At the portfolio level, we anticipate foreign exchange to be a headwind as the dollar has strengthened relative to other currencies. In addition, we forecast overall net prices to decline by mid- to high single digits in percentage terms, including U.S. Part D changes. We continue expanding our manufacturing capacity and estimate to produce 1.6x the amount of incretin salable doses during the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024. Our facility in Concord is anticipated to begin shipping medicines this year, and we plan to make continued progress on expanding our manufacturing network. Our expected ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue is expected to be between 41.5% and 43.5%. At the midpoint, this reflects approximately 340 basis points of margin expansion compared to 2024. In SG&A, we will continue to invest behind our new launches, including direct-to-consumer efforts in the U.S. to drive new patient activation. In addition, we plan to increase investment outside the U.S. to support the launches of Mounjaro in new and existing markets. In R&D, we plan to accelerate our investment in early and late-stage activities. As Dan will share later, we started 8 new Phase III programs in 2024 and anticipate that investment in those programs will ramp as the studies enroll patients. We also plan to initiate new Phase III programs in 2025. While we keep a high bar for what we advance into clinical trial development, we expect to scale our investment in R&D this year. Other expenses is expected to be $600 million to $700 million, driven by interest expense. We estimate our effective tax rate to be approximately 16%. Earnings per share or EPS is expected to be $22.50 and $24 on a non-GAAP basis. This doesn't include a forecast for charges related to IPR&D. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D and to provide an overview of potential key events we expect in 2025.",1171.0,617.0,16.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,6.0,0.02593192868719611,0.008103727714748784,0.011345218800648298,0.0016207455429497568,0.0,0.017828200972447326

I'll cover pipeline progress in Q4, then the 2024 key events and finally, provide potential key events for 2025. Since our last earnings call, 2 new indications were approved in the U.S., Zepbound for obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity and Omvoh for moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Both approvals are important milestones and mark an expansion in the number of patients who can benefit from each of these medicines. Moving to regulatory submissions. We completed submissions in the U.S. and EU for tirzepatide for heart failure and global submissions for imlunestrant for metastatic breast cancer and for Jaypirca with the BRUIN CLL-321 data. I'm also pleased to share that we've submitted an update to the Kisunla U.S. label to include the dosing modification data from TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6, and the FDA has granted the submission a priority review. In our Phase III portfolio, we initiated a new program for Orforglipron in obstructive sleep apnea. This program includes 2 studies under the same master protocol to evaluate if people with obstructive sleep apnea and obesity can benefit from Orforglipron. After Zepbound was approved in the U.S. as the first and only prescription medicine for obstructive sleep apnea, we're excited to explore if an oral GLP-1 can also deliver a benefit in this disease. Earlier in the pipeline, we advanced the second oral GLP-1 into Phase II in obesity and advanced Eltrekibart into Phase II for ulcerative colitis. Three Phase II assets and 1 Phase I asset have been discontinued based on clinical readouts. In Q4, we also began Phase I studies for 4 new molecules, 1 in each of our therapeutic areas. Q4 capped off a productive year of advancing new medicines at Lilly. In total, over the year, we started 8 new Phase III programs. We disclosed Phase III data from 21 trials, including 17 major publications in top-tier medical journals. We received regulatory approvals for 2 new medicines, Ebglyss and Kisunla as well as many new indications around the world. And we added 14 new programs to the early phase pipeline. On Slide 16, we detail these outcomes for our 2024 milestones. I'm pleased that nearly all of our anticipated milestones came to fruition positively in 2024. Turning our focus to 2025. Slide 17 shows key R&D milestones we expect this year. Starting with our late-stage portfolio, we expect to initiate 2 new Phase III programs this year. First, in oncology, we'll begin an adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer Phase III program for our KRAS G12C inhibitor, olomorasib, building on its ability to be administered with immunotherapy. Our current metastatic program is progressing well, and we've aligned with the FDA on our Phase III dose through the Project Optimus pathway. We shared a clinical update at the World Conference on Lung Cancer last fall, and we are encouraged by the ability to safely combine olomorasib with other agents. Our new Phase III program will focus on moving to an earlier setting and combining with existing approved agents in both resectable and unresectable KRAS G12C mutant lung cancer to prevent cancer from recurring. The second program is in cardiometabolic health, where we plan to initiate a Phase III trial for Orforglipron in hypertension, adding to the ongoing trials in type 2 diabetes, obesity and obstructive sleep apnea. I'm excited that this year, we're looking forward to reading out multiple Orforglipron trials. We expect to see data from up to 5 studies in type 2 diabetes and 2 studies in obesity. Our goal is to generate efficacy, safety and tolerability profile that is similar to that of an injectable single-acting GLP-1, but through an orally available medicine. The first Orforglipron Phase III trial to read out will be ACHIEVE-1, which is a 40-week study in patients with type 2 diabetes. These patients have a baseline hemoglobin A1c between 7% and 9.5% and a body mass index of 23 or greater. The trial utilizes 6 escalating doses in 4-week increments to a maximum dose of 36 milligrams. Based on prior studies of Orforglipron as well as other GLP-1 therapies, we expect weight loss in people with diabetes to be significantly less than in people living with obesity who do not have diabetes. We anticipate ACHIEVE-1 will read out in Q2 this year, followed by up to 4 additional type 2 diabetes trials in the second half of 2025 and a potential submission for this indication in 2026. The Orforglipron Phase III trials in people with obesity, ATTAIN-1 and ATTAIN-2 are expected to read out in Q3 of this year. These trials will form the basis of our first Orforglipron regulatory submissions, which will be for the treatment of obesity, and we expect to occur late in 2025. This year, we also expect data from the tirzepatide cardiovascular outcome study SURPASS-CVOT. Of course, this is an event-based trial, and the time line is dependent on the accrual of cardiovascular events. We anticipate data in Q3. While designed to measure both non-inferiority and superiority compared to Trulicity, a positive outcome in either would demonstrate that tirzepatide reduces the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and would support a labeled indication. Late this year, we expect to see the first data from our triple-acting incretin Retatrutide which combines GLP-1, GIP and glucagon. We believe this potential new medicine can deliver even more weight loss than tirzepatide and could potentially provide additional health benefits. The initial study to read out TRIUMPH-4 is a 68-week study in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who have a body mass index of 27 or greater. We'll also see multiple additional Jaypirca data sets this year. Physician feedback is very positive on experience with Jaypirca in the currently approved indications, and we hope that generating data in earlier lines of therapy will enable broader use within CLL and MCL. We could see data from additional trials in the first-line or BTK-naive settings this year. Moving to neurodegeneration. While we don't have a key event listed in 2025 for donanemab, we're closely watching the preclinical Alzheimer's disease study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3. This trial screened patients with a blood-based diagnostic and utilized a fixed duration of treatment with donanemab. By moving earlier in disease progression, the goal is to reduce the risks of developing any symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. While the current primary completion is projected for 2027, the study will read out when the target number of progression events are accrued. A new focus area for us in 2025 will be to study potential new applications of incretin biology across diseases in neuroscience and immunology. With the pipeline of incretins in clinical development and deep scientific expertise in this space, Lilly is well positioned to match the biologic properties of specific molecules to the desired indications being studied. We plan to start several clinical trials, assessing potential benefits of our incretins in areas that could include brain health, substance use disorder, pain, neuropsychiatry and inflammation. We'll be prepared to move rapidly into Phase III trials based on clinical data and where our conviction is high. Lastly, we expect a number of important regulatory submissions in 2025, including Orforglipron for obesity, as I detailed, insulin efsitora alfa for type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide for cardiovascular outcomes and multiple potential data sets for Jaypirca. 2025 will be another exciting year for Lilly R&D. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for some closing remarks.",1235.0,624.0,19.0,8.0,11.0,5.0,2.0,9.0,4.0,1.0,0.030448717948717948,0.01282051282051282,0.017628205128205128,0.008012820512820512,0.003205128205128205,0.017628205128205128

We finished $4 billion above our first-time revenue guide and $4 per share above our first-time EPS guide when taking IPR&D charges into account. The incretin market continues to grow rapidly, and Mounjaro and Zepbound are both gaining share of market. We believe both products are still very early in their launch cycle. In addition, our oncology, immunology and neuroscience therapeutic areas continue to progress, launching new medicines and delivering strong revenue growth. We have an exciting outlook for growth in 2025 as well. New indications, new manufacturing capacities, new access opportunities and new markets are all tailwinds to our financial performance. We made significant advances across our pipeline in 2024 and have several exciting readouts, which Dan just highlighted, expected throughout 2025.

So I think everyone knows the prescription uptake trend didn't show acceleration, hasn't shown it yet. That's been viewed by some as a concern. Does the 2025 guidance require acceleration? Or can you get the scripts just continue on the same trajectory and the slope of that line doesn't change? When I do back of the envelope math, it seems like that's frankly all that needs to occur.

We have 8% to 7% coverage in the commercial space still. And of course, the employer opt-in is a second step of high importance that made progress in 2024, and we expect in terms of employer opt-in that we are north of 50% today. OSA remains an opportunity for us to gain access also in the Medicare segment, and CMS confirmed recently that they will reimburse OSA if Plan D plans decides to lift it. And they have 180 days to make that decision from the FDA approval, and we're working with plans right now, and we anticipate to get some Medicare coverage by the second half of this year.

We've been in supply since August and FDA took us off the list formally later in Q4. Of course, the compounding associations are suing to delay that. We opposed that and joined that suit. I think the next date coming up is February 18, where the FDA said that's when you need to stop one form of compounding. Our position has been clear all along. We don't think there's a place for this because we have full supply, and there's no reason to have non-approved kind of illegitimate product out there. So of course, new sheriff in town, new government and court case pending. So we don't know the outcome of all that. But that all said, I mean, I think our business is growing nicely in Q4, and we can see that in prescription trends early this year.

Different payers will make different decisions at different times. And I think the data sets you mentioned will be some of the more compelling to create moves, but still then the way affordability and budget constraints, et cetera.

And then an important leading indicator is the diagnostics front, and those results also continue to be encouraging, and its use is more than doubling in the last year and the use of blood diagnostics grows significantly each month as well. The true challenge here is the system -- health care systems' readiness and I think most critically, the capacity to detect and diagnose patients. And so we have a number of solutions that we're working on with the health care providers to help them increase that capacity, increase the throughput for patients, a lot of educational series as well on how to quickly diagnose and treat these patients. Importantly, I think we're hearing a lot of enthusiasm about the profile of Kisunla, and that actually helps with these capacity constraints, the once-monthly infusions, the ability to stop dosing once plaque is cleared, all of those physicians have told us are going to help with some of these capacity constraints. So it's been a strong start so far. We learned lessons from the first launch that went out there and applying that learning to what we're doing now.

I've never had the apology upfront, so I appreciate that. I know why you're asking it. And I think the perspective we have is that it's early days on a very, very large opportunity. There's turbulence. I'll own that. We always seek to put projections out that we can hit with confidence, but that are also within the range of possibilities. And in the back half of that year -- last year, we fell short of that. But everything we've said is true, and we continue to believe in that this is a market with hundreds of millions of people globally that there is a unique thing here and that we can both prevent a large portion of chronic disease with obesity drugs. And last year, we saw proof points on that from Lilly and our competitor that's not just weight loss that translates into chronic disease outcomes. You'll hear and see more of that. And people love taking these drugs. We know that because when we run out, which we did last year, they get very angry with us. And so I have been a person who represents to the Board, the CapEx decisions, I have zero doubt that we have still more building to do and that the capacity we put in the ground so far is not sufficient to meet global demand. You'll hear more about that from us. Of course, as highlighting on this call, we're getting close to, I think, a relief valve on that, which is the idea that you could have an oral which is scalable in a way that injectable systems just aren't really test the question legitimately what is the edge of the demand curve. But we don't think we're close to it right now. We're still gating promotion and gating launches globally. That's a different thing, and we're building facilities as fast as we can to match up those 2 things, what we can make and what we can sell, and although we're supplying the U.S. market well right now, we'll need to do more, and I'm pretty confident in that.

Could that be a reasonable comp for the obesity studies in '26, unlike what you flagged with ortho and diabetes?",78.0,33.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.06060606060606061,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.0,-0.06060606060606061

You're probably noticing that the osteoarthritis trial is shorter than any of the other ones. We've commented before that retatrutide is going to need longer trials. Most of ours are 80-week plus trials to reach maximal efficacy. This is a 68-week trial. I think we also know, at least by analogy from the semaglutide trials that looked at osteoarthritis and obesity versus a more pure obesity population that even for similar length studies, there's a diminution of efficacy in terms of weight loss in the OA population for a number of reasons, including different baseline demographics, male, female, BMI, et cetera. So I think we know how to extrapolate out from the OA population to the general population, but I don't think you should take the OA population as a point estimate for what will be achieved in a broader obesity population. We should do quite a bit better than that.",169.0,78.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.05128205128205128,0.01282051282051282,0.0,0.0,-0.02564102564102564

I think our thesis here has been in combination with tirzepatide that we could get incremental weight loss or perhaps a similar weight loss. But as you point out, with preservation of what we call lean mass. I think to really show a benefit for combining the 2 drugs, we're probably going to either need to see the incremental weight loss or we're going to need to see some real functional benefits to lean mass preservation. I think just lean mass on its own, we don't really know how to understand that, and we've previously noted that we don't see any signs that lean mass changes on tirzepatide or to my knowledge, on any incretin are actually adverse in any way. On the other hand, growing muscle could be a positive in different ways. So we're looking for new positive effects with bimagrumab.

We increased our revenue, advanced our pipeline, invested to drive future growth and shared the first Phase 3 clinical data from our oral GLP-1 or orforglipron. Dan will share more details during the R&D update, but we're pleased with the results from the GLP-1trial for orforglipron in patients with Type 2 diabetes. These data met our expectations and are the first step to delivering our overall goal for the program, which is to create a medicine that offers injectable GLP-1 like efficacy, safety and tolerability with the convenience of a once daily pill that can be manufactured at scale to meet global demand. This scientific breakthrough has the potential to eventually impact hundreds of millions of people around the world with chronic diseases. And we expect Phase 3 data from seven global clinical trials to read out over the next 12 months across Type 2 diabetes and obesity. We also expect potential regulatory submissions for obesity to begin worldwide by the end of 2025. On Slide 6, we list Q1 financial metrics and highlight progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 45% compared to Q1 of 2024. Our key products defined as Ebglyss, Jaypirca, Kisunla, Mounjaro, Omvoh, Verzenio and Zepbound grew by more than $4 billion and now account for $7.5 billion of revenue for the company. In addition to the orforglipron readout, we achieved several other key pipeline milestones this quarter. They include the approval of Jaypirca in the EU for CLL, the approval of Omvoh in the U.S, EU and Japan for Crohn's disease and the initiation of a Phase three program for Olomorasib in resected adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer. We also shared plans to more than double our manufacturing investment in the U.S. In total, we've announced over $50 billion of new U. S. manufacturing investments since 2020, including our most recent announcement to build four new facilities, of which three will be API or active pharmaceutical ingredient facilities. Lastly, we distributed $1.3 billion to dividends in the first quarter and executed a $1.2 billion share repurchase. We realize there's a lot of investor focus right now on tariffs and trade, so I'll make a few comments that reflect our current views on these complex and quite dynamic matters. We support the U.S. Government's goals to increase domestic investment. However, we don't believe tariffs are the right mechanism. Enhanced tax incentives and or the extension of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act are better tools to achieve their goals. The announced tariffs currently in effect do not materially change Lilly's 2025 financial outlook. However, the expansion of tariffs in other geographies or increases in retaliatory tariffs would have a negative effect on Lilly and for our industry. As a company, Lilly has a large U.S. manufacturing footprint with 10 active projects ongoing to build and expand new sites. Upon completion of our manufacturing agenda, we'll be able to supply medicines for the U.S. market entirely from U.S. facilities, as well as increase the volume of medicines we export. We will continue to execute our U.S. manufacturing agenda. However, we urge the administration to negotiate deals with key trading partners as soon as possible that level the playing field for American exporters like Lilly and remove harmful tariffs and non-tariff market access barriers in the developed economies. Now I'll turn the call over to Lucas to review our Q1 financial results.",577.0,288.0,9.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,0.03125,0.017361111111111112,0.006944444444444444,0.003472222222222222,0.0,0.013888888888888888

As shown on Slide 7, Q1 was another strong quarter of financial performance with revenue growing 45% compared to Q1 2024, driven by our key products. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 83.5% in Q1, an increase of 1 percentage points versus the same quarter last year. Gross margin was positively impacted by improved production costs and favorable product mix, which were partially offset by lower realized prices. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 26% as we invested in promotional activities to support new launches across our therapeutic areas. R&D expenses increased 8%, driven by higher development expenses for late stage assets and additional investments in early stage research. In Q1, we recognized acquired IP R&D charges of $1.57 billion primarily related to the previously announced acquisition of Scorpion Therapeutics PI3Kα inhibitor program. In total, IP R&D charges negatively impacted earnings per share by $1.72. Our non-GAAP performance margin, which we define as gross margin less R&D, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue was 42.6%, an increase of over 11 percentage points from Q1 2024. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 20.2%. The Q1 tax rate was negatively impacted by the previously described non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $3.34 in Q1, inclusive of the negative impact of $1.72 from acquired IPR&D charges. This compares to earnings per share of $2.58 in Q1 2021, inclusive of $0.10 of prior IPR&D charges. On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 49% in Q1, driven by strong volume growth of our key products, including Zepbound and Mounjaro, partially offset by a 7% decline in price. Moving to Europe, revenue increased 71% in constant currency. Q1 2025 was positively impacted by a onetime benefit of $370 million related to further restructuring our alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim. Excluding this benefit, constant currency revenue grew 46%, driven primarily by Mounjaro, partially offset by a 7% decline in price. Japan revenue grew 15% in constant currency with volume growing 16%, driven by Mounjaro and Jardiance. Moving to China, Q1 revenue increased 21% in constant currency. Volume growth was primarily driven by Mounjaro. As a reminder, we recently initiated a limited Mounjaro launch in China with expectation to gradually increase commercial launch in the second half of 2025 as supply becomes available. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 17% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume growth from Mounjaro and to a lesser extent Verzenio. Slide 9 provides an update on the performance of our key products. Beginning with immunology, we have seen encouraging U.S. uptake of Ebglyss in atopic dermatitis. New patient starts are increasing and we are making good progress securing access and reimbursement. Ebglyss is currently covered by two of the largest pharmacy benefit managers and we expect further access improvement later this year. As of May 1, Ebglyss will be reimbursed on plans that account for 60% of people who are commercially insured. For Omvoh, we have received approval of Crohn's disease across the globe as a second indication. Commercial activities is going to drive new patient starts in this larger patient population. Moving to oncology, Jaypirca was recently approved in Europe for relapsed or refractory CLL in patients who previously treated with a BTK inhibitor. We anticipate launches beginning in Q2. We also expect readouts from additional global Phase 3 trials later this year, which we believe will be important to evaluate Jaypirca in earlier settings of CLL, including a head to head comparison with ibrutinib. Verzenio global sales grew 10% in Q1, as Verzenio continues to be the standard of carrying high risk early breast cancer. As expected, we have seen some impact from competition in early breast cancer. However, Verzenio share of market in high risk early breast cancer is stable and total prescription to continue to grow. U.S. prescription grew by 7% in Q1, partially offset by the wholesaler inventory destocking in the quarter. International volumes for Verzenio grew 30% in Q1. Within neuroscience, Kisunla is now approved in 12 countries. We have seen a steady increase in the use of blood based biomarkers, the conversion rates from diagnosis to treatment and the number of new patients starting treatment in both the U.S. And Japan. While it is encouraging to see progress, we do still expect that it will take some time to build this market. We expect U.S. regulatory action for the modified dose enrichment for Kisunla in the next few months. Finally, moving to Cardiometabolic Health, both Mounjaro and Zepbound posted a strong revenue growth. Mounjaro sales were $3.8 billion more than double the same quarter last year. In the U.S, Mounjaro exited Q1 as the market leader in new prescription within diabetes incretin analogs. Outside the U.S, Mounjaro has launched in over 40 countries and Q1 was another quarter of steady sequential growth. We recently launched in India and Mexico and plan to continue with additional country throughout 2025. Our focus internationally is on seeking reimbursement for Type 2 diabetes and developing the ecosystem to treat obesity as a chronic disease. Zepbound performance was also robust, as sales increased by $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion in the quarter. Zepbound is the U.S. branded anti-obesity market leader in both total prescription and new prescription, reaching 60% and 74% respectively at the end of Q1. We also launched higher dose Zepbound vials adding two additional doses for patients to access Zepbound through the self-pay channel. The uptake of Zepbound Vials has been strong and Vials accounted for approximately 10% of total prescription and 25% of new prescriptions in Q1. On Slide 10 is an update on trends in the U.S. incretin analog market, which includes incretin prescriptions in both Type 2 diabetes and obesity. Q1 was another quarter of steady market growth as total prescriptions grew by 46% compared to Q1 2024. Leading performance was strong as a four week rolling average share of market increased by 5 percentage points compared to Q4 2024 and by 10 percentage points compared to the same quarter last year. On Slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. Moving to Slide 12 is our updated 2025 financial guidance. Our performance in Q1 was strong and we are encouraged by the underlying trends we saw across our portfolio of medicines. As a result, we are reaffirming our revenue and performance margin guidance. Our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is unchanged, except for Q1 charges related to acquire IPR&D. As Dave mentioned, the situation regarding trade and tariffs remains dynamic. We continue to monitor the external environment. However, we estimate that the announced tariff currently in effect will have a limited impact financially, which we have absorbed within our 2025 guide. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.",1117.0,595.0,21.0,6.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,0.03529411764705882,0.010084033613445379,0.010084033613445379,0.0016806722689075631,0.0,0.025210084033613446

I'll start with key data from our recently completed orforglipron Phase 3 trial and provide some context on our development plans and timelines for this important molecule. I previously said that our hypothesis was that orforglipron could deliver efficacy, safety and tolerability similar to the best seen for available GLP-1 monotherapy injectables. I believe the results from ACHIEVE-1 trial support that hypothesis. Let me start with efficacy. Beginning on Slide 13, you can see the reduction of 1.3% to 1.6% for hemoglobin A1c. Given the relatively low baseline of 8 in this 40 week monotherapy study, patients on the two highest doses ended the study with a mean A1c of about 6.5%, similar to the lowest levels achieved in trials of other monotherapy GLP-1 agonists. In fact, with orforglipron more than 65% of patients achieved an A1c less than or equal to 6.5%, which is below the American Diabetes Association's defined threshold for diabetes. In a key secondary endpoint, orforglipron also helped people with diabetes lose approximately 16 pounds or 7.9% of their body weight at the highest dose. These data are in line with weight loss demonstrated with existing injectable GLP-1s in patients with diabetes, especially when considering the baseline weight and other demographic factors in this trial. Given that the study was only 40 weeks in duration, participants had not yet reached a weight plateau at the conclusion of this study. This result is encouraging as we look ahead to our first Phase 3 readout in people with obesity that we expect in Q3. Most importantly, we were pleased to see the safety profile of orforglipron in this trial. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, which is consistent with the GLP-1 class. We did not see any hepatic safety issues in ACHIEVE-1. As you can see on Slide 14, discontinuations due to adverse events were low, with only 4% to 8% of patients discontinuing orforglipron due to adverse events. The slow and stepwise dose escalation we utilized in Phase 3, combined with the relatively long, about 24-hour half-life of this molecule, resulted in a tolerability profile that matched our expectations and was consistent with weekly injectable GLP-1s. The ACHIEVE-1 full results will be presented at the ADA's 85th Scientific Sessions and will be published in a peer reviewed journal. This was the first of several Phase 3 trials that we'll read out for orforglipron. On Slide 15, you can see how ACHIEVE-1 fits into the broader orforglipron development program. Over the next 12 months, we expect to get results from four additional diabetes trials, where we're studying orforglipron compared to insulin and head to head versus other oral diabetes medicines. We also expect to get results in our two obesity Phase 3 trials, one trial in people with obesity without diabetes and a second trial in people with obesity and diabetes. Assuming success in these Phase 3 programs, we plan to submit orforglipron for obesity in Q4 later this year, followed by Type 2 diabetes in the first half of 2026. We also have an ongoing Phase 3 trial in obesity in the maintenance obesity and we will initiate a Phase 3 trial in hypertension later this quarter. We look forward to seeing more data from this robust clinical development program as we continue to find the impact orforglipron can have for patients. Moving on to other R&D updates since our last call. On the regulatory front, following discussions with the FDA, we've withdrawn our U.S. application for the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction indication for Tirzepatide. We believe the positive Phase 3 data from the SUMMIT trial do support an indication. However, FDA indicated an additional confirmatory clinical trial is required. Regulatory reviews are ongoing in other countries. Continuing with updates in Cardiometabolic Health, we're sharing today plans to initiate a new Phase 3 trial studying our triple agonist, Retatrutide, in patients with obesity and chronic low back pain. We're also announcing today next steps for our Oral Once-Daily program targeting lipoprotein (a), muvalaplin. In Phase 2 data we presented last year, muvalaplin lowered lipoprotein (a) levels by up to 85% at the highest tested dose. Based on these data, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 program later this year in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and we're excited about the potential to bring what could be the first ever oral small molecule approach for lowering lipoprotein (a) to patients. Moving to oncology, we've now started a new Phase 3 program with Olomorasib in KRAS G12C mutant resected adjuvant lung cancer. This is the third potential indication that we're simultaneously pursuing for Olomorasib. Across our therapeutic areas, we made good progress in our early phase portfolio and we advanced five new medicines into Phase 1 clinical trials as shown on Slide 16.

Dave, just in light of the CVS formulary announcement this morning, favoring Wegovy over Zepbound, there are clearly some investor concerns about the PBM dynamic in obesity given what we've seen in other big healthcare markets in the past where two PBMs -- where PBMs fit two companies against each other. So two part question. Number one, what is your expectation on market share dynamics in the next weeks and months from the CVS formulary loss? And then second, can you talk to your strategy on how you're going to be navigating an environment where we could see PBMs continue to try and restrict formulary access between Zepbound and Wegovy.",116.0,52.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.09615384615384616,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.019230769230769232,-0.07692307692307693

If we look at what's happening in the market, we're pretty deep into a replacement cycle, particularly on obesity and Tirzepatide, as we've highlighted on this call, is gaining a lot of market share, basically most of the growth in the categories happening with our medicine. Of course, the private pay market is an important segment. We'd like to grow that segment and we'd like to grow Choice and Access in that segment. So we're not interested at all in one of one deals of reducing access and choice for doctors and patients. We want to expand it. So this type of thing isn't too interesting to us, but it's understandable that it can happen and obviously, in this one case did. Our focus is on making better medicines and more accessible medicines. So our orforglipron is a topic today, excited by the possibility of an oral that could be more widely distributed around the world and here in the U.S. With GLP-1 injectable GLP-1 like profile like Dan highlighted and of course, on driving more advanced therapies as well, a combination or triple acting agents like Tirzepatide. So that's our focus. It doesn't surprise me that this happened, and we'll work through it recognizing in this case as well we're talking about the, the templated lives at CVS and probably opt in rates for employers in the templated part of their book are pretty low compared to the national average, just to maybe inform your analysis, and we'll work through it.

For Dan or for Dave, when you look at the positioning of orforglipron, is the ultimate goal to have meaningfully more indications than Tirzepatide just given the oral convenience?

That's guided our thinking on indications that we're pursuing. I think coming out of this readout, we have even more confidence in this molecule and we'll aggressively pursue whatever directions we think work. Combinations surely are on the table where that makes sense for patients, particularly in disease areas where there could be synergy with other mechanisms. Probably there are a number of good ideas in immunology and neuroscience as you point out. Also just a reminder, Geoff, we it's not our only oral incretin.

Just looking at the Type 2 market today, we know that approximately 50% of patients have a preference for an oral, giving everything as equal on the efficacy and the safety side. And similarly on the obesity side, we know that we have approximately 25% of the patients in the U.S. suffering from needle fear. So I think that position us very nicely to be a first line in routine for both Type 2 and chronic weight management. The other benefits as well, I think with an oral here, we can scale and reach patients that is more or less impossible with only injectables. So I think it provides a huge global opportunity for us with orforglipron and also from a manufacturing side, probably a significant benefit as well.

They're trying things on their own now and we'll have science based solution using oral, which we think will be an attractive choice. That data is not in hand yet. We need to wait for that to prove that out. But, I think that that's an interesting segment that will probably grow quite large over time, Chris. The other one is reaching segments of the population that maybe have comorbid risk, maybe not comorbid disease, have overweight but not obesity. And don't need dramatic weight loss, but sustained lower body weight, is an important factor in their long term health. And we'll look at studies there.

The past was really about very high list prices and relatively deep discounts to leverage PBM Access. And we've been very vocal about trying to move away from that past, basically to have a more transparent, closer pricing between list and net. Maybe important to say that based on this morning's news as well. So we price that down at a discount, to the competitor, some meaningful discount on list price, with the idea of trying to squeeze those two numbers together.

It seems like, I mean, a Zepbound versus the Wegovy kind of price war? Or the other way could be, I mean, looking at CVS comments, it seems like a lot of our employers did not opt in and CVS is finding a way to actually provide affordable access to this medicine.

You're just pointing out that the book of business we're talking about is smaller employers who tend to tell it take the templated formulary the opt-in rates already are low. So it is possible that, depending on what price that CVS is going to offer this client, so you get more opt-in. I think that's a net good thing overall because what we see despite the press is when employers opt in, they tend to not opt out. Employees like to be on these medicines. And there's a big study yesterday you may have seen from Aon, which looked at real world data, which is very compelling. Within two years, there's ROI and a 40% reduction in MACE events in the real world, et cetera. So that could be good, as you're saying. On the other hand, I guess, we're focused on innovation and differentiation. We see kind of a mega category here that will have many different choices and solutions. And it seems like the wrong idea to reduce choice. Maybe there's patients who are taking Zepbound in one of these formularies and as of July 1, they won't have that choice.

Now these are patients who have elevated levels of amyloid but no detectable symptoms, and our goal is to significantly reduce the risk that people ever experience symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

So I think we feel confident that additional data readouts coming, of course, but so far, so good. I think with respect to rates of diarrhea, you're pointing out that they were a bit higher in this study than we've seen in previous studies. They were also higher in the placebo rate. I think we might need to move to an understanding of diarrhea rates as a sort of a ratio of drug to placebo because they could be pretty variable depending on the country that you enrolled the trial, and we saw that effect in this study with some countries having very high diarrhea rates in placebo and drug and also the way that's ascertained by the investigators. So I didn't see anything of concern there, but I do need our trials that probably across the Lilly seem to have slightly higher diarrhea rates than others. But let's see what we see in the obesity rate. That's not the main focus here.

I was in charge of it at the time. Actually, we had a situation where we are the follower and what we try to do is go from one of one in a new category 2 of 2. And that's what I think we more or less achieved over the course of the first 3 or 4 years of the brand. Of course, things have changed since then with IL-23s and now a third IL-17 entering and you do see one of ones, but I guess maybe a point to raise here is, that kind of payer behavior is more common in the pharma industry, when you have more than 2 players and when you have product profiles that are clinically kind of close to each other. Just pointing out in the obesity space, it's -- neither of those things are true. And it will be interesting to see how this experiment works. We have more differentiation coming. So I think there'll be more choice needed in the marketplace, not less. It's really never been our strategy in a category to use the payer channel to drive share exclusively even when we had big advantages on clinical profile. I mean Jardiance is an example of that where we always sought to have multiple choices in that class. So different memory than yours, Steve, although you've been doing this a long time as well. And that doesn't mean we didn't have some situations that were one-on-one for Taltz, but it wasn't our preferred position. And frequently, we didn't offer different rates to get there.

Separately, there is an agenda item in the administration to repatriate supply chain and one we support. And then thirdly, there's a question of raising revenue while they're going through a reconciliation process and so far. So just on those 3 things. The 232 review, I think, has merit in the sense that if we look at -- what are really a lot of commonly used generic medications, some of which invented by Lilly long ago or other innovative companies have moved toward offshore sources, single-source sources and potentially in competing countries where you can imagine a future conflict and a potential problem. We see that, too. I think the branded industry would like to help with that problem if we could. Fundamentally, it's kind of a market mechanism problem, where the -- there's no real good pricing available. So there's not going to be an onshore presence until there is. But in the case of emergency, maybe we could work with them. I think there's a big question of whether tariffing that would do anything to move the supply chain. And maybe that's the subject of that review. And we would hope the 232 review would be kind of cabin to that question. Secondly, is the trade imbalance broader thing? And as you're pointing out, so we have a mixed source, U.S. and non-U.S., but most of our non-U.S. is Irish origin, and we're in the process, we made a decision 4 years ago with the Board to move away from just a pure efficiency, whether it be tax efficiency or cost of goods efficiency and move to a more of a resilient position. We've been at this a little while, and we'll continue to do that. And so that will rebalance naturally our sourcing a lot more choices. So I think tariffing that could have a transient effect for Lilly, but probably not a long-term one. We think the real answer there, as I said earlier, is to reduce the gap that led to that problem to begin with, which is really an income tax situation. And when the U.S. was at 35 in Ireland was a whatever, 15. So I think tax reform is key to that, and we'll fix that problem for the long term. Within Lilly, we've made investments to sort of contain that anyway. The raising revenue in general is a separate point and one we point out that our industry pays a disproportionate amount of income tax. And then actually, because of -- in the 2017 Tax Cut Jobs Act, there are provisions for a minimum global tax basically so that we already pay tax on foreign-sourced income. So that really doesn't change whether we move it back to U.S. or not. What that does is it has an effect of raising income tax in the third countries, which it actually has done over the last 7 years. So I think we're well-positioned within the mix of companies. I think these issues are complicated and hard to reduce the sound bites 232 has substance. I think the trend on -- for the industry and certainly for Lilly of re-domesticating is well underway. And we hope we opt get into a tariff discussion. Hopefully, we pass the tax bill and this can normalize.",588.0,262.0,6.0,13.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0.022900763358778626,0.04961832061068702,0.022900763358778626,0.003816793893129771,0.0,-0.026717557251908396

These are important questions, particularly the expectations for the obesity study and probably take some pain again to remind people that this is a monotherapy GLP-1 agonists, not a dual agonist like Tirzepatide. So we need to expect a weight loss that could be seen with GLP-1 monotherapy, which as we showed in SURMOUNT-5, is quite different than what you get with 2 actions that Tirzepatide has. So SURMOUNT-5 was a 72-week trial in obesity patients that Lilly ran that included monotherapy GLP-1 injectable in the form of semaglutide up to 2.4 milligrams. And I think in that study, we achieved about 13.7% weight loss with the GLP-1 monotherapy. This is a similar trial. It's not exactly the same for orforglipron but probably, we should expect to be somewhere near that. I think on tolerability, that study also had about a 20-some percent of the patients, maybe 21% of the patients with vomiting, which is probably the most reliable indicator of GI tolerability in the most consistent across trials. So that's our expectations. Again, it's still to match the best available data from an injectable. And in this case, I focused on the trial that we conducted since we're conducting this trial with orforglipron. With respect to when did the discontinuations and tolerability events occur in the previous study, I think it was pretty similar to what we've seen in the past with injectables that usually these things happen early in the study and when people increase their dose, actually, some of the difference between the top 2 doses was probably just a chance because it happened pretty early in the study when actually patients would have been on the same dose levels during the escalation scheme.

So progress there on employer opt-in. But also in other segments, in Medicaid, we have actually moved from 11 states being covered by the end 2024 to 14 states covering now an incremental state Medicaid that have opted-in in April, specifically for OSA. And on OSA, we know that the CMS has issued guidance that plans can reimburse for OSA, but they have 180 days since the approval, which took place late December last year. We expect some progress in Medicare as well during the second half of this year. In terms of compounding, I think it's really hard to assess the magnitude of that market. But I think a couple of important cuts here, not all of those patients are necessarily on label. And B, that is also a matter of pricing, then we believe that our price point of 349 is actually quite competitive. And thirdly, in terms of the overall presence in the marketplace where we currently have a strong momentum with more than 75% of patients starting anti-obesity treatment starting on Zepbound. So I think we'll continue to execute along those lines across all segments and we see progress being made every week.",259.0,115.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.043478260869565216,0.008695652173913044,0.02608695652173913,0.0,0.0,0.034782608695652174

We delivered robust revenue growth, shared top line clinical data from multiple Phase III programs and invested in several initiatives that will support our future growth. Today we shared positive top line data from the ATTAIN-1 orforglipron trial in people with obesity. In ATTAIN-1, patients taking the highest dose of orforglipron lost more than 27 pounds or 12.4% of their body weight. In addition, the safety and tolerability in ATTAIN-1 was consistent with the injectable GLP-1 class. Orforglipron also met all secondary endpoints in the study, improving key markers of metabolic health such as blood pressure, cholesterol and inflammation. This is the second positive Phase III trial for orforglipron we reported this year, and we're encouraged by these results. Our goal from the beginning was to create a medicine that has a clinical profile consistent with approved GLP-1 while offering the convenience of a once-daily pill and the production flexibility of small molecule chemistry to meet global demand. We believe this medicine has the potential to make a significant impact on human health, and we will now work with urgency to submit orforglipron around the world to meet the global challenge of obesity. On Slide 6, we list key Q2 financial metrics and highlight progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 38% compared to Q2 2024, driven by our key products. These include Ebglyss, Jaypirca, Kisunla, Mounjaro, Omvoh, Verzenio and Zepbound. In the U.S., we continue the robust uptake of Zepbound and Mounjaro, and Lilly gained market share in the incretin analog class for the fourth quarter in a row. Mounjaro also recently became the market leader in the U.S. in total prescriptions within the type 2 diabetes incretin market. Outside the U.S., we continue to launch Mounjaro in new countries. These include Mexico and Brazil, most recently. We have now launched Mounjaro in most major markets. Q2 was also a quarter of continued investment for Lilly. In addition to increasing commercial activities to support our newest medicines we started multiple new clinical programs. While the company is experiencing rapid revenue growth, we're also increasing our R&D investment as early phase program data continues to impress us, and to support our future growth of the company. Our financial performance in the first half of 2025 was strong. And as a result, we raised our revenue and earnings per share guidance. Lucas will cover this in more detail during the financial update. In addition to the results from ATTAIN-1, we achieved several key milestones since our last earnings call. These include the U.S. FDA approval of a new dosing schedule for Kisunla, the positive European CHMP opinion for Kisunla. Announced positive results in the SURPASS-CVOT Phase III trial for tirzepatide in people with type 2 diabetes and heart disease. We announced positive results in the BRUIN CLL-314 Phase III trial of pirtobrutinib in CLL and SLL. And we launched the 2 highest doses of Zepbound in vials in the United States. We announced and closed the acquisition of SiteOne Therapeutics, which expands Lilly's pain portfolio and adds a clinical-stage non-opioid pain program to our mix. And Verve Therapeutics, which adds new genetic medicines for cardiovascular disease with potential to only be administered once in a person's lifetime. We made progress in Q2 and throughout the first half of 2025 to bring new manufacturing capacity online. We produced more than 1.6x the amount of salable incretin doses during the first half of 2025 when compared to the first half of 2024. This includes a significant step-up in capacity from our recently constructed facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. We will continue to bring more capacity online in the second half of 2025 and expect our production capabilities to increase further. We also plan to announce the location of 2 of our new U.S. manufacturing facilities later this quarter. During the quarter, we distributed $1.3 billion in dividends and executed approximately $700 million in share repurchases. Before I turn the call over to Lucas, I'd like to offer some perspective on the drug pricing reform discussion that's going on. While we support the administration's position that medical research costs need to be shared more equitably across developed countries. It's also true that the U.S. pharmaceutical market has significant defects, which shift cost to consumers and increase red tape. These problems also require urgent reform and make apples-to-apples comparisons of ex-factory pricing inaccurate and misleading. At Lilly, we've already implemented several initiatives, which directly lower patient costs for our most commonly used medicines. We operate a direct-to-consumer model at scale through LillyDirect, which provides more affordable access to Lilly medicines. This includes our leading weight loss medications Zepbound at a discount of more than 50% off the list price. We also led in resolving insulin pricing issues in our country by reducing list prices by 70% and ensuring broad access to $35 monthly patient costs, including for Medicare. Negotiated prices in Europe come with broad access, low patient co-pays and without administrative hurdles like prior authorizations. There are also no intermediaries that distort prices, and hospitals do not seek profit by selling medicines and marking them up. If we import foreign price controls and insert them into a U.S. system that isn't built to function for patients, we risk embracing the worst of 2 worlds, the low productivity and output of Europe's biopharma sector with the high out-of-pocket and distorted prices of the U.S. insurance market. Both today's patients and the future of new cures and treatments will suffer along with the United States competitiveness. Of course, we will engage and are committed to working constructively with the administration to find solutions that both benefit patients while preserving the hope for tomorrow's cures and the scientific base that has made America the envy of all in global pharmaceutical innovation. Now I'll turn the call over to Lucas to review our Q2 results.",1003.0,519.0,24.0,13.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,3.0,0.046242774566473986,0.025048169556840076,0.005780346820809248,0.0,0.0038535645472061657,0.02119460500963391
LLY,2025-08-07,2025-08-07,,2025-08-07,2025-08-07T08:30:00-04:00,0,2025-08-07,prepared,,Lucas E. Montarce,"Thanks, Dave. As shown on Slide 7, Q2 was another strong quarter of financial performance. Revenue grew 38% compared to Q2 2024, driven by our key products. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 85% in Q2, an increase of 3 percentage points versus the same quarter last year. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by improved cost of production and favorable product mix, which were partially offset by lower realized prices. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased by 30% as we continue to increase investment to support our newest launches across therapeutic areas and geographies. R&D expenses increased 23%, driven by higher expenses for late-stage assets and additional investment in early-stage research. Our non-GAAP performance margin, which we defined as gross margin less R&D, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue was 45.9%. Performance margin increased by more than 6 percentage points from Q2 2024 driven by revenue growth. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 16.5%, consistent with Q2 2024. At the bottom line, earnings per share increased 61% to $6.31, including of a negative impact of $0.14 from acquired IPR&D charges. This compares to $3.92 in Q2 2024, which also includes $0.14 of acquired IPR&D charges. On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 38% in Q2 driven by strong volume growth of Zepbound and Mounjaro, partially offset by an 8% decline in price. In Europe, revenue grew 77% in constant currency, reflecting the strong uptake of Mounjaro. Japan revenue grew 7% in constant currency, driven by Mounjaro and Ebglyss. In China, revenue increased 19% in constant currency, driven by volume growth of Mounjaro. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased by 1% in constant currency, driven primarily by stocking in the base period related to Mounjaro launches in new markets. This impact was largely offset by volume growth of Mounjaro and Verzenio this year. Slide 9 provides an update of the performance of our key products. Beginning with immunology, Ebglyss continues to perform well in atopic dermatitis. New patient starts and revenue trends are strong and total prescriptions have nearly doubled since Q1. We also made progress securing access and Ebglyss is now covered by all 3 of the largest pharmacy benefit managers that represent 90% of people with commercial insurance. For Omvoh, we are 1 full quarter into the launch in Crohn's disease and are making progress in a competitive market. The new citrate-free formulation is available in most major markets and we are seeing positive trends in new patient starts in the U.S., Germany, Japan and other international markets. Moving to oncology. Physician feedback on Jaypirca continue to be very positive. While still only approving later lines of CLL and MCL, we have seen a strong uptake within the label population and encouraging trends regarding time on therapy. We continue to generate additional data in Phase III trials that we believe will support an expanded label and use in early settings. We recently announced positive results of BRUIN 314 in CLL and SLL, is another positive step forward those goals. Verzenio global sales grew 12% in Q2 driven by volume growth. Verzenio continued to be the NBRx and TRx market leader in the U.S. and a standard of care in high-risk early breast cancer. U.S. prescriptions grew by 4% in Q2 compared to Q2 2024 and international volume grew by 18%. Within neuroscience, Kisunla is continuing a steady launch trajectory, and we are making significant progress in driving health care system readiness and adoption. In the U.S., we are seeing a strong diagnostic growth driven by PET and the acceleration of blood biomarker test. This momentum is leading to more people being diagnosed and accessing treatment. Over 1,500 physicians and 150 of the top health care organizations have started patients on Kisunla. Outside the U.S., efforts are progressing as well with approval in 13 countries. In Europe, we anticipate approval and launch later this year following the recent CHMP positive opinion. Finally, moving to cardiometabolic drugs. Mounjaro and Zepbound both delivered impressive performance. Mounjaro posted $5.2 billion of global sales and exited the quarter with more than 50% of new type 2 diabetes incretin prescriptions in the U.S. Mounjaro also became the U.S. market leader in total type 2 diabetes incretin prescriptions in July and has gained 8 percentage points in total prescription share of market during the first 7 months of 2025. With the recently announced positive results from SURPASS-CVOT, we look forward to submitting this data to global regulators to support a label cardiovascular indication. Outside the U.S., tirzepatide is now launched in most major markets. As a reminder, Mounjaro is marketed as a single brand for both chronic weight management and type 2 diabetes in all international markets except Canada and Japan. While the initial reception of recent launches in Mexico, Brazil, China and India has been excellent, the commercial activities have been measured to ensure demand doesn't exceed supply and that patients and physicians have a good experience. Zepbound performance was strong in Q2, contributing $3.4 billion of sales. Zepbound continues to be the U.S. market leader in the branded anti-obesity market with 2/3 of total patients taking Zepbound. We recently launched the 12.5- and 15-milligram single-use vials in LillyDirect. All doses of Zepbound are not available in the vial presentation. While we want to secure broader reinvestment of anti-obesity medicines, we are encouraged by the uptick of Zepbound in vials. The cash pay vials were approximately 20% of total U.S. Zepbound prescriptions and over 35% of new prescriptions in Q2. As a reminder, effective July 1, the CVS pharmacy benefit manager began excluding Zepbound as an offering for patients on its template formulary insurance plans. This has caused significant disruption to patients, and we strongly disagree with the decision to restrict access to medicines for patients. As demonstrated in randomized clinical trials, incretin medicines for chronic weight management are not all the same. While it's still early, we have seen this decision negatively impact Zepbound prescriptions during July and expect it to be a headwind to the rate of volume growth in Q3. We remain confident in the long-term growth outlook for Zepbound as the most widely used incretin therapy in the branded anti-obesity market. On Slide 10, we provide a view on the U.S. incretin analog market, which include prescription for both type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management. Q2 was another quarter of steady market growth as total prescriptions grew by 41% compared to Q2 2024. Lilly performance was again strong with share of market reaching above 57%, an increase of 3.8 percentage points compared to Q1 2025. While market growth continue to be robust, overall penetration into the addressable population is still low and we believe significantly more patients can benefit from incretin therapy. On Slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. Moving to Slide 12, this is our updated expectation for our 2025 financial performance. We are encouraged by the underlying performance we saw across the business in the first half of the year. We are increasing the bottom and the top end of the revenue range as well as our expectation for performance margins and earnings per share. We now anticipate our revenue will be between $60 billion and $62 billion. This range reflects the strong performance and a tailwind from foreign exchange rates. We will continue to invest to support our newest launches and to develop new medicines. Given our updated expectations for revenue growth, we now expect non-GAAP performance margin to be between 43% and 45.5% as a percentage of revenue. The potential effect of tariffs remains dynamic, and we will continue to update our estimate as the situation changes. We expect the 2025 impact of currently announced tariffs to be modest, and this has been factored into our 2025 guidance range. At the bottom line, we have increased our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share and expect EPS of $21.75 to $23. As Dave mentioned earlier, we exceeded our incretin salable doses production in the first half of the year and expect to bring more capacity online during the second half of 2025. We expect to produce at least 1.8x the number of salable incretin doses in the second half of 2025 compared to the second half of 2024. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.",1372.0,706.0,32.0,5.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,6.0,0.0453257790368272,0.007082152974504249,0.0113314447592068,0.00141643059490085,0.00141643059490085,0.03824362606232295

During just the past 2 weeks, we shared 3 Phase III readouts from some of our most important molecules. I'll start with these. Last week, we announced results from the tirzepatide SURPASS-CVOT trial, where tirzepatide demonstrated cardiovascular protection in a landmark head-to-head trial which was the first ever cardiovascular outcomes trial comparing 2 incretin therapies in people with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It included over 13,000 participants across 30 countries and it is the largest and longest study of tirzepatide to date. As shown on Slide 13, tirzepatide achieved the primary objective of the study, demonstrating non-inferiority compared to Trulicity with an 8% lower rate of MACE-3 events. Tirzepatide showed consistent results across all 3 components of the MACE-3 composite endpoint. We were particularly impressed to see the rate of all-cause mortality was 16% lower on tirzepatide versus dulaglutide. Because this trial did not include a placebo arm, we conducted a prespecified indirect comparison analysis of matched patient level data from the REWIND and SURPASS-CVOT studies. This analysis showed that tirzepatide reduced the risk of MACE-3 by 28% and reduced all-cause mortality by 39% compared to putative placebo. We're very pleased with these results, which show that in addition to the well-established best-in-class weight loss and A1C control, tirzepatide now also provides a cardioprotective benefits and may provide more wide-reaching health improvements, including greater kidney protection and a reduced overall risk of death. We look forward to detailed results being presented at the EASD Meeting in September and published in a peer-reviewed journal. We plan to submit these data to global regulators by the end of this year. The SURPASS-CVOT results reinforce our enthusiasm for SURMOUNT-MMO, which enrolled over 15,000 participants with obesity, and will assess the impact of tirzepatide on reducing morbidity and mortality. This is an event-based study and the rate of accrual will dictate the timing of the readout. While SURPASS-CVOT and SURMOUNT-MMO are likely the largest randomized trials we'll conduct with tirzepatide, we'll still explore additional indications for this molecule. And we're excited to have started a new Phase III trial in people with type 1 diabetes. Moving on to orforglipron. As Dave mentioned, today we're excited to announce top line results from our second orforglipron Phase III trial, ATTAIN-1. This trial included people with obesity, but without type 2 diabetes. As shown on Slide 14, patients in ATTAIN-1 lost on average between 7.8% and 12.4% of their body weight after 72 weeks depending on the dose. At the highest dose, the average participant on orforglipron lost more than 27 pounds, and approximately 40% of people on this dose lost more than 15% of their body weight. We also saw notable improvements on important drivers of cardiovascular risk, including non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure. Moving to Slide 15. We are very pleased with the safety profile of orforglipron in ATTAIN-1. The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal, which is consistent with the GLP-1 class. Discontinuations due to adverse events were low, with 5% to 10% of patients discontinuing orforglipron across doses. There were no hepatic safety signals. We look forward to sharing detailed results from ATTAIN-1 also at the EASD Meeting in September and in a peer-reviewed publications. With today's readout, we've now seen results from 2 large Phase III clinical trials involving over 3,600 participants. And we're highly encouraged with what we've seen thus far. The data from these first 2 pivotal studies provide evidence that a once-daily oral GLP-1 can achieve efficacy and safety in line with injectable GLP-1s. Orforglipron has the potential to be a more convenient alternative to injectable treatments and to be utilized to support early disease intervention in the primary care setting. With these data in hand, we're now working to move quickly towards our first regulatory submissions yet this year. We expect results from 4 additional orforglipron Phase III trials over the next 5 months, 3 trials in people with diabetes from our ACHIEVE program. and 1 additional trial from the ATTAIN program in people with diabetes and obesity. ATTAIN-1 and ATTAIN-2 will support global submissions for chronic weight management, which we expect in Q4. In addition to the ongoing Phase III trials for orforglipron in diabetes, obesity, weight maintenance and obstructive sleep apnea, we initiated a new program for orforglipron this quarter, ATTAIN-Hypertension, focused on reducing systolic blood pressure at 36 weeks as the primary endpoint. This is the first study of orforglipron that includes patients with a baseline BMI as low as 25. We also announced plans to initiate a new Phase III trial in people with knee osteoarthritis pain in overweight or obesity starting later this year. Moving to pirtobrutinib. We announced positive results from the BRUIN CLL-314 Phase III trial of pirtobrutinib compared to ibrutinib in people with CLL/SLL. This trial included treatment-naive patients as well as patients previously treated but not with the BTK inhibitor. Pirtobrutinib met the primary endpoint of response rate non-inferiority compared to ibrutinib and had a nominal p-value for superiority that was less than 0.05. While progression-free survival data were immature, there was a positive trend in favor of pirtobrutinib. Additional testing for progression-free survival is planned as part of a future analysis. Of note, the subpopulation of treatment-naive patients had a particularly pronounced progression-free survival trend in favor of pirtobrutinib. This subpopulation had the longest follow-up which is encouraging for what we might see more broadly across the total study population over time. This is a second positive Phase III trial to read out for pirtobrutinib as we continue to build evidence supporting the potential role for this medicine in earlier settings. We look forward to the readout of BRUIN CLL-313, which assesses pirtobrutinib versus chemoimmunotherapy in treatment-naive CLL/SLL later this year. We expect these data in combination with BRUIN CLL-314 to form the basis of regulatory submissions globally. In addition to our recent Phase III readouts, we also have updates on several other important molecules, donanemab, retatrutide and olomorasib. For donanemab, we had 3 important milestones since our last earnings call. First, we were pleased to receive a positive opinion from the CHMP in the EU. We look forward to approval and launch there later this year. Second, the modified dosing schedule was approved in the U.S., further strengthening the safety profile for donanemab, and we expect the modified dosing regimen to be part of the EU labeling at launch as well. Finally, we shared long-term extension data from TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, which demonstrated that, over 3 years, donanemab-treated participants showed increasing clinical benefit despite most participants having completed treatment within the first 18 months of the trial. In a separate part of the extension study, patients initiating donanemab after 18 months of placebo, also demonstrated disease slowing once they started donanemab. These data reinforce the value of early intervention and support the limited duration dosing approach with sustained and increasing long-term benefits for treatment. For retatrutide, we started a new Phase III trial in chronic low back pain in overweight or obesity, called TRIUMPH-7. This is our second pain study for retatrutide in addition to the ongoing study in osteoarthritis pain of the knee, TRIUMPH-4 from which we expect results later this year. We are excited to announce plans to initiate a Phase III study in high-risk metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease or MASLD later this year. This trial includes both retatrutide and tirzepatide, and it will utilize non-invasive tests to enroll patients who are at high risk of major adverse liver outcomes, with a primary objective of reducing the occurrence of such outcomes. This novel trial design more closely mirrors how physicians diagnose this disease in clinical practice and will enable simultaneous development of both medicines each compared to placebo. In a prior Phase II trial in MASLD, retatrutide reduced liver fat by over 80%. And in a Phase II trial in MASH, tirzepatide led to over half of patients meeting criteria for resolution of MASH without worsening of fibrosis. We believe each of these medicines has the potential to make a profound impact on this disease, and we look forward to initiating the study later this year. Moving to olomorasib. We started a Phase III trial in unresected adjuvant lung cancer. This marks the fourth indication we are simultaneously pursuing for olomorasib in KRAS G12C-mutant lung cancer as part of the SUNRAY-01 and SUNRAY-02 programs. We believe olomorasib in combination with immuno-oncology agents in an early setting could improve the standard of care for patients with KRAS G12C-mutant lung cancer. I'm also excited that through business development, we've added new molecules to our portfolio and new colleagues to our team, and it's a pleasure to welcome new team members from SiteOne and Verve to Lilly this quarter. With SiteOne, we added a new pain asset into our neuroscience portfolio, STC-004 is a Nav1.8 inhibitor that's shown encouraging early data to treat pain. We believe this molecule could be an important non-opioid therapy for pain in the future. Through the acquisition of Verve Therapeutics, we added several genetic medicines for cardiovascular disease that may only need to be given once in a lifetime. The most advanced programs are VERVE-102, which targets PCSK9, and VERVE-201, which targets ANGPTL3. And in our early phase portfolio, we advanced nisotirostide, our PYY analog agonist into a Phase II trial in people with diabetes. And we initiated Phase I clinical trials for glucose-sensing insulin, a PTK7 antibody drug conjugate in oncology and a next-generation triple agonist in cardiometabolic health. We also discontinued 2 Phase II programs, Kv1.3 antagonist for psoriasis and mazisotine for pain, and 2 Phase I programs itaconate mimetic in immunology and SCAP siRNA in MASH. It was a productive period since our last earnings call, and we still have an ambitious R&D agenda for the last 5 months of 2025.

We also know that simplicity matters in this space and the instructions for use here are going to be pretty simple. Take it once a day without regard to food and water. Of course, the data we're sharing today are in patients with overweight and obesity, but we are evaluating orforglipron in a lot of other settings that includes other disease areas like diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea and OA knee pain. We're also evaluating in other context for the treatment of obesity. Right now, we have the ATTAIN-MAINTAIN study ongoing, which is also testing orforglipron as a potential maintenance therapy for patients who have lost drugs -- who lost weight on drugs like Zepbound, to see whether they can keep that weight off.

I was just hoping, Dave, you could discuss a little bit more your views on the path for price with orforglipron and the growing number of assets coming to market.

We've always been concerned about this because of the patient safety risk that exists. And every day, we get calls from patients concerned that they are getting ill on a medicine they think is ours, and it's not. This, of course, was allowed during drug shortage. There's no drug shortage. And we really think that regulators and law enforcement officers in the U.S. need to step up their game to really eliminate this. That's why we have an FDA and a structured regulatory process in the U.S. And so we want to see that, and mostly because people are being harmed. We see robust growth in the marketplace in the U.S., 42% total incretin growth over last year, good sequential growth. And of course, Lilly's growth is more than double that. So we're -- the business is fine, but people shouldn't be harmed. That said, I think on pricing, we've always had a philosophy across all medicines, including with incretins, to price to value. And given the profile we present to consider offsetting other health care costs, including medicines, the value to the patient, the value in the economy as well, and here with GLP-1 and incretin mechanisms, we're seeing profound value, frankly. So we're noticing a difference in when we offer consumer level pricing outside of insurance. But inside of the health care system, which is most of the business, we think that we'll expect single-digit erosion like we do other chronic medications in net pricing, while maintaining a value point on list that makes good sense. That's not considering any new policy environment, but that's our philosophy going forward. So as we have a suite of products with somewhat perhaps more value in patients with more complicated obesity, or those that may be have less complicated obesity, but medicines like orforglipron that could reach the masses, of course, we'll consider those factors in price setting at the list level and then the net will find its level in negotiations. And you can continue to expect Lilly to offer consumer level pricing as long as we have such a large hole in coverage in our country for important chronic disease like obesity that should be covered. Those are our views on pricing.",404.0,186.0,2.0,10.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.010752688172043012,0.053763440860215055,0.026881720430107527,0.016129032258064516,0.0,-0.043010752688172046

Canadian generics for Novo's semaglutide, they're likely to launch in early '26.

Seems to me Canadian generics are just a replacement for that compounding channel, and they'll keep that headwind alive even if compounders get shut down.

As we take a look at our Q2 performance and the health of both the market and where Zepbound has gained share, and we added around 1.7 million TRx in Q2, the overall impact, I think what we've discussed prior is a couple of hundred thousand TRx volume that may vary. It's still early in the transition to CVS and, obviously, that creates frustration for employers, for providers, for patients, and we don't agree and disappointed with CVS decision. At the same time, in terms of impact, you'll have some medical exceptions, and overall, in the context of growing 1.7 million TRx, we view -- and you look at July TRx as a proxy where on average, it's back to around May average TRx, we see continued growth and very good performance across all segments for Zepbound, both in covered as well as our cash pay market. And so we expect continued growth. I think the commentary is more about the rate of growth. So obviously, some new patient starts related to CVS template only may have some impact on growth.

What we disclosed, of course, with the rate of discontinuation in ATTAIN-1 for placebo of 29.9%, and then for orforglipron, ranging from 22% to 24%. We don't think there's anything remarkable there. And we've disclosed these information on previously Lilly programs. I think on SURMOUNT-1, we did. Maybe to put this in a little bit of context, if you look at analogous studies in obesity, really placebo rates are in the 20s. If you take maybe step one, 22% placebo rate for discontinuation and about 5 points lower for active comparator. That's exactly what we see here on the delta. So really nothing remarkable here. The more important thing to look at, of course, patients can discontinue study for a whole host of reasons. They can just withdraw their consent because it doesn't fit with their life, maybe they're not getting the efficacy they need, and that's why we typically see lower rates in the active drugs, which is what we see here, or an adverse event. Now the rates for adverse events, as Dan noted, a range between 5% and 10% for orforglipron. That's exactly where we'd expect to be for an oral GLP-1 single agonist.

I mean just on the discrete question you're asking, I think we believe long term, we should rebalance pricing between U.S. and Europe in terms of who's bearing the cost for really the amortized R&D and the risk we took. That's a rational thing. And it's, in my career, gotten more and more out of whack. So I think here, the President's right to call that out. The question is really how. And as you know, the European governments don't exactly -- they're not signing up to pay more for drugs. So we need trade tools to rebalance that equation. We've been very clear on that advocacy with both European and U.S. governments. And in the U.S., we need to deflate the gross-to-net bubble because there's this huge artificial thing that needs to get deflated. The problem of doing that suddenly is all those cash flows into hospitals and premium support for seniors and Part D, et cetera, you can't collapse it all once, it would be very difficult, I think. So the idea of new products gives it sort of a ramp, but we need these other structural changes on the U.S. side and the gross-to-net environment in Europe in terms of the total reimbursement set up to get there. But we'd be excited to enter that world. And actually, I'll point out in a few cases, we are narrowing the gap substantially on new products. And some of that's for the reason you point out that some countries, reimbursement is just a tough equation. So what's the point of lowering that? So watch that space.

And a lot of that has to do with the consumer journey, and it's varied across different segments where you have significant coverage versus not. And with Mounjaro, we have significant coverage, so over 90% coverage in both commercial as well as Part D. And so I'm not sure if that necessarily provides an additional avenue. With Zepbound we see significant growth because we do have coverage gaps in commercial. And obviously, we also have coverage gaps without having the ability to cover anti-obesity medications in Part D. So we see this as an opportunity for us to meet that need.

We made progress across all our strategic deliverables. We delivered compelling financial results, advanced our pipeline and achieved key milestones to expand our manufacturing footprint. This is all shown on Slide 6. In Q3, revenue grew 54% compared to the same period last year. Revenue from key products more than doubled as our medicines continued to increase their global impact. In the U.S., Lilly gained market share in the incretin analogs market for the fifth consecutive quarter. Lilly medicines account for nearly 6 out of 10 prescriptions within this large and growing class. Outside the U.S. Mounjaro performance accelerated, driven by robust uptake around the world. As a result of our strong financial performance, we raised our revenue and earnings per share guidance. Lucas will cover this in more detail later in the call. Since our last earnings call, we achieved several key milestones, including U.S. FDA approval for imlunestrant under the brand name Inluriyo for ER+, HER2-, ESR1-mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The EU approved Kisunla for early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Positive results from Phase III trial of Jaypirca in treatment of naive CLL. Positive overall survival data for Verzenio in high-risk early breast cancer. Positive results from the second Phase III trial of orforglipron in obesity, enabling now global submissions to begin later this year. Positive results from 3 additional Phase III trials of orforglipron in type 2 diabetes, including 1 trial that demonstrated head-to-head superiority versus oral semaglutide. We also made good progress executing our manufacturing expansion agenda. We announced plans to build 2 new U.S. facilities that will make active pharmaceutical ingredients and the expansion of an existing facility in Puerto Rico. The new facility in Virginia will support our bioconjugate and monoclonal antibody portfolio. And the new facility in Texas and the expansion in Puerto Rico will support our small molecule portfolio, including orforglipron. We plan to announce updates on our 2 remaining new U.S. manufacturing facilities in the coming months.

Revenue grew 54% compared to Q3 2024, driven by our key products. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 83.6% in Q3, an increase of 1.4 percentage points versus the same quarter last year. This improvement was driven by favorable product mix, partially offset by lower realized prices. Research and development expenses increased 27% driven by continued investments in our portfolio. We have initiated 16 new Phase III programs since the start of 2024 and continue to advance our pipeline. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 31% as we continue to increase investment to support ongoing and future launches across therapeutic areas and geographies. Our non-GAAP performance margin, which we define as gross margin less R&D, marketing, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was 48.3%. Performance margin increased by more than 8 percentage points from Q3 2024, driven by revenue growth. At the bottom line, earnings per share increased to $7.02 inclusive of $0.71 of acquired IPR&D charges. This compares to $1.18 in Q3 2024, which included $3.08 of acquired IPR&D charges. On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 45% in Q3, driven by strong volume growth of Zepbound and Mounjaro partially offset by a 15% decline in price. Price was negatively impacted by a favorable one-time adjustment to estimates for rebates and discounts in Q3 2024. Excluding this base period effect, U.S. price declined by high single digits. In Europe, revenue increased by over 100% in constant currency, reflecting the strong uptake of Mounjaro. Revenue was positively impacted by $380 million onetime benefit related to a milestone payment and business development. Excluding this impact, revenue grew 81% in constant currency. Japan, China and Rest of the World delivered constant currency revenue growth of 24%, 22% and 51%, respectively, driven by Mounjaro volume growth. On Slide 9, we provide an update on the performance of our key products, which accounted for $12 billion of revenue within the quarter. Beginning with immunology, EBGLYSS delivered strong performance in atopic dermatitis as U.S. total prescriptions increased by 41% compared to Q2 2025. We saw increased use in the first-line setting, which now accounts for more than 50% of new EBGLYSS patients. Omvoh continued a steady uptake and the newly published 4-year data in ulcerative colitis show long-term safety and efficacy benefits. Within oncology, Jaypirca continued to build momentum both in the marketplace and with new data from Phase III trials. Dan will talk more about this later during the R&D update. Verzenio remains the market leader in the U.S. for the node-positive, high risk early breast cancer population, reflective of its position as standard of care in this setting. In the U.S., prescription grew by 3% compared to Q3 2024 and international volume grew by 14%. In neuroscience, Kisunla total prescription grew by 50% compared to Q2 2025 and continue to increase share of market versus the competition. We also recently received marketing authorization by the European Commission, and we are in active reimbursement discussion across Europe and expect launches beginning this quarter and throughout 2026. Finally, moving to cardiometabolic health, Zepbound and Mounjaro both posted a strong global performance. Beginning outside the U.S. Mounjaro performance was robust. We have now launched in 55 countries and all major markets. We have seen a strong reception globally and have gained significant share in most major markets as a result. While obesity reimbursement remains limited internationally, we are encouraged by the strong uptake. Approximately 75% of Mounjaro revenue outside the U.S. is coming from people with obesity, paying out of pocket, demonstrating a high level of clinical need and high willingness to pay. Moving to the U.S., Zepbound prescription tripled in Q3 2025 compared to the same period last year. While the impact of the CVS template formulary change was disruptive to patients and physicians, the impact on Zepbound performance was modest. Share of total U.S. prescription in the branded anti-obesity market declined by approximately 2 percentage points compared to Q2 2025. However, performance is back to Q2 levels and Zepbound exited Q3 with 71% share of new prescriptions. We saw strong uptake of Zepbound in vials, which comprise approximately 30% of total U.S. Zepbound prescriptions and over 45% of new prescriptions in Q3. Mounjaro posted robust Q3 in the U.S. as total prescriptions grew by over 60%. Mounjaro also gained share of market in the type 2 diabetes incretin analog market, increasing by 4 percentage points compared to Q2 2025. Mounjaro is the most widely prescribed incretin for people with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. As shown on Slide 10, the combined U.S. incretin analog market growth was strong, increasing by 36% in Q3 compared to the same period in 2024. Lilly incretin gained share of market compared to Q2 2025 and approximately 2 out of every 3 new prescriptions in the incretin analog market is a Lilly medicine. On Slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. Moving to Slide 12. We share our updated expectations for Lilly's 2025 financial results. Based on the strong underlying performance and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, we are increasing the midpoint of our revenue range by over $2 billion and now anticipate our full year revenue will be between $63 billion and $63.5 billion. Given our updated expectations for revenue growth and performance margin over the first 9 months of the year, we now expect non-GAAP performance margin to be between 45% and 46% of revenue. At the bottom line, we have increased our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share and expect EPS of $23 to $23.70.

I'll summarize progress by therapeutic area, beginning with cardiometabolic health. Since our last call, we announced results from 4 additional positive Phase III trials for orforglipron. Of note, one of those trials was attained too, in people with both obesity and type 2 diabetes. As a reminder, patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes are less responsive to weight loss on GLP-1 monotherapy than those without type 2 diabetes. For example, in the STEP-2 clinical trial of people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, semaglutide at 2.4 milligrams and 1 milligram resulted in 10.6% weight loss and 7.6% weight loss, respectively. As shown on Slide 13, ATTAIN-2 demonstrated 10.5% weight loss and 7.8% weight loss at the 36-milligram and 24-milligram doses of orforglipron, respectively, aligned with our goal to deliver efficacy similar to injectable GLP-1 monotherapy in an easy-to-use daily pill. This trial completed the clinical package required to initiate global regulatory submissions for the treatment of obesity. These submissions are beginning imminently, and we anticipate launching orforglipron in the U.S. for treatment of obesity next year. We also made great progress on orforglipron for type 2 diabetes since the last call, with positive results from ACHIEVE-2 and ACHIEVE-3. Orforglipron demonstrated superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to dapagliflozin and ACHIEVE-2 and compared to oral semaglutide and ACHIEVE-3. As shown on Slide 14, in ACHIEVE-3, both the 12-milligram and 36-milligram doses of orforglipron were superior to the highest available dose of oral semaglutide on both A1c reduction and on weight loss. People taking orforglipron saw an average A1c reduction of 2.2% from baseline and lost nearly 20 pounds on the highest dose of orforglipron. We also announced results from ACHIEVE-5 which demonstrate that orforglipron has the potential to provide benefit as an add-on therapy to titrated insulin glargine. With 4 positive Phase III diabetes trials now completed, we believe orforglipron has the potential to be a foundational treatment for type 2 diabetes. We now await results from ACHIEVE-4, which will trigger submission of orforglipron for treatment of type 2 diabetes anticipated in the first half of 2026. With data from over 8,000 participants across 6 completed Phase III orforglipron trials, we've observed benefits across multiple cardiometabolic health measures as well as consistent safety and tolerability. Overall, orforglipron has delivered a profile consistent with our goal of developing an oral and scalable small molecule GLP-1 with efficacy, safety and tolerability comparable to injectable monotherapy GLP-1s for treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Outside of the core registrational programs for these 2 important indications, we have several additional ongoing Phase III orforglipron trials shown on Slides 15 and 16, including new Phase III starts for treatment of osteoarthritis pain and for treatment of stress urinary incontinence, a new indication that we think could benefit from weight loss seen with orforglipron. The next study to read out will be ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, a Phase III study of weight loss maintenance. This study is the first of its kind. It's designed to measure the impact of switching from injectable semaglutide or injectable tirzepatide to oral orforglipron. Our goal in this novel trial is to measure what level of weight loss patients can maintain after switching from an injectable incretin to orforglipron. Since the patients in this trial were previously escalated to a maximal tolerated dose of semaglutide or tirzepatide and treated for 72 weeks, this is a very ambitious trial. For those people switching from tirzepatide, maintaining weight loss after switching to orforglipron is a high bar given the strong efficacy of tirzepatide as a dual incretin agonist. As this trial includes moving patients off of an active therapy onto a placebo maintenance arm ATTAIN-MAINTAIN allows patients who are randomized to placebo to switch to orforglipron as a rescue therapy if weight regain exceeds a specified threshold. This will be a rich data package, and we look forward to seeing the results in the coming months, either late this year or early next year. Moving to retatrutide, our GIP GLP-1 glucagon triple agonist. We expect results from up to 6 Phase III studies by the end of 2026 to support the obesity and related complications program called TRIUMPH and the type 2 diabetes program called TRANSCEND. With its first-of-a-kind triple acting mechanism, we expect retatrutide can deliver deeper and more rapid weight loss than existing obesity medicines even more than tirzepatide. Of course, not all patients may need this potentially very high level of efficacy. And we believe retatrutide will likely be best suited for patients with a very high BMI or with obesity-related complications that require a high degree of weight loss. While the global development program for retatrutide includes people with a broad range of BMIs, spanning across overweight and obesity, we anticipate we'll be focused on the clinical profile of this medicine in patients where the clinical needs are at the highest. The first trial to readout TRIUMPH-4 compares retatrutide to placebo in patients with obesity and knee osteoarthritis pain. This 68-week study is designed primarily as a pain relief study to support an indication for treatment of knee osteoarthritis pain in combination with other trials in the TRIUMPH program. We look forward to sharing top line results from TRIUMPH-4 later this year. Given this is the first Phase III trial for retatrutide, we'll be cautious not to over extrapolate from these results. We have 7 more Phase III trials reading out in 2026 and 2027 and we'll likely need to see data from at least a few of these before we more fully understand the profile of this medicine across a wide range of patients. For the obesity indication specifically, we look forward to results from 3 additional Phase III studies in the second half of 2026. Moving now to muvalaplin, which is our once-daily oral small molecule inhibitor of lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a). Lp(a) is a biomarker associated with increased cardiovascular risk. In Phase II, muvalaplin demonstrated over 85% reduction of this biomarker at the highest dose compared to placebo. Based on these data, we've now initiated a Phase III study in people with elevated Lp(a) levels and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, known as the MOVE-Lp(a) trial. Muvalaplin is the first small molecule approach to Lp(a) and our second program in Phase III development against this important target. In other updates from cardiometabolic health, we submitted our once-weekly insulin called insulin efsitora alfa in the U.S. for treatment of type 2 diabetes and we announced plans to initiate 2 Phase III trials with baricitinib in type 1 diabetes. From the early phase portfolio, we look forward to presenting Phase II data from our selective amylin agonist eloralintide at Obesity Week in November. Moving to oncology. We're very pleased to have received U.S. FDA approval of imlunestrant under the brand name Inluriyo as a monotherapy for ER-positive, HER2-negative, ESR1 mutated metastatic breast cancer. Imlunestrant is also being studied in an ongoing Phase III trial called EMBER-4, which compares imlunestrant to the standard of care endocrine therapy in high-risk early breast cancer. This 8,000-patient trial is the largest oncology trial we've ever conducted, and it is on track to be fully enrolled by early 2026. The positive results in the metastatic setting provided an important signal that imlunestrant could have a role in early breast cancer, where we believe an oral SERD could have the largest patient impact. Also in oncology, we top lined the study readout from the third positive Phase III trial of pirtobrutinib in the BRUIN CLL development program. In BRUIN CLL-313, a trial of pirtobrutinib compared to chemoimmunotherapy in treatment naive CLL/SLL, pirtobrutinib demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival. Pirtobrutinib demonstrated the most compelling effect size ever observed for a single BTK inhibitor in a treatment-naive CLL study compared to this comparator. We look forward to sharing these data at an upcoming medical meeting. As we continue to build evidence supporting the potential role for pirtobrutinib in treatment-naive CLL, we expect these data in combination with BRUIN CLL-314 to form the basis of regulatory submissions globally. We also presented updates from our early-stage oncology portfolio at the recent European Society for Medical Oncology meeting, including data on our mutant-selective PI3-kinase alpha inhibitor for people with advanced breast cancer and PI3 kinase alpha mutations, our folate-receptor alpha antibody drug conjugate for treatment of ovarian cancer vepugratinib, our FGFR3 selective inhibitor for FGFR3 altered metastatic bladder cancer. We continue to be encouraged by the emerging clinical profiles we've observed across each of these 3 programs. And we plan to initiate Phase III trials for these medicines in 2026, if not sooner. In Neuroscience, we received the EU marketing authorization for Kisunla. Importantly, this approval came with the modified titration dosing in the label, which is also approved in the U.S. and now approved in Japan. The modified dosing schedule is thus approved in most major geographies and we're pleased that it's being used to further lower the risk of ARIA. Our Phase III trial with remternetug is also progressing well, and we've now completed enrollment in TRAILRUNNER-ALZ 3 which is evaluating subcutaneous remternetug in treatment of preclinical Alzheimer's disease with a similar time-to-event design as we are pursuing with the ongoing TRAILRUNNER 3 ALZ trial for donanemab. Separately, we're pleased to announce that we've initiated our Phase III program in alcohol use disorder with brenipatide, the GIP/GLP-1 dual agonist that we believe could have the optimal properties for neuroscience indications. Growing evidence from real-world clinical studies suggest that incretin therapies may reduce cravings, an observation that is supported by nonclinical studies that show decreased dopamine release in reward pathways after treatment with incretin therapy. Given the data we've observed thus far with brenipatide, we believe it has the potential to treat a range of diseases. We expect to initiate several additional Phase II and Phase III trials in the coming months, including testing this medicine in important but extremely challenging unmet medical needs, such as opioid use disorder. In addition to neuroscience applications, we will test brenipatide in immunologic disease including a Phase II trial in asthma, which has recently begun enrolling patients. Also in immunology, new data were presented for lebrikizumab at the 2025 Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference. Lebrikizumab delivered durable disease control in people with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, when dosing was reduced from once every 4 weeks to once every 8 weeks, reducing the number of maintenance doses to as few as 6 doses per year could provide flexibility and reduce the treatment burden on patients. We've now submitted these data to the FDA for a potential label update and continue to explore opportunities for even less frequent dosing of this medicine for people with atopic dermatitis. While we continue to pursue innovative modalities across several immunological disorders, we're also developing combination therapies with the potential to deliver differentiated efficacy. We recently began 2 new studies combining mirikizumab with tirzepatide in people with ulcerative colitis and people with Crohn's disease. These 2 new studies complement the previously initiated TOGETHER studies of ixekizumab plus tirzepatide in people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We expect the first data from the TOGETHER trials to read out in the next 6 months. Slide 16 shows additional milestones and updates to our clinical portfolio. It has been a very productive period since our last earnings call, and we still have an ambitious R&D agenda for the last 2 months of 2025. Slide 17 shows the remaining list of potential key events expected yet this year.

I think we are very encouraged by what we're seeing outside of the U.S. And the business, as we shared earlier, is 75% out-of-pocket and 25% type 2 diabetes. What we have seen is, of course, an initial stocking in those markets where we launched, and we refer to the big ones being in Q2 being China, Brazil, Mexico and India. Since then, we have seen a lift in the performance also in those markets in Q3 and a continued very strong performance globally. Looking forward, I think the major opportunity is, number one, in type 2. We have reimbursement currently in 8 markets, and we'll continue those efforts across all of the U.S. markets, but that's going to take some time. Secondly, the big opportunity when it comes to obesity is really about patient activation, and we will lean in on all of those efforts also in 2026. When you look at international, it's important to -- while it's one line in the income statement, we are referring to more than 55 countries and there are different market dynamics, different buying patterns.

Of course, Lilly has been focused on the obesity opportunity for quite some time. We have a very strong R&D engine behind it. I think when you look at where the science leads us and sort of every kind of reasonable or logical target to pursue, we have robust programs against those targets. And in nearly every case, I think we have either a best molecule or first molecule or both, actually. So I like our portfolio. Clearly, the late-stage clinical molecules that the Street is paying attention to, we like where they are. But behind it, I can assure you there's a robust pipeline that we like. No surprise then that every -- probably just about every other company in this industry looks at that and wants to improve their own position. So that doesn't surprise us. We watch that and of course pay attention but we haven't seen anything that changes our view about the competitiveness of our portfolio or the lead that we have in this space, which we intend to maintain through robust investments, not just in research and development, but as you've seen today, in multiple Phase III trials and new indications.",210.0,94.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.06382978723404255,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.0,0.0425531914893617

I mean today's call highlights that with some of the new studies Dan highlighted. But it's also important to note, in addition to innovation, you need to execute. This is a highly scaled business and reaching potentially tens or even hundreds of millions of people. And here also, I think Lilly has really done well. It's a combination of those 2 things that, I think, built the lead we have.

I think it's a good move for innovators. It's a good move for patients. It's a good move for payers, for the commercial payers and probably smart of Cigna to make this first move to recoup market share or gain market share. I think that everyone wants more transparency and lower out-of-pocket for patients. And this kind of model will produce both of those. And what we want is to make the basis of competition, one of clinical differentiation that doctors and patients both appreciate in a way, the nontransparent rebates and other behind the scenes activities that determine which medicine a patient gets is not in our interest. So as an innovator, probably the leading spender on innovation in the sector coming up, we're for this. I think David and his team at Cigna did a good thing here. And we hope others follow and the market in the U.S. can rapidly transition to such a system. I don't think that per se that reads through to some pricing effect. What I hope is that more valuable medicines will have that value recognized in pricing and less valuable medicines will have a harder time competing now because you can't just rebate away some number and find formulary position ahead of a better medicine.

As you know, we tend not to comment on interims. As we've shared previously, we have completed enrollment in TRAILBLAZER-3. So now it just continues to be a matter of reaching the sufficient number of events, and this is an event-based trial. In clinicaltrials.gov, we listed date of 2027, though it could be earlier than that. We are pleased, though, and this is what I think we commented on to see momentum and awareness in the space. I think that was really evidenced by the enthusiastic enrollment in our remternetug preclinical study as well. And as Dan mentioned, what we have the opportunity there is to innovate with a subcu dosing formulation as well as a monthly dosing in a -- and again, in a fixed duration dosing paradigm. So we continue to innovate in the Alzheimer's space, and you'll see us continue to commit to that even as we build on the foundation of a very strong Kisunla performance. There's a couple of things that we're doing right now to make sure that we're ready for this readout, I will mention in preclinical because it does require a few fundamental shifts. It requires awareness and education on the importance of treating in that earlier stage of disease and the need to be proactive really around brain health. And very importantly, it requires a simple and accessible blood test to make the diagnosis in the preclinical space, which is also referred to as Stage 1 and 2. So there's quite a bit to do.

Now with 6 Phase III studies in hand, I think we really understand the profile of this emerging medicine. It continues to recapitulate the efficacy and safety of injectable GLP-1s. In fact, Dan recapped some of that during the early part of the call, recapping the ATTAIN-2 data, which seemed very consistent with STEP-2 as well as the ACHIEVE-3 data showing superiority versus oral semaglutide. So we think this is a great profile. You're getting glucose benefits, weight benefits, improvements in blood pressure, lipids, inflammatory markers, all that in a simple once-daily pill with no restrictions on food and water and of course, which we can manufacture and distribute at scale. So we tend to think at a different magnitude about the opportunity here than historically what we've done with incretins. In the United States, there's probably 8 million or 8.5 million people on incretins out of maybe 170 million who might benefit. And globally, that's a much bigger number, probably measured in the high hundreds of millions or even billions. So this is now, I think, the generational opportunity to figure out how to get an incretin to a much larger group of people. We can do that to the simplicity of the profile, which is also easier to manufacture and distribute. So really, our plan will be about accomplishing that at an international level, getting it out there as quickly as possible. Of course, we're also developing orforglipron in a lot of other settings beyond obesity and diabetes. Dan recapped some of those new NILEX that we've announced. And of course, just to recap as well, we see an opportunity not just as a starter incretin here with orforglipron, but also something that could potentially be used for patients to continue the success they've had with a drug like Wegovy or Zepbound. We're assessing that now in the ATTAIN-MAINTAIN study and look forward to sharing those data later this year.",335.0,151.0,10.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.06622516556291391,0.006622516556291391,0.039735099337748346,0.0,0.006622516556291391,0.059602649006622516

Just sticking with orforglipron, maybe given it's importance, just a high-level question on pricing and volume dynamics ahead of the launch. So the cash pay channel is where you're continuing to see the most rapid growth in the obesity market. Zepbound vials are now almost 40% of new scripts. And related on ex U.S. price elasticity, you saw a shift in volumes in the U.K. when Mounjaro prices increase. So I guess what are the learnings from this for the orforglipron ramp next year as it relates to the elasticity of demand across different price points?

Obviously, we have experienced significant growth overall in the total market. So we've seen sequential growth in the covered. Overall the sequential growth is 15%. But we're seeing significant more volume go through a direct-to-consumer platform with LillyDirect, which says a lot about, one, what consumers and patients as well as providers see as the benefit of Zepbound in particular and also the ability to remove some of the friction and the ability to have accessibility to medicine. And so we see this channel as a significant channel now and into the future. And then as part of that, obviously having more offerings, whether you include being able to pick up your Zepbound vial at a local Walmart, which we announced yesterday or expanding the offering on having another treatment like orforglipron. That's an important element for us to expand the ability for patients to get treated.

I think, first and foremost, in the U.K. with a raise in price that was effective September 1, I think we learned pretty much what we expected to learn. What we did was just to take the U.K. price at the level of -- raise it to the level of a European price. And even if there were regulations in the U.K., we actually saw export of medicines out of U.K. to other markets. So that has probably stopped with intervention we did put in place. Secondly, we're also learning something about consumer pricing elasticity. So that exists. But most importantly, I think orforglipron will meet a slightly different need of the marketplace. We know that obesity is a heterogeneous disease. And for people with a BMI below 35 and that might not need a weight loss drug like tirzepatide, we believe there is a significant opportunity in OUS. And also driven by the other features that Ken referred to earlier, the opportunity to scale here and to reach other patient populations and with no need of refrigeration, et cetera.

And that, of course, would be good for everyone in the space. What is Lilly picking up on this?

Obviously, we're -- we don't know the price is being negotiated at the same time. There are several things that are important to note. One, that it only applies to sema in Part D beginning in 2027. Overall, if you take a look at our volumes, Medicare Part D is a small proportion of our overall volume. Obviously, predominantly in type 2 diabetes since there's lack of coverage in obesity. Probably the most important element to include here is that tirzepatide has demonstrated superior efficacy versus sema in head-to-head trials, which is a strong foundation for any value-based discussions that we have with payers, not only in our data, but you see that as well in provider preference as well as patient preference that you see in the market.",138.0,63.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031746031746031744,0.031746031746031744,0.015873015873015872,0.0,0.0,0.0

This is a really first of its kind study, and we're looking forward to these data later this year. We took advantage of the opportunity to rerandomize patients for the SURMOUNT-5 study who were maximally tolerated on either semaglutide or tirzepatide and randomized them to orforglipron or placebo, and we're going to measure the percentage of the weight that they lost over the course of 72 weeks that they keep off while taking orforglipron. Of course, this is a first of its kind study. We don't know exactly what the results will be, but we're hopeful that orforglipron will provide a simple once-daily oral option that lets patients keep the majority of their weight off. And so we think this is really an opportunity to expand the market even further for orforglipron. Of course, we have very bullish expectations for it as a first-line starter incretin, but also this is an opportunity to continue to grow that. I don't think -- as we think about orforglipron, we don't think about sort of cannibalization in that way. This is an opportunity to grow the market at a very different rate, and we think the data from ATTAIN-MAINTAIN could be really just an exciting boost and allow us to have some medical information to disseminate to physicians about how they can help patients switch from drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound.

Maybe just thinking about the pricing dynamics when you actually unpack our Q3 performance, you see that actually, our pricing continued to perform as what we expected, right? So I think it's a good data going after the CVS move that we didn't see again, a significant price erosion, but actually was very much in line to what we said early in the year for the full year as well. So maybe just had a good data point that you can take from that perspective. And thinking more broadly about the competition in the marketplace, again, we always pay close attention on the competition in the marketplace, but also how we differentiate both commercially, but also on the level of the product. And Ilya, Dan, Ken mentioning about the differentiation. And you see that in the marketplace. So if you take, for example, a good proxy that for me is LillyDirect we have been priced over the last maybe 6 months already at that starting point at $349 going to $499 and maintain that price and you see the penetration and the competition is placed at the same level as well.

So I mean, yes, our strategy is to bridge both. We think, as you're pointing out, that flatter pricing between U.S. and other developed countries is important. But there's like 3 ways that this works. And I think one important thing here that just to point out on all these pricing questions that is different in this GLP-1 category is the consumer self-pay channel. We haven't really seen that at scale in other categories. And it certainly is a channel here, partly because of under insurance, but partly because the benefits of these medicines manifest so consistently. There really aren't that many nonresponders at all and produce a very desirable short-term effect in addition to enhancing long-term health benefits. It really is a unique situation. So we have seen price elasticity, as was mentioned, and that it's, on the one hand, in our interest to offer consumers a compelling price where they can afford to self-pay. It's also in our interest to continue to build out indications for chronic disease, as Ken and Dan were outlining earlier. And we are committed to doing both, having a strong consumer offering, but also proving the health benefit. And that should not compete for consumer dollars, but for health care dollars, either government or from private payers. So it's a both end, and I do think these can bridge because we have so much evidence coming of long-term benefit, we should compete with other classes of medicines in chronic diseases or even create whole new classes. And at the same time, we'll probably continue to see consumer self-pay demand, whether it be for prevention or there are other needs. So I think it's entirely possible to do both. And I think Ken mentioned earlier some of the numbers that we are literally just scratching the surface of global treatment here.
