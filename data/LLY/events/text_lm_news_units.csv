NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Humankind Investments, a quantitatively driven asset manager specializing in socially responsible investments, announced today the release of the “Humankind 100,” the first-ever ranking of the top U.S. companies offering the greatest benefit to humanity, based on Humankind Investments’ proprietary Humankind Value methodology. As the challenges of creating transparency around Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data and rankings become increasingly apparent, Humankind developed a holistic, quantitative way to calculate impact in terms of human benefit versus human suffering. Humankind’s ranking rewards companies that sustain human well-being and significantly improve our daily lives. As such, industries that perform well include healthcare, food, water and technology. This year, Alphabet (GOOGL), which generates substantial value through its free online services like email, maps, and internet search, scored highest in the ranking. The positive value of creating free digital tools for consumers outweighs the negative impact of factors like data harvesting and internet addiction in Humankind’s analysis. Other companies rounding out our top 10 include companies involved in providing healthcare products, hygienic products, and free digital tools: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pfizer (PFE), Abbvie Inc. (ABBV), Verizon (VZ), Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), Merck & Co. (MRK), Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT). The complete rankings – with details on the positive contributions of each company – can be found at rankings.humankind.co. “We launched the Humankind 100 with a two-fold purpose – to help people understand the companies best supporting their quality of life and to encourage companies to continue striving for progress,” said James Katz, founder and CEO of Humankind Investments. The ranking was calculated using Humankind Investments’ proprietary Humankind Value methodology, which tends to favor companies that promote human health and improved quality of life. The methodology analyzes each company’s positive and negative contributions to society to calculate a single dollar figure that is meant to represent a company’s true social and economic value to humanity – its “Humankind Value.” The methodology draws on a combination of nationally recognized third-party data providers, as well as academic research, government data and NGO data. “Since day one, our mission has been to invest in what we believe is best for humanity and inspire others to do the same,” continued Katz. “By publishing these rankings we’re optimistic that we can motivate companies to make progress on their own human impact.” About Humankind Investments Humankind Investments was founded on the premise that it would be better for all of us if we paid closer attention to how our investments affect humankind. We are a quantitatively driven investment manager whose mission is to give investors concrete and measurable ways to invest in a manner that generates rewards for themselves and for humanity. We offer socially responsible portfolio management services for high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients as well as exchange traded fund products. A company’s Humankind Value, an estimate of how much value the company creates for humankind, is published annually and is current as of April 29, 2022. It is based on a quantitative analysis that calculates the comprehensive economic value of a company based not only upon its financial performance metrics but also on the costs and benefits to society from conducting its business. This calculation also attempts to take into account the Humankind Value of the company’s critical supply chain partners. The components of the calculation include: (i) Investor Value, which is the estimated value to investors on the basis of multi-year profitability; (ii) Consumer Value, which is the estimated value to customers based on the offering of a product or service; (iii) Employee Value, which is the estimated value to employees based on their salaries, bonuses and benefits; and (iv) Societal Value, which is the estimated unaccounted costs and benefits to society from the operation of the company’s business.

OXFORD, England & INGELHEIM, Germany & RIDGEFIELD, Conn. & INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--EMPA-KIDNEY Phase III clinical trial met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a significant kidney and cardiovascular benefit for adults living with chronic kidney disease (CKD).1,2 When treated with empagliflozin, the risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death was significantly reduced by 28% vs. placebo (HR; 0.72; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82; P<0.000001).1,2 The results were announced today during the American Society of Nephrology (ASN)’s Kidney Week 2022 by the Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit (MRC PHRU) at the University of Oxford which designed, conducted and analyzed EMPA-KIDNEY, in a scientific collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY). The results were also published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine.2 EMPA-KIDNEY is the first SGLT2 inhibitor CKD trial to demonstrate a significant reduction in all-cause hospitalizations (14%) (HR; 0.86; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95; p=0.0025) vs. placebo, one of the pre-specified key secondary confirmatory endpoints.1,2 CKD doubles a person’s risk for hospitalization and is a leading cause of death globally.4,5 Hospitalizations account for 35%-55% of total healthcare costs for people with CKD in the U.S.6 The overall safety data was generally consistent with previous findings, confirming the well-established safety profile of empagliflozin. “We know that there is an urgent need for new therapies proven to delay CKD progression which can lead to the need for dialysis or transplantation. Today’s results demonstrate that empagliflozin may benefit adults at risk of progression, including those with or without diabetes, and across a wide range of kidney function,” said William Herrington, Associate Professor at MRC PHRU (part of Oxford Population Health), and Honorary Consultant Nephrologist, and EMPA-KIDNEY co-Principal Investigator. “By reducing the risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death, empagliflozin has the potential to positively impact healthcare systems worldwide.” “The design of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial included a wider range of patients than ever before,” said Professor Richard Haynes, co-Principal Investigator. “Previous SGLT2 inhibitor trials focused on certain groups of people living with CKD, such as those with diabetes or high levels of protein in their urine. Today’s positive trial results across a broad CKD population reflect an opportunity to improve the treatment of this disease and prevent people from needing dialysis.” EMPA-KIDNEY is the largest and broadest dedicated SGLT2 inhibitor trial to date.7 It included 6,609 participants across a wide range of underlying causes, many with co-morbidities across the spectrum of cardiovascular, kidney, or metabolic conditions. The trial assessed both kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in people across the spectrum of CKD severity.8 ""The Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly Alliance is incredibly proud that EMPA-KIDNEY has provided another pivotal moment for Jardiance,” said Carinne Brouillon, Head of Human Pharma and Member of the Board of Managing Directors, Boehringer Ingelheim. “Today’s data adds to the body of evidence from our clinical program which includes more than 700,000 adults with cardiovascular, kidney and metabolic conditions. EMPA-KIDNEY reinforces the potential role of empagliflozin in changing the way these interconnected conditions may be managed.” Reductions in other key secondary endpoints of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death or all-cause death were not statistically significant, however the power to detect this was limited by the number of events observed. Reduction in the risk of these endpoints is consistent with the totality of the evidence from other trials which have shown statistical significance of these outcomes. “Today’s EMPA-KIDNEY trial results will be welcomed by people living with CKD and the medical community.

Since the start of 2020, Eli Lilly’s (NYSE: LLY) stock price chart has been straight up and to the right, up 531.19% and currently trading at $834.50. The company has been around since 1876 and the stock didn’t go public until 1952 but in the last 4 years, Eli Lilly went from a $100 billion market capitalization to $740 billion today, which also makes it a potential stock split stock. However, as investors, we care about the stock price years down the line and what Eli Lilly will do in the next 3 to 5 years and beyond. That is why 24/7 Wall Street looks at projected revenue and net income to give you our best estimate of future stock prices from 2025 to 2030. Other “experts” look at past growth rates and assign future stock prices to those past numbers. However, we will walk you through our assumptions and give you the key drivers we see propelling Eli Lilly’s stock in the future. Recent Eli Lilly Stock Updates and News 11/12/2024 Eli Lilly’s CEO, Dave Ricks, has been named the recipient of the 2024 August M. Watanabe Life Sciences Champion of the Year Award by BioCrossroads. Under Ricks’ leadership, the company has invested billions of dollars in research and development to address critical health challenges, particularly in areas like oncology, obesity, immunology, and neurodegenerative diseases. 11/11/2024 Susan McGowan, a 58-year-old nurse from Scotland, tragically passed away after taking two doses of tirzepatide, a weight-loss drug manufactured by Eli Lilly. McGowan experienced multiple organ failure, pancreatitis, and septic shock a few days after taking the medication. This is believed to be the first such death in the U.K. officially linked to the medication. 11/8/2024 There is a strong bullish sentiment surrounding Eli Lilly, as seen by the increase in call option trading volume. This surge, particularly in the 820 and 830 strike calls expiring today, suggests that traders are anticipating a potential upside in the stock price. 11/7/2024 After a six-day losing streak, Eli Lilly’s stock is finally rebounding today. While the stock is still down 14% over the past month, it’s still outperforming the broader market, with a year-to-date gain of over 35% compared to the S&amp;P 500’s 24%. 11/5/2024 Eli Lilly has announced that the company will present data from studies of Jaypirca (pirtobrutinib) at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in San Diego. The meeting and exposition will be held from December 7th through the 10th. 11/4/2024 Deutsche Bank analyst James Shin has lowered his price target slightly for Eli Lilly, reducing it from $1,025 to $1,015. However, he maintains a “Buy” rating on the stock. 10/31/2024 Eli Lilly released its quarterly earnings report, showcasing strong growth in Q3 and a total revenue rising 42% year-over-year. 10/29/2024 Eli Lilly has received approval to start selling its weight loss drug, Mounjaro, in Hong Kong as early as the end of this year. 10/28/2024 Eli Lilly will release its third-quarter results this Wednesday. Investors are keen to see how the company has performed, particularly regarding Mounjtaro and Zepbound. Analysts expect Eli Lilly to report $12.1 billion in sales and $1.45 in adjusted earnings per share for the quarter. 10/25/2024 Eli Lilly announced positive results from its Phase 3b study of Ebglyss, which focused on patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Patients had been previously treated with Dupixent with little success. However, the results of this latest Ebglyss study show that it was effective in improving skin and itch symptoms, particularly in challenging areas like the face and hands. 10/24/2024 Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) has announced that it will not cover Eli Lilly’s new Alzheimer’s drug, donanemab. Initially, the NHS was expected to approve the drug this week, but instead has decided that it’s too expensive for patients to use. 10/23/2024 A group of U.S. senators is investigating Eli Lilly and Pfizer’s new direct-to-consumer telehealth platforms, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest for prescribers. LillyDirect and PfizerForAll offer virtual and in-person healthcare appointments, as well as convenient home delivery of prescription medications and other health products. Eli Lilly’s Recent Stock Success How did Eli Lilly’s stock price soar so much in the past few years? Let’s take a look at the numbers: Share Price Revenues* Net Income* 2016 $80.36 $21.22 $2.74 2017 $77.55 $19.94 ($0.21) 2018 $122.13 $21.49 $3.23 2019 $140.83 $22.32 $8.32 2020 $206.46 $24.54 $6.19 2021 $238.31 $28.32 $5.58 2022 329.07 $28.54 $6.25 2023 $745.91 $34.12 $5.24 *Revenue and Net Income in Billions Since 2016, Eli Lilly’s revenue grew by 60% but income grew by 91%. Typically you wouldn’t expect a company growing at its top line by 7% annually to see an 828% increase in share price, however, investor sentiment for the next line of drugs front ran the stock price. For example, in 2016 Eli Lilly was trading 13 times the trailing 12 months earnings and the market has increased its valuation each year and currently trades at a 125 times earnings multiple. This raises the valid question, is Eli Lilly overvalued or will future revenues make up for the expensive valuation? 3 Key Drivers of Eli Lilly Stock Innovated Drug Pipeline: The current drug pipeline is loaded with several very high-potential drugs in development. Mounjaro, Zepbound, and Jardiance in the cardiometabolic category, Taltz in immunology, and Verzenio in oncology are the future of Eli Lilly’s growth. While the aforementioned are the safer bets, the company has a handful of other drugs that could hold blockbuster potential. Strategic Acquisitions: The acquisition of Morphic, with its promising drug candidate MORF-057, is a testament to Lilly’s strategic vision. This drug, if successful in late-stage trials, could become a major success in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Lilly’s focus on acquiring mid-sized companies (13 since 2020) with promising pipelines has bolstered its own research and development efforts, positioning it well for future growth. Operational Efficiency: With a sound balance sheet, Eli Lilly should continue to improve operational efficiency and manage costs to have net income growth rates above revenue growth. Eli Lilly (LLY) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current Wall Street consensus 1-year price target of Eli Lilly stock is $1030.00, which is 23.43% higher than today’s price of $834.50. Of the 26 analysts covering Eli Lilly stock, the current rating is 1.67 or “Outperform” with 1-year price targets as high as $1,100 and as low as $540.00. 24/7 Wall Street sets its 1-year price target at $1,040. Taking a look at the sum of its parts, we see Eli Lilly’s vertices valued as follows: Endocrinology $735/ share Oncology $122/ Share Cardiovascular $4/ Share Neuroscience $16/ Share Immunology $38/ Share Others and Pipeline $110/ Share Cash $17/ Share Eli Lilly’s Share Price Estimates 2025-2030 Valuing Eli Lilly’s stock price for the coming years, we will take a look at expected revenue and net income and give our best estimate of the market value of the company by assigning a price-to-earnings multiple. Revenue Net Income EPS 2025 $52.8 $17.29 19.11 2026 $62.5 $22.49 25.03 2027 $70.87 $27.12 30.39 2028 $80.68 $32.2 25.97 2029 $87.99 $36.45 40.58 2030 $96.67 $41.12 46.29 *Revenue and net income reported in billions How Eli Lilly’s Next 5 Years Could Play Out We expect Eli Lilly’s P/E ratio in 2025 to be 60 with an EPS of $19.11, resulting in a price target of $1140.00 This prediction is based on strong revenue growth of 18.37% to $52.80 billion and net income expansion to $17.29 billion, continuing the upward trajectory from previous years. For 2026, we anticipate a P/E ratio of 50 with an EPS of $25.03, leading to a price target of $1250.00. This reflects significant revenue growth of 18.37% to $62.50 billion and an increase in net income to $22.49 billion, driving higher earnings per share. Heading into 2027, we project the P/E ratio to remain at 50, with EPS increasing to $30.39. This results in a price target of $1520.00. Continued revenue growth of 13.39% to $70.87 billion and net income expansion to $27.12 billion justifies this substantial increase in stock price. With an EPS of $25.97 and a P/E ratio of 50 in 2028, we forecast the stock price to be $1300.00. A slight dip in EPS growth is expected, but sustained strong performance in net income to $32.20 billion and revenue growth of 13.84% to $80.68 billion keeps the stock highly valued. By 2029, we estimate Eli Lilly’s EPS to rise to $40.58, with the P/E ratio adjusting to 40. This gives us a price target of $1623.00. The continuous revenue growth of 9.06% to $87.99 billion and net income expansion to $36.45 billion supports this higher valuation. Eli Lilly Stocks Price Target for 2030 Price Target: $1850.00 Upside: 121.69% By 2030, we estimate Eli Lilly’s EPS to rise to $46.29, with the P/E ratio adjusting to 40. This gives us a price target of $1850.00. The continuous revenue growth of 9.86% to $96.67 billion and net income expansion to $41.12 billion supports this higher valuation. Year Price Target % Change From Current Price 2025 $1140.00 Upside of 36.61% 2026 $1250.00 Upside of 49.79% 2027 $1520.00 Upside of 82.14% 2028 $1300.00 Upside of 55.78% 2029 $1623.00 Upside of 94.49% 2030 $1850.00 Upside of 121.69% Smart Investors Are Quietly Loading Up on These “Dividend Legends” If you want your portfolio to pay you cash like clockwork, it’s time to stop blindly following conventional wisdom like relying on Dividend Aristocrats.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended All&#039;s Well That Ends Green 4:30 pm All three major market indices ended in the green Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up a bare 0.05%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained a more substantial 0.7%, and the Nasdaq closed up 1.2% gain. Despite an inauspicious start on Monday, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF&#8217;s gain of 0.7% Friday brought its total gain for the week to 4.6%. For the month of April, however, the Voo remains down 1.5%, with just three trading days remaining. Call It &quot;the Trump Effect&quot; 1:23 pm Markets have turned solidly green in afternoon trading, with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.66% and the Voo ETF ticking right along in its footsteps with a 0.64% gain. So what&#8217;s changed? Responding to China&#8217;s demurral yesterday that &#8220;there are absolutely no negotiations on the economy and trade between China and the U.S.,&#8221; which was itself in response to President Trump&#8217;s assertion Tuesday that talks were happening, the President insisted again today that, whatever the Chinese government may want people to believe, &#8220;we&#8217;ve been meeting with China&#8221; to talk about lowering tariffs after all. In this game of he said, Xi said, it&#8217;s honestly hard for an investor to know what&#8217;s really going on. But for now at least, the markets seem to believe Mr. Trump, and are hoping the trade war is nearing an end. S&amp;P 500 Just Turned Into a Horse of a Different Color 11:50 am Uh-oh. We&#8217;re 15 minutes from noonday now, and the S&amp;P 500 has just turned red, down 0.12%. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF, likewise, has lost its pleasant shade of green, and is now down 0.14%. In happier news (for investors), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) just won a ruling in Texas, where an Outsourcing Facilities Association lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the FDA suing them for making Ozempic copycat drugs just got rejected. S&amp;P 500 component Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) previously won a similar ruling, also in Texas. For the big publicly-traded GLP-1 drugmakers, things are finally going their way. S&amp;P Might Not Bounce Back This Time 10:52 am In mid-morning trading, we&#8217;re getting further disturbing news that may weigh on &#8220;the Voo.&#8221; CNBC reports that S&amp;P 500 component Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN), or more precisely third party retailers who sell on Amazon, are raising prices on hundreds of items to help them absorb the cost of new tariffs imposed by President Trump. Amazon&#8217;s stock price doesn&#8217;t seem to be suffering from the report yet. It&#8217;s still slightly in the green. But the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t moving any higher, despite trading having begun nearly an hour and a half ago already. And we&#8217;re off! The stock market opened for trading a bit lower today than it left off last night. But within five minutes of opening, the S&amp;P 500 (Index: SPX) was already, if only barely, in the green with an 0.06% gain. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: VOO), which closely tracks the performance of the index, is up 0.09%. It&#8217;s still a hesitant start, but a logical result in light of comments from President Trump, just published by Time magazine, to the effect that the President is looking to end his trade war with China (and the world) perhaps &#8220;a year from now&#8221; and with tariffs on foreign countries settling at &#8220;20% to 50%.&#8221; The prospect of trade war volatility dragging on for another 12 months, and of tariffs ending up two to five times higher than the 10% &#8220;reciprocal&#8221; tariffs already announced, is clearly not something that investors wanted to hear. Earnings Last night, after the close of trading on a third straight day of gains for &#8220;the Voo,&#8221; index component Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOG) (Nasdaq: GOOGL) reported earnings a staggering 40% better than Wall Street analysts were predicting, which seemed propitious enough news to keep the stock market rally going this morning. Unfortunately, comments from Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) seem to have canceled out Alphabet&#8217;s good news. The chipmaker reported a $0.19 per share loss for its own first quarter, warned that it&#8217;s not going to earn a profit in Q2 either (at best, Intel might break even), and its Q2 sales will be about $1 billion less than analysts had forecast. This mixed messaging on the earnings front, for two of the country&#8217;s biggest tech companies, is also weighing on the market today. Analyst Calls Perhaps unlucky for them, Wall Street analysts seem not to have had an opportunity to review the President&#8217;s comments before issuing their latest round of upgrades this morning.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended S&amp;P 500 Extends Its Winning Streak 4:18 pm The S&amp;P 500 closed up 0.6% for Tuesday, extending its winning streak to six straight days. Trade Talks Keep S&amp;P 500 Moving Higher 1:51 pm &#8220;Ask, and ye shall receive.&#8221; Investors for example have been asking a lot lately, for proof that President Trump&#8217;s tariffs threats will result in trade deals that can benefit the U.S. economy. Today, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the conclusion of a trade deal with India is almost set now, with deals with both Japan and South Korea likely to follow in short order. That&#8217;s exactly what investors wanted to hear. The S&amp;P 500 is now up 0.7%, and so is &#8220;the Voo.&#8221; Trump Growls, Amazon Caves 12:13 pm Well, that was quick! No sooner had the White House expressed disapproval of an Amazon plan to inform customers of how much tariffs were raising the cost of goods sold on its site, than Amazon has abandoned the plan. Amazon spokesman Tim Doyle has just tossed the idea under the proverbial bus, admitting he &#8220;considered the idea&#8221; but it &#8220;was never approved and not going to happen.&#8221; Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick (see above) commented: &#8220;Good move,&#8221; Amazon. Tariffs Threaten Supply Chain, Wall Street Shrugs 10:57 am Gene Seroka, the executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, is warning of a &#8220;precipitous drop&#8221; in shipments from China as &#8220;major American retailers stop &#8230; all shipments from China based on the tariffs&#8221; announced by President Trump earlier this month. Despite the warning, investors have resumed buying stocks, and the S&amp;P 500 is now in positive territory, up 0.3%. Stock markets opened lower on Tuesday, threatening to break the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s five-day winning streak, although the market is moving back towards breakeven now. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.3% lower this morning, and the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) likewise opened down 0.3%. T In political news, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted a reported plan by Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN), to display the cost of wares on its site next to the amount the cost was inflated by tariffs cost, as a &#8220;hostile and political act.&#8221; Things could be worse, though. Last night, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick promised to &#8220;reward &#8230; companies who manufacture domestically&#8221; by reducing tariffs on foreign auto parts used to manufacture cars in the U.S. General Motors (NYSE: GM) CEO Mary Barra responded to the news by promising to &#8220;invest even more in the U.S. economy.&#8221; Ford (NYSE: F) CEO agreed that the move &#8220;will help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers.&#8221; Earnings Speaking of General Motors, the automotive giant reported this morning that its Q1 profits came in at $2.78, $0.17 ahead of analyst forecasts. Commercial truckmaker Paccar (Nasdaq: PCAR) on the other hand reported profits $0.14 below forecasts. In housing, we see LGI Homes (Nasdaq: LGIH) miss badly, but paintmaker Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW) beat. In airlines, Jetblue Airways (Nasdaq: JBLU) reported a $0.59 per share loss, but this was $0.02 better than the $0.61 per share loss it was expected to report. Analyst Calls Analyst action is so far muted. Swiss bank UBS upgraded cranemaker Crane (NYSE: CR) to buy. Tariffs war and &#8220;market uncertainty&#8221; notwithstanding, UBS says it&#8217;s &#8220;increasingly confident in the long-term earnings outlook and M&amp;A opportunity&#8221; for the company. Not everyone&#8217;s so confident, however. Already this morning we&#8217;re seeing downgrades outnumber upgrades, with Stifel cutting Builders FirstSource (Nasdaq: BLDR) to neutral, Bank of America lowering ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), also to neutral, and TD Cowen downgrading GLP-1 drugs compounder Hims &amp; Hers (NYSE: HIMS) to hold, citing increased competition from Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), and a lack of near-term catalysts to move the stock higher.

Net income for the quarter was $49.5 million, up from $11.1 million in Q1 2024. The company posted adjusted EBITDA of $91.1 million, compared to $32.3 million a year ago, bringing adjusted EBITDA margin to 16%. The company’s subscriber base grew to 2.4 million, reflecting 38% growth from the prior year. Monthly online revenue per average subscriber increased 53% to $84, indicating higher per-user monetization. Gross margin came in at 73%, down from 82% in the prior year period, which the company attributes to product mix changes and scaling of new fulfillment capabilities. Following the FDA&#8217;s decision to end the semaglutide shortage, Hims transitioned away from compounded GLP-1 prescriptions and began offering branded alternatives through a new partnership with Novo Nordisk. Despite the shift, revenue and subscriber growth remained strong in Q1, with leadership citing continued adoption across weight loss and other care categories. The company maintained its full-year revenue guidance of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion and raised its adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $295 million to $335 million. Additionally, management introduced new long-term targets for 2030, aiming for at least $6.5 billion in revenue and $1.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Hims will host a conference call later today to discuss the results in more detail, including performance drivers across its growing portfolio of care categories and operational updates related to its pharmacy and logistics network. HIMS Earnings: 3 Things to Watch 2:44 pm by Joel South GLP-1 Transition Under ScrutinyHims&#8217; shift from compounded to branded GLP-1s will test growth durability, margin structure, and fulfillment capacity — all eyes are on early uptake and unit economics.

Margins Reflect Operational DisciplineAnalysts expect stable 6–8% EBITDA margins; any deviation could signal pressure from branded drug costs or fulfillment inefficiencies as Hims expands care categories. HIMS Names Former Amazon Executive as COO 2:22 pm by Joel South Hims has appointed Nader Kabbani as its new Chief Operating Officer, marking a significant leadership addition as the telehealth company expands its personalized care offerings. Kabbani brings nearly two decades of experience from Amazon, where he led initiatives including the acquisition of PillPack, the launch of Amazon Pharmacy, and the development of Amazon Logistics and Kindle. He also oversaw Amazon’s COVID-19 vaccination efforts for over a million individuals. CEO Andrew Dudum emphasized Kabbani’s role in scaling global operations to deliver affordable, seamless healthcare. The appointment coincides with Hims &amp; Hers&#8217; recent partnership with Novo Nordisk to offer the FDA-approved weight-loss drug Wegovy through its platform, enhancing access to obesity care. Following these developments, HIMS stock rose over 3% to $42.19, reflecting investor confidence in the company&#8217;s strategic direction. HIMS earnings keys: guidance and margins 2:00 pm by Joel South Hims &amp; Hers has guided for FY25 revenue between $1.17 billion and $1.19 billion, representing a healthy increase over FY24’s $872 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to land between $70 million and $80 million, implying sustained EBITDA margins above 6%. These targets reflect a careful balance between growth and profitability as the company moves into new, more regulated care categories. On the Q4 2024 earnings call, CFO Yemi Okupe emphasized the company’s intention to drive profitability without compromising growth, pointing to the success of its vertically integrated model and data-driven customer acquisition engine. Management also highlighted efforts to improve marketing efficiency and maintain strong retention through service layering. The guidance includes expectations around the full rollout of branded GLP-1 medications following the discontinuation of compounded options. The shift is likely to influence both gross margins and per-customer profitability, making this quarter’s commentary on cost structure especially relevant to modelers. Analysts will be looking for any updates to this outlook, especially if the adoption curve for Wegovy is ahead of expectations or if churn increases materially. Margin stability in Q1 could reinforce confidence in the scalability of the platform, particularly as Hims expands into higher-acuity care and medication fulfillment partnerships. HIMS sentiment heading into earnings release 1:33 pm by Joel South Investor sentiment around Hims &amp; Hers heading into Q1 earnings is cautiously constructive. While the discontinuation of compounded GLP-1 prescriptions introduced a level of uncertainty, analysts have broadly applauded the company’s rapid strategic response. The April announcement of a partnership with Novo Nordisk to offer Wegovy, an FDA-approved GLP-1 treatment, helped alleviate fears of demand disruption and was viewed as a critical step in maintaining user continuity. Sell-side coverage remains largely bullish, with price targets consolidating in the mid-$20s. Several firms — including Jefferies and Bank of America — have reiterated their positive outlooks, citing Hims’ resilient subscriber growth and potential upside from new care verticals. That said, consensus does reflect a more tempered stance compared to late 2024, when sentiment was euphoric around GLP-1 traction. Key themes in recent analyst notes include scrutiny over fulfillment cost structures for branded medications, margin implications from co-branded logistics, and whether churn rates might tick up in Q1. While no major downgrades have surfaced, several firms have flagged the need for greater transparency around economics per subscriber and cost-per-acquisition as the company scales. Ultimately, today’s earnings report will serve as a barometer of investor confidence in Hims’ ability to absorb regulatory shocks and maintain momentum. Sentiment remains optimistic — but Q1 results could either validate or reset expectations for FY25 growth. HIMS subscriber growth and past stock performance 12:52 pm by Joel South Throughout 2024, Hims &amp; Hers demonstrated consistent top-line acceleration driven by new product introductions and broader consumer adoption. The company’s revenue grew from $260 million in Q1 2024 to $481 million in Q4, with subscriber growth moving in tandem — increasing from 1.5 million to 2.2 million across the same period. This momentum reflects strong execution across multiple verticals, especially in mental health and metabolic care. In particular, the launch of GLP-1 weight-loss services mid-2024 significantly bolstered engagement, although much of that volume came through compounded versions prior to the recent FDA decision. With branded access now in place, investors are keen to see if the company can preserve that growth trajectory in Q1 2025. Comparing past quarters also reveals positive trends in average order value and retention. CFO Yemi Okupe previously pointed to increasing multi-category engagement as a margin lever — users who start with one vertical, such as mental health, often expand into dermatology or primary care. As today&#8217;s results arrive, the question is whether these patterns have continued into 2025, or if the post-compounding GLP-1 adjustment is creating temporary friction in subscriber additions. Forward commentary on churn, conversion, and re-engagement will be vital to contextualizing Q1 results. Wall Street&#039;s expectations for tonights earnings 11:25 am by Joel South According to Capital IQ, the Street expects Q1 2025 revenue of $260.91 million, representing 57% year-over-year growth. EPS is projected at $0.03, consistent with the company’s recent trend of balancing top-line growth with margin expansion. Analysts have remained relatively steady in their forecasts over the past 60 days, signaling confidence in the company’s ability to execute through volatility. Notably, some models may not fully account for the rapid GLP-1 shift from compounded to branded fulfillment. Thus, revenue composition and subscriber dynamics will be closely scrutinized in the release. In terms of profitability, consensus EBITDA margins are expected to come in around 6%–8%, roughly in line with FY24 results. The company previously guided for FY25 revenue between $1.17B and $1.19B, with EBITDA between $70M and $80M — targets that could be revised depending on Q1 performance and adoption trends of new product categories. Watching for GLP-1 Fallout 10:14 am by Joel South The telehealth platform was hit earlier this year by the Food &amp; Drug Administration declaring there was no longer a shortage of Ozempic or Wegovy, the GLP-1 drugs sold by Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) for the treatment of of diabetes and obesity, respectively. Because Hims was able to sell compounded versions of the treatments, the FDA announcement crushed HIMS stock, cutting the stock nearly in half. It subsequently loss some 68% of its value, despite promising to sell personalized dosages of semaglutide. That&#8217;s a bit of an end-run around the regulations, as the generic versions of the branded drug can continue to be sold so long as they are personalized beyond the standard dosages commercially available. More than just weight-loss Yet GLP-1 drugs represented less than 20% of Hims &amp; Hers revenue in 2024 while hair-loss products for both men and women enjoyed phenomenal growth. In Q4, Hims Derm saw 55% year-over-year subscriber growth while Hers Derm more than doubled. Hims provides generic Rogaine and Propecia. Other major contributors to HIMS 69% revenue growth in 2024 include sexual health treatments, such as drugs for erectile dysfunction, such as generic Viagra, and mental health services and treatments, including generic Zoloft. And just last week, Hims &amp; Hers and Novo Nordisk announced an agreement for the telehealth platform to sell branded Wegovy on its site for $599 per month. This is a significant opportunity because it derisks the potential for litigation from the Dutch pharmaceutical while bringing in a well-known brand. It also means Hims will likely stop selling its cheaper compounded versions as it transitions subscribers to the branded drug. Hurdles still to get over However, Wegovy has lost significant market share to rival Eli Lilly&#8216;s (NYSE:LLY) Zepbound, because it is seen as a better, more efficacious GLP-1 drug. Zepbound&#8217;s active ingredient, tirzepetide, is known as a dual-agonist as it targets the GLP-1 receptors as well as the receptors. Semaglutide only targets the GLP-1 receptor. Lilly also recently reported positive late-stage clinical trial results for its oral weight-loss treatment orforglipron. It expects to gain FDA approval to market it later this year and is already stockpiling the drug so there are no shortages. These developments mean Hims &amp; Hers may enjoy less traction in sales than many envision as suggested by HIMS 45% bounce in the stock last week. HIMS stock is up 2% at $41.64 per share ahead of the market&#8217;s open. What to watch after the market closes 9:24 am by Joel South Shares of Hims &amp; Hers Health have rallied 250% over the past year, buoyed by growing adoption of its direct-to-consumer model and continued expansion into new care categories. The company’s focus on retaining customers and driving lifetime value through vertical integration has enabled strong gross margins and operating leverage. Today, investors are watching closely to see how the company weathers regulatory headwinds in the weight-loss market. In early 2025, the FDA declared the semaglutide shortage over, ending a period during which compounded GLP-1 prescriptions helped fuel subscriber growth. That decision forced Hims to discontinue those compounded offerings, but the company moved swiftly — launching a partnership with Novo Nordisk to provide access to branded Wegovy through its platform. This pivot has helped stabilize investor sentiment, but the impact on margins and customer acquisition remains unclear. Bulls argue that branded partnerships provide more durable growth; skeptics question the long-term pricing structure and whether the company can retain users amid evolving fulfillment models. Heading into earnings, there is high expectations for continued subscriber growth, and we will be focused on that number when earnings are out. Hims &amp; Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS) will report its Q1 2025 financial results today, after the market closes with a conference call shortly after at 5 pm (which we will have live coverage on). Analysts expect the company to post revenue of $260.91 million and earnings per share of $0.03, according to Capital IQ. For a company that began as a startup tackling stigma in men’s health, today marks another milestone in its transformation into a scaled, consumer-driven healthcare platform. From its origins in telehealth prescriptions for hair loss and ED, Hims has evolved into a fast-moving digital health brand offering treatment for mental health, dermatology, and weight loss. Co-Founder and CEO Andrew Dudum has described 2024 as a “validation year” for the company — not just in terms of product traction, but in demonstrating that its vertically integrated model can scale efficiently. That model, which keeps pharmacy operations, clinical services, and marketing in-house, is central to Hims&#8217; claim of being able to innovate faster and deliver care more affordably. The company ended last year with 2.2 million subscribers, a 45% increase from the prior year, while generating positive free cash flow and EBITDA margins of 6.2%. CFO Yemi Okupe attributed the company’s growing leverage to disciplined acquisition spend and increased average order values as users engage across multiple care categories. Now, Q1 will test whether that momentum continues. The GLP-1 program, which launched in 2024, is expected to play a major role in revenue acceleration this year. Dudum said it will be a &#8220;meaningful contributor&#8221; to top-line growth in 2025, and investors will be watching closely for early signals on fulfillment scale and prescription uptake. Also in focus are the company’s newer verticals in dermatology and cardiovascular health, which are still early-stage but central to Hims’ long-term vision. Analysts are eager to see if those categories are beginning to gain traction. Stay tuned for rolling updates throughout the day as we break down expectations for tonight&#8217;s earnings and what we are most interesting in seeing from HIMS 1st quarter results.

While most investors pile into Eli Lilly (LLY 2.95%) or flee from struggling Novo Nordisk (NVO 2.48%), they're missing a compelling opportunity in the clinical-stage space.

Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Nasdaq up 300 at the Open 9:54 am Despite a poor outing on Friday, the Nasdaq just opened 300 points higher. All as investors attempt to shake off trade war and job uncertainty. The Dow Jones is up 340. The S&amp;P 500 is up 61. Gold prices are up by $13.82 at $3,381.98. Oil is down $1.70 at $65.63. Shares of Tesla Are Racing Higher in Pre-Market 8:58 am Shares of Tesla (TSLA) are accelerating on news that the company just approved a compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, which consists of 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at about $29 billion. On Semiconductor is down after issuing third-quarter guidance of 54 cents to 64 cents, with analysts expecting 58 cents. The lower end of the expected revenue of $1.465 billion to $1.565 billion also fell short of estimates of $1.50 billion. Bank of America Reiterated a Buy Rating on Nvidia 8:44 am After dropping late last week on jobs growth and tariff concerns, the Nasdaq is turning aggressively higher in the pre-market. At the moment, it’s up 188 points at 23,073.75 Bank of America just reiterated its buy rating on Nvidia, noting it sees a strong beat/raise when it posts earnings later this month. UBS just initiated a buy rating on Pony AI with a price target of $20. Evercore ISI reiterated an outperform rating on Amazon, noting, “We reiterate our Outperform on AMZN in the wake of our proprietary research into Alexa+, Amazon’s AI Agent currently being rolled out to its Echo platform devices. We have tested Alexa+ on and off for two weeks now and have run our own proprietary survey of 1,350 current Smart Device owners,” as quoted by CNBC. Markets were doing well until the latest tariffs and a slowdown in jobs created uncertainty. Non-farm payrolls came in at 73,000 with prior months revised lower. With the latest numbers, investors are digesting what it could mean for interest rates. At the moment, investors are betting on reduced chances for a September cut. Unfortunately, the probability of a September fell to 40%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. With tariffs, Trump signed an executive order that modified reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, with updated duties ranging from 10% to 41%. It’s why the Dow dropped 542 points on Friday, why the S&amp;P 500 shed 101, and why the NASDAQ lost 472 points. This morning, in an attempt to brush off the negativity, the major indices are exploding in the pre-market. The Dow Jones is up about 192. The S&amp;P 500 is up about 35, as the NASDAQ tacks on about 174 points. It’ll be interesting to see if they can hold the gains – especially with the latest tariffs, the potential for a worsening trade war, and jobs. We also have to consider that August is historically a weak month for the Dow, heading back to 1988, according to CNBC. It’s the second-worst month for the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. Key Earnings are on Deck Key earnings from Palantir, Disney, McDonald’s, Advanced Micro Devices, and Eli Lilly will also help decide the markets’ direction. This morning, Tyson Foods posted better-than-expected earnings. EPS of 91 cents was above expectations of 80 cents. Revenue of $13.88 billion was also above the estimates of $13.54 billion. It also raised its revenue guidance for the full year, expecting an increase in production for certain meat products like chicken. Berkshire Hathaway saw a year-over-year decline in operating earnings, which fell 4% to $11.16 billion. All thanks to week insurance writing. Warren Buffett also warned that steep tariffs would hurt its business. &#8220;The pace of changes in these events, including tensions from developing international trade policies and tariffs, accelerated through the first six months of 2025,&#8221; Berkshire said in its earnings report. &#8220;Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events.&#8221; OPEC+ Just Agreed to Raise Oil Production OPEC+ just agreed to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September. This is the latest in a series of accelerated output hikes to regain market share, especially with concerns mounting over potential supply disruptions linked to Russia. “Given fairly strong oil prices at around $70, it does give OPEC+ some confidence about market fundamentals,&#8221; said Amrita Sen, co-founder of Energy Aspects, adding that the market structure was also indicating tight stocks, as quoted by CNBC.
