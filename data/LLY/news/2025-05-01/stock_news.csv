The results exceeded Wall Street targets and pushed the U.S. drugmaker's shares up 11% in premarket trading, while dragging down rival Novo Nordisk and obesity drug developer Viking Therapeutics. aAdsList.push('Article'); aAdsListSize.push([300, 250]); aAdsListCA.push(null); An oral drug is seen as a more convenient option compared to currently available weekly injections. Several companies are developing weight-loss pills, encouraged by estimates that sales of obesity treatments could hit $150 billion in the coming years. Lilly, which has started stockpiling supplies of the pill, said it planned to file by the end of this year with global regulators for approval. ""As a convenient once-daily pill, orforglipron may provide a new option and, if approved, could be readily manufactured and launched at scale,"" Lilly's CEO David Ricks said in a statement. Analysts were keenly eyeing side effects seen in the trial, which could be a stumbling block for the drug. The late-stage trial found that between 13% to 18% of patients given the drug experienced nausea across doses, compared with 2% of placebo patients. The rate for diarrhea was 19% to 26% and vomiting was 5% to 14%. Lilly said no liver safety signal was observed in its trial. On Monday, Pfizer discontinued development of its experimental weight-loss pill danuglipron after a trial patient experienced potential drug-induced liver injury that resolved after the medication was stopped. Lilly said 8% of trial patients on orforglipron's highest dose discontinued treatment. Levels of HbA1c, a measure of blood sugar over time, fell by an average of 1.3% to 1.6% across doses. Analysts at TD Cowen, in a recent research note, said a ""rough bar"" for the orforglipron trial was HbA1C lowering of 2%, weight loss of 7% and a discontinuation rate of 9%. After 40 weeks of treatment in the multi-dose trial, Lilly said once-daily orforglipron showed body weight reductions of 4.7% at 3 milligrams, 6.1% with 12 milligrams, and 7.9% with 36 mg. Patients on placebo lost 1.6%. Lilly currently sells injectable tirzepatide -- the active ingredient in its diabetes drug Mounjaro and obesity treatment Zepbound -- which mimics natural peptide hormones GLP-1 and GIP. Orforglipron also targets GLP-1, but unlike hormone-mimicking peptides, which also include Novo's Ozempic and Wegovy, it is a synthetic small molecule drug. Orforglipron and similar experimental pills could mean wider access to effective weight-loss options since the manufacturing of small molecule drugs is simpler.

UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) is a major drag on the Dow and S&amp;P 500 today, losing over 20% on the day. The S&amp;P 500 is being helped by Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), which is up 16% today. Discount retailer Dollar Tree and fintech stock (NYSE: FIS) are holding onto their gains as well, rising 7% and 9%, respectively. The markets are headed for a holiday-shortened week for which the S&amp;P 500 is currently in the losing column. Markets Spooked 11:07 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market has erased earlier gains, with the S&amp;P 500 now being pressured lower alongside the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite. In this holiday-shortened week, the markets are on track for their third straight day of losses. The S&amp;P 500 is being pressured lower by UNH and GPN stock on earnings and M&amp;A news, respectively. Energy as a sector is up 2.2% today, fueled by gains in FANG stock. Yesterday&#8217;s hawkish comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell are spooking markets further in an already uncertain climate. The markets are struggling to maintain any sort of upward momentum, as the S&amp;P 500 watches its modest gains slip away today. Stocks are being driven by tariff uncertainty between the U.S. and China, hawkish comments out of the Fed and the latest earnings results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has set a negative tone due to UnitedHealth Group&#8217;s (NYSE: UNH) disappointing earnings results, pressuring the healthcare sector lower too. UNH stock is also part of the S&amp;P 500. Tech as a sector is under pressure today, while energy stocks continue to show off with gains. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell&#8217;s comments are still ringing in the ears of traders and investors, leading to greater market uncertainty. Powell warned that the tariffs could thwart the central bank&#8217;s efforts to rein in inflation and spark economic growth, placing a question mark on monetary policy surrounding interest rates. Discount retailer Dollar Tree (Nasdaq: DLTR) is bucking the downward trend today, rising 5% as a beneficiary of an economic slowdown. Investors have been flocking to discount retailers for protection in a potential economic recession that could result from the tariff climate. DLTR stock has gained approximately 25% from its March low of about $61 per share. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 718.47 (-1.8%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 115.71 (-0.71%) S&amp;P 500: Down 15.21 (-0.30%) Market Movers Fintech giant FIS (NYSE: FIS) is rising 6% on the day after announcing two multi-billion dollar deals in one fell swoop involving WorldPay and Global Payments&#8217; (NYSE: GPN) Issuer Solutions division.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up a bare 0.05%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained a more substantial 0.7%, and the Nasdaq closed up 1.2% gain. Despite an inauspicious start on Monday, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF&#8217;s gain of 0.7% Friday brought its total gain for the week to 4.6%. For the month of April, however, the Voo remains down 1.5%, with just three trading days remaining. Call It &quot;the Trump Effect&quot; 1:23 pm Markets have turned solidly green in afternoon trading, with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.66% and the Voo ETF ticking right along in its footsteps with a 0.64% gain. So what&#8217;s changed? Responding to China&#8217;s demurral yesterday that &#8220;there are absolutely no negotiations on the economy and trade between China and the U.S.,&#8221; which was itself in response to President Trump&#8217;s assertion Tuesday that talks were happening, the President insisted again today that, whatever the Chinese government may want people to believe, &#8220;we&#8217;ve been meeting with China&#8221; to talk about lowering tariffs after all. In this game of he said, Xi said, it&#8217;s honestly hard for an investor to know what&#8217;s really going on. But for now at least, the markets seem to believe Mr. Trump, and are hoping the trade war is nearing an end. S&amp;P 500 Just Turned Into a Horse of a Different Color 11:50 am Uh-oh. We&#8217;re 15 minutes from noonday now, and the S&amp;P 500 has just turned red, down 0.12%. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF, likewise, has lost its pleasant shade of green, and is now down 0.14%. In happier news (for investors), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) just won a ruling in Texas, where an Outsourcing Facilities Association lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the FDA suing them for making Ozempic copycat drugs just got rejected. S&amp;P 500 component Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) previously won a similar ruling, also in Texas. For the big publicly-traded GLP-1 drugmakers, things are finally going their way. S&amp;P Might Not Bounce Back This Time 10:52 am In mid-morning trading, we&#8217;re getting further disturbing news that may weigh on &#8220;the Voo.&#8221; CNBC reports that S&amp;P 500 component Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN), or more precisely third party retailers who sell on Amazon, are raising prices on hundreds of items to help them absorb the cost of new tariffs imposed by President Trump. Amazon&#8217;s stock price doesn&#8217;t seem to be suffering from the report yet. It&#8217;s still slightly in the green. But the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t moving any higher, despite trading having begun nearly an hour and a half ago already. And we&#8217;re off! The stock market opened for trading a bit lower today than it left off last night. But within five minutes of opening, the S&amp;P 500 (Index: SPX) was already, if only barely, in the green with an 0.06% gain. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: VOO), which closely tracks the performance of the index, is up 0.09%. It&#8217;s still a hesitant start, but a logical result in light of comments from President Trump, just published by Time magazine, to the effect that the President is looking to end his trade war with China (and the world) perhaps &#8220;a year from now&#8221; and with tariffs on foreign countries settling at &#8220;20% to 50%.&#8221; The prospect of trade war volatility dragging on for another 12 months, and of tariffs ending up two to five times higher than the 10% &#8220;reciprocal&#8221; tariffs already announced, is clearly not something that investors wanted to hear. Earnings Last night, after the close of trading on a third straight day of gains for &#8220;the Voo,&#8221; index component Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOG) (Nasdaq: GOOGL) reported earnings a staggering 40% better than Wall Street analysts were predicting, which seemed propitious enough news to keep the stock market rally going this morning. Unfortunately, comments from Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) seem to have canceled out Alphabet&#8217;s good news. The chipmaker reported a $0.19 per share loss for its own first quarter, warned that it&#8217;s not going to earn a profit in Q2 either (at best, Intel might break even), and its Q2 sales will be about $1 billion less than analysts had forecast. This mixed messaging on the earnings front, for two of the country&#8217;s biggest tech companies, is also weighing on the market today. Analyst Calls Perhaps unlucky for them, Wall Street analysts seem not to have had an opportunity to review the President&#8217;s comments before issuing their latest round of upgrades this morning. Citigroup for example is starting the day off with an upgrade of Hasbro (Nasdaq: HAS) stock, while KeyBanc is upgrading both Lowes (NYSE: LOW) and La-Z-Boy (NYSE: LZB) &#8212; all three of which companies are highly dependent upon goods imported from abroad. If the trade war keeps rumbling, and tariffs keep climbing, things could turn ugly for all of these stocks, and for the S&amp;P 500 in general.

T In political news, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted a reported plan by Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN), to display the cost of wares on its site next to the amount the cost was inflated by tariffs cost, as a &#8220;hostile and political act.&#8221; Things could be worse, though. Last night, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick promised to &#8220;reward &#8230; companies who manufacture domestically&#8221; by reducing tariffs on foreign auto parts used to manufacture cars in the U.S. General Motors (NYSE: GM) CEO Mary Barra responded to the news by promising to &#8220;invest even more in the U.S. economy.&#8221; Ford (NYSE: F) CEO agreed that the move &#8220;will help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers.&#8221; Earnings Speaking of General Motors, the automotive giant reported this morning that its Q1 profits came in at $2.78, $0.17 ahead of analyst forecasts. Commercial truckmaker Paccar (Nasdaq: PCAR) on the other hand reported profits $0.14 below forecasts. In housing, we see LGI Homes (Nasdaq: LGIH) miss badly, but paintmaker Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW) beat. In airlines, Jetblue Airways (Nasdaq: JBLU) reported a $0.59 per share loss, but this was $0.02 better than the $0.61 per share loss it was expected to report. Analyst Calls Analyst action is so far muted. Swiss bank UBS upgraded cranemaker Crane (NYSE: CR) to buy. Tariffs war and &#8220;market uncertainty&#8221; notwithstanding, UBS says it&#8217;s &#8220;increasingly confident in the long-term earnings outlook and M&amp;A opportunity&#8221; for the company. Not everyone&#8217;s so confident, however. Already this morning we&#8217;re seeing downgrades outnumber upgrades, with Stifel cutting Builders FirstSource (Nasdaq: BLDR) to neutral, Bank of America lowering ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), also to neutral, and TD Cowen downgrading GLP-1 drugs compounder Hims &amp; Hers (NYSE: HIMS) to hold, citing increased competition from Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), and a lack of near-term catalysts to move the stock higher.

Net income for the quarter was $49.5 million, up from $11.1 million in Q1 2024. The company posted adjusted EBITDA of $91.1 million, compared to $32.3 million a year ago, bringing adjusted EBITDA margin to 16%. The company’s subscriber base grew to 2.4 million, reflecting 38% growth from the prior year. Monthly online revenue per average subscriber increased 53% to $84, indicating higher per-user monetization. Gross margin came in at 73%, down from 82% in the prior year period, which the company attributes to product mix changes and scaling of new fulfillment capabilities. Following the FDA&#8217;s decision to end the semaglutide shortage, Hims transitioned away from compounded GLP-1 prescriptions and began offering branded alternatives through a new partnership with Novo Nordisk. Despite the shift, revenue and subscriber growth remained strong in Q1, with leadership citing continued adoption across weight loss and other care categories. The company maintained its full-year revenue guidance of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion and raised its adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $295 million to $335 million. Additionally, management introduced new long-term targets for 2030, aiming for at least $6.5 billion in revenue and $1.3 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Hims will host a conference call later today to discuss the results in more detail, including performance drivers across its growing portfolio of care categories and operational updates related to its pharmacy and logistics network. HIMS Earnings: 3 Things to Watch 2:44 pm by Joel South GLP-1 Transition Under ScrutinyHims&#8217; shift from compounded to branded GLP-1s will test growth durability, margin structure, and fulfillment capacity — all eyes are on early uptake and unit economics. Subscriber Momentum Must HoldStrong 2024 subscriber growth now faces a regulatory test; Q1 must confirm continued expansion and multi-vertical engagement to validate the platform&#8217;s scalability. Margins Reflect Operational DisciplineAnalysts expect stable 6–8% EBITDA margins; any deviation could signal pressure from branded drug costs or fulfillment inefficiencies as Hims expands care categories. HIMS Names Former Amazon Executive as COO 2:22 pm by Joel South Hims has appointed Nader Kabbani as its new Chief Operating Officer, marking a significant leadership addition as the telehealth company expands its personalized care offerings. Kabbani brings nearly two decades of experience from Amazon, where he led initiatives including the acquisition of PillPack, the launch of Amazon Pharmacy, and the development of Amazon Logistics and Kindle. He also oversaw Amazon’s COVID-19 vaccination efforts for over a million individuals. CEO Andrew Dudum emphasized Kabbani’s role in scaling global operations to deliver affordable, seamless healthcare. The appointment coincides with Hims &amp; Hers&#8217; recent partnership with Novo Nordisk to offer the FDA-approved weight-loss drug Wegovy through its platform, enhancing access to obesity care. Following these developments, HIMS stock rose over 3% to $42.19, reflecting investor confidence in the company&#8217;s strategic direction. HIMS earnings keys: guidance and margins 2:00 pm by Joel South Hims &amp; Hers has guided for FY25 revenue between $1.17 billion and $1.19 billion, representing a healthy increase over FY24’s $872 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to land between $70 million and $80 million, implying sustained EBITDA margins above 6%. These targets reflect a careful balance between growth and profitability as the company moves into new, more regulated care categories. On the Q4 2024 earnings call, CFO Yemi Okupe emphasized the company’s intention to drive profitability without compromising growth, pointing to the success of its vertically integrated model and data-driven customer acquisition engine. Management also highlighted efforts to improve marketing efficiency and maintain strong retention through service layering. The guidance includes expectations around the full rollout of branded GLP-1 medications following the discontinuation of compounded options. The shift is likely to influence both gross margins and per-customer profitability, making this quarter’s commentary on cost structure especially relevant to modelers. Analysts will be looking for any updates to this outlook, especially if the adoption curve for Wegovy is ahead of expectations or if churn increases materially. Margin stability in Q1 could reinforce confidence in the scalability of the platform, particularly as Hims expands into higher-acuity care and medication fulfillment partnerships. HIMS sentiment heading into earnings release 1:33 pm by Joel South Investor sentiment around Hims &amp; Hers heading into Q1 earnings is cautiously constructive. While the discontinuation of compounded GLP-1 prescriptions introduced a level of uncertainty, analysts have broadly applauded the company’s rapid strategic response. The April announcement of a partnership with Novo Nordisk to offer Wegovy, an FDA-approved GLP-1 treatment, helped alleviate fears of demand disruption and was viewed as a critical step in maintaining user continuity. Sell-side coverage remains largely bullish, with price targets consolidating in the mid-$20s. Several firms — including Jefferies and Bank of America — have reiterated their positive outlooks, citing Hims’ resilient subscriber growth and potential upside from new care verticals. That said, consensus does reflect a more tempered stance compared to late 2024, when sentiment was euphoric around GLP-1 traction. Key themes in recent analyst notes include scrutiny over fulfillment cost structures for branded medications, margin implications from co-branded logistics, and whether churn rates might tick up in Q1. While no major downgrades have surfaced, several firms have flagged the need for greater transparency around economics per subscriber and cost-per-acquisition as the company scales. Ultimately, today’s earnings report will serve as a barometer of investor confidence in Hims’ ability to absorb regulatory shocks and maintain momentum. Sentiment remains optimistic — but Q1 results could either validate or reset expectations for FY25 growth. HIMS subscriber growth and past stock performance 12:52 pm by Joel South Throughout 2024, Hims &amp; Hers demonstrated consistent top-line acceleration driven by new product introductions and broader consumer adoption. The company’s revenue grew from $260 million in Q1 2024 to $481 million in Q4, with subscriber growth moving in tandem — increasing from 1.5 million to 2.2 million across the same period. This momentum reflects strong execution across multiple verticals, especially in mental health and metabolic care. In particular, the launch of GLP-1 weight-loss services mid-2024 significantly bolstered engagement, although much of that volume came through compounded versions prior to the recent FDA decision. With branded access now in place, investors are keen to see if the company can preserve that growth trajectory in Q1 2025. Comparing past quarters also reveals positive trends in average order value and retention. CFO Yemi Okupe previously pointed to increasing multi-category engagement as a margin lever — users who start with one vertical, such as mental health, often expand into dermatology or primary care. As today&#8217;s results arrive, the question is whether these patterns have continued into 2025, or if the post-compounding GLP-1 adjustment is creating temporary friction in subscriber additions. Forward commentary on churn, conversion, and re-engagement will be vital to contextualizing Q1 results. Wall Street&#039;s expectations for tonights earnings 11:25 am by Joel South According to Capital IQ, the Street expects Q1 2025 revenue of $260.91 million, representing 57% year-over-year growth. EPS is projected at $0.03, consistent with the company’s recent trend of balancing top-line growth with margin expansion. Analysts have remained relatively steady in their forecasts over the past 60 days, signaling confidence in the company’s ability to execute through volatility. Notably, some models may not fully account for the rapid GLP-1 shift from compounded to branded fulfillment. Thus, revenue composition and subscriber dynamics will be closely scrutinized in the release. In terms of profitability, consensus EBITDA margins are expected to come in around 6%–8%, roughly in line with FY24 results. The company previously guided for FY25 revenue between $1.17B and $1.19B, with EBITDA between $70M and $80M — targets that could be revised depending on Q1 performance and adoption trends of new product categories. Watching for GLP-1 Fallout 10:14 am by Joel South The telehealth platform was hit earlier this year by the Food &amp; Drug Administration declaring there was no longer a shortage of Ozempic or Wegovy, the GLP-1 drugs sold by Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) for the treatment of of diabetes and obesity, respectively. Because Hims was able to sell compounded versions of the treatments, the FDA announcement crushed HIMS stock, cutting the stock nearly in half. It subsequently loss some 68% of its value, despite promising to sell personalized dosages of semaglutide. That&#8217;s a bit of an end-run around the regulations, as the generic versions of the branded drug can continue to be sold so long as they are personalized beyond the standard dosages commercially available. More than just weight-loss Yet GLP-1 drugs represented less than 20% of Hims &amp; Hers revenue in 2024 while hair-loss products for both men and women enjoyed phenomenal growth. In Q4, Hims Derm saw 55% year-over-year subscriber growth while Hers Derm more than doubled. Hims provides generic Rogaine and Propecia. Other major contributors to HIMS 69% revenue growth in 2024 include sexual health treatments, such as drugs for erectile dysfunction, such as generic Viagra, and mental health services and treatments, including generic Zoloft. And just last week, Hims &amp; Hers and Novo Nordisk announced an agreement for the telehealth platform to sell branded Wegovy on its site for $599 per month. This is a significant opportunity because it derisks the potential for litigation from the Dutch pharmaceutical while bringing in a well-known brand. It also means Hims will likely stop selling its cheaper compounded versions as it transitions subscribers to the branded drug. Hurdles still to get over However, Wegovy has lost significant market share to rival Eli Lilly&#8216;s (NYSE:LLY) Zepbound, because it is seen as a better, more efficacious GLP-1 drug. Zepbound&#8217;s active ingredient, tirzepetide, is known as a dual-agonist as it targets the GLP-1 receptors as well as the receptors. Semaglutide only targets the GLP-1 receptor. Lilly also recently reported positive late-stage clinical trial results for its oral weight-loss treatment orforglipron. It expects to gain FDA approval to market it later this year and is already stockpiling the drug so there are no shortages. These developments mean Hims &amp; Hers may enjoy less traction in sales than many envision as suggested by HIMS 45% bounce in the stock last week. HIMS stock is up 2% at $41.64 per share ahead of the market&#8217;s open. What to watch after the market closes 9:24 am by Joel South Shares of Hims &amp; Hers Health have rallied 250% over the past year, buoyed by growing adoption of its direct-to-consumer model and continued expansion into new care categories. The company’s focus on retaining customers and driving lifetime value through vertical integration has enabled strong gross margins and operating leverage. Today, investors are watching closely to see how the company weathers regulatory headwinds in the weight-loss market. In early 2025, the FDA declared the semaglutide shortage over, ending a period during which compounded GLP-1 prescriptions helped fuel subscriber growth. That decision forced Hims to discontinue those compounded offerings, but the company moved swiftly — launching a partnership with Novo Nordisk to provide access to branded Wegovy through its platform. This pivot has helped stabilize investor sentiment, but the impact on margins and customer acquisition remains unclear. Bulls argue that branded partnerships provide more durable growth; skeptics question the long-term pricing structure and whether the company can retain users amid evolving fulfillment models. Heading into earnings, there is high expectations for continued subscriber growth, and we will be focused on that number when earnings are out. Hims &amp; Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS) will report its Q1 2025 financial results today, after the market closes with a conference call shortly after at 5 pm (which we will have live coverage on). Analysts expect the company to post revenue of $260.91 million and earnings per share of $0.03, according to Capital IQ. For a company that began as a startup tackling stigma in men’s health, today marks another milestone in its transformation into a scaled, consumer-driven healthcare platform. From its origins in telehealth prescriptions for hair loss and ED, Hims has evolved into a fast-moving digital health brand offering treatment for mental health, dermatology, and weight loss. Co-Founder and CEO Andrew Dudum has described 2024 as a “validation year” for the company — not just in terms of product traction, but in demonstrating that its vertically integrated model can scale efficiently. That model, which keeps pharmacy operations, clinical services, and marketing in-house, is central to Hims&#8217; claim of being able to innovate faster and deliver care more affordably. The company ended last year with 2.2 million subscribers, a 45% increase from the prior year, while generating positive free cash flow and EBITDA margins of 6.2%. CFO Yemi Okupe attributed the company’s growing leverage to disciplined acquisition spend and increased average order values as users engage across multiple care categories. Now, Q1 will test whether that momentum continues. The GLP-1 program, which launched in 2024, is expected to play a major role in revenue acceleration this year. Dudum said it will be a &#8220;meaningful contributor&#8221; to top-line growth in 2025, and investors will be watching closely for early signals on fulfillment scale and prescription uptake. Also in focus are the company’s newer verticals in dermatology and cardiovascular health, which are still early-stage but central to Hims’ long-term vision. Analysts are eager to see if those categories are beginning to gain traction. Stay tuned for rolling updates throughout the day as we break down expectations for tonight&#8217;s earnings and what we are most interesting in seeing from HIMS 1st quarter results.
