As the challenges of creating transparency around Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data and rankings become increasingly apparent, Humankind developed a holistic, quantitative way to calculate impact in terms of human benefit versus human suffering. Humankind’s ranking rewards companies that sustain human well-being and significantly improve our daily lives. As such, industries that perform well include healthcare, food, water and technology. This year, Alphabet (GOOGL), which generates substantial value through its free online services like email, maps, and internet search, scored highest in the ranking. The positive value of creating free digital tools for consumers outweighs the negative impact of factors like data harvesting and internet addiction in Humankind’s analysis. Other companies rounding out our top 10 include companies involved in providing healthcare products, hygienic products, and free digital tools: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pfizer (PFE), Abbvie Inc. (ABBV), Verizon (VZ), Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY), Merck & Co. (MRK), Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT). The complete rankings – with details on the positive contributions of each company – can be found at rankings.humankind.co. “We launched the Humankind 100 with a two-fold purpose – to help people understand the companies best supporting their quality of life and to encourage companies to continue striving for progress,” said James Katz, founder and CEO of Humankind Investments. The ranking was calculated using Humankind Investments’ proprietary Humankind Value methodology, which tends to favor companies that promote human health and improved quality of life. The methodology analyzes each company’s positive and negative contributions to society to calculate a single dollar figure that is meant to represent a company’s true social and economic value to humanity – its “Humankind Value.” The methodology draws on a combination of nationally recognized third-party data providers, as well as academic research, government data and NGO data. “Since day one, our mission has been to invest in what we believe is best for humanity and inspire others to do the same,” continued Katz. “By publishing these rankings we’re optimistic that we can motivate companies to make progress on their own human impact.” About Humankind Investments Humankind Investments was founded on the premise that it would be better for all of us if we paid closer attention to how our investments affect humankind. We are a quantitatively driven investment manager whose mission is to give investors concrete and measurable ways to invest in a manner that generates rewards for themselves and for humanity. We offer socially responsible portfolio management services for high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients as well as exchange traded fund products. A company’s Humankind Value, an estimate of how much value the company creates for humankind, is published annually and is current as of April 29, 2022. It is based on a quantitative analysis that calculates the comprehensive economic value of a company based not only upon its financial performance metrics but also on the costs and benefits to society from conducting its business. This calculation also attempts to take into account the Humankind Value of the company’s critical supply chain partners. The components of the calculation include: (i) Investor Value, which is the estimated value to investors on the basis of multi-year profitability; (ii) Consumer Value, which is the estimated value to customers based on the offering of a product or service; (iii) Employee Value, which is the estimated value to employees based on their salaries, bonuses and benefits; and (iv) Societal Value, which is the estimated unaccounted costs and benefits to society from the operation of the company’s business.

The results were also published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine.2 EMPA-KIDNEY is the first SGLT2 inhibitor CKD trial to demonstrate a significant reduction in all-cause hospitalizations (14%) (HR; 0.86; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95; p=0.0025) vs. placebo, one of the pre-specified key secondary confirmatory endpoints.1,2 CKD doubles a person’s risk for hospitalization and is a leading cause of death globally.4,5 Hospitalizations account for 35%-55% of total healthcare costs for people with CKD in the U.S.6 The overall safety data was generally consistent with previous findings, confirming the well-established safety profile of empagliflozin. “We know that there is an urgent need for new therapies proven to delay CKD progression which can lead to the need for dialysis or transplantation. Today’s results demonstrate that empagliflozin may benefit adults at risk of progression, including those with or without diabetes, and across a wide range of kidney function,” said William Herrington, Associate Professor at MRC PHRU (part of Oxford Population Health), and Honorary Consultant Nephrologist, and EMPA-KIDNEY co-Principal Investigator. “By reducing the risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death, empagliflozin has the potential to positively impact healthcare systems worldwide.” “The design of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial included a wider range of patients than ever before,” said Professor Richard Haynes, co-Principal Investigator. “Previous SGLT2 inhibitor trials focused on certain groups of people living with CKD, such as those with diabetes or high levels of protein in their urine. Today’s positive trial results across a broad CKD population reflect an opportunity to improve the treatment of this disease and prevent people from needing dialysis.” EMPA-KIDNEY is the largest and broadest dedicated SGLT2 inhibitor trial to date.7 It included 6,609 participants across a wide range of underlying causes, many with co-morbidities across the spectrum of cardiovascular, kidney, or metabolic conditions. The trial assessed both kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in people across the spectrum of CKD severity.8 ""The Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly Alliance is incredibly proud that EMPA-KIDNEY has provided another pivotal moment for Jardiance,” said Carinne Brouillon, Head of Human Pharma and Member of the Board of Managing Directors, Boehringer Ingelheim. “Today’s data adds to the body of evidence from our clinical program which includes more than 700,000 adults with cardiovascular, kidney and metabolic conditions. EMPA-KIDNEY reinforces the potential role of empagliflozin in changing the way these interconnected conditions may be managed.” Reductions in other key secondary endpoints of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death or all-cause death were not statistically significant, however the power to detect this was limited by the number of events observed. Reduction in the risk of these endpoints is consistent with the totality of the evidence from other trials which have shown statistical significance of these outcomes. “Today’s EMPA-KIDNEY trial results will be welcomed by people living with CKD and the medical community. We are also encouraged by the risk reduction for hospitalization after just two years, as this finding is in line with the significant reductions seen in prior Jardiance cardiovascular outcomes trials,” says Jeff Emmick, M.D., Ph.D., Vice President, Product Development, Lilly. “The Alliance looks forward to discussing plans for marketing authorization for CKD with regulators worldwide in due course.” Notes to editors Kidney disease progression: Defined as end-stage kidney disease (the initiation of maintenance dialysis or receipt of a kidney transplant), a sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to below 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, kidney death or a sustained decline of at least 40 percent in eGFR from randomization).
