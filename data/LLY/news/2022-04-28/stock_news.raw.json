I see no better place to further our research and discovery programs than as part of the Lilly community in South San Francisco.” In 2019, Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY) announced the first Lilly Gateway Lab to speed the discovery of innovative medicines through collaboration with local biotech companies. IgGenix joins 8 other leading biotechnology companies in the South San Francisco Gateway Labs. “The purpose of the Lilly Gateway Labs is to offer emerging biotech companies the necessary innovative collaborations to foster scientific breakthroughs that deliver new solutions for patients,” said Julie Gilmore, Ph.D., chief operations officer of Lilly Gateway Labs. “IgGenix will be a great addition to Lilly’s diverse group of biotech companies. This collaboration will work to address the unmet needs of treatment options within the allergy space.” More than 50 million Americans have suffered from various types of allergies, the sixth leading cause of chronic illness in the United States.i IgGenix is driven to develop safer therapeutic options through its single-cell discovery platform, leveraging evolutionary biology designed to target monoclonal antibodies. About IgGenix IgGenix is a privately held biotechnology company taking a revolutionary approach to directly alleviate food and other severe allergies by reengineering key antibodies involved in the allergic cascade. Founded based on research by Stephen Quake, Kari Nadeau, and Derek Croote of a novel discovery platform developed at Stanford University, IgGenix isolates rare allergen-specific IgE antibodies responsible for allergic reactions and transforms them into IgG antibodies. These therapeutic IgG antibodies are designed to alleviate and possibly prevent life-threatening allergic reactions, saving lives and reducing the constant fear that affects people living with severe allergies.
