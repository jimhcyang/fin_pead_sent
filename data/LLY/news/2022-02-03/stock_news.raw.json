    "text": "WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: EGRX) (“Eagle” or the “Company”) today announced the commercial availability of its novel product PEMFEXY™ (pemetrexed for injection). A branded alternative to ALIMTA®, Eagle’s PEMFEXY is a ready-to-use liquid with a unique J-code approved to treat nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. “We’ve spent the past several months building our inventory and are pleased that PEMFEXY will now be available to the many patients who need it. Together with our recent launch of vasopressin and now PEMFEXY, these products represent significant opportunities for Eagle,” stated Scott Tarriff, President and Chief Executive Officer. In February 2020, Eagle received final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of its New Drug Application for PEMFEXY, following the settlement agreement of patent litigation with Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) in December 2019. The agreement provided for a release of all claims by the parties and allows for an initial entry of PEMFEXY into the market (equivalent to approximately a three-week supply of current ALIMTA utilization) on February 1, 2022 and a subsequent uncapped entry on April 1, 2022. On October 1, 2020, PEMFEXY’s Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System code, or J-code, became effective. About PEMFEXY™ PEMFEXY is a pemetrexed injection ready-to-dilute formulation for locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in combination with cisplatin; locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy, as maintenance treatment; locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy as a single agent; and malignant pleural mesothelioma whose disease is unresectable or who are otherwise not candidates for curative surgery in combination with cisplatin. About Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Eagle is a fully integrated pharmaceutical company with research and development, clinical, manufacturing and commercial expertise. Eagle is committed to developing innovative medicines that result in meaningful improvements in patients’ lives. Eagle’s commercialized products include RYANODEX®, BENDEKA®, BELRAPZO®, and its oncology and CNS/metabolic critical care pipeline includes product candidates with the potential to address underserved therapeutic areas across multiple disease states.
