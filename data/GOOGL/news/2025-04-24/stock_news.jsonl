UnitedHealth Group stock has been a weight on the Dow and S&amp;P 500 today after its worrying quarterly results and outlook. Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON), which is part of the Nasdaq Composite, is gaining over 2% on the day. The company reports its quarterly results on April 29. The company is in the midst of spinning off a couple of business divisions, and the stock is nearing the $200 per share level. Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is down 1% after BMO Capital cut its price target on the stock to $200 per share, which still represents upside from current levels of $151 per share. Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) is gaining 1.5% on the day as the company expands its chip footprint in the auto sector. Market Gains Slip 8:17 am The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are struggling to keep their grip on gains after coming out of the gate higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains pressured with a 1.2% loss on the day. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) stock is a major drag on the Dow, owing to disappointing quarterly results, while CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) remains a bright spot, rising 1.2% on the day. Chip stock Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM) is up nearly 1% this morning on a bullish report out of Citi analysts. Sector performance is largely positive, led by a 2.4% gain in energy stocks but dampened by a tech sector that has just turned south. After yesterday&#8217;s massive technology sell-off, the markets are licking their wounds, with the three major stock market averages giving a mixed showing. Among the gainers is the Nasdaq Composite with a 0.63% advance and the S&amp;P 500 also fractionally higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently erasing over 400 points. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green today, a complete reversal from yesterday&#8217;s leader board. The markets are still processing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell&#8217;s comments from yesterday, which were on the hawkish side of monetary policy. Earnings are capturing some attention away from tariffs with railway CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) gaining 1% on the heels of its Q1 print. CSX faced challenges in the quarter, including a 7% year-over-year decline in revenue, but met consensus expectations amid a backdrop of weaker coal prices and dwindling fuel surcharges. Big Tech is mostly showing green this morning but remains mired in losses over the past five-day stretch, including a 2% drop in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), 14% decline in Meta (Nasdaq: META) and nearly 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) over the past week or so. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) is a big drag on the Dow, shaving off 18% of its value today alone on disappointing earnings results. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 446 (-1.09%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 118.75 (+0.65%) S&amp;P 500: Up 22 (+0.41%) Market Movers Qualcomm (Nasdaq; QCOM) is rising today on the heels of a bullish report out of Citi analysts, who reportedly raised estimates on the company and added it to their positive catalyst watchlist thanks to robust demand for its chipsets out of China. QCOM stock has been volatile and is down 11% year-to-date. Citi also likes Generac Holdings (Nasdaq: GNRC), upgrading the stock to &#8220;buy&#8221; with a &#8220;high-risk&#8221; tone from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; BMO has upgraded shares of wood producer (NYSE: TREX) Trex to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8220;market perform,&#8221; calling shares attractive. The stock is up 1.8% today.

I think Alphabet's revenue relies too much on advertising (~75%), with promising but limited diversification from Cloud (28% growth) and Subscriptions/Platforms (18% growth).", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4778600-alphabet-no-ai-cracks-in-the-hull-but-still-too-reliant-on-advertising", "ticker": "GOOGL", "event_date": "2025-04-24", "window_start": "2025-04-10", "window_end": "2025-05-08", "publishedDateET": "2025-04-27T11:54:18-04:00", "date_et": "2025-04-27"}

Bank of America is bullish on GOOGL, raising its price target to $200 per share from $185 with a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating attached. Citi also raised its price target on GOOGL to $200 in the wake of the company&#8217;s strong quarterly results. Piper Sandler predicts GOOGL price will hit $195 and has an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on shares. Wells Fargo analysts lifted their price target on the stock to $175 with an &#8220;equal weight&#8221; rating. GOOGL stock is currently hovering at $163 per share. Markets Attempt Gains 12:08 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market is attempting to move higher, including a 0.36% gain in the Nasdaq Composite. Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is holding onto 2% gains while Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is soaring by 8%, helping to lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite as autonomous driving makes its way closer to the mainstream. Tesla shares are up 24% over the past five-day stretch. Resilient Consumers 11:21 am by Gerelyn Terzo Consumer sentiment surprisingly improved toward the end of April amid a resilient consumer despite the tariff uncertainty. The University of Michigan published the final reading of its consumer sentiment index, which rose 52.2 compared with its initial view of 50.8 earlier this month. Economists were expecting the reading to remain flat. Nevertheless, the index fell sharply from March levels and has been on the decline in 2025. Today is the ex-dividend date for Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), CSW Industrials (CSWI) and Fastenal Company (Nasdaq: FAST). After a three-day winning streak, the markets are getting off to a slower start, with all three of the major stock market averages meandering between positive and negative ground this morning. Small-cap stocks are out front with a 2% jump in the Russell 2000 index. Google parent Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is tacking on 4% after yesterday afternoon&#8217;s strong earnings print. Mag 7 stock Alphabet beat consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines, in response to which shares have been soaring ever since. Alphabet reported $2.81 per share on revenue of $90.2 billion compared with Wall Street estimates of $2.01 per share on revenue of $89.1 billion. Bank of America&#8217;s Michael Harnett is bearish on stocks due to the trade uncertainties, advising investors to remain defensive, sell the SPX/US$ rallies and buy price dips in gold. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 61.79 (-0.18%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 8.78 (-0.07%) S&amp;P 500: Down 5.01 (-0.09%) Tech Roundup Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) beat on the top and bottom lines with better than expected profits and revenue. But the markets are focused on the outlook, and Intel&#8217;s revenue guidance for the current quarter fell shy of consensus estimates, sending shares lower by 7% this morning. T-Mobile (Nasdaq: TMUS) shares are under pressure, falling 9% after the company revealed disappointing subscriber numbers in its quarterly print despite beating on the top and bottom lines. Pony AI (Nasdaq: PONY) shares are continuing their wild ride, soaring 17.7% today after yesterday&#8217;s double-digit percentage rally. Market Movers Goldman Sachs has upgraded its rating on financial services stock Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW) to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;neutral,&#8221; citing &#8220;durable EPS growth.&#8221; Citizens JMP has started coverage on fintech stock SoFi Technologies (Nasdaq: SOFI) with a &#8220;market outperform&#8221; rating and a $17 price target attached, implying there is runway for gains of nearly 40%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up a bare 0.05%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained a more substantial 0.7%, and the Nasdaq closed up 1.2% gain. Despite an inauspicious start on Monday, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF&#8217;s gain of 0.7% Friday brought its total gain for the week to 4.6%. For the month of April, however, the Voo remains down 1.5%, with just three trading days remaining. Call It &quot;the Trump Effect&quot; 1:23 pm Markets have turned solidly green in afternoon trading, with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.66% and the Voo ETF ticking right along in its footsteps with a 0.64% gain. So what&#8217;s changed? Responding to China&#8217;s demurral yesterday that &#8220;there are absolutely no negotiations on the economy and trade between China and the U.S.,&#8221; which was itself in response to President Trump&#8217;s assertion Tuesday that talks were happening, the President insisted again today that, whatever the Chinese government may want people to believe, &#8220;we&#8217;ve been meeting with China&#8221; to talk about lowering tariffs after all. In this game of he said, Xi said, it&#8217;s honestly hard for an investor to know what&#8217;s really going on. But for now at least, the markets seem to believe Mr. Trump, and are hoping the trade war is nearing an end. S&amp;P 500 Just Turned Into a Horse of a Different Color 11:50 am Uh-oh. We&#8217;re 15 minutes from noonday now, and the S&amp;P 500 has just turned red, down 0.12%. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF, likewise, has lost its pleasant shade of green, and is now down 0.14%. In happier news (for investors), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) just won a ruling in Texas, where an Outsourcing Facilities Association lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the FDA suing them for making Ozempic copycat drugs just got rejected. S&amp;P 500 component Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) previously won a similar ruling, also in Texas. For the big publicly-traded GLP-1 drugmakers, things are finally going their way. S&amp;P Might Not Bounce Back This Time 10:52 am In mid-morning trading, we&#8217;re getting further disturbing news that may weigh on &#8220;the Voo.&#8221; CNBC reports that S&amp;P 500 component Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN), or more precisely third party retailers who sell on Amazon, are raising prices on hundreds of items to help them absorb the cost of new tariffs imposed by President Trump. Amazon&#8217;s stock price doesn&#8217;t seem to be suffering from the report yet. It&#8217;s still slightly in the green. But the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t moving any higher, despite trading having begun nearly an hour and a half ago already. And we&#8217;re off! The stock market opened for trading a bit lower today than it left off last night. But within five minutes of opening, the S&amp;P 500 (Index: SPX) was already, if only barely, in the green with an 0.06% gain. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: VOO), which closely tracks the performance of the index, is up 0.09%. It&#8217;s still a hesitant start, but a logical result in light of comments from President Trump, just published by Time magazine, to the effect that the President is looking to end his trade war with China (and the world) perhaps &#8220;a year from now&#8221; and with tariffs on foreign countries settling at &#8220;20% to 50%.&#8221; The prospect of trade war volatility dragging on for another 12 months, and of tariffs ending up two to five times higher than the 10% &#8220;reciprocal&#8221; tariffs already announced, is clearly not something that investors wanted to hear. Earnings Last night, after the close of trading on a third straight day of gains for &#8220;the Voo,&#8221; index component Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOG) (Nasdaq: GOOGL) reported earnings a staggering 40% better than Wall Street analysts were predicting, which seemed propitious enough news to keep the stock market rally going this morning. Unfortunately, comments from Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) seem to have canceled out Alphabet&#8217;s good news. The chipmaker reported a $0.19 per share loss for its own first quarter, warned that it&#8217;s not going to earn a profit in Q2 either (at best, Intel might break even), and its Q2 sales will be about $1 billion less than analysts had forecast. This mixed messaging on the earnings front, for two of the country&#8217;s biggest tech companies, is also weighing on the market today. Analyst Calls Perhaps unlucky for them, Wall Street analysts seem not to have had an opportunity to review the President&#8217;s comments before issuing their latest round of upgrades this morning. Citigroup for example is starting the day off with an upgrade of Hasbro (Nasdaq: HAS) stock, while KeyBanc is upgrading both Lowes (NYSE: LOW) and La-Z-Boy (NYSE: LZB) &#8212; all three of which companies are highly dependent upon goods imported from abroad. If the trade war keeps rumbling, and tariffs keep climbing, things could turn ugly for all of these stocks, and for the S&amp;P 500 in general.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 300 points in response for a 0.84% gain, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are holding similar gains. Narrow Range 12:34 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are managing slight gains across the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average despite the absence of greater details on any global trade deals. Of the S&amp;P 500, Baird investment strategist Ross Mayfield is cited by CNBC as saying, “I think [stocks are] probably trapped in a in a pretty tight range here,&#8221; pointing to a range of 5,100-5,700. “I think we can bounce around there for quite a while in kind of some volatile, choppy trading. Until we get some resolution on the trade front, I don’t think much else matters,&#8221; he added. Consumer Weakness 11:03 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market averages are currently all moving higher despite some weaker than anticipated economic data. The U.S. consumer has long been credited with upholding the economy throughout the one-two punch of inflation and higher interest rates. Now the tariffs could be the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back, as consumer confidence shows signs of waning. The Consumer Confidence Index published by the Conference Board sank to a reading of 86 in April, a drop of nearly 8 points from the prior month and below economist estimates calling for 87.7. A separate index that reflects consumer sentiment over the next six months fell by a steep 12.5 points to a reading of 54.4, its worst level in over a decade. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that March job postings dropped to their lowest level in about six months. Tariffs, Earnings and Tech 10:00 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets continue to trade mixed this morning on tariff deal ambiguity as Q1 earnings results pour in. Stocks are weighing earnings results and a lack of certainty on the tariff deal front while tensions have emerged between Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and the White House over tariff-related costs. Magnificent Seven stocks are mixed, with Amazon and Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) trading in the red while Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) benefits from a Wall Street endorsement. Hims &amp; Hers HEalth (Nasdaq: HIMS) is soaring by 24% today on news of a deal to sell weight loss drug phenom Wegovy on its e-commerce platform. The markets are holding out for more tariff deal progress, digging in their heels and nearly standing still in the meantime. The three major stock market averages are moving fractionally in either direction, with the Nasdaq Composite posting slight declines alongside the S&amp;P 500 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is eking out modest gains. Sectors of the economy are evenly split between red and green, with real estate moving higher and consumer discretionary stocks headed lower. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is getting some unwanted attention after the White House took aim at the tech giant, calling its reported plans to list tariff cost impacts on its site as a &#8220;hostile and political act.&#8221; Big 3 automaker General Motors (NYSE: GM) reported better-than-expected quarterly results while reassessing its full-year outlook, sending the stock lower by 1.5%. GM and the auto sector have targets on their backs at the height of the tariff wars, in response to which the former Dow component has suspended all share buyback programs. The White House has affirmed its plans to provide tariff relief to the auto sector. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 138.11 (+0.36%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 67.15 (-0.40%) S&amp;P 500: Down 10.23 (-0.19%) Earnings &amp; Analyst Calls Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) surpassed Q1 expectations on the top and bottom lines and is keeping its full-year guidance intact amid expectations that it will be able to manage any tariff-related fallout, including rising aluminum costs. Rival company PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) recently lowered its earnings forecast due to the tariff impact. Evercore ISI has reiterated its &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock with a $250 price target, suggesting the company&#8217;s strategies should help it to offset any impact from the tariff frenzy. Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), saying that the China tariff uncertainties notwithstanding, the AI leader&#8217;s strong market relationships give the stock a place in the analyst firm&#8217;s top large cap pick universe. UBS has reiterated its &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) but lowered the price target to $253 from $272, owing to what it described as &#8220;potential demand destruction.&#8221; The post Live Nasdaq Composite: Markets Stand Still on Tariff and Tech Tussle appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..", "url": "https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/04/29/live-nasdaq-composite-markets-stand-still-on-tariff-and-tech-tussle/", "ticker": "GOOGL", "event_date": "2025-04-24", "window_start": "2025-04-10", "window_end": "2025-05-08", "publishedDateET": "2025-04-30T12:05:47-04:00", "date_et": "2025-04-30"}
