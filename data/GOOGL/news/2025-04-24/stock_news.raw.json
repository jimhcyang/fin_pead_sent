Each of the Magnificent 7 stocks are trading higher today, as Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) recoups about 3% while Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) advances by 1.6%). Google parent company Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) regained its composure and is rising 1% after yesterday&#8217;s steep AI-driven sell-off in the stock. Alphabet stock was caught in the crosshairs yesterday after an Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) executive predicted AI will muscle search engines out of the picture. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 238.81 (+0.58%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 162.24 (+0.91%) S&amp;P 500: Up 33.87 (+0.60%) Market Movers Quantum computing stock D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) is ballooning by 22.1% today after reporting Q1 results. At $15 million in revenue, D-Wave&#8217;s results topped estimates and set a fresh record for the company. Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is rising 4.5% on the day amid reports of friendlier regulatory guardrails for the chip sector. ARM Holding stock is down 6.2% today due to a disappointing outlook attached to its fiscal Q4 earnings report. Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) was one of yesterday&#8217;s winners alongside Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) but is shaving off 4.8% of its value today after reporting a wider than expected Q1 net loss. AppLovin (Nasdaq: APP) stock is soaring by 17% today after offloading its mobile games studio portfolio in an $800 million deal. The AppLovin CEO said the company was &#8220;never a game developer at heart.&#8221; The post Live Nasdaq Composite: Markets Rise on Trade-Deal Promise appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",
