We are proud that people continue to choose Google's products to stay informed, connected and comforted during uncertain times. Being helpful to people in moments big and small is the foundation of everything we do. The past year also accelerated the shift to cloud and adoption of online services. This has profound implications for all companies and consumers, and we are pleased that so many trust us to help them make this transition. In particular, Google's products and support have been a lifeline for millions of small and medium businesses hit hard by the pandemic. Today, I'll review some of the important work we have done this quarter across Google and Alphabet with a particular focus on our growing cloud business, which we are breaking out as a separate segment for the first time. Then I'll welcome to the call Google's Chief Business Officer, Philipp Schindler, who many of you know from investor conferences and events. Philipp will speak about partnerships, business and advertising trends in the Google Services segment. We have heard that you’d appreciate more texture and detail there. Then Ruth will go through the quarter in more detail. First, some highlights at Google. Since the pandemic began, our teams have built new features and products to help people and businesses. Now we are helping with the complex challenge of getting vaccines to billions of people around the world. Vaccination locations have started to roll out in Google Search and Maps. Google Cloud's Intelligent Vaccine Impact platform is helping authorities improve vaccine distribution and forecasting. We are providing substantial new ad grants to the CDC, the World Health Organization and others to promote vaccine education. We're also making direct grants to organizations addressing racial and geographic disparities in vaccination access, plus opening up Google's facilities as vaccination clinics as needed. Elsewhere, in Maps, we added a new community feed in the Explore tab, and now you can track takeout and delivery orders when you book or order from Google Maps. At YouTube, we are building products to help creators benefit from 2 important trends: live video and short-form video. More than 0.5 million channels livestreamed on YouTube for the first time in 2020, from artists performing in their living rooms to churches moving their services online. And videos in our new Shorts player are receiving 3.5 billion daily views. We are looking forward to expanding Shorts to more countries this year.",422.0,221.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.013574660633484163,0.00904977375565611,0.004524886877828055,0.0,0.0,0.004524886877828055

We're pleased with Google Services revenue of $52.9 billion in the fourth quarter, which continued the significant rebound from the negative impact of COVID earlier in the year. Two trends drove the strong results across Search, YouTube and network advertising. Consumers continued to move more of their activity online, and advertisers responded to the shift in consumer behavior by reactivating spend that they had paused earlier in the crisis.",83.0,46.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08695652173913043,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216

For 2020, total Alphabet revenues were $183 billion, up 13% year-on-year or up 14% in constant currency. With our new segment disclosures this quarter, I'll start with quarterly results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. My focus will be on year-on-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues were $56.9 billion, up 23%, which reflect broad-based increases in advertiser spending in Search and YouTube within Google Services as well as ongoing strength in Google Cloud. Our total cost of revenues was $26.1 billion, up 24%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $15.6 billion and up 25%. The biggest factors here were: first, content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for YouTube's advertising-supported content, followed by costs for subscription content; and second, costs associated with data centers and other operations, including depreciation. Operating expenses were $15.2 billion, down 4%. The year-on-year decline reflects the lapping of valuation-based compensation charges in certain Other Bets in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily in R&D, as well as the impact of actions taken earlier in the year as a result of COVID. Each of the 3 components of OpEx also reflects our decision to slow head count growth beginning late in the first quarter. Head count was up 3,180 from the third quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers with continued aggressive investment in cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $15.7 billion, up 69%, and our operating margin in the quarter was 28%. Other income and expense was $3 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $15.2 billion. Operating cash flow was $22.7 billion, with free cash flow of $17.2 billion in the quarter and $43 billion for the full year 2020. We ended the fourth quarter with $137 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $52.9 billion, up 22%. Each component of our advertising revenues reflects the return of advertiser spend in response to the continued movement of consumer activity online that Philipp spoke about, including Google Search and other advertising revenues of $31.9 billion in the quarter, up 17%; YouTube advertising revenues of $6.9 billion, up 46%, driven by a rebound not only in brand advertising but also ongoing strength in direct response; network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion, up 23%. Other revenues were $6.7 billion, up 27%, primarily driven by growth in YouTube nonadvertising and Play revenues. Within Play, app revenues in the fourth quarter continued to benefit from elevated levels of engagement, reflecting increases in active buyers and spend per buyer due to COVID. However, we did experience a deceleration in growth from the levels we saw in the third quarter. Google Services operating income was $19.1 billion, up 41%, and the operating margin was 36%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, including GCP and Google Workspace. Revenues were $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter, up 47%. GCP's revenue growth rate was again meaningfully above Cloud overall. Strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $1.2 billion, essentially flat versus last year. As to our Other Bets, for the full year 2020, revenues were $657 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily, and reflect that most of our Other Bets are pre-revenue. The operating loss was $4.5 billion for the full year 2020 versus an operating loss of $4.8 billion in 2019. Let me end with our outlook for each segment and our investments more broadly. For Google Services, we're encouraged by the increase in consumer online activity and the return of advertiser spend as reflected in our Q4 results. Looking forward to 2021, year-over-year quarterly comparisons will be affected meaningfully by the impact of COVID last year with easier comps in the first half, especially in Q2, and then lapping stronger performance in the second half. With respect to other revenues, with the closing of the Fitbit acquisition earlier this month, we will be reporting its revenues within Google Other. In terms of investment levels within Google Services, late in the first quarter of 2020, as a result of COVID, we made what we described as tactical adjustments to slow the pace of spend in certain categories. Given the ongoing uncertainty in the external environment, we maintained the discipline through the rest of 2020. Looking forward, we do expect the pace of investment to increase to support the extraordinary opportunities we see given the usefulness of our products and services in this environment. The investment pace will ramp up over the course of the year. As for Google Cloud, we've obviously been investing aggressively given the substantial market opportunity we see. Under Thomas Kurian's leadership, we further accelerated investment to strengthen the position of the business. For example, we are on track to meet our near-term goal of tripling the size of the Cloud Direct sales force and have greatly expanded the partner channel. We've also substantially improved our product offering while rationalizing our approach to focus on our 6 key industry verticals. And we've invested in expanding our network of locations for compute capacity to support Cloud, ending 2020 serving customers in 24 regions and 73 zones. We're encouraged by the momentum in the growth of revenue and customer wins. We more than doubled revenues over the last 2 years from $5.8 billion in 2018 to $13.1 billion in 2020. Our backlog, which is nearly all attributable to Cloud, nearly tripled from 2019 to 2020. Although increases in backlog do not directly correlate to revenue trends, the growth in backlog demonstrates the success Google Cloud is having with large enterprises, which are signing meaningful long-term commitment agreements. Looking forward, we will continue to focus on revenue growth driven by ongoing investment in products and the go-to-market organization. Cloud's operating loss reflects that we have meaningfully built out our organization ahead of revenues, as we've discussed in prior quarters, with respect to the substantial investments in our go-to-market organization as well as engineering and technical infrastructure. Operating loss and operating margin will benefit from increased scale over time. In addition, we are focused on delivering on efficiency efforts across the board to contribute incrementally to profitability over time. Finally, as you can see from the historical data provided in the press release, Cloud's operating loss was higher in the first quarter relative to other quarters, and then the operating loss improves thereafter. We expect similar seasonality in 2021. In terms of Other Bets, we continue to invest with a focus on the long-term value creation opportunity. On head count, we plan to reaccelerate the pace of hiring in Google Services, in line with our opportunities. Our head count growth will also reflect the addition of Fitbit and our ongoing transition of certain customer support roles from third-party vendors to Google's in-house operation centers. We also plan to continue to prioritize investment in both sales and technical roles for Google Cloud. Turning to CapEx. At the consolidated level, the year-on-year results this quarter again reflect the slower pace throughout 2020 of investment in office facilities. Within technical infrastructure, servers continue to be the largest driver of investment in the fourth quarter, followed by data centers. Looking ahead, we expect a return to a more normalized pace of ground-up construction and fit-out of office facilities, which translates into a sizable increase in CapEx in 2021. Servers will continue to be the largest driver of spend on technical infrastructure. Finally, a housekeeping point. As noted in our earnings press release, we have adjusted the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment starting in 2021. We expect these changes will favorably impact our 2021 operating results by approximately $2.1 billion for assets as of year-end 2020. We look forward to the year ahead. I hope everyone stays safe. Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions.",1352.0,738.0,24.0,13.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,2.0,0.0,0.032520325203252036,0.017615176151761516,0.005420054200542005,0.0013550135501355014,0.0013550135501355014,0.014905149051490514

I don't know if it's better to Sundar or to Ruth, but can you just conceptually help us understand how to think about the opportunity  versus Cloud and how it factors back into which you want to invest against the opportunity or, possibly, maybe even accelerate the opportunity by looking at inorganic paths to growing scale vis-à-vis competition in the space? And then maybe for Philipp if I can. YouTube continues to evolve as a platform. There's now subscription offerings. You highlighted the strength you're seeing in DR. Could you talk a little bit about the path for monetization in the coming years and how we should think about the opportunity against a large-scale audience and engagement you see at YouTube broadly?",149.0,66.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.030303030303030304,0.07575757575757576,0.0,0.0,0.06060606060606061

And on your question on YouTube, on the overall development and the subscription side, our Direct Response business on YouTube was practically nonexistent three years ago. And now it's one of our largest and fastest-growing ad offerings on YouTube. And with TrueView for action, we're actually making it easier for advertisers to unlock opportunities to reach audiences with video campaigns. And just to give you a few numbers, 60% of TrueView for action customers are new to YouTube. And we more than doubled the number of active advertisers using TrueView for action in the first 6 months of 2020. And we're really tapping into the tremendous innate commercial behavior on the platform. 70% of YouTube viewers are saying they bought a brand as a result of seeing it on YouTube. I talked about L'oréal earlier. MasterClass is another great example. Online learning has become a huge opportunity, and they use TrueView for action to connect the right people to the right content and saw really big, like 140% increase in clicks to their sites, 70% increase in sign-ups to courses and so on. YouTube continues, in our view, to be amazing for brand advertisers as well. Our brand business was hit hard in the early stages of the pandemic, rebounded in Q3 and into Q4. And it really helps advertisers reach younger audiences. They can reach anywhere. We now reach more 18- to 49-year-olds than all linear TV networks combined. Watch time is increasing. Advertiser effectiveness is getting better and better. And so this is a very nice development on the subscription strategy. Maybe just briefly, music is an incredibly popular vertical on YouTube and, obviously, a key part of the overall experience. We found that users wanted a premium YouTube experience and we -- basically the ability to download songs and videos. YouTube Premium provides additional revenue streams, of course, for music labels and publishers as well. In 2019, YouTube paid the music industry over $3 billion. We have over 30 million music and premium paid subscribers. We are now operating over 95 countries, so members get a lot of extra benefits, yes.",351.0,175.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.05142857142857143,0.005714285714285714,0.005714285714285714,0.0,0.0,0.045714285714285714

Anything else you can add just in terms of the significant inflection that you saw on Google Cloud backlog there? And I guess, in particular, curious what you're seeing in terms of benefit and success as you're leveraging Alphabet more broadly like in the Ford deal. And then how do you think about Google Cloud margins structurally kind of long-term relative to peers?

And depending on the sector they are in, they are definitely interested in a broader solution set across the breadth of what Google and Alphabet can bring. We see this in health care, our efforts in Google Health, work that's happening in Verily, all end up helping. Ford is a great example of, I'd say, thinking longer term not just for Cloud but Android auto-powering their vehicles. And so these are big transformations cutting across the company. And one of the areas where we are really executing is leveraging our global business operations that Philipp runs and partnering closely with Thomas' teams, and that's definitely brings in a lot of synergies here. On your second question, on the broader stuff, the one thing I would say is -- I mentioned a part earlier, we get into these long-term deals. And so over time, as you add more cohorts, that contributes to the margin structure. It is -- the scale of the product offerings, the number of areas and the number of regions in the world, there's a much more significant investment.

As we've each noted, the financial results really did reflect this increase in advertiser activity. And that was in part unlocking budgets that they had paused earlier in the year as well as really reflecting the increase in consumer online activity. The largest contributor, as Philipp mentioned, was retail, the largest contributor to the year-on-year growth of the ads business. But I would say tech, media and entertainment as well as CPG were also meaningful contributors. And for Search, we saw ongoing improvement in advertisers spend broadly. For YouTube, Direct Response, as Philipp talked about, really did maintain a very high level of growth. And the acceleration in overall YouTube revenue growth reflects a pickup in brand advertising across all verticals on top of the ongoing strength that we saw in DR. And then in network, also same point, it's this pickup in advertiser spend, as Philipp noted. It was led by growth in AdMob and Ad Manager. So we're really pleased with Q4.

Look, at the highest level, we want to build a healthier e-commerce ecosystem. When people come to Google to shop, we want them to help find the best product with the best prices from really the widest range of merchants, and we want our results to be as comprehensive and relevant as possible. And we took some significant steps last year, as you know, on Google Shopping. And in many ways, we really see them as a return to our first principles here: free listing, zero commissions, really good feedback, helps lower barriers for online retail. So we've become a great place for stores to connect with potential customers whether it's by driving traffic to the website for free listings or ads or just by making it easier for purchases to happen directly on Google. And by the way, let me be clear also, shopping ads will continue to be a powerful way for retailers to promote their products, obviously. So overall, we're providing an open ecosystem that works for every kind of business, from national chains and online marketplaces to just your small local stores. And we're giving retailers more choice, which is very well received by opening our platform to third-party providers. We talked about this, starting with PayPal and Shopify. And we brought YouTube into the fold, and we began experimenting with a feature that lets you learn a lot more about products and videos on a limited set of channels and so on and so on. So I would say overall it's very, very well received. On the Discover side, discovery has grown -- so discovery is Discover and, obviously, discovery ads. So Discover has grown dramatically since we launched it, I think, just 3 years ago. People are loving how we're surfacing relevant information, gorgeous visuals that are all in what we call Coriolis feed experience. And naturally, some of these experiences are commercial. And we made discovery ads generally available about 6 months ago. I think it was May 2020. And it's already reaching up to 3 billion people across Discover, YouTube, Gmail, and that's worldwide. And advertisers love how we're able to drive performance objectives by really matching their premium creatives with Google intent on our -- yes, what we call Coriolis surfaces.",393.0,199.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.03015075376884422,0.010050251256281407,0.010050251256281407,0.0,0.0,0.020100502512562814

Just given the strength of those services ads and subscriptions during the pandemic, I wonder if part of what we're seeing is more of an acceleration from TV ad budgets from linear spending to more of YouTube spending, I mean given also the momentum we've seen in over-the-top over the last 9 months or so. And then given some of the changing industry dynamics around privacy, including what you've already announced around browser cookies, wondering what plans might be as well for Android and how we should think about potential impact on ad revenues broadly as a result of privacy changes.",115.0,52.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232

We've seen brands steadily shift budgets to YouTube to complement their linear TV buys as TV audiences really become more fragmented. And as traditional TV ratings continue to decline, TV advertisers are turning to streaming platforms like YouTube to reach people who are no longer watching TV. Connected TVs are our fastest-growing screen. In the U.S., we have over 100 million people that watch YouTube and YouTube TV on their TV screens each month. YouTube helps advertisers reach general audiences they can't reach anywhere else. We talked about it. YouTube reaches more 18- to 49-year-olds than all linear TV networks combined. And so there is an opportunity, a big opportunity, for YouTube to help brands and agencies really more easily connect with this audience. And we're very invested in this space. And just to give you a few examples, in the second half of last year, we launched YouTube Masthead on TV screens to help advertisers drive awareness with large audiences in basically a single moment. Many are taking advantage of it: Uber, many others. We launched Brand Lift for YouTube on TV screens to really help advertisers make informed decisions about ad performance, optimize streaming campaigns in real time and so on. And we also made it possible last year for advertisers to basically buy among the most popular YouTube and YouTube TV content viewed on the TV screens in one -- what we call one single lineup. Quickly on the third-party cookies strategy in general, we know that expectations are really changing for how data is used online, and people are demanding greater privacy. We're taking our responsibility to user privacy and to supporting our partners in the web ecosystem very, very seriously. In 2019, we announced The Privacy Sandbox, which is an open standards initiative to invent new technology that will replace third-party cookies with a set of privacy-preserving mechanisms for the web, and we're making great progress. We've shared a detailed proposal with the industry for experimentation and feedback. We shared recently as well our what we call FLoC, our Federated Learning of Cohorts API, which we think provides an effective replacement signal for third-party cookies. And we really believe Privacy Sandbox is the best path forward, and we remain very committed to our collaboration with the ads community on privacy-preserving open standard mechanisms that can, what we call, sustain a healthy and ad-supported web.",415.0,215.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.04186046511627907,0.009302325581395349,0.009302325581395349,0.0,0.004651162790697674,0.03255813953488372

I wanted to understand the framework, if you could, and think about the bigger opportunity longer term and priority highs -- priority is in streaming video, right? So are you happy with the progress of YouTube TV so far? Will you expand into other countries? And can you contrast that versus the opportunity you see in connected TVs and devices as you've done for Google TV or Chromecast?

We want to bring it to the screen that's most convenient for users and, hence, our investments in Google TV, Chromecast, YouTube TV as a whole itself. And I think we are taking a long-term view here, obviously focused on the user experience and really getting it all to work well.

But as we take a more longer-term look into the future, what do you think some of the new applications could be? And I think, Philipp, it might have been a few years ago when you were speaking at an investor conference, and you called out the desire to onboard and help SMBs, particularly as they really had no way to advertise before. And Google, and online in general, presented a golden opportunity to really help them grow their business.

We've always wanted to be foundational in how we approach technological advances, and that's the core competency. We invest across the company. We're one of the largest R&D investors in the world. And obviously, AI is a big part of it. Just I'm really excited that we -- over the past few years, while we have made progress in understanding different modalities, be it text, images, voice, vision, et cetera, there is -- we definitely -- I think we are at an inflection point, and we are investing to build better models and deepen our understanding and do it in a more generalized way. And when we do that, it will apply horizontally across our products. You saw a version of that when we shipped Bird in Search in what was one of our biggest quality improvements, but you'll see that flow across be it Google Search, YouTube, Android as well as our investments in Alphabet, be it self-driving cars or robotics.

So first, let me recognize, I mean it has obviously been a very, very challenging environment for SMBs. Many weren't online. Many lost line of sight to demand overnight due to COVID. So around this time last year, as soon as we saw the scale of the impact, we really accelerated product that give our customers, and especially our SMB customers, signals to help them actually navigate and pivot. And as I noted earlier, as more consumers moved online and advertisers obviously responded by reactivating spend, we also saw our advertiser base grow, particularly the number of smaller advertisers or SMBs, and we're helping them see shift in supply and demand not just across sectors but actually within sectors. For example, travel continues to get hit hard, hit pretty hard. And after the initial lockdown last year, searches for vacation homes and near-me rentals saw huge spikes, and that continues to fluctuate. On the other hand, if we look at retail, demand isn't disappearing. It's shifting in many cases. We're seeing increases in searches for things like gym equipment, crafts, patio heaters and so on, anything related to outdoor activity and so on. We're obviously thinking about how to help SMBs on products like Maps. Like, over the last 5 years, we've made more than 1,000 improvements to business profiles, making it a lot easier for merchants to connect with customers and especially now into the crisis. In 2020, we added new features to, for example, provide COVID updates, service changes and new attributes like takeout, delivery, curbside pickup, now all easily available for consumers on Maps to connect them to their favorite SMBs, so a really incredible investment, frankly, from our side, and I think it's very well received.",297.0,166.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030120481927710843,0.024096385542168676,0.006024096385542169,0.0,0.0,0.006024096385542169

We are pleased with a strong growth in Google Services revenues in the first quarter. Year-on-year performance reflects elevated consumer online activity, broad-based strength and advertiser spend, and lapping of the initial impact of the pandemic on advertising revenues that began in March last year. In the first quarter in Search, we saw sustained strength across most categories led by retail. We also saw strong performance in tech and CPG. In YouTube, we had phenomenal growth driven by Direct Response, followed by continued strength in brand. We have seen great momentum in TrueView for action ads, with a number of advertisers using the format doubling over the past year. In Network exceptional growth was driven by AdMob and Ad Manager with particular strength in app campaigns. Google other revenues were driven by growth in Google Play and YouTube’s non-advertising revenues, followed by hardware. I would now like to take a few minutes to dive deeper into the trends we are seeing in our business. As Sundar touched on earlier, the pandemic is evolving in different ways across the world. Some countries are in advanced stages of reopening, others are facing reacceleration of cases and there’s everything in between. It’s never been more important to help businesses navigate the pandemic as circumstances change.

My focus will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $55.3 billion, up 34% or up 32% in constant currency, reflecting elevated consumer activity online and broad-based increases in advertiser spending within Google Services, as well as ongoing strength in Google Cloud. Our total cost of revenues was $24.1 billion up 27%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $14.4 billion up 25%, followed by TAC, which was $9.7 billion, up 30%. Within Other cost of revenues, the biggest factors are, first, content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for YouTube’s advertising supported content, followed by costs for subscription content. And second, costs associated with data centers and other operations, offset partially by a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes to estimated useful lives of servers in certain network equipment. Operating expenses were $14.8 billion, up 4%. In terms of the three component parts of OpEx. First, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth. Second, sales and marketing expenses were essentially flat, reflecting headcount growth, which was offset by lower spend on ads and promo, as well as on travel and entertainment. Finally, the decline in G&A reflects the benefit of lapping the unusually high allowances for credit losses recorded in the first quarter of 2020 due to the impact of COVID offset by charges relating to certain legal matters. Headcount was up 4,694 from the fourth quarter, including more than 1,800 Fitbit employees who joined us in Q1. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. Operating income was $16.4 billion, up 106% and our operating margin in the quarter was 30%. Other income and expense was $4.8 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $17.9 billion. Operating cash flow was $19.3 billion, with free cash flow of $13.3 billion in the quarter and $50.7 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the first quarter with $135 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $51.2 billion up 34%, consisting of Google Search and other advertising revenues of $31.9 billion in the quarter up 30%, with strength across most categories led by retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $6 billion up 49%, driven by exceptional performance in Direct Response and ongoing strength in brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $6.8 billion up 30%, driven by AdMob and Ad Manager. Other revenues were $6.5 billion up 46%, primarily driven by growth in Play and YouTube non-advertising revenues followed by hardware, which benefited from the addition of Fitbit revenues. Google Services operating income was $19.5 billion, up 69% and the operating margin was 38%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, including GCP and Google Workspace, revenues were $4 billion for the first quarter up 46%. GCP’s revenue growth was again meaningfully above Cloud overall. Strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $1 billion. As to our Other Bets, in the first quarter, revenues were $198 million. The operating loss was $1.1 billion. Let me end with our outlook for each segment and our investments more broadly. For Google Services, for the remainder of 2021, year-over-year comparisons will be affected meaningfully by the impact of COVID last year, with a greater benefit in Q2 from an easier comp relative to what you saw in Q1 and then beginning to lap stronger performance in the second half of the year. In the first quarter, we continue to benefit from elevated consumer online activity and broad-based strength in advertiser spend. It is too early to say how durable this consumer behavior will be as economies recover and restrictions on mobility are lifted. Within Other revenues, Play benefited from an increased level of user engagement starting in Q1 last year due to the pandemic, which we are now beginning to lap. In terms of investment levels within Google Services, we still intend to invest aggressively to support the extraordinary opportunities we see. That being said, in some areas, like, travel and entertainment and marketing events, the pace of investment through the balance of the year may be affected by the pace of COVID recovery globally. As for Google Cloud, our approach to building the business has not changed. We remain focused on revenue growth and we will continue to invest aggressively in products and our go-to-market organization, given the opportunity we see. The operating results in Q1, in part reflects some notable items in the quarter. First, the lapping of the unusually high allowances for credit losses recorded in the first quarter of 2020, as I already mentioned. And second, lower depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives. Although, the dollar benefit will diminish throughout the course of the year across segments. As we have noted previously, operating results should benefit from increased scale over time. However, at this point, we do remain focused on continuing to invest to build the cloud organization for long-term performance. In terms of Other Bets, we continue to invest with a focus on the long-term value creation opportunity. Turning to CapEx, at a consolidated level, the results reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, offset by a slower pace of investment in office facilities, given the ongoing impact of COVID. Within technical infrastructure, servers continue to be the largest driver of investment, as we continue to invest to support Cloud, Search, Ads and machine learning. Finally, with respect to capital allocation, our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. As we indicated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $50 billion of our Class C stock. Thank you.

It seems obvious to do except we need to provide right answers and without giving wrong answers or misinformation for many other things. So to do that is where all our underlying investments go and that’s how we think about it over the long-term. BERT last year, I think, was a great example of it. It was one of our biggest quality improvements and that was based on the transformer breakthrough from our Google AI team, which laid the foundation for it. So we are continuing to invest that way in the deep technology as the web is scaling up. There’s more information than ever before. So that’s a big part of what we are doing. Beyond that, there is a lot of opportunity to improve the user experience. You have seen our efforts around shopping. That’s one aspect of how we are working hard to improve the experience there. So - but we are looking at it pretty deeply. Philipp?",219.0,86.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05813953488372093,0.046511627906976744,0.011627906976744186,0.0,0.0,0.011627906976744186

On the YouTube side, let me start with our Direct Response business, growth was truly exceptional this quarter. DR was practically non-existent on YouTube a few years ago and it’s now a large and fast-growing business and we are just getting started in my view. People already, as you know, go to YouTube to decide what they want to buy, and we want to make it easier for them to buy and make the discovery process overall a lot easier. And for creators, we launched new shoppable capabilities. So viewers can actually make purchases from their favorite creators directly on YouTube. Just as an example, as part of our Brand Connect program, Calvin Klein tested these and drove over. I think it was, 200% lift in brand search and sold out multiple products actually. For merchants, they can now bring their product feeds directly into their video campaigns and I think we are still scratching the surface on what’s possible really with commercial intent on YouTube. And then there is, of course, the opportunity to be a major platform for brands. Historical approaches to reaching audiences through, let’s just say, call it, linear TV don’t really work anymore. Advertisers are using YouTube now to reach the audience they can’t find anywhere else. And remember, more 18- to 49-year-olds are actually watching YouTube than all linear TV combined and brands are also seeing more incremental reach on YouTube compared to TV. So we are starting to see advertisers by a mix actually of awareness and more action-oriented formats. They are driving reach and results across the funnel from awareness to consideration to action. So we see a lot of really interesting opportunities here.",290.0,140.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.04285714285714286,0.0,0.007142857142857143,0.0,0.0,0.04285714285714286

So in terms of Cloud and overall performance, I think, the main point I would say is, I wouldn’t extrapolate generally from quarter-to-quarter, given we are still in the early stages of building the business. We do intend to continue to invest meaningfully in Cloud given the opportunity. And so, as you said, there were a couple of things that benefited margins in the quarter, both the depreciation expense item, but also lapping the unusually high allowance for credit losses that were recorded back in the first quarter. So, the main takeaway is we are continuing to invest. We will invest aggressively in products and go-to-market where we have talked about quite consistently over time. And it’s much as operating losses and operating margin will benefit from increased scale over time.

I think the main thing we would want to leave you with is that, we are seeing, in part an acceleration in the shift to digital, but it’s too early to forecast the extent to which these changes in consumer behavior and advertising spend will endure.

I usually look at the different components of Search as basically four key drivers. The first one obviously being the queries, so are we really the best place for users to turn to when they need information. The second one is, I would call it, as coverage. So what percent of coverage is really commercial and then what percentage are we actually covering with ads. And then we need to ask ourselves, do both of these have upside. The third one is click-through rates or individual. At click-through rates close to being optimized, is there more we can do it here by just delivering better creative, better ads, better answers, to what extent can we deploy next-generation machine learning here. And then the last one is obviously the CPC, right? How much is someone willing to bid for click on their ad and this is obviously to a large extent driven by the quality of traffic we are sending, and then conversion rate is a big driver of this. So we are working very closely with our partners, advertisers and so on across the world to help them optimize their conversion rates and their O/I.

I think, at the highest level, the approach is unchanged. Our approach on investing capital allocation is first and foremost to support long-term growth with financially sustainable businesses. It’s about being sharper within product areas and then making sure we are investing. And what I keep referring to is operational excellence, things like our technical infrastructure, systems to improve productivity, to improve velocity of our product teams and then the very important efforts around privacy and security and content moderation. And I think, to your question, the experiences of this past year underscored really the value of having made those investments to protect and support operational excellence. It really served us well and customers in our ability to deliver throughout this period of time. So that framework is unaltered. I think that part of what you are seeing in the first quarter, I have said it a couple of times now, but are some notable items in the quarter. The lapping of the allowance for credit losses, the benefit from depreciation life and then there were certain things that were due to COVID just the lower impact for things like T&E and marketing.

Obviously, creating a lot of new opportunities for small businesses, and obviously, consumers are spending more time online. They are buying more online.

As we look forward at developing our real estate footprint for offices, what we factor into it is, first, we are growing our headcount, we are looking at less density per employee. So even with a hybrid work environment, we will continue to need space and so we are continuing to build out our campuses and office facilities. What you saw in the first quarter was a slightly slower pace for that and a slower pace on fit-outs, as well as we are evolving what does the space look like.

Below the line budgets are really significant, everything promotional pricing, product placements, sponsorships and so on and so on. So there is this massive acceleration in e-commerce due to the pandemic. Still more than 80% of commerce is still offline. So there is a huge opportunity here across the world for us to tap into those other budgets. There are really traditional use in a very different context.

Today, I'll give an overview of the quarter, going through some of our product momentum, then touching on Cloud and YouTube. First, I want to acknowledge that the new COVID-19 variants have been challenging for so many communities across the world. As the pandemic evolves, we want to help people get the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe. I really encourage everyone to get the vaccine when it's available to you. Turning to the quarter, we saw a rising tide of online consumer and business activity. We are proud that our services helped so many businesses and partners. In fact, we set a number of records this quarter. This quarter, publisher partners earned more than they ever have from our network. We also paid more to YouTube creators and partners than in any quarter in our history. And on top of that, over the past year, we have sent more traffic to third-party websites than any year prior, in addition to generating billions of direct connections like phone calls, directions, ordering food and making reservations that drove customers and revenue to businesses around the world that are working to get back on their feet. A few years ago, we placed a bet on AI believing that it would be a fundamental technology that would underpin and dramatically improve all our products. That vision was on full display at our I/O event in May where we announced new advancements that will be helpful to people and businesses everywhere. As one example, we introduced Multitask Unified Models or MUM. MUM is a big advancement in Search, a thousand times more powerful than our current systems. It has the ability to learn and transfer knowledge across 75 languages, which means that it can learn from sources in one language and help bring that information to you in another.",326.0,163.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.03067484662576687,0.006134969325153374,0.018404907975460124,0.0,0.0,0.024539877300613498

We are pleased with the growth in Google Services revenues in the second quarter. Year-on-year performance reflects elevated consumer online activity, broad based strength in advertiser spend and the lapping of the first ever revenue decline in our Ads business last year due to COVID. In the second quarter, retail, again, was by far the largest contributor to the year-on-year growth of our Ads business. Travel, financial services and media and entertainment were also strong contributors. Let's now take a few minutes to talk about the trends we've seen across our business. Over the last 18 months, we've been deeply focused on helping businesses, big and small, navigate profound change. First, as a lifeline during the pandemic, and now, as a partner to reaccelerate growth as the world begins to reopen. The road to global recovery is likely to be uneven and unpredictable. That's why the real-time insights we've put in the hands of businesses going into the pandemic will be just as important coming out of it. New tools like Travel Insights, which launched in the US this month after rolling out to select countries in APAC and EMEA in December, are helping our partners get a clearer picture of where demand is coming from.",228.0,117.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.02564102564102564,0.017094017094017096,0.008547008547008548,0.0,0.0,0.008547008547008548

My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I state otherwise. We'll start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook. For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $61.9 billion, up 62%, or up 57% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenue was $26.2 billion, up 41%, primarily driven by growth in TAC, which was $10.9 billion, up 63%, followed by growth in other cost of revenues, which was $15.3 billion, up 29%, the largest driver of which was content acquisition costs. Operating expenses were $16.3 billion, up 22%. In terms of the three component parts of OpEx, first, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth. Second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to the ramp-up of spending on ads and promo in contrast to the pullback in the second quarter last year. Finally, the increase in G&A reflects the impact of charges relating to legal matters. Headcount was up 4,061 from the first quarter. Operating income was $19.4 billion, up 203%, and our operating margin in the quarter was 31%. Other income and expense was $2.6 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $18.5 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $57.1 billion, up 63%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $35.8 billion in the quarter were up 68%, with broad-based strength across our business, led again by strong growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $7 billion were up 84%, driven by brand, followed by direct response. Network advertising revenues of $7.6 billion were up 60%, driven by Ad Manager and AdMob. Other revenues were $6.6 billion, up 29%, primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, followed by hardware, which benefited from the addition of Fitbit revenues. And finally, Google Play, which lapped the increased level of user engagement that started in Q1 last year due to the pandemic. Google Services operating income was $22.3 billion, up 134%, and the operating margin was 39%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $4.6 billion for the second quarter, up 54%. GCP's revenue growth was again above Cloud overall, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Once again, strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by robust growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $591 million. As to our Other Bets in the first quarter, revenues were $192 million, the operating loss was $1.4 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. In the second quarter, revenues benefited from an FX tailwind of more than 4% at the consolidated level. Based on FX spot rates against the dollar relative to the third quarter of last year, we expect a more muted tailwind to revenues in the third quarter. In terms of outlook by segment, for Google Services, the benefit to revenue growth in Q2 from lapping the effect of COVID last year will diminish through the balance of the year as we begin to lap stronger performance in the second half of 2020. In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from elevated consumer online activity and broad-based strength in advertiser spend. We believe it is still too early to forecast the longer term trends as markets reopen, especially given the recent increase in COVID cases globally. Within other revenues, Play revenue growth for the balance of the year will face headwinds due to the impact of lapping elevated engagement in the pandemic, as well as the change in fee structure, which was implemented as of July 1. We continue to invest across Google services to support the extraordinary opportunities we see. A couple of reminders consistent with prior years, we expect that headcount additions will be seasonally higher in Q3 as we bring on new graduates. In addition, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year, in part, to support product launches in the holiday season. As for Google Cloud, we remain focused on revenue growth and are pleased with the trends we are seeing. Across Cloud, we will continue to invest aggressively, given the opportunity we see. Turning to CapEx. The results in the second quarter primarily reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, most notably in servers, to support ongoing growth across Google. We also began to increase the pace of investment in ground up construction and fit outs of office facilities, which were slowed due to COVID and are focused now on advances  Turning to cash and capital allocation. We continue to generate strong free cash flow of $16.4 billion in the quarter and $58.5 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the second quarter with $136 billion in cash and marketable securities. As we indicated in our press release today, our Board has approved an amendment to the existing $50 billion stock repurchase program permitting us to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner that's in the best interest of the company and its stockholders.

One for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, the first one is you've had so much innovation over the years using AI to improve Search and improve the overall business. Can you just give us some examples of where you still see low hanging fruit or areas for further improvement in the company's overall products using AI, et cetera, over the next couple of years? And then, Philipp, your comments on omnichannel were pretty loud and clear. Give us some examples of where you're most focus to continue to enable more retailers to move in the omnichannel sort of drive that side of the business?

We see so much headroom given our bet on AI, going to our most important product of all, Search. When you see the launch of Bird, which was a significant improvement, and we are following that up with MUM, which is another extraordinary advance. So the rate information is growing, pretty rapidly. And so constantly developing better models to improve our search quality ranking, et cetera, is one of the most important ways we invest. Beyond that, I would say, all the work we are doing into making sure computers can understand in a multimodal way, be it images, audio, text, video, and then bringing it across our products, I think, is an important way we'll approach it.

And to my part of the question, look, we want to make sure that when people come to Google, they are able to basically find the best products and prices available from, frankly, the widest possible range of merchants. And we're making strong progress under Bill's leadership. And as I said earlier, 2020 was about removing financial barriers. We made listings free, removed commission fees. And it's worth pointing out the upside of combining free listings with shopping ads actually. Merchants that used both in Q1 saw a 50% lift in clicks once they started, I think that's pretty impressive. 2021, as I said, has been about removing integration barriers. We have the partnerships with Shopify, Square, BigCommerce, GoDaddy, WooCommerce and so on. And they're making it easier for businesses to get started with us, whether it's across Search and Shopping and image search and YouTube. And then once merchants are onboarded, I mean, there's so much more value we can offer them. We launched a new measurement tools to help retailers better understand performance and pricing. You asked specifically a question about focus areas. And then we're making the product and user experience better, not only with our UI/UX research feedback with our tech and AI capabilities. And maybe a cool example is how we're using AR to bring in-store experiences online, like with auto dealerships, and then letting users really try before they buy. And we do this in cosmetics and in apparel categories. And we have the shopping graph, which I mentioned earlier. We think it will open up completely new product experiences across Google. Shopping with Lens is one example. You can shop your screen shots or use your phone camera to find the dress or pair of sneakers that caught your eye or whatever. And we're working hard to build an open retail ecosystem, and that really levels the playing field for all merchants, and we think there is a lot of opportunity ahead. And I think those are our biggest areas of focus.",349.0,175.0,10.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.05714285714285714,0.022857142857142857,0.011428571428571429,0.005714285714285714,0.0,0.03428571428571429

First, just I think the key initiative over the last couple of years has been to bring the full breadth of Google Services to customers. So I was hoping you could talk more just about - when you think about the Search and overall ads recovery, and then also growth in Google Cloud, how those efforts are going as you work across businesses with corporate customers and what their reception has been? And then, Ruth, just on costs kind of in the back half and going forward, as you think about bringing some of these costs back, just curious if you can comment more around some of the puts and takes as you think about the overall cost structure pre COVID versus post COVID?

I would say, overall, as you realize, it's a broad digital shift, customers are looking for digital transformation. And depending on the sector they are in, they look to Alphabet as a digital partner, and we try to bring the broader solution set that's possible across our capabilities, and that's been working well. You mentioned Cloud, most of our Cloud customers are either in conversations with us. It could be because they're concerned about security on their supply chain or they're trying to understand the shift to digital and invest more in data analytics. Or the shift to hybrid workforce is what's probably getting them to think about Workspace and so on. And if they are retailers, we can bring in our expertise across ads, the work we are doing on commerce to be - with the partnerships we have, and so we can bring those additional expertise to bear. And so that's a trend we are seeing across. Philipp gave examples of our telco partnerships. And so across our priority verticals, we are able to engage in a broad way. And maybe the recent Google-wide partnership with Univision was another example of a multiyear, multi-product partnership with companies.",210.0,93.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.010752688172043012,0.010752688172043012,0.053763440860215055,0.0,0.010752688172043012,0.0

Really, the driving focus is how do we support near term, long term quality growth. And I think it's important to note that some of our costs are less variable in the short term, such as depreciation and the operations cost of our data centers. So when you look at Q2 performance, in part, the meaningful year-on-year improvement in the operating margin in the second quarter, clearly reflects the strong revenue growth, but also the fact that some of these costs are less variable in the short term. However, to support long term growth, and very much to your question, it's true across both Google Services and Google Cloud, we will continue to increase the pace of investment. And that's true in headcount, it's true with compute, sales and marketing, really across the board. And you also heard that in some of my comments about CapEx. We're continuing to pick up the pace of investment in office facilities. Both fit outs and ground up construction have been slowed as a result of COVID, and we're pleased that the pace has picked up, and that really relates to our comments about continuing to build out across the US, around the globe, in line with continuing to invest in headcount growth. I'd make one other point, which is, I think you're aware of this, but in this quarter, the results also reflect the benefit from the change in useful lives that we talked about earlier in the year that reduced depreciation expense. It's a benefit of about $721 million in the quarter, and the benefit from this change will be lower in the second half as you're looking ahead.",304.0,146.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.02054794520547945,0.02054794520547945,0.0136986301369863,0.0,0.0,0.0

A couple, when you look at Search in the quarter, it really accelerated beyond the comp. And if you look at it quarter-over-quarter, it was really good. So wondering if there's any products or verticals that really surprised you, or things to call out. And how do you think about the sustainability here, specifically in Search and the product pipeline from here? And then secondly, on Cloud, really saw a nice margin improvement there.

On the Cloud side, first of all, we do investments in our infrastructure. First of all, we are doing it across a set of cloud services we are building for Google. And it's the same that we bring to Cloud, and so there's tremendous synergies we have there. And maybe to give you an example of it, I already mentioned data analytics and processing. It's the same infrastructure, be it BigQuery, et cetera, which we have invested and built over time. And people are looking to use data analytics alongside with machine learning and AI. They want to do this across structure and unstructured data, do it across any platform. And so that's the kind of capability we are able to bring.

There's really no change in our approach to building the Cloud business. We do intend to continue to invest meaningfully. We are very pleased with the business, as we both said. As an example, we're continuing to build out the global footprint, continuing to invest in our compute capacity globally. As an example, we most recently announced a second cloud region in India. This is our 26th cloud data center region globally. And so continuing to invest across the board, given the opportunity that we see. And as I said last quarter, I would not extrapolate from quarter-to-quarter, given we still are in the early stages of building the business, and we do intend to continue to invest aggressively, including expanding our go to market organization, our channel expansion, our product offerings and our compute capacity.

Is it fair to say as well based on your initial comments that security also represents some competitive differentiation that's contributing incrementally to business development? And then for Philipp, in the momentum in YouTube and capturing the shift in viewership and advertising away from linear TV, how do the different Google Services fit together in that?

Obviously, Google for a long time. We are cloud native. We pioneered approaches like Zero Trust, built the architecture out from a security first perspective. And so particularly over the course of the last couple of years, as companies have really - with the recent attacks, they really started thinking deeply about the vulnerabilities, supply chain security has been a major source of consensus, particularly over the past few quarters. Cyber threats, increasingly, is in the mind of not just CIOs, but CEOs across our partners. And so it's definitely an area where we are seeing a lot of conversations, a lot of interest.

Maybe let me start on the brand side. The global shift to online video and streaming continues, with over like 2 billion monthly active users now, 1 billion plus hours of video watched every day. I think we're at the forefront of this shift. And advertisers have increasingly needed to look beyond linear TV alternatives to achieve their reach and awareness goals. And as I said earlier, Nielsen total ad ratings reach reporting has found, on average, 70% of YouTube's reach was delivered to an audience, not reached by the advertisers TV media. So not only are we driving improved reach, but we're also helping brands do it more efficiently. And as a result of this, you see many advertisers re-evaluating the media mix and increasing their investments in our platforms. And as far as the direct response part goes, we're helping advertisers convert intent into action. We try to drive performance at an incredible scale. Take an example like with video action campaigns, which is our next-generation TrueView for Action format. Advertisers are getting access to even more inventory across YouTube and our partners, all in a single automated campaign. And as I said before, we're working really hard to make YouTube not only more actionable, but also more shoppable. So YouTube is proving to be meaningful for not just brand building and reaching a massive audience, but also for converting viewers into buyers. And what's nice is that we're seeing more advertisers leveraging brand to create demand and direct response to convert it. So they're basically using the funnel very, very smartly. And then to the second part of your second question, the YouTube TV ads, for example. This part, we're really trying to bring the - well, connected TV is - let me phrase it from a connected TV part. I think that's easier. It is really the fastest growing consumer service that we have. And that growth started before the pandemic and has frankly solidified since.

And a number of shopping capabilities' already underway, and we're working really hard to make it easier for users to discover and buy directly on YouTube.

But obviously, local communities are in varying stages of recovery. Some are reopening, while others are, unfortunately, returning to lockdown. And we're focused on continuing to, I would say, level the playing field for SMBs here. And from getting them online and, frankly, set up for success, you're giving them all the digital tools they need to get discovered and be ready for what's ahead. This includes the ability to like seamlessly transition between online and offline and reach customers nearby, far beyond their local neighborhoods as well. So over the past few months, I mean, literally, just the past few months, we've made it easier for SMBs to show their products across Google for free, and we added new ways for them to highlight in-store inventory through local inventory ads. And we've also made it easier for them to leverage the power of YouTube. They now can create video ad campaigns literally within minutes via their smartphone.

And where do you see the opportunity for Google in terms of your product offerings to maybe improve consumer adoption of connected TVs?

Look, I mean, there is a shift to these becoming computing devices over time. They are going to be connected computing experiences. People who both consume content passively, actively, including gaming, over the top video and so on. So we view this as part of our platform shift. Android TV has made tremendous strides. It's a very customizable platform. We are working not only with TV providers globally, we are doing it with cable box manufacturers, as well as we supplement it with Google TV, with Chromecast as well. So it's a significant investment from our side, making sure we can drive that shift.

Let me maybe talk a little about how we think about the overall market for Search. In the addressable market, in the last call - last quarter, I gave you a little bit of a breakdown here. But what is really important is we're not just addressing above the line marketing budgets, which is different metrics around, let's say, around $0.5 trillion  which is traditional advertising, TV advertising and so on. There is also significant upside in below the line budgets overall, like promotional pricing, product within sponsorships and so on. And sure, we've seen COVID accelerate the shift to e-commerce at an astounding rate, but keep also in mind, 80% of commerce still remains offline. So there's a lot of room for digital to play a bigger role, and we think we can tap into other budgets that were traditionally used for, let's say, local advertising to drive sales. And as we think about our long runway for growth, we also think obviously about improving user and advertiser experiences for years to come here. And we're constantly asking ourselves how do we drive better answers to queries, including those with commercial intent. And how do we use our ML to deliver even more relevant and higher quality experiences for users.

In 2016, I laid out our vision to become an AI-first Company. Five years later, this quarter's results show how our investments in AI are building more healthful products for people and for our partners in local communities. Today, I'll begin with new product highlights, then I'll cover our cloud business, followed by YouTube. First, product highlights. Search remains the heart of what we do. We have made remarkable advances over the past 23 years that benefits search and related products like Google Assistant, which just celebrated five years. Earlier this year, we announced that we reached a significant milestone with Multitask Unified Model or MUM for short. MUM is a thousand times more powerful than BERT and can understand information across many contexts, like text and images. At our Search On event in September, we shared how we are using MUM to improve Google Lens, so people can search using both images and words. We also shared that we are bringing a more visual shopping experience to Search, powered by Google Shopping graph. It links shoppers with over 24 billion product listings from merchants across the web. Google Maps now offers eco-friendly routing. It lets drivers in the U.S. choose a more fuel-efficient route, saving money and reducing emissions. Maps now has a wildfire layer so that people can get up-to-date details and make quick informed decisions during emergencies. Finally, in Search and our Discover feed, we are continuing to support the news ecosystem and make quality journalism more accessible. Philipp will give a bit more detail about our new showcase partnerships. Turning next to hardware, I hope you saw our fall Pixel event last week. I am very excited about the range of Pixel phones available this holiday season. The new Pixel 6 and 6 Pro bring together the best of Google AI, software and hardware, with the most advanced and inclusive cameras we've ever built. They're beautiful, fast, and powered by Google Tensor, a first-ever system on a chip. It's specifically built to support Google AI and machine learning on device, and provides a long-term foundation for our Pixel devices. We also introduced our new Nest Renew program, which uses Nest thermostats to support clean energy use in the home. On to Android. Android 12 is getting great reviews. It's the biggest design change in Android's history with new widgets to personalize your phone. We also introduced accessibility features that use gestures to control your phone and communicate. Android 12 is secured by default and private by design. New dashboards and indicators make it easier to view and adjust privacy permissions, and disable access to device sensors and location information. We've also made progress with the Made for India affordable smartphone, co-developed with Reliance. The JioPhone Next device features premium localized capabilities and is on track to launch in market by Diwali. On to cloud, where we see continued momentum with Q3 revenue growing 45% year-over-year, with GCP's revenue growth rate above Cloud overall. At Cloud Next, two weeks ago, we unveiled hundreds of new capabilities, services, and solutions. We also announced 20 new and expanded partnerships to support the growth and scale of our customers around the world. More than any other top cloud provider, Google Cloud has unique capabilities to meet the needs of enterprises, digital natives, and SMBs around the world. I'll highlight three. First, our leadership in real-time data, analytics and AI is winning customers like Carrefour Belgium, Deutsche Post DHL, and Wendy's, who are unlocking data to deliver unique business outcomes. BigQuery, our leading data warehouse solution is reducing costs and driving productivity at Cardinal Health and ATB Financial. Our differentiated AI and ML-based industry solutions are helping leading global companies. GE Appliances, a Haier Company is integrating Vision AI into their next-generation smart home appliances, and IKEA Retail is using recommendation AI to drive a 30% increase in customer click-through rate. Second, customers see value in our open scalable infrastructure that enables them to run workloads anywhere, on our cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. Rodan + Fields scaled its SAP environment. Siemens Energy is migrating its global network of data centers and Company-wide SAP systems, and Indonesia's largest technology, digital native, GoTo Group is supporting over a 100 million monthly active users with Google Cloud. General Mills, Bell Canada, and Wells Fargo are harnessing our leadership in multi-cloud and our open development environment. To meet the unique digital sovereignty needs of customers around the world, we announced industry first partnerships with T-Systems in Germany and Thales in France. Third, as consumers, businesses and schools continue to shift towards hybrid work, the threats of cybersecurity continue to increase. Customers are turning to Google Workspace and our cybersecurity platform to provide the ease of use, collaboration, and security they need. These include organizations like Discovery, Common Spirit Health, and the state of Maryland, who want to foster creativity while securely protecting their users. We're also seeing strong growth in our broad portfolio of cyber security products. This includes Chronicle, one of our zero-trust offerings, with JetBlue users to detect cyber security threats, helping to protect its customers and enterprise. We're bringing our team's deep expertise to customers through the Google Cyber Security action team and a new Work Safer program, which provides best-in-class security for emails, meetings, messaging, and more. Earlier, I mentioned a few of the sustainability-related product features we announced. Our Cloud customers already benefit from operating on the world's cleanest cloud and last year we set an ambitious goal to run our data centers and campuses on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030. Two - thirds of the electricity consumed by Google data centers in 2020 was matched with local carbon-free sources on an hourly basis. And our new carbon footprint tool gives customers carbon emissions insights associated with their Google Cloud Platform usage. Now over to YouTube for a few highlights. We recently surpassed 50 million music and premium subscribers, including those in trial. And YouTube shots continues to see higher option rates. In the past year, the average number of daily first-time creators more than doubled. Next week as global leaders gather in Glasgow to address climate change, YouTube is partnering with COP26 to livestream conference activities, making the event more accessible for everyone. As we grow, we are maintaining our open global platform responsibly by removing harmful content and reducing bottom-line content. Both our AI investments and the promotion of Clustered sources have helped us significantly lower the violated view rate, which is the percentage of views on YouTube from content that violates our policies. Onto our other bets. Waymo began welcoming riders to its trusted tester program in San Francisco in addition to its fully autonomous ride-hailing service currently in Phoenix. Next year, Waymo will open a dedicated trucking hub in the Dallas Fort Worth area, helping support commercial freight droughts across the Southwest. And we announced last week the first commercial expansion of things on demand, air delivery service to Walgreens customers in select locations. To close, the world is slowly starting to travel and meet up in-person. In this quarter, I joined events virtually to celebrate some big milestones in regions around the world. Earlier this month, we announced a $1 billion investment in Africa over five-years to support the continent's digital transformation. And September mark 20 years since we opened our first office outside of the U.S. in Tokyo. We now have thousands of employees in 28 offices across the Asia Pacific region. And we are investing in cloud regions and digital skills programs to help expand economic opportunity there. As you can see, our business in APAC is growing really well. in Africa, Asia Pacific and beyond it's been a successful quarter and we have lots more innovation and product development on the way. Thanks to our employees around the world for their contributions. As we continue our [Indiscernible] to hybrid work, I hope to see more of you in person soon.

We are pleased with the growth in Google Services revenues in the third quarter. Year-on-year performance was driven by broad-based strength and advertisers spend. Consumer online activity also remained elevated. In the third quarter, Retail was, again, by far the largest contributor to year-on-year of our Apps business. Media and entertainment, finance, and travel were also strong contributors. Let's take a deeper look at some of the trends that drove this quarter's performance. First, from a big picture global recovery perspective, we continue to see a lot of unevenness. Some economies have restarted and re-accelerated or be at different speeds. Other countries, depending on local regulations and vaccines, have been slower to rebound. It's clear that uncertainty is the new normal. The world is in flux. So when it comes to anticipating change, predicting demand, and investing in innovation, businesses need as much support now as they did a year-and-a-half ago.

So last month we launched free [Indiscernible] for things to do, and a new ad format that makes it easier to promote local experiences.

And then there are companies like Alaska Airlines that are harnessing first-party data and automation across search to navigate market fluidity and better understand the lifetime value of their customers. They have increased return on ad spend by 30% plus versus the same period pre COVID, beyond travel.

With a multi-pronged approach, including Shopping campaigns, de Bijenkorf drove substantial growth throughout the pandemic. Returning visitors to online stores, were up fourfold in first half 2021 versus 2020, which leads me to Retail, where we had another stellar quarter. We've seen explosive growth in Digital over the last 27 months. But as the world begins to reopen, shoppers are returning to stores. Brick and mortar isn't dead. Instead, omni -channel is in full force. Searches for open now near me are four times globally versus last year. Strong growth in Local Shopping queries means people are researching the visits to stores more often before they go. As a result, we've seen more advertisers include in-store sales alongside e-commerce goals to drive omni -channel growth. Adoption has nearly doubled over the past year. Take COTS, it optimizes media spend into trending categories and launched curbside pickup just two weeks after its 1100 stores shutdown. After testing local inventory ads in Q4, COTS went all-in on omni -channel bidding across its paid search portfolio and is leaning heavily into a full funnel approach on YouTube, including CTV. COTS (ph) net sales were up 31% year-over-year in Q2, led by higher foot traffic and continued strength in digital. Innovating an omni -channel and next-gen user experiences remains core to our Shopping strategy. A few of our latest launches include easier ways for business to show the local services they offer, from hair extensions to auto repair, across Search and Maps. Local inventory ads, it highlights which products are in stock and when to pick them up. Free shipping and easy return annotations across Search and Shopping, AI capabilities that bring in-store moments online and that users try before they buy, and then instantly shoppable images with Google Lens, plus a new visual, browsable experience on Search. There's a lot more to come, including tapping into commerce on YouTube. From shoppable livestream experiments with retailers like, Sephora, Target and Walmart. To pilots that, that viewers by directly from the favorite creators videos we're still in the early innings of what’s possible. Our direct response momentum remains strong, video action campaigns are driving more conversions than previous formats, and by adding product feeds to these campaigns, advertisers are achieving on average, over 60% more conversions at a lower cost than those without. Our brand business is also performing well. As I said last quarter, YouTube's reach is becoming increasingly incremental to TV. We're helping advertisers find audiences they can't find anywhere else. Connected TV is driving part of this growth, is our fastest-growing screen. The precision of digital paired with the scale of linear is proving to be an awesome combo. And even more so now with the expansion of video action campaigns for CTV. Advertisers can now drive conversions on the big screen, which brings me to help brands of all sizes continue to buy YouTube at both ends of the funnel to create future demand while they convert existing demand. And they're seeing upside. For example, we found that advertisers using both DR And brand video see brands driving 28% of conversion assists. Domino's Pizza is a great example. the UK business delivered a 9x return on ad spend on their direct response campaigns when paired with our brand campaigns. Lastly, I've said it before, and I'll say it again: our success is only possible because of our customers and partners. We do well only when they do well. And it's a result of the revenue share models we've talked about many times before. Three highlights, first, as Sundar mentioned, our commitment to high-quality journalism and open access to information remains steadfast. It's been one year since we launched new showcase. In Q3 alone, we signed over a 120 deals and launched in three new markets, Japan, Colombia, and Austria. And of the more than 1,000 publications across a dozen-plus countries that we now have on board, 90% are considered local, regional, or community newspapers. Second, over 2 million creators are now making money and building their businesses on YouTube via YouTube Partner Program with 10 different ways to monetize their content from Super Chat to Brand Connect. The next-generation of businesses and media companies are being built by creators on YouTube and we're excited to help them grow. Third by echoes Sundar's excitement on Pixel, and to bring it to life and to users, we worked with an entire ecosystem of partners. We signed partnership agreements with over 45 carriers and retailers across 9 countries at launch, including deep collaboration, with each of the major U.S. carriers AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. On behalf of many. I want to say how grateful we are to collaborate with so many amazing customers and partners everyday. We can't wait to start doing more of this in person again soon. Also, a huge thank you to our sales partnerships, product and support teams for their work and dedication. The impact you all continue to have is, as we say in Germany, [Indiscernible], with that Ruth over to you.",887.0,461.0,13.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.028199566160520606,0.0021691973969631237,0.006507592190889371,0.0,0.0021691973969631237,0.026030368763557483

My comments will be on a year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I state otherwise. We will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook. For the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were 65.1 billion, up 41% or up 39% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was 27.6 billion, up 31% primarily driven by growth in TAC, which was 11.5 billion up 41%. Other cost of revenues were 16.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting in part the benefit from the change in useful lives meet earlier this year. The largest driver of the growth in other cost of revenues was content acquisition costs. Operating expenses were 16.5 billion, up 19%, in terms of the 3 component parts of opex. First, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth. Second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses was driven by headcount growth, followed by the continued ramp up of spending on ads and promo, in contrast to the pullback in the third quarter last year. Finally, the increase in G&A reflects the impact of charges relating to legal matters, followed by headcount growth. Operating income was 21 billion, up 88%, and our operating margin was 32%. Other income and expense was 2 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was 18.9 billion. We continue to generate strong free cash flow of 18.7 billion in the quarter and 65.7 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the third quarter with 142 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were 59.9 billion, up 41%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of 37.9 billion in the quarter were up 44% with broad-based strength across our business, led again by strong growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of 7.2 billion, were up 43% due to strength in both direct response and brand advertising. The deceleration in the growth rate versus the second quarter was driven by lapping a strong recovery in brand in the third quarter of last year. Network advertising revenues of 8 billion were up 40%. Other revenues were 6.8 billion up 23% driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues and hardware which benefited from the addition of Fitbit revenues. Google Services operating income was 24 billion, up 66%, and the operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were 5 billion for the third quarter, up 45%. GCP's revenue growth was again above Cloud overall, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by robust growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of 644 million. As to our other bets in the third quarter, revenues were 182 million, the operating loss was 1.3 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. With respect to foreign exchange impact on reported revenues, based on current spot rates, we expect virtually no impact in Q4, in contrast to 1.5% tailwind in Q3 and 4% in Q2. In terms of outlook by segment. For Google Services, as I noted, the strength of our revenues in Q3 reflected both underlying strength in advertiser and user activity, as well as the impact from lapping weaker performance in the comparable period last year. Given the gradual recovery in results through the back half of 2020, The benefit from lapping prior year performance diminished in Q3 versus Q2 and will diminish further in Q4. Within other revenues in the fourth quarter, we expect the ongoing drivers of revenue growth to the Hardware due to the benefit from the holiday selling season and inclusion of Fitbit, as well as YouTube subscriptions. Google Play's contribution to revenue growth will remain more muted given the ongoing impact of both lapping the increased level of user engagement that started in the first quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic, as well as the fee change that took effect on July 1. Within Google Services, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be elevated in the fourth quarter to support the holiday season. Turning to Google Cloud, we remain focused on revenue growth and are pleased with the trends we're seeing. In GCP, our customer wins, as Sundar noted, reflect our multi-year investments in products and solutions that are purpose-built to solve for the biggest opportunities within our targeted 8 industries. The benefit of these solutions to our customers is clear, and they are choosing to work with us as their long-term transformation partner. With respect to workspace, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum in both seat growth and average revenue per seat, which underscores the value of collaborative solutions, in particular, as people increasingly are embracing a hybrid work model. Across cloud, we continue to invest aggressively, both in growing our go-to-market and product teams, as well as building out our cloud regions. At the Alphabet level, headcount grew by nearly 6,000 in the third quarter, including our seasonal campus hires. And we expect robust headcount growth in Q4 for both Google Services and Google Cloud. Turning to CAPEX, the results in the third quarter primarily reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, most notably in servers to support ongoing growth in Google Services and Google Cloud. We also continue to increase the pace of investment in fit-outs and ground-up construction of office facilities to accommodate our ongoing headcount growth globally. We will continue to pursue real estate acquisition opportunities where it makes sense, as you saw in our New York City announcement in Q3. Thank you. And now, Sundar, Philipp, and I will take your questions.",969.0,520.0,17.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.032692307692307694,0.011538461538461539,0.0019230769230769232,0.0019230769230769232,0.0,0.021153846153846155

Coming back to how you started the call, when you look out over the next three to five years, what do you see are some of the big investments that Google needs to make to marry your ambitions on AI, machine learning against aligning Google's broader product and services against the rising digitalization of the global economy. Would love to have that as a framing over the next three to five years. And then maybe -- I am not sure if directed better at Philipp or Ruth, but on a shorter duration basis, it seems to be an element of headwinds and tailwinds in the broader, can you talk a little bit about the business elements of Google's products and what elements of reopening dynamic you're seeing on a sector basis versus potential headwinds as we move into Q4 and next year from things like supply chain shortages, or labor shortages, or things like that.

You're right in The fact that AI and ML itself is broader, deeper investments we are driving, and we're using it across our product portfolio. The recent launch of Tensor in Pixel six a great example of that. So for example, we're willing to go as steep in the stack as needed. Silicon both on the cloud side with our Tensor Processing Units and Google Tensor on the client side is an example of that. Overall, thinking through compute, networking, building data centers, making sure they are clean and carbon-free, and really investing in the advanced models and algorithms on top, which is a lot of it just done by our AI research teams. So making sure we're able to attract the best talent across the world is all part of that. So but you you'll continue to me to see us undertake deep technology investments and beyond the horizon.

We expect some amount of heterogeneity in recovery depending obviously on location and vaccination rates. But because every region is different, it's hard to make a generalization from the data right now. That said, the consumer shift to digital is real and will continue even as we start seeing people return to stores. Shopping habits have ebbed and flowed over the last 20 months. But the underlying takeaway is that people want more choice. They want more information, more flexibility, and we don't see this reversing. Omni -channel, I talked about it, is definitely in full force. I said this earlier. We've been really focused on building features and solutions to help retailers, large and small, succeed here. And we think this will continue as the world reopens, and shoppers fluctuate between online and in-store based on whatever is really more convenient. YouTube is exciting for many reasons. It's incredible to see lot of content that's valuable for people across so many topics, and we're helping advertisers tap into this. And whether it's browsing for inspiration, product research or actually making the purchase a billion shopping sessions happen across Google every day, and they are happening on search, in YouTube, in image search, in the shopping tab, on Lens, and so on.

The first one, you've made notable strides in the retail search category over the past 12 to 18 months, and there seems to be more to come. Can you talk to us about which other search verticals, where you are most excited to innovate and invest around the Nest, within the next year or two. My second question is, maybe one on augmented reality. You have made some real progress here and I have some budding product integrations.

On augmented reality, we've -- for a while, we've deeply focused on thinking through computing for the long-term. We've talked about ambient computing, and it's just a matter of time before beyond phones, you will see other successful form factors and AI is an exciting part of that future. We are looking at all deep investments, we need to make. I think it's going to take some time. And so for example, when you look at something like Google Lens or when you look at the fact that we are making search work in a multimodal way, or when you think about YouTube and making sure it works well. We are AI world so we are, obviously, investing in all our services. And beyond that from a computing standpoint, both our hardware teams as well as our platform teams are thinking through definitely, and it's going to be a major area of investment for us. On the first question, I think Philipp spoke about Shopping via, obviously, searches -- part of what makes search so successful is people use it for a wide variety of use cases. And so we really invest comprehensively across all experiences, be it Local and Maps, be it images, be it videos. And so we're definitely investing a lot. People do come to search for education as well, so making sure we're comprehensive. Health has been a major area of focus, particularly through the pandemic.

An important point, hopefully self-evident, is that the improvement in the Q3 operating margin does reflect the strong revenue growth in the quarter. And as I said on the second quarter call, some of our costs are less variable in the short-term, such as depreciation and the operations costs of our data centers. And we did have a gross margin benefit from this in the near term, but consistent with centers comments [Indiscernible], we do continue to invest here. And then to support long-term growth across both Google services and Google Cloud, we're continuing to invest at a meaningful clip across headcount, compute sales and marketing. I noted that headcount increase in Q3 of about 6,000 and we do expect the pace of hiring to remain strong. The benefit from the change in useful lives was obviously in the quarter as well and that benefit does diminish is lower in the fourth quarter. So just to put some of that in context, and as Sundar said, we are continuing to invest in the business focusing on long-term growth, with respect to the play changes. Again, just as it relates to this quarter, and I think as I said, in opening comments, the key point to note there was that results lap The strength that we had going into the pandemic from user engagement, and that continues to seeing user engagement.

The key points, as I said, starts with strong revenue growth and just timing lags. If some of the costs, as I said, are more fixed in the near-term, but we do continue to invest. And you can see that in gross margin. You can see it in operating margin. We are continuing to invest to support growth we see in both Google Services and Google Cloud. Up leveling the question, we've consistently said, let's look, we our focus on capital allocation is investing for long-term growth and innovation and making sure that we remain focused. On that though, those long-term opportunities. At the same time, we've consistently also said that it's important to ensure that we're being sharp about investments within each product area, and we're continuing to do that.

And so part of what excites me about the upcoming partnership with GO in building a phone is really investing beyond just English, and getting languages, and getting the local needs right for people and doing it in a way that many more people can take advantages of a smartphone. So, I view it as laying the foundation to version of digital transformation and its palpable demand we see and I think over a three to five-year time frame, it will end up having a lot of impact.

Are they really -- or is this really just a part of the process or stepping stones to bring more companies, or most companies over to full cloud adoption? And then secondly, we're seeing a clear blurring of the lines among e-commerce, digital payments, and social platform.

So we want to meet the customers the way they want to take this journey. I think we're gearing up to support them both on the multi-cloud form a hybrid cloud standpoint. But I do think overtime, when I look at the scale of which we are investing to support particularly to my points earlier around security and so on. I think people will see the value more of a hosted cloud solution. But I think we want to be customer centric here and then we want to go where the market goes. That's why we build a scalable server we have. So I'm excited about the opportunity there. Your second question around e-commerce digital platforms, shopping, social, how does it all fit together? For me, I see these two things, we want to get the primitive strike, which means as a user being able to search in YouTube, either on the products, we are trying to connect merchants to user stride and be it organically or through advertising, and so we are investing in identity, payments, making sure it's seamless for users, that's a big part of our focus. The second is really from a user experience standpoint both search in YouTube and other IaaS like Maps and discovery overtime. We will make sure if users want to act more beyond discovery and they want to do more that it's seamless to do so. But they're going to be focused on making sure for merchants that they get access to users. And that's the value proposition we deeply care about.

The last few months have been challenging for communities everywhere because of Omicron. I'm grateful for the frontline healthcare workers who are helping us through it and glad to see signs that this wave is receding in many parts of the world. Whether it's helping people find a COVID testing center, learn a new skill or launch a new business, our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it's ever been. In 2022, we'll stay focused on evolving our knowledge and information products, including Search, Maps and YouTube, to be even more helpful. Investments in AI will be key, and we'll continue to make improvements to conversational interfaces like the Assistant. I'll begin by touching on a few highlights from Q4. Our new AI models are helping to create information experiences that are truly conversational, multimodal and personal. For example, Multitask Unified Model, or MUM for short, has improved searches for vaccine information. And soon, we'll introduce new ways to search with images and words simultaneously. In October, we introduced a new AI architecture called Pathways. AI models are typically trained to do only one thing. With Pathways, a single model can be trained to do thousands, even millions of things. From MUM to Pathways to BERT and more, these deep AI investments are helping us lead in Search quality. They're also powering innovations beyond Search. For example, DeepMind's protein folding system AlphaFold was recently recognized by Nature & Science Magazine as a defining breakthrough. To illustrate the scale of the team's achievement, it took scientists more than 50 years to figure out the structure of 150,000 proteins. The DeepMind team has now expanded that number to 1 million, and they think they will get to more than 100 million this year. Philipp will talk in great detail about our advertising business, which also benefits from our investments in AI. It's been a very strong quarter for us. Our teams have helped millions of businesses of all sizes and launched dozens of important features to help them get the most out of their online marketing spend. These businesses are the backbone of our global economy and the heart of our community. So helping them thrive is more important than ever. We are also seeing exciting momentum at YouTube. YouTube Shorts continues to drive significant engagement. We just hit 5 trillion all-time views and have over 15 billion views each day globally. This is helping our creator community reach newer and bigger audiences. In fact, more people are creating content on YouTube than ever before. Last year, the number of YouTube channels that made at least $10,000 in revenue was up more than 40% year-over-year, and we are continuing to improve support for artists and creators. More creatives than ever are earning money from our non-ads products like Super Chat and channel memberships and the Shorts Fund is now available in more than 100 countries. Another big area for investment is combining the best of AI software and hardware to deliver helpful experiences across our family of devices. In Q4, we set an all-time quarterly sales record for Pixel. This came in spite of an extremely challenging supply chain environment. The response to Pixel 6 from our customers and carrier partners was incredibly positive. And AI is making Pixel even more helpful. As one example, Live Translate detects whether a chat message is in a different language and automatically translates it in up to 48 languages. We are also focused on ensuring devices across the Android and Chrome ecosystems work well together. For example, at CES last month, we announced that we are working with Acer, HP and Intel to bring great experiences to their devices. Also announced at CES, the new Ripple open standard will broaden the capabilities of radar technology opening the door for new products and services. Another priority is ensuring our products and services are private, secure and safe. To that end, I'll note a new privacy sandbox proposal called Topics API. We think it will be a big improvement for protecting user privacy while also ensuring businesses are able to thrive online. We'll begin testing this year and look forward to feedback from the industry. Next, on to Cloud. It's been a big year, so let me go a bit deeper this quarter. In Q4, Cloud revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $5.5 billion. Alphabet's backlog increased more than 70% to $51 billion, most of which is attributed to Google Cloud. This growth comes from many leading businesses, including Albertsons and LVMH; digital natives, including Box and Spotify; and public sector agencies, including the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Defense Innovation Unit and the USDA. Our sales force, which we have more than tripled since 2019, delivered strong results across geographies, products and industries, and we continue to invest. For the full year 2021, compared with the full year 2020, we saw over 80% growth in total deal volume for Google Cloud Platform and over 65% growth in the number of deals over $1 billion. Our partner ecosystem is helping accelerate our growth. For the full year 2021 compared with the full year 2020, the number of customers spending more than $1 million through the marketplace increased by 6x. Customer spend through channel partners on GCP more than doubled, and the number of active certifications within our top global systems integrators more than doubled as well. Our product leadership continues with more than 2,000 new cloud products and feature releases in the last year. These were in four categories. First, our data cloud and our AI/ML platform is helping organizations like Cartier, Groupe Rocher and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries understand and use their data intelligently across multiple clouds. Our fast secure data sharing capability helps the National Cancer Institute advance breast cancer research. Our unified data lake and data warehouse, which brings together unstructured and structured data, helps TELUS and Tyson Foods improve their understanding of customers. And our AI/ML platform helps CN deliver better customer experience. Second, our open multi-cloud infrastructure enables customers like BBVA and Wells Fargo to run mission-critical systems on our cloud. We believe new auto scaling in our Kubernetes engine, which allows customers to run 15,000 node clusters, outscales the competition by up to 10 times. Our edge cloud helps us grow in telecommunications, driving partnerships in Q4 with Indosat Oridu Hutchison, Telenor and Verizon. They join existing customers and partners, including Ericsson, Reliance Jio and Nokia. Third, our cybersecurity products are helping product organizations like ANZ Bank, Meditech and Wayfair as a trusted cloud provider. VirusTotal helps product organizations from software supply chain vulnerabilities. Chronicle and Security Command Center help organizations detect and protect themselves from cyber threats. And our fraud prevention and identity verification solutions are protecting over 5 million websites. Finally, our secure communication and collaboration platform, Google Workspace is helping public sector organizations like USAID and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory as well as global brands, including Colgate and Roche, adopt secure hybrid work. Our new Work Safer program launched in Q4 provides the highest security for e-mail meetings and documents by bringing together Google Workspace, Titan security keys, zero trust and other security advances. Customers come to Google Cloud because of our expertise in bringing enterprises and consumer ecosystems closer together. One example is Shopify. From Black Friday through Cyber Monday, Shopify reported $6.3 billion in global sales by 47 million customers, all safely transacted on Google Cloud. Importantly, we have made progress operating 24/7 on carbon-free energy and continue to provide customers the cleanest cloud in the industry. On to our Other Bets. October marked the one-year anniversary of our Waymo One fully autonomous commercial ride-hailing service in Arizona. In San Francisco, hundreds of riders are using Waymo One as part of our trusted tester program, but many more on the waiting list. And Waymo Via continues delivering freight into the Southwest U.S. and developing partnerships with key industry players. Before I close, I want to say how proud I am of Google’s work to help economic recovery around the world. Nearly a third of small business owners say that without digital tools, they would have had to close their business during the pandemic. Digital skills have also been a lifeline to help people find jobs and grow their carriers. Since 2014, we have provided digital skill training to over 90 million people around the world. In the months and years ahead, technology will help unleash new opportunities globally, especially as hundreds of millions more people come online in places, including Southeast Asia and Africa.

In the fourth quarter, retail was again by far the largest contributor to year-on-year growth of our ads business. Finance, media and entertainment and travel were also strong contributors. Before we dive into some of the trends that drove this quarter’s performance, let’s zoom out for a second. Quarter after quarter, for the last 20-some months, we said that the world is in flux, that the recovery is uneven, that uncertainty is the new normal. Q4 proved no different. What we know for certain though is that businesses are the lifeblood of a thriving economy, and our role in helping them remains more important than ever. AI continues to power our ability to help via Insights, new tools and automation. In fact, the same cutting-edge AI that’s advancing our understanding of everything from search to protein-folding is also driving innovation across our ads products. Let’s start with automation. It’s become a key differentiator for businesses in navigating complexity and efficiently reaching customers, wherever they are in a privacy-first wave. Our news campaign, Performance Max, went global in November and has been quickly embraced by advertisers. It brings the best of Google Ads, AI and automation together to let brands promote their businesses across all Google services from a single campaign, helping them drive more online sales, leads and/or foot traffic. It’s also an example of how we are radically simplifying our products and making them easier for customers to use. French children’s wear retailer Petit Bateau tested PMax over a three-week period, return on ad spend jumped 35%, click-through rates increased 40%, and valuable insights were gleaned into what messaging resonated most. We’ve also developed our Insights tools. Four new features launched in Q4, including demand forecast, which uses ML to help businesses predict forward-looking trends and better understand what goods to stock and what services to offer when. Whether it’s insights, automation or new features, our work to help businesses more easily connect with their customers has been nonstop. On top of the 100-plus enhancements made to our ads products every quarter, we’ve launched 200-plus features and tools since March 2020. A recent example. We made it easier for businesses to claim and verify their business profile on Google Search and Maps and respond to customer messages directly in search. In Germany, completed business profiles received an average of over 5 times more calls versus those that aren’t. For an SMB, that can be really meaningful. Let’s transition to retail, where we had a terrific quarter. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we’ve seen ongoing shifts in consumer spending patterns. Pre-COVID, each year, we saw increased spikes in demand between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. What’s interesting is that in 2020, and again in 2021, we actually saw shoppers start shopping earlier and spending more throughout the quarter. In Q4, we also saw a parallel lead year-over-year retail query growth with hobbies and leisure close second. I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again, the future of retail is omnichannel. And we continue to invest in new features and next-gen experiences so merchants and shoppers can benefit. Global searches for gift shops near me jumped 60% year-over-year in October, with searches for gifts near me up 70% in Google Maps. People increasingly want to know what’s available nearby before they get to the store. Our new in-stock filter helps with just that. Shoppers can find local stores that carry the products they want right from search, like a new tennis racket or that last-minute birthday gift. Showing in-store availability helps businesses attract local customers, and they’ve caught on. One in four local offers across shopping and Google.com are taking advantage of our curbside pickup badge. People also want deals. They’re looking for value. For shoppers, we made it possible to browse and discover the hottest deals for major moments like Black Friday and Cyber Monday on Search. For merchants, we made it even easier to list promotions via automated imports from third-party integrations like Shopify and WooCommerce. Moving inventory, attracting new customers and building brand loyalty during the holidays and beyond got a lot easier. In Q4, the number of merchants using promo features jumped 280% year-over-year. Retailers are also turning to us to help them transform and accelerate growth. Take Warby Parker, who drove a 32% year-over-year increase in its Q3 sales by not only opening stores and expanding its contact lens business, but also by tapping into Google across surfaces. Omnichannel bidding, smart shopping campaigns and an expanded presence in Maps to promote in-store eye exams contributed to Warby’s success and it since launched its first-ever brand awareness campaign on YouTube, which brings me to YouTube, where our commerce opportunity remains really exciting. We’re making it easier for viewers to buy what they see and simpler for advertisers to drive action with innovative solutions like product feeds and video action campaigns and emerging formats like live commerce. Backcountry.com generated a 12:1 return on ad spend with product feeds in 2021 and plans to double its investment in 2022, while Samsung, Walmart and Verizon partnered with creators to host shoppable holiday livestream events in the U.S. As for our brand business, momentum remains strong. We continue to make inroads in unlocking TV brand budgets, and we’re still in the early innings of what’s possible with Connected TV.  Let’s take a minute to double-click into the full funnel trend I talked about last quarter. YouTube’s ability to drive both massive reach and action is becoming more clear to more advertisers. In a recent study, DR advertisers who added YouTube branding formats not only drove increased reach, but also averaged 9% more conversions. At the same time, we see more brand advertisers adding action, like Nike Korea, which saw higher conversion rates and drove 50% plus incremental reach by adding video action. Another huge focus for us is continuing to deliver for our partners and key ecosystems, all while delighting users. Our expanded partnership with Snap to deliver a first of its kind quick tap to Snap feature is a great example. Our Pixel 4A with 5G or newer pixel phones users can access Snapchat directly from their lock screen, making Pixel the fastest phone to make a snap. And then across our Pixel and AR teams, we’re working with the NBA to create exciting immersive experiences for fans using 3D and AR technology. And the lighting doesn’t stop there. With Adobe, we are collaborating on a multiyear journey to bring Photoshop, Illustrator and its other flagship products to the web, a testament to the web as a first-class platform for creativity and productivity. As we close out another extraordinary and challenging year, I want to express deep gratitude to our customers and partners for their trust and collaboration. Our success is only possible because of their success. I also want to say a gigantic thank you to our product, engineering, partnerships, sales and many support teams for their outstanding work and unwavering commitment to helping our users, customers and partners. Ruth, over to you.",1260.0,683.0,30.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.043923865300146414,0.0014641288433382138,0.007320644216691069,0.0014641288433382138,0.0014641288433382138,0.0424597364568082

My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. We will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues were $75.3 billion, up 32% or up 33% in constant currency, rounding out a strong year. Our total cost of revenues was $33 billion, up 26%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $19.6 billion, up 25%. The biggest factors here were: first, content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for YouTube’s advertising-supported content followed by costs for subscription content; second, hardware costs; and third, costs associated with data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which were offset in part by the impact of the change in useful lives made at the beginning of 2021. Operating expenses were $20.5 billion, up 35%. In terms of the three component parts of OpEx: first, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth; second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses was driven primarily by increased spending on ads and promo for the 2021 holiday season, in contrast to the sizable pullback in the fourth quarter of 2020; finally, the increase in G&A reflects the impact of charges relating to legal matters as well as charitable contributions. Operating income was $21.9 billion, up 40%, and our operating margin was 29%. Other income and expense was $2.5 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $20.6 billion. We continue to generate strong free cash flow with $18.6 billion in the quarter and $67 billion in 2021. We ended the year with $140 billion in cash and marketable securities. We also repurchased a total of $50 billion of our shares in 2021. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $69.4 billion, up 31%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $43.3 billion in the quarter were up 36%, with broad-based strength across our business, led again by strong growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.6 billion were up 25%, reflecting strength in both direct response and brand advertising. The deceleration in the growth rate versus the third quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by lapping a strong recovery in brand in the fourth quarter of 2020. Network advertising revenues of $9.3 billion were up 26%, driven by AdMob. Other revenues were $8.2 billion, up 22%, driven primarily by growth in hardware, which benefited from the successful launch of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro as well as the addition of Fitbit revenues followed by YouTube non-advertising revenues. In terms of Google Services cost, TAC was $13.4 billion, up 28%. Google Services operating income was $26 billion, up 36%. And the operating margin was 37%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $5.5 billion for the fourth quarter, up 45%. GCP’s revenue growth was again greater than Clouds, and that reflects significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $890 million. As to our Other Bets for the full year 2021, revenues were $753 million. The operating loss was $5.3 billion for the full year 2021 versus an operating loss of $4.5 billion in 2020. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. We are nearly two years into a global pandemic that has brought unprecedented change and uncertainty in the macro environment. Throughout these difficult times, Googlers have remained focused on delivering helpful services for users and partners as well as on driving innovation for long-term growth. In terms of outlook by segment, for Google Services, we are very pleased with our year-on-year revenue growth in Q4 and for the full year 2021, which continued to be driven by broad-based advertiser strength and strong consumer online activity. The year-on-year growth rate also reflected a benefit from lapping COVID-related weakness in 2020, which obviously will not be a factor in 2022. Within other revenues, we are pleased with the momentum from Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro reflected in our hardware revenues in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, hardware revenues in 2021 also reflected the acquisition of Fitbit, which we lapped a couple of weeks ago. With respect to Play, the underlying consumer spend and engagement trends remained healthy in the fourth quarter. That being said, in 2022, Google Play’s contribution to revenue growth will reflect the fee changes we started to implement in the third quarter of 2021. In terms of investment levels within Google Services, we are focused investing meaningfully in the many opportunities we see for growth. Turning to Google Cloud, 2021 represented another year of substantial growth. Our investments in our go-to-market organization, product innovation and partner ecosystem have been paying off as we help customers with their digital transformation. You can see that Google Cloud revenues increased by 47% for the full year 2021 compared to 2020 with GCP revenues continuing to grow at a faster rate than cloud overall. While Cloud operating loss and operating margin improved in 2021, we plan to continue to invest aggressively in Cloud given the sizable market opportunity we see. We do remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability and over time, operating loss and operating margin should benefit from increased scale. At the Alphabet level, in the first quarter, based on current spot rates, we expect the foreign exchange impact on reported revenues to be a headwind. With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added nearly 6,500 people in the fourth quarter, and the majority of hires were for technical roles. We continue to attract great talent and expect a strong pace of hiring in 2022 across Alphabet. Turning to CapEx. The results in the fourth quarter primarily reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, most notably in servers, to support ongoing growth in both Google Services and Google Cloud. We also increased the pace of investment in fit-outs and ground-up construction of office facilities. In 2022, we expect a meaningful increase in CapEx. In technical infrastructure, servers will again be the largest driver of spend. With respect to office facilities, after fairly muted CapEx over the past two years, we are reaccelerating investment in fit-outs and ground-up construction. Recently, you have also seen us pursue real estate acquisitions where they make sense. For example, last month, we announced plans to purchase for $1 billion of previously leased headquarters building in London. And in the first quarter, we have completed the $2.1 billion purchase of a New York office building that we announced in the third quarter of 2021. Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions.",1141.0,623.0,25.0,8.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.04012841091492777,0.012841091492776886,0.004815409309791332,0.0016051364365971107,0.0,0.027287319422150885

Sundar, first was just curious to get your view on Web3 and just how you’re thinking about Alphabet’s approach and where your primary efforts here may lie going forward? And then, Ruth, you mentioned the 6,500 increase in head count. I think it was the biggest that we’ve seen in any quarter ever. I know you’re catching up on hiring from the last several quarters.

Look, any time there is innovation, I find it exciting, and I think it is something we want to support the best we can. The web has always evolved, and it’s going to continue to evolve. And as Google, we have benefited tremendously from open-source technologies, and so we do plan to contribute there. There’s several areas of interest, AR is a big one at the computing layer. We’ve been investing there for a long time and will continue to play a role. And it’s something both not just at the computing layer, the services layer, be it Maps, YouTube, Google Meet, et cetera, I think, will contribute a lot. On Web3, we are definitely looking at blockchain and such an interesting and powerful technology with broad applications, so much broader again in any one application. So as a company, we are looking at how we might contribute to the ecosystem and add value. Just one example, our Cloud team is looking at how they can support our customers’ needs in building, transacting, storing value and deploying new products on blockchain-based platform. So we’ll definitely be watching the space closely and supporting it where we can. Overall, I think technology will continue to evolve and innovate, and we want to be pro-innovation and approach it that way.",226.0,104.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0673076923076923,0.0,0.009615384615384616,0.0,0.0,0.0673076923076923

Susan has been writing a fair bit on YouTube and the way it’s exposed to the creator economy and what you’re trying to build for the medium to long-term. Can you talk about elements of the creator economy and how it sort of fits into your products, both on the advertising side and the commerce side over the medium to long-term? And then, Ruth, maybe just one follow-up on the expense side. Was there anything of a one-time nature in Q4? Because just looking at some of the corporate expense or some of the elements of the core margin, just trying to make sure if there were any one-timers that needed to be called out because I think you talked about legal and charitable donations as well just so we could model that right.

And even recently, I mentioned in my remarks earlier about the growth we are seeing not just in ads, but beyond ads, with Super Chat, channel memberships and so on. Susan mentioned in her creator letter that -- while early, they’ll be taking a look at NFT and so on, with the view towards making sure the user experience works and -- but there is value, we are constantly thinking about how we can support and do more for creators. So that’s going to be an integral part. I think all the commerce experiences we are thinking about in YouTube is a whole additional layer of opportunity. And again, it’s another area where it all feels very early to me. We are seeing tremendous traction in YouTube across newer areas, be it podcast, gaming, learning, sports. And so across all these areas, we’ll kind of take a vertical-specific look and see how we can support creators better.",189.0,79.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0379746835443038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0379746835443038

In sales and marketing, I would note that sales and marketing was elevated in the fourth quarter by ads and promo, in part to support the holiday season and more so than last year. The additional items to note that I called out is in the fourth quarter, we did have a one-time well-being bonus. We also had a year-on-year increase in charitable contributions, including a higher Googler gift match. And in fact, I would say that it’s more helpful in particular on the corporate costs unallocated to think of that line on a trailing 12-month basis because it can be lumpy to your question.",131.0,60.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.016666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Maybe the first one for Philipp. You’ve made so much progress over the last 12 to 24 months about improving the retail and e-commerce Search product for advertisers. As you look across the other verticals of Search, where are you most excited or see the most opportunity for innovation to really drive more value for advertisers in nonretail verticals as we go into 2022? Then the second question, either Philipp or Sundar, you both talked about the commerce shopping opportunity on YouTube. Can you just sort of talk to us a little bit about what aspects are already built out versus what areas of innovation or hurdles you still have to clear to really realize that commerce opportunity on YouTube?

Look, consumers now have a lot of different ways to access information and more than they’ve ever had before. And Search is just one of them. But we’re constantly trying to innovate and improve the experience for both users and advertisers over the long-term. And as I’ve discussed previously, I can share some of the questions we actually ask ourselves to give you a sense of how we think about the opportunity. So the first one, obviously, are we the best place users turn when they need information or want to discover and be inspired. So things like queries and discover. And we’re focused on providing better and more comprehensive answers to more types of questions, and we need to obviously deliver high-quality relevant info for all types of queries, including ones where they may be looking for a specific brand or product or just look for an inspiration. And how people search is changing, and it needs to become more multimodal, more conversational. So what does that mean for ads, for example. So getting user experience right across commercial quarries is essential way beyond, obviously, the area that you mentioned. And there is a lot of innovation that goes into this. The second part is really are we providing the most relevant ads when and where consumers are. And we only want to show ads when they’re helpful to people. On 80% of the searches actually, we show no top ads and most of the ads that you see are on searches with commercial intent. And yes, we’re -- for those with commercial interest, the question is really how do we provide the best answer in a way that’s meaningful to users and where advertisers actually have something relevant to offer. And then the last, the third point is really the questions around -- and this goes again for the vertical you mentioned -- but for many, many beyond -- are we delivering most conversions for advertisers at the best ROI? And there’s a lot of intelligence in our auction to deliver great ROI for advertisers, but there’s always more we can do. And we’re delivering -- or are we delivering the most relevant users by leveraging our users’ signals? Are we building the best creatives by combining advertisers’ assets in ways that make it compelling for user? Have we predicted the value of the user for that advertiser so we can help appropriately bid for each search with a unique user and query combinations we need? Can we fully measure what users do after they click on ads, from buying something to making phone calls or downloading apps and all across devices? So those are a lot of different things how we think about the runway ahead.",473.0,215.0,10.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.046511627906976744,0.023255813953488372,0.009302325581395349,0.0,0.004651162790697674,0.023255813953488372

Look, one thing I would say is across both Search, YouTube and other areas, there’s a lot of common infrastructure that’s getting done, right? So this is focused on merchants, onboarding merchants and all the back end so that we can have the broadest and the most comprehensive inventory available. And there, our partnership with other e-commerce platforms is a basic foundational layer we are putting in. And specifically on YouTube, while pretty early, there’s a lot of pilots underway, just we have introduced a creative tagging pilot program so that we were had a choice to browse, learn and shop products featured in the favorite videos, piloted shopping live streams with brands like Walmart and Target and more broadly, including product feeds more globally in video action campaigns. So there’s a lot more to do. Super early also on testing how shopping can be integrated with Shorts.

And second, is there any fundamental reason why Search could be higher growth today than it was pre-pandemic? And then over to Ruth, Cloud had impressive growth.

And so, when I look at the tip of tree about -- as to where the research on the AI side is progressing, it’s progressing at an incredibly rapid pace. We are committed to leading there. And then we have real good interfaces between the AI teams and our core product area teams, including Search to kind of productize this. So primarily, I think you’re going to continue to see us lead in search quality. I just find the world of information is only continuing to grow, and it’s getting increasingly multimodal in nature.

I just want to follow-up on Justin’s question about Search growing faster than pre-pandemic. I think, Philipp you talked about a couple of areas within search and retail is at the front of the list. I think you mentioned in a few other categories. Travel was always a big category. Do you feel like travel has come back full or is it -- travel is still sort of underperforming for macro reasons versus where it was pre-COVID? And then, Ruth, just on the share repurchases, I think that was a record level in the quarter. How should we think about the share repurchases going forward? To what extent is it opportunistic versus, I don’t know, systematic or systemic way you think about returning cash to shareholders as every year, your free cash flow rises?

Look, I said earlier that travel was a contributor to our year-on-year ads growth in Q4, and we were encouraged by the performance we saw throughout much of the quarter, but we found that user behavior tends to reflect what’s going on in the world. And demand really continues to vary based on location and type of activity. And this has been more pronounced in light of Omicron. We’ve seen changes in traveler search behavior as preferences have evolved such as searches for outdoor destinations like beaches, parks and camping have increased, while searches for museums, for example, have declined. Overall, I think it’s fair to say that travel has generally been sensitive to outbreaks and that there’s still unevenness that makes it too soon to say what trends are here to stay and which pre-pandemic habits are coming back. That said, as people think about where they want to go next, they’re coming to us to help them navigate a patchwork of information. In fact, from the end of August to the end of October, searches for travel rules were up over 6 times globally year-over-year. And we’ve launched a ton of new features to make it easier for people to understand changing travel restrictions and requirements. Similarly for travel partners, we’ve pivoted our product strategy in big ways to help whether it’s with Flight Demand Explorer and Travel Insights to help partners predict demand over making it free for hotel and travel companies and now to an activity operators to list their booking links. And I’m sure you also saw our big sustainability in news in October, new info on CO2 and Google Flights, eco-friendly hotels, new eco-friendly routes and maps. So lots of important work is being done here actually to help our users and business drive more sustainable choices and just overall help our travel partners and the industry at large.",333.0,170.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023529411764705882,0.0058823529411764705,0.011764705882352941,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.01764705882352941

I have a couple, Sundar and Philipp. Sundar, I’m just interested in the decision you announced last week to move away from Federated Learning and go to Topics. So you could talk a bit about the reason and the rationale why you’re making that change. When FLoC was first announced, it was patterned to be very effective relative to cookies as a signal for advertisers. What do you think is going to be the impact as you go away from cookies to topics on ROAs and budgets? And then Philipp, I think during the pandemic, one of the big growth spurts has definitely been connected TV. Can you talk a bit about what YouTube is seeing with Connected TV and how important of a driver is that? And then as hopefully we get back to normal, what are you doing on the product side to make YouTube on CTV even more engaging as time goes on?

So the Chrome team has been really focused and working independently on Privacy Sandbox, which you all know is our initiative to build privacy preserving on device technologies that will power the future of digital advertising and obviously as a result of free and open web. And just last week, we announced our new Privacy Sandbox called Topics. And Topics was informed by our own learnings plus widespread, let me call it, community feedback from our earlier FLoC trials. It will now actually replace our FLoC proposal. I urge you all to read last week’s blog for the details. But basically, the Topics API will allow advertisers to show relevant ads to people based on their interest inferred from the website they visit all in a more private way for users. And from an advertiser perspective, which is a big part of your question, it’s obviously way too early to share more because we’re just opening this up to the world. We expect to make it available for testing by the end of Q1, but we’re really focused on designing for both parties from an advertiser and a privacy point of view and are committed to making sure goals are met on both sides. On the second one, the connected TV opportunity, streaming in the living room has exploded. We’ve seen it firsthand. Connected TV is our fastest-growing screen, and we think there’s a ton of runway ahead. Brands are getting the best of all worlds, the precision of digital with the scale of linear and a lot more relevance. They can personalize ads at scale and use video ad sequencing to tell powerful stories and we’ve recently added action to the mix. Video action campaigns were upgraded in October to automatically include CTV inventory, which means users get a more helpful viewing experience and brands get to drive more online sales and/or leads. And just think about it like the traditional TV screen “desk screen” that viewers have essentially stared at for decades, is now starting to come alive with the ability to drive conversions and it’s pretty cool. Measurement is also obviously a key component to success here, and we want to make sure that advertisers can fully measure their YouTube CTV video investments across YouTube and YouTube TV for an accurate view of true incremental reach and frequency and so on. And the U.S. advertisers actually can do this now, if you have Comscore and Nielsen. So all-in-all, we are excited by the opportunities ahead with Connected TV.

As I indicated, there was a broad-based advertiser strength. There was strong consumer online activity, and those were really the primary drivers. I think the one place that that comment might be more relevant is really in understanding the year-on-year within YouTube relative to last year, where there was strength. This year relative to -- there was real strength this year, but what we saw last year was more in line with, I think, your question, which was after a week beginning of the year, a very strong fourth quarter.

First, Sundar, you mentioned that investment in artificial intelligence has helped the ads business significantly. What are the two to three ways that you think AI has helped your advertisers invest your ad revenue growth the most? And then second, we’ve seen a variety of new bills introduced in the U.S. Congress recently that seemed to take in squarely at large technology companies like Alphabet.

On AI and advertising -- after I answer the second part, pass it to Philipp to give more details. But definitely, again, the overarching thing is the same AI advancements we want to make it simpler for advertisers to run campaigns, and there’s a lot that goes behind it to drive that simplicity. And Philipp can give a bit more details there. On your question about Congressional antitrust bills. As a company, we have always been constructive in how we have approached and we are open to sensible updated regulations. It’s important that technology is beneficial to society. And so for example, there are many areas where there’s widespread agreement. We have call for privacy regulations, particularly at the federal level, updating productions for children and so on. On some of the current proposals, they quite don’t address those issues. There are areas where we are genuinely concerned that they could break a wide range of popular services we offer to our users, all the work we do to make them -- make our products safe, private, secure, et cetera. And in some cases, can hurt American competitiveness by disadvantaging solely U.S. companies. So broadly, when we think about building many features, do we have to think on each feature, we shipped 3,000 features in Search alone every year. How do we make sure that complies with all the regulation, where do we proactively need approvals and so on. So those all can have unintended consequences. We’re very worried about the impact on small business and local retailers as well as their customers as well. Having said that, we are committed to approaching it constructively. We always want to engage and do things in a way that’s beneficial for society. And we have urged Congress to take time to consider the unintended consequences, and I think we’ll remain focused on building great products for our users.",324.0,144.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.034722222222222224,0.04861111111111111,0.006944444444444444,0.041666666666666664,0.006944444444444444,-0.013888888888888888

We cover -- Performance Max, we talked about it. We talked about Insights page. In Search, I would say we see an emergence of a real, let’s call it, a better together story fueled by machine learning and automation. Advertisers are leaning more into automation using responsive search ads to create and select the best performing creatives, matching with more relevant search queries using broad match keywords, setting optimized bids with auction-time signals. We have smart bidding. So those are a few examples. We’re using more AI to help advertisers measure their results and bid intelligently with data-driven attribution, for example, which uses very advanced ML to more accurately understand how each marketing touch point actually contributed to a conversion obviously, while respecting user privacies, broad matched keywords are a big part of this. We have responsive ads on display and discovery. They use text image and video assets from advertisers and predict the best combination of assets to show in any size or format on Google properties or the display network.

You mentioned, obviously, payments. And definitely, it’s informed our payment strategy globally. In general, we are trying to think deeper about these newer markets, both -- it really lines up with our mission of building a more equitable Internet for everyone. A couple of the things we have done recently. A year ago, we announced a $10 billion Google for India Digitization Fund. And it’s a reflection of our confidence in the future of India, its digital economy, our desire to build products there, which we think will help us globally. And last year in October 2021, we announced a plan to invest $1 billion in Africa, again, with the goal of supporting entrepreneurs, helping businesses with their digital transformation and beginning to build products in Africa for African users, which I think will help us take learnings outside. I already see it.

Over the last few months, guided by our mission, we continue to develop helpful technologies with a view towards empowering both people and businesses. Even as more people return to in-person activities, we are seeing hybrid approaches to learning and working are here to stay, and our products are helping partners seize these new opportunities. To help support our own flexible work plans, this year, we plan to invest approximately $9.5 billion in our U.S. offices and data centers, creating at least 12,000 new Google jobs in the U.S. in places like New York and Atlanta. To enable our long-term growth, we are investing in areas like Cloud, AI, YouTube, Search and beyond. In 2020 and 2021 combined, we invested $40 billion in research and development here in the U.S. Beyond the U.S., we have announced new office investments in London and Warsaw and a new product development center in Nairobi. We are excited for the product development they will support. We'll share more about these investments at Google I/O, our Annual Developer Conference on May 11, and I encourage you to tune in. Turning now to product highlights. AI continues to be at the heart of our core search and information products. We launched multisearch in Google Search this quarter. It's a new way people can find what they need using both images and words. For example, you can snap a photo of a shirt pattern and then type the word green to find a green shirt with that pattern. We also shared new features in Search to help people find health care providers who take their insurance and book appointments online. With ads automation, search ads powered by AI are helping our customers quickly respond to the market conditions most relevant to their business. Philipp will discuss this in more detail. Let's move to YouTube. We continue to support our community of creators, advertisers and viewers. With over 2 billion monthly signed-in users, we are well-positioned to do this. YouTube, over the past 2 years, has seen significant growth and has become a central destination for entertainment, learning and educational content. And even as people have returned to in-person activities, time spent on YouTube has continued to grow. Just as YouTube evolve from desktop to mobile, and that created huge opportunities, we are excited about the new opportunities we see now. Short-form video is one. YouTube Shorts is now averaging over 30 billion daily views. That's 4x as much as a year ago. In the first quarter, we added new capabilities to video editing, and we are continuing to invest in making Shorts a fantastic experience for creators and viewers alike. As we've always done with products, we focus on building a great user experience first, and we will work to build monetization over time. The living room is another area of opportunity. On average, viewers are watching over 700 million hours of YouTube content on televisions every day. And in the year ahead, we will give YouTube's connected TV viewers new smartphone control navigation and interactivity features, allowing people to comment and share content they are watching on television directly from their devices. Turning next to our computing platforms. A few weeks ago, we marked a big milestone, our 100th release of Chrome and Chrome OS. Over the years, we have worked with developer and OEM partners to improve speed, simplicity and security and move the web forward. It's a great example of what we mean when we say we are building for the long-term. And on Android, we'll showcase at I/O the many helpful features and services that Android and its platforms provide. Over the coming years, we will continue to invest in new form factors, seamless multidevice experiences and raising the bar for user privacy while giving developers the tools they need to succeed on mobile. As you know, we have made changes to our Google Play pricing model to help all developers on our platform succeed. Today, 99% of developers qualify for a service fee of 15% or less. While this impacted our short-term results, we think it's the right long-term approach to support the ecosystem and to be the most developer-friendly app store and gaming platform available. We are also exploring alternative billing options. And as we do this, we'll continue to uphold high safety standards that protect personal data and sensitive financial information. Earlier today, we launched the Data safety section in Play, where people can access more information about how apps collect, share and secure their data. In hardware, Pixel 6 is a huge step forward for the Pixel portfolio, and it's been great to see the response from Pixel users. It's the fastest-selling Pixel ever, and we are building broad consumer awareness of the brand and making good progress. I'm excited about the products we have coming and look forward to sharing more at Google I/O. Next, on to Cloud, where Q1 revenue grew 44% year-over-year with continued strong performance across Google Cloud Platform and Workspace. We continue to deliver differentiated products across 4 distinct areas. First, cybersecurity, where we introduced new offerings, including Assured Workloads to address digital sovereignty in the European Union; Virtual Machine Threat Detection, a first-to-market agentless malware detection capability; an advanced intrusion detection system for network threat detection. Organizations like T-Mobile and DoorDash are protecting their critical systems and data with Google Cloud's trusted cybersecurity products. These include Security Command Center, which helps many companies, including UKG, Ultimate Kronos Group, and Ocado Group, monitor and manage their security posture and risk. Our leading threat detection and response platform, Chronicle, is now paired with Simplify to more quickly automate incident detection and resolution. We also announced our intent to acquire Mandiant, a leader in dynamic cyber defense and response, to help protect customers from the most advanced threats. Second, we continue to evolve a leading data cloud with serverless Spark to run batch Spark workloads; BigLake, a new storage engine that unifies data warehouses and lakes; and Dataplex, which provides unified management and governance of data across data warehouses and lakes. Our unified data cloud and AI platform is helping organizations like KeyBanc, LG Electronics, and Macy's work intelligently with data across multiple clouds. BigQuery, our leading solution for analytics, is helping customers like Kraft Heinz, Mercado Libre and we’re to help create more personal consumer experiences. BT Group, UPS and other leading brands continue to tap our deep expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning to power their organizations. This includes our Contact Center AI platform, which helped The Home Depot improve their call containment by 185%, creating a more positive customer support experience. We are proud to share that more than 700 technology partners power their applications with our data cloud. Third, our open secure infrastructure remains a differentiator as it enables customers to run their workloads and apps where they need them. This is winning global brands like Dun & Bradstreet, Boeing and Kyocera. Our product leadership continued with the release of Tau VMs, which powers price performance that's more than 40% better than any other leading cloud; and Google Distributed Cloud Edge, a new edge solution designed to run telecommunication networks at scale, which is helping Bell Canada evolve its 5G network. And we further expanded our regional footprint globally. Leading companies like Mahindra are choosing us for large-scale IT transformations and migrating their data centers to Google Cloud, while Sony's Crunchyroll uses our infrastructure and networking capabilities to power the largest anime streaming service in the world. Our scalability enables Ninja Van, the leading logistics provider in Southeast Asia, to handle more than 10x their normal traffic during peak times. Finally, we continue to advance Google Workspace. To support hybrid work, we recently introduced new collaboration features, including bringing Google Meet directly into Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. You can now see and hear your team as you collaborate in real time without the need to schedule meetings. Google Meet can now live stream to up to 100,000 people who can also participate in Q&A and polls. We also launched the next wave of innovation in Google Docs with smart canvas, including auto-generated summaries and pageless format in Docs, smart chips and automating workflow using Gmail. Smart canvas has seen very rapid uptake with more than 6 million checklist and 6 million smart chips being added to documents each week. These innovations are helping employees adapt to hybrid work at large enterprises like Equifax and Ocean Network Express, digital natives including Flipkart and organizations like the University of Alberta. Finally, our Other Bets. This month, Waymo became the first company to run fully autonomous ride-hailing operations in multiple locations simultaneously. Today, employees can take rider-only trips in San Francisco, joining the growing number of public Waymo One riders in Phoenix. Wing launched its on-demand drone deliveries in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. In the first quarter of 2022, Wing completed over 50,000 commercial deliveries. That's up more than 3x year-over-year. As you know, sustainability continues to be a big focus for us. In addition to our own ambitious goals to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, we recently joined Frontier, a new coalition with Stripe and many others, jointly committing more than $900 million to accelerate carbon removal solutions. Before I close, we remain deeply concerned about the war in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the region. While I was in Warsaw, Poland last month, I met with many leaders across Central and Eastern Europe to reaffirm our commitment to the region. We are finding ways for our products and platforms to be helpful, including enhanced features on Search to help refugees find resources. Across all these efforts, I feel inspired by the ways that our teams at Google work to help people in moments big and small. With that, let me thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions this quarter. Over to you, Philipp.",1687.0,908.0,38.0,9.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.04185022026431718,0.009911894273127754,0.003303964757709251,0.0,0.0022026431718061676,0.031938325991189426

I want to start by echoing Sundar. The war in Ukraine and the deepening humanitarian crisis across the region is heartbreaking. As with our response during the global pandemic, we remain focused on how we can help, whether it's air raid alerts on Android phones to help Ukranians get to safety, refugee centers live on Maps or new attributes that let hotels share if they're offering free or significantly discounted accommodations for those in need or whether it's helping via Insights, which enabled Ukraine's largest person-to-person marketplace, OLX Ukraine, to pivot its product strategy nearly overnight to help people find essential products and services. Let's take a quick look at our performance this quarter before we dive into the trends that drove it. In Google Services revenues, we were pleased with the growth in the first quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Retail was again the largest contributor to year-on-year growth of our ads business in Q1, followed by travel. Speaking of travel, people are seemingly back on the move, whether they're searching for planes, passports or their next vacation destination. Q1 travel searches were above Q1 '19 prepandemic levels. Query growth in categories like beaches and islands were up 27% versus 2019, while vacation rentals rose 37%. Compared to last year, global searches for passport online jumped 80%, while searches for travel insurance surged 2x. We continue to launch new tools to help travel partners reconnect with customers and to help users find the trusted info they need to plan their next trip. In March, free hotel booking links expanded to Search and Maps. Travel partners can extend their reach. Users get a more comprehensive set of options. And earlier this month, we made it possible for hoteliers to easily share their rates and availability directly on Google via Business Profile. Let's talk Performance Max, our newest AI-powered campaign that allows businesses to harness the best of automation to drive the most optimal performance across all Google Ads inventory. Since launching globally in November, PMax has seen strong customer adoption, particularly among smaller businesses. PMax' simplicity shows how we're moving from a model in which businesses needed to understand the complex language of campaigns, keywords, CPC and so on to a model where we understand the company's goals and actively help them achieve their business objectives. Take ASSIST CARD, a leading LatAm travel assistance company who first tested PMax to accelerate its recovery in Argentina. Initial test to drive sales yielded a 40% lower cost per acquisition at a 15x higher conversion rate versus other campaigns with the same goals. Early success led ASSIST CARD to rapidly expand PMax to 9 other countries, including Brazil, Spain and the U.S., and significantly increased spend on the new format in 2022. Moving on to retail, where we had another strong quarter. Consumers are finding a new balance between online and in-person. Google Maps searches for shopping near me were up 100% globally year-over-year. People want to buy from brands that provide a seamless experience wherever and whenever they prefer to shop. For local businesses and big box retailers alike, this remains a big opportunity. Omnichannel is still a winning strategy. We're also continuing our investments to make shopping on Google as effortless, delightful and as engaging as possible. With rich, more immersive content, including more visual and browsable results for apparel and fashion searches and new advancements like multisearch in Google Search, which launched in beta for shopping queries earlier this month, we're helping people go beyond the search box to search anywhere and any way. Take AR beauty, which is still in its early days, but a great example of the innovative and cool experiences we're building to benefit both users and brands. Shoppers can now virtually discover and try on thousands of products from 90-plus brands, including Maybelline New York, MAC and Charlotte Tilbury as well as from retailers like Ulta Beauty right in Google Search. Let's move on to YouTube. Our brand business had a strong quarter. However, we did see more modest growth in direct response. For brand, we're enthusiastic about what's ahead for connected TV. Brands are turning to us to tap into the shift to streaming and reach new audiences in smarter and more efficient ways. Over 135 million people in the U.S. were reached via YouTube on connected TVs in December. We've recently rolled out new tools to help advertisers consistently plan and measure their CTV spend across platforms. And later this year, in partnership with Nielsen, we'll help brands directly compare their YouTube reach to linear TV, including the ability to measure co-viewing. This apples-to-apples comparison will be a game changer in helping advertisers make smarter investment decisions. According to Nielsen, in the U.S., YouTube accounts for over 50% of ad-supported streaming watch time on connected TVs among people ages 18 and up. And over 35% of viewers in this group can't be reached by any other ad-supported streaming service. In other words, we're seeing that when users choose to watch ad-supported CTV, they choose to watch YouTube, and YouTube delivers CTV audiences that advertisers can reach anywhere else. Brands are taking notice, like Warner Bros., who leaned to YouTube to help drive awareness among key audiences for The Batman. By using a combination of best-performing video creative, connected TV media and video ad sequencing, Warner Bros. expanded its target audience in the 2 weeks leading up to its release, helping contribute to its successful $134 million opening weekend. For direct response, we continue to believe there's great opportunity to address commercial intent on YouTube between video action campaigns, app campaigns, product feeds and new live commerce features. As Sundar mentioned, Shorts is another area we're really excited about. Engagement is strong, and we're focused on delivering great experiences for users, creators and advertisers. In fact, we're testing ads on Shorts with products like app install and video action campaigns. And while it's still early days, we're encouraged by initial advertiser feedback and results, which brings me to our partners and how we're closely collaborating with them to grow and evolve healthier, sustainable ecosystems and bring them the best of Google. We continue to focus on accelerating growth in India's digital ecosystem and are excited about our expanding partnerships with a number of partners in the region. Then Sundar mentioned Sony's Crunchyroll. Beyond Cloud, we're working across Android, Google Play, Google TV and more to help Sony and Crunchyroll acquire and retain more users and fans and strengthen its leadership in the direct-to-consumer anime streaming market. As always, I want to extend deep appreciation to our customers and partners for their collaboration and trust and to our product, engineering, partnership, sales and many support teams. Thank you. Your relentless focus on helping our users, customers and partners makes our success possible.

My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $68 billion, up 23% or up 26% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $29.6 billion, up 23%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $17.6 billion, up 22%. The biggest factors here were costs associated with data centers and other operations, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for subscription content and then costs for YouTube's advertising-supported content. Operating expenses were $18.3 billion, up 24%. Headcount growth was the primary driver of expense across all 3 categories: research and development, sales and marketing and G&A. Growth in sales and marketing also reflects an increase in advertising and promo expense as we ramped back from the lower levels of spend last year. Operating income was $20.1 billion, up 22%. And our operating margin was 30%. Other income and expense was a loss of $1.2 billion, which was driven by unrealized losses in the value of investments in equity securities given market volatility. Net income was $16.4 billion. We again delivered substantial free cash flow with $15.3 billion in the quarter and $69 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $134 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repurchased a total of 52 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in the last 12 months. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $61.5 billion, up 20%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $39.6 billion in the quarter were up 24%, led again by retail, followed by continued recovery in travel. YouTube advertising revenues of $6.9 billion were up 14%, reflecting ongoing strong growth in brand and more modest growth in direct response. The deceleration in the year-on-year growth rate primarily reflects lapping of the exceptional performance of direct response that we called out in the first quarter of 2021. Network advertising revenues of $8.2 billion were up 20%, driven by AdSense and AdMob. Other revenues were $6.8 billion, up 5%. The growth rate reflects substantial growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues driven by subscriber growth in YouTube Music and Premium and YouTube TV, which were largely offset by a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, primarily as a result of the pricing changes that we've discussed with you previously. In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $12 billion, up 23%. Google Services operating income was $22.9 billion, up 17%. And the operating margin was 37%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $5.8 billion for the first quarter, up 44%. GCP's revenue growth was again greater than Cloud's, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $931 million. As to our Other Bets for the first quarter, revenues were $440 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. We're pleased with our strong results in the first quarter, which reflect the benefit of investments we've made over many years. We remain committed to investing to continue to build helpful technologies in support of long-term growth notwithstanding the uncertainty in the global outlook. The most visible reflection of our focus on long-term performance is our continued investment in talent and compute capacity across the company. In terms of outlook by segment for Google Services, the revenue growth rates we delivered in 2021 in our advertising businesses benefited from lapping the COVID-related weakness in 2020. Obviously, we will not have that tailwind for the rest of this year. As discussed in prior calls, the largest impact from COVID on our results was in the second quarter of 2020, which means that in the second quarter of 2022, we will face a particularly tough comp as we lap the recovery we had in the second quarter of 2021. Additionally, the second quarter results will continue to reflect that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia. Within other revenues, in the first quarter, the substantial growth in YouTube subscription revenues was offset by a decline in Play revenues versus the first quarter last year due to the fee changes we previously announced. These fee changes will continue to affect our results throughout 2022 until we lap the introduction of the changes. Turning to Google Cloud. Cloud's performance in the first quarter reflects growing deal volume and strength across multiple industries and regions. Customers are increasingly choosing Google Cloud to help them digitally transform their businesses using our global infrastructure offerings, our data analytics and AI capabilities and the collaboration benefits of Workspace. We continue to invest aggressively in Cloud given the sizable market opportunity we see. At the Alphabet level, reported revenues in the first quarter reflect that the U.S. dollar strengthened versus last year, with a 3-point headwind in Q1 compared with a 2-point tailwind in the first quarter of 2021. In the second quarter, the impact from foreign exchange rates will have an even greater impact on year-over-year comparisons given both the larger tailwind last year and the increase we expect in the headwind in Q2 versus Q1 based on current spot rates. With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added 7,400 people in the first quarter, and the majority of hires were for technical roles. The biggest increases in headcount this quarter across product areas were again in Cloud for both technical and sales roles. Turning to CapEx. The investment in the first quarter reflects the timing of closing for several large acquisitions of office facilities, which converged in the first quarter. More specifically, of the total, nearly 4 billion covers the purchases in New York, London and Poland that we had mentioned previously. We continue to expect a meaningful increase in CapEx in 2022 versus last year. For the balance of 2022, the increase will be particularly reflected in investments in technical infrastructure globally with servers as the largest component. As stated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $70 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in a manner that's in the best interest of the company and its stockholders. Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions.",1087.0,579.0,12.0,10.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,0.02072538860103627,0.017271157167530225,0.0051813471502590676,0.0017271157167530224,0.0017271157167530224,0.0034542314335060447

The first one, Ruth, wondering, could you talk to us at all about sort of the shape of the ad business growth throughout the first quarter, understanding there's some uncertainty around Ukraine, et cetera? And then what have you seen sort of quarter-to-date in the overall Search business from a growth perspective? And then the second one for Philipp. Appreciate all the color on Performance Max. Can you just talk to us a little bit about -- strategically about how long we should think about it takes to drive broader adoption of these type of tools with your sales forces at months, quarters, years? Where are you in SMB adoption? How long do you think it takes to get broader and maybe full adoption of a product like that?

So in terms of the ad business, I would say, as I did in the opening comments, we were very pleased with the year-on-year Search revenue growth in the first quarter, up 24%. And it really reflected the strength that we've seen in retail, as Philipp and I commented on. I would say -- as you're asking how are we looking forward, I would say the revenue growth rates that we delivered in 2021 in Search and across our advertising businesses more generally, as I said in the opening comments, did benefit from lapping the COVID-related weakness in 2020. So I think one key point is that we're not going to have that tailwind for the rest of this year. And as I noted, one of the key areas to focus is Q2 of 2020. That was where we had the largest impact from COVID. So that means in the second quarter of 2022, we're going to face a tough comp, as I said. I would say, in addition, the second quarter results are going to continue to reflect that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia. And then I noted the impact of foreign exchange. So as we're looking at it generally, we feel good about what we're doing in the business, a couple of key points that I called out there.",232.0,102.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00980392156862745

It really brings together the best of Google's automation to help advertisers maximize their reach and efficiency across our channels. Using the same input, we can now serve campaigns on multiple inventory formats, expanding an advertisers' reach with the same effort. And by the way, just today, we announced new features for Performance Max, including new customer acquisition goals, new campaign level insights. More details about the one-click upgrade tool for Smart Shopping and Local campaigns. So we're very, very committed to helping Performance Max deliver for our advertisers and have been very open to advertiser feedback how we can do this.

Other industry players have called out pockets of weakness in brand advertising globally in the quarter that you just reported. Did you see any of that from a volatility standpoint, especially around maybe the war in Ukraine for a period of time in March? And then sticking with all the commentary you gave on YouTube, how should we be thinking about the strategic goals of driving longer engagement and user growth and monetization for you to begin some of the initiatives you called out versus how to think about the performance of the business as we go through '22, short-form video versus long-form video or maybe mix of direct response versus brand advertising?

I think you are asking from the war and anything else that was relevant there. I would say the most important, as both Sundar and Philipp said, is what a tragic humanitarian crisis this is. And across Google, we're doing a lot to provide support. In terms of revenues, the most direct impact is the fact that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia, as we announced in early March. And to your question, about 1% of Google revenues were from Russia in 2021, and that was primarily from advertising. In addition, from the outset of the war, there was a pullback in advertiser spend, particularly on YouTube in Europe. So a couple of impacts from the war. And I guess over to Philipp with respect to YouTube and trends there.",146.0,54.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09259259259259259,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.09259259259259259

Shorts went global, rolled out to over 100 countries, and as Sundar mentioned, now has 30 billion daily views, which is 4x higher than a year ago. And if we take the creator view, we're taking a fresh look at what it means to monetize Shorts and reward creators for their short-term videos. The first step, I think, is our $100 million YouTube Shorts Fund, which is now available in over 100 countries globally. And over 40% of creators who will receive payment from the Shorts Funds in 2021 weren't in the YouTube Partner Program, just as an interesting number. And then on the advertiser view side, as I mentioned earlier, we're testing ads on Shorts with products like app install and Video action campaigns and are encouraged by the early results. And so all in all, I think we're deeply committed to supporting the next generation of mobile creators here on YouTube and are very actively working on what monetization could look like in the future.",181.0,88.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.022727272727272728,0.011363636363636364,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.011363636363636364,0.011363636363636364

Just thinking about industry conversations, it seems pretty clear that you were able to capture some dollars that shifted to search from social related to Apple's iOS privacy changes. Just curious if that dynamic continued in 1Q. And then if you can comment at all on just how you think about sustainability of those dollars going forward. And then, Ruth, in terms of spending and on the margin side, operating margins continue to be strong at 30% even with the greater headcount of the past couple of quarters. Just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on what you mean by considered investments and in what areas are you able to offset and gain more efficiencies in the business.

We haven't seen a noticeable shift in spend. And then in terms of overall margins and how we're thinking about investing, what I tried to make clear is we do continue to plan to invest aggressively this year. I made that point in opening comments with respect to both ongoing hiring at a rapid clip as well as ongoing investment in technical infrastructure. And I would say in terms of margins, we do remain focused on investing for long-term value creation. And as we noted, last year, in 2021, our margins did benefit from substantial revenue growth, while at the same time, expense growth ramped more gradually during the year. And in certain respects, as we talked about last year, margins benefited from what I described as a bit of a timing difference between revenue growth and expense growth. And there were 2 other benefits worth calling out that we talked about last year that affected operating margin. The first was the impact from the change in useful lives that we called out last year, and that benefited the year-on-year growth in expenses last year. And the second was the impact of foreign exchange, which was a tailwind last year, but as I noted, has really flipped to a headwind given the strength of the U.S. dollar. And as a reminder, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenue given our expense base is weighted towards the U.S. with most of our R&D efforts located here in the U.S. So the main thing is, the key point, we are very focused on long-term value creation. And in our view, given the opportunities we see, there are some key investments that we're continuing to make.",317.0,151.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026490066225165563,0.006622516556291391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019867549668874173

Has that been a little bit of a headwind for growth as you ramp that up, and we can try to guess on monetization later?

So in terms of YouTube, I think there are a couple of questions in your question. In terms of the deceleration in the year-on-year revenue growth rate relative to the first quarter, the largest factor was lapping an exceptionally strong quarter in direct response, as we noted last year. In addition to that direct response lapping, there were a couple of other items worth noting. First, as I've already mentioned, the war that did have an outsized impact on YouTube ads relative to the rest of Google. And that was both from suspending the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia as well as, as I noted earlier, the related reduction in spend primarily by brand advertisers in Europe. Then in addition, as we mentioned on the third quarter earnings call, we continue to experience a headwind from ATT primarily in direct response. And the dollar impact from ATT has been consistent since it was implemented in April of last year. And then there's the FX headwind I've already commented on. I would say to the other part of your question, we're experiencing a slight headwind to revenue growth as Shorts viewership grows as a percentage of total YouTube time. We are testing monetization on Shorts, and early advertiser feedback and results are encouraging. And the team is focused on closing the gap with traditional YouTube ads over time. So we're excited about the new opportunities with Shorts, but a slight headwind.",254.0,119.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04201680672268908,0.04201680672268908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Tragically, it is still ongoing; so too early to comment there. And then overall, in terms of YouTube and engagement, I noted on both YouTube's advertising business as well as the subscription businesses, the performance there, I'd say, over the past few years, we've seen significant investment in online video. There's been a ton of innovation. We think innovation is positive. Broadly, we continue to benefit from the fact that there are 2 billion logged-in viewers who visit YouTube every single month.

On YouTube, I think what we're hearing is that there's emerging concern that TikTok is a competitor to YouTube's mobile position. And I know you called out the strength of Shorts, but can you talk big picture if you're seeing any meaningful shift in consumer demand to the mobile YouTube product? And any type of advertising maybe shift on mobile because of TikTok? And then to Ruth, it's an odd quarter because if you look at APAC, the APAC region underperformed EMEA, which had Russia and Ukraine in there.

It's very similar to what Ruth said before. I mean we've seen significant investment in online video, and there's been a ton of innovation. But there are 2 billion plus logged-in viewers who visit YouTube every single month, and more people are creating content on YouTube than we've ever seen before. And the team remains very focused on trying to help creators grow, trying to innovate. And just to give you a number, 2021, the number of YouTube channels that had made at least $10,000 in revenue was up more than 40% year-over-year. And we're heavily investing in Shorts, in the connected TV and shopping. You heard the stats from Sundar on the 30 billion daily views.

In terms of geographic color, just to even broaden out your question a bit more and go through the various regions, so in the U.S., we were pleased with the 27% year-on-year growth. And I think nothing to call out there. In Europe, as you noted in your question, the slightly bigger impact from the war in Ukraine than in other regions, and then the sizable delta between fixed and floating really reflects the meaningful strengthening of the dollar versus the euro. I guess to the heart of your question with respect to APAC, the main thing there is to take you back to a year ago, we were lapping a substantial 39% growth rate in constant currency. And so this really reflects lapping that sizable growth relative to more muted ads performance in APAC this first quarter, and it really takes you just back to last quarter.

I’m proud of how our teams continue to build helpful products and experiences for people and partners. Reflecting this, our performance in Search in the second quarter was strong. We are also seeing momentum in Cloud. With an uncertain global economic outlook, our strategy to invest in deep technology and computer science to build helpful products for the long term is the right one. Our ability to take the long view stems from our timeless mission, to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. At Google I/O in May, I talked about two key ways we move that mission forward, advancing both knowledge and computing. Those goals are at the heart of what we do. We know that our services are particularly helpful to people and businesses during uncertain moments. Whether it’s using Search or YouTube to find anything from anywhere or highly efficient tools like Search Ads that help businesses of all sizes reach customers or Google Cloud, which helps companies adapt to hybrid work and find efficiencies. We’ll continue to invest in areas like AI, Search and Cloud, and we’ll do it responsibly and in a way that is responsive to the current environment. Earlier this month, I announced that we’ll be slowing our hiring and sharpening our focus as a company. We are focused on hiring engineering, technical and other critical roles. And we are working to improve productivity and ensure that the great talent we do hire is aligned with our long-term priorities. Turning now to product highlights. Years ago, we made a big bet on AI. We believe that it would be transformational for our business and for the world. We are still in the early days, yet AI already underpins many of our most helpful products and services. For example, AI is helping us create entirely new ways to search. People are using Google Lens to do visual searches more than 8 billion times per month. A new feature called multisearch helps people find what they need using words and images at the same time. Later this year, multisearch will be able to help people find local results near them. AI is also helping improve translation. With the new monolingual approach to translation, we’ve added 24 new languages to Google Translate, spoken by 300 million people. And a new immersive view in Maps uses computer vision, AI and billions of images to create high fidelity representations of places around the world. Beyond AI, we are also seeing a new frontier with augmented reality. We have been testing exciting prototypes in our labs like the device we shared at I/O that puts real-time translation and transcription in your line of sight. It’s one example of how AR can solve real needs in the real world. And last week, we announced that we will soon begin early testing of AR prototypes in real-world scenarios. Our goal is to learn how they can help people in their everyday lives. Our investments in commerce are another way we deliver helpful experiences. People are shopping across Google more than 1 billion times each day. We see hundreds of millions of shopping searches on Google Images each month. Merchants will soon be able to submit 3D images of their products to appear directly on Google Search, so customers can try before they buy. We’re also focused on bringing together hardware, software and AI in a range of helpful devices. At I/O announced great new products, including Pixel 6a, Pixel Buds Pro and Pixel Watch. We are currently taking preorders for Pixel 6a and Pixel Buds Pro. It’s been great to see the positive feedback so far. And on platforms, I’m proud that Android remains the world’s most popular operating system with more than 3 billion monthly active devices worldwide. Last year alone, consumers activated 1 billion Android phones. We are making it easier for Android users to share photos and communicate with friends and family with a modern messaging standard called Rich Communication Services or RCS. Across our platforms and beyond, we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. Safe browsing on Chrome browsers help protect billions of people every day by warning them when they try to access dangerous sites or files. Earlier this year, we rolled out a new machine learning model that identifies more than twice as many potentially malicious sites and phishing attacks as the previous model, helping to contribute to a safer and more secure web. We’ve also unified our password managers across Chrome and Android. Now stored passwords can be grouped and predicted across devices, apps and the web. Taking a closer look at YouTube. YouTube Shorts are watched by over 1.5 billion signed-in users every month with more than 30 billion daily views. In Q2, YouTube TV surpassed 5 million subscribers, including trialers. There’s also a lot of potential for shopping on YouTube. Just last week, we announced a partnership with Shopify. It will help creators easily connect their stores to YouTube and enable shopping across their live streams and videos. There’s more to come here. Moving on to Cloud, which surpassed a $6 billion quarterly revenue mark for the first time. Q2 revenue grew to $6.3 billion, with momentum across Google Cloud Platform and Workspace. We saw continued demand in all geographies with global brands like Target in North America, H&M Group in Europe, Banco BV in Latin America and [BioPharma] (ph) in Asia. We launched Google Public Sector in June, expanding our commitment to help U.S. government agencies and public institutions accelerate their digital transformations. From New York State and Arizona State University to the U.S. Forest Service and the state of Rhode Island, customers are choosing Google Cloud as their technology partner because of our leadership in four areas. First, we continue to lead in the data cloud market because we unify data lakes, data warehouses, data governance and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud. Companies like S.C. Johnson, Northwell Health and the Golden State Warriors choose Google Cloud for our strength in data analytics. Our capabilities helped Swiss Air optimize its flight operations. They’re also helping ENGIE explore ways to optimize wind energy management and Ford, to create smarter factory floors. Second, companies like BetaBank and Mayo Clinic choose their open cloud infrastructure to modernize their IT systems on our cloud, at the edge or in their data centers. Our infrastructure scales to help customers like Deutsche Telekom modernize its network, Wipro to modernize its core systems, and Garvan Institute of Medical Research to process 14,000 genomes in under two weeks. Our multi-cloud strategy remains a differentiator for customers like Elevance Health, formerly known as Anthem and AMD. Third, cybersecurity. Google has always provided a secure cloud infrastructure, and we continue to introduce new cybersecurity products that help customers deduct, protect and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats. Customers like GitLab, Highmark Health and Iron Mountain protect their critical systems and data with our products. Carryable Coffee and Etsy are among the 5 million websites protected by our cybersecurity technology. Finally, Google Workspace’s easy to use and secure communication and collaboration tools continue to be chosen by many organizations as they return to hybrid work. Google Workspace helped St. Luke’s Medical Center, a leading health care system in the Philippines address a 38% increase in telehealth visits during the pandemic. Results like this are driving growth in many customer segments around the world, including digital natives like Canva, large enterprises like Travis Perkins plc and public sector institutions, including the Central Dutch Government. Finally, our other bets. Waymo expanded rider-only testing with employees to include Downtown Phoenix and started testing at Phoenix’s Sky Harbor Airport. It also began charging trusted tested riders in San Francisco, a step closer to launching a commercial service with fully autonomous trips. Waymo also opened a new facility to support Waymo Via, their autonomous Class 8 trucking solution as they continue to increase their operations and investment across the Southwest region. Calico is testing an investigational drug treatment in patients with ALS, developed in collaboration with AbbVie. It’s an early step of many in the development process. Wing recently surpassed 250,000 commercial deliveries and unveiled a series of delivery drone prototypes able to carry different sized packages. There is good progress here and will continue to be intentional across the portfolio. To close, while the economic outlook is uncertain, it’s been great to see people gathering in person again. We are pleased to see people coming back into the office more often, resulting in more opportunities for collaboration. It’s a privilege to build technology that’s helpful in both, good times and uncertain ones. And I want to thank everyone at Alphabet and Google for their work and support of people, businesses and all of our partners, everywhere.

You’ve seen our own commitment to the long term in our latest innovation announcements at I/O, Google Marketing Life and Brandcast. Sundar covered a number of these. I’ll dive deeper into a few more, including how we’re improving our advertiser experiences and building simpler, more useful products for our partners. Within Google Services, Search delivered strong revenue growth for the second quarter, driven by performance in both, travel and retail. In travel, users appetite continued to remain strong heading into the summer season. Searches for places to visit in summer were up 2x globally year-over-year, while searches for last-minute hotel deals were up 50%. However, as we’ve all seen in the news recently, the travel sector has been experiencing some challenges. As always, we’re committed to helping our travel partners navigate this with insights and new tools. Then there’s retail, where we had another solid quarter. At GML, we highlighted how we’re continuing to innovate to help merchants make the most of how quickly consumer shopping is evolving, like Best Buy who’s embracing a full omnichannel approach from measurement to bidding to using omni ad formats across Google. By adopting omni across its local inventory ads portfolio and showcasing curbside and in-store pickup, Best Buy increased in-store revenue from Google Ads by 34% last year. Today’s customers expect to shop wherever, whenever, and they care as much about local as they do about finding inspiration for the next purchase online. In Q2, searches for open now and near me were up 8x globally year-over-year, while searches for designer outlet jumped 90%. We also saw strong interest in apparel categories like women’s clothing and in beauty categories like perfume and fragrances. With AI-powered tools like Performance Max, which local and smart shopping campaigns will upgrade to in time for the holidays, we’re helping businesses move at speed and scale to reach new and existing customers wherever they are in their shopping journey with relevant useful content. We’ve seen strong momentum with PMax. Advertiser adoption is up 5 times year-to-date. Sustainable Apparel brand, Rothy’s drove a 59% increase in conversions and a 60% increase in revenue after turning to PMax. By leveraging its creative assets and showing them at scale, Rothy’s reached more customers in a way it hadn’t been able to do before. Innovating across Search and YouTube also remain top priorities. Sundar mentioned new 3D AR features. Target and Wayfair are testing these to help customers see and shop products in real life. We launched new ad formats for more visual browsy search experiences. And then there’s cool live commerce capabilities like live direct which let creators start a shopping live stream on their channel and then redirect viewers to a brand’s channel for more. Let’s dive deeper into YouTube. In the second quarter, the biggest factor in the year-over-year comparison was the lapping of a very strong second quarter in 2021 when we experienced a strong recovery from the impact of COVID in early 2020. Ruth will provide more details on this later on. As we continue to help advertisers manage through uncertainty, I would point out three key highlights for YouTube. First, Brandcast joined the Upfronts in New York in May for the first time ever, a reflection of how digital and linear TV worlds are converging for both viewers and advertisers. As the number one streaming video platform to reach viewers across all devices with billions of hours of video watched every day, YouTube remains well-positioned to deliver the reach, results and relevance that advertisers need. In fact, even in TV’s biggest moments, YouTube is still delivering huge incremental reach. According to Comscore, 49.9% of adults that saw a Super Bowl ad on YouTube on the day of the Super Bowl did not see the ad on TV. And as more advertisers tap into connected TV, they’re also driving results. According to Google commissioned Nielsen meta-analysis of MMMs that measured YouTube CTV and TV across U.S. consumer packaged goods, on average, YouTube CTV effectiveness was 3.1 times greater than TV. Take GSK Consumer Healthcare, now Haleon, who piloted CTV campaigns across its top 10 global markets to drive effectiveness at scale and tap into the shift to streaming. The results, 73% of campaigns drove substantial lift in brand and unbranded searches, and viewers were up to 14 times more likely to search for Haleon related terms. Adding CTV to its existing plans also led to greater efficiencies and savings. Haleon has since opted its 2022-2023 investment and is now expanding CTV across LATAM and EMEA markets. Second, as Sundar said, our momentum in Shorts continues. Last quarter, we shared that we’re in the early stages of testing monetization with ads, and we continue to be encouraged by the results so far. Third, there’s full funnel, which we’ve covered before, and more advertisers are embracing. On average, YouTube advertisers using a full funnel strategy experienced 80% unique reach across brand and action campaigns. With this incremental reach across upper and lower funnel formats, advertisers meet different audiences based on where they are in the purchase journey. Estee Lauder Taiwan’s recent campaign for its advanced night repair serum is a great example. Branded content collaboration with top creators raised awareness, while YouTube shopping shelf feature boosted consideration, and to generate new leads and sales, a series of well-orchestrated action formats did the trick. This full funnel strategy drove 29% more unique visits to its website and a 95% increase in sales. With our performance products, advertisers can convert demand with our massive reach products, they create net new demand at scale. Lastly, an update on how we’re bringing the best across Google to our partners and key ecosystems. First, in gaming, to help Bandai Namco Entertainment drive immersive gaming experiences and build a more robust IP strategy, we’re partnering across Cloud, Geo, Ads, YouTube and more. And then there’s news. Google News showcase now has 1,500-plus partnerships with publications across 17 countries, including recent agreements with publications in the UK, Romania and Slovakia. I’ll close, as I always do, with gratitude for customers and partners and for Googlers across sales, partnerships, product engineering and our many, many support teams. Thank you for your tireless commitment to making a positive impact around the world.

My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.7 billion, up 13% or up 16% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $30.1 billion, up 15%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $17.9 billion, up 17%. The biggest factor here was costs associated with data centers and other operations. Operating expenses were $20.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting the following: first, the increase in R&D expenses, which was driven primarily by headcount growth; second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses, which was driven primarily by increased spending on ads and promo followed by headcount growth; and finally, the growth in G&A, which reflects increases in both, professional service fees and in headcount, partially offset by a decline in charges related to legal matters. Operating income was $19.5 billion, flat versus last year, and our operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was a loss of $439 million. Net income was $16 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $12.6 billion in the quarter and $65 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $125 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $62.8 billion, up 10%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $40.7 billion in the quarter were up 14%, driven by both, travel and retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.3 billion were up 5%. The modest year-on-year growth rate primarily reflects lapping the uniquely strong performance in the second quarter of 2021. Network advertising revenues of $8.3 billion were up 9%, driven by AdSense. The quarter-on-quarter deceleration in both YouTube and network advertising revenues primarily reflects pullbacks in spend by some advertisers. Other revenues were $6.6 billion, down 1%, reflecting a year-on-year decline in play, primarily driven by the fee changes we have discussed previously. We also saw a slowdown in buyer spend due to a number of factors, including lower engagement levels compared with earlier stages of the pandemic. In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $12.2 billion, up 12%. Google Services operating income was $22.8 billion, up 2%, and the operating margin was 36%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $6.3 billion for the second quarter, up 36%. GCP’s revenue growth was again greater than Cloud’s, reflecting significant growth in both, infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both, seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $858 million. As to our other bets for the second quarter, revenues were $193 million and the operating loss was $1.7 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. In terms of the Google Services segment, we are pleased with our performance in Search in the second quarter, which continued to deliver strong results. As a reminder, the 2022 revenue growth rates are presented against particularly tough comps as we lapped the recovery in the second quarter of 2021 from the impact of the pandemic in early 2020. Going forward, the very strong revenue performance last year continues to create tough comps that will weigh on year-on-year growth rates of advertising revenues for the remainder of the year. In YouTube and Network, the pullbacks in spend by some advertisers in the second quarter reflects uncertainty about a number of factors that are challenging to disaggregate. Within other revenues in the third quarter, we expect an ongoing headwind from the fee changes and the slowdown in buyers spend that impacted results in the second quarter. Turning to Google Cloud. Customers are transforming their businesses, utilizing GCP’s secure infrastructure with data analytics and AI capabilities, uncovering real-time insights and leveraging the collaborative tools of workspace. They are in the early days of this transformation, and we continue to invest in our products, go-to-market capabilities and cloud regions. In terms of foreign exchange, our second quarter results reflect the U.S. dollar strengthened versus last year from a significant tailwind last year to a 3.7 percentage-point headwind in 2Q. Looking to the third quarter, based on strengthening of the U.S. dollar quarter-to-date, we expect an even larger headwind from foreign exchange. As a reminder, all segment revenues are reported on a GAAP basis. We provide fixed FX revenues only at the consolidated level and by geographic region. In addition, as we’ve said previously, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenues, given that our expense base is weighted more toward the U.S. with most of our R&D efforts located here. With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added 10,108 people in the second quarter with the majority of hires for technical roles. Given the uncertain global economic outlook and the hiring progress achieved to date, as Sundar previously announced, we intend to slow the pace of hiring. We expect our actions on hiring to become more apparent in 2023. Our headcount additions in the third quarter will reflect we already have a strong number of commitments, including new graduate hires. As a reminder, we also expect the acquisition of Mandiant to close by the end of the year, which will further increase headcount on top of hiring. Although we expect the pace of headcount growth to moderate next year, we will continue hiring for critical roles, particularly focused on top engineering and technical talent. Turning to CapEx. The largest investments in the second quarter were in servers followed by data centers and office facilities. After several large transactions closed in the first quarter, investment in office facilities was once again focused on fit-outs and ground-up construction on existing projects. We continue to expect an increase in CapEx in 2022 versus last year. For the balance of 2022, the increase will be particularly reflected in investments in technical infrastructure globally with servers as the largest component. Thank you. Sundar Philip and I will now take your questions.",1029.0,559.0,12.0,12.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,0.02146690518783542,0.02146690518783542,0.005366726296958855,0.0017889087656529517,0.0017889087656529517,0.0

First, Sundar, just in your letter, you talked about how the economic challenges will serve as an opportunity for Alphabet to deepen its focus and invest for the long term. Just wanted to get a sense of how that might change the investment profile and areas of priority for the Company. And then, Ruth, I was hoping you could provide some color perhaps on how growth trended more through the second quarter, and if you have any comments on what you’re seeing so far in 3Q in July.

Personally, I find moments like these clarifying. It’s a chance to digest and make sure we are working on the right things as a company with taking a long-term view, making sure we are continuing to invest in deep technology and computer science and doing differentiated work, and gives a chance to assess everything we are doing with the critical lens and reallocate resources to our most critical priorities. So, it’s a constrained optimization problem. I think it gives us a chance given the strong -- given a few years of strong growth to double down and focus, and we’re going to be very disciplined in terms of how we will approach it.

Just a bit of context, Sundar and I, I think, Philipp, as well used the term uncertainty because we do think that’s the best way to characterize what we’re seeing. The data are complicated. Our results have reflected lapping, continue to reflect lapping of the significant growth rates last year. On top of that, there is uncertainty in the global economic environment. And then, there are issues that differ across industry. You’ve seen it in the news for some it’s supply chain, for some of it’s inventory issues.

I think, your tone around investment for the year changed somewhat over the course of the last few weeks. You’ve kind of gone through July and heard about slowing of hiring and now a reported hiring pause. You mentioned just recently, you’re finding moments like these to sort of optimize spend. Could you just talk to what are you seeing in your business specifically on the advertising side or the cloud side that is sort of saying now is when we really do need to make sure we’re optimizing? Are you seeing pullbacks, or is it more sort of just you’re seeing the macroeconomic headlines and wanted to get ahead of it?",132.0,61.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.03278688524590164,0.03278688524590164,0.0,0.0,-0.03278688524590164

All of us are reacting to quite a varying set of dynamics, and it’s tough to summarize it because the factors -- underlying factors are different and they vary by maybe geography and verticals. But, there is some commonality to it in terms of the macro environment. So, there’s definitely something we are looking at and want to be more disciplined as we go forward. So, that’s the higher-level theme. I think in terms of underlying areas, pretty much I’m focusing my time on what are the right set of things to do with a longer term view. And I do think as a company, when you’re in growth mode, it’s tough to always take the time to do all the readjustments you need to do, and moments like this gives us a chance.

You’ve called out the tougher comps over the last couple of quarters. Can you give us a better sense of how you move away from some of those tougher comps in the periods ahead of us over the next 12 to 18 months, and how maybe we should think about the digestion of the direct response growth and consumption growth that YouTube saw a year ago and how that might lead to better growth ahead for YouTube in the periods going forward?

There was a lot in your question, so I’ll start and then I’ll pass it to Philipp. An obvious point as we’re pointing out, the lapping of what truly were extraordinary growth rates as time will get us through the lapping. So, that’s obvious math, but you asked the question. So, starting with that. And then, I did note that we have seen pullbacks in spend by some advertisers that, in fact, was the biggest factor in the quarter-on-quarter change, the sequential decline in the growth rate. And we’re -- that we do view that as rather idiosyncratic as I said, some of it’s supply chain, some of it’s inventory. And so, just working through that. And then I would say, there were a couple of other factors that were relevant. The war was a modest headwind to year-on-year and sequential growth. AT&T impact, in fact, remained relatively constant, we’ve said that for the last couple of quarters. So that does remain headwind. So, we’re working through those. But again, it goes really to continuing to invest in YouTube and the experiences and the opportunity to deliver for our entire ecosystem users, creators.

It’s worth calling out that this was first year participating in the Upfronts, which is really exciting and really a testament to YouTube’s evolution, and we were very pleased with our strong growth and upfront commitments. Customers tell us they see value in YouTube’s reach and the ability to drive results. I talked about CTV earlier and as well on our last call, and we are very excited about the road map here. We’re also continuing to give advertisers unique and creative storytelling opportunities and the ability to lean into very precise KPIs and we recently rolled out some very critical measurement tools. On the direct response side, we still think there’s a lot of runway to address commercial intent on YouTube between video action campaigns and app campaigns and product feeds and new live commerce features, where we’re testing a number of different things across live commerce. So, we’re excited about the opportunities here, especially to connect brands with creators. We’re also seeing advertisers by YouTube at both ends of the funnel, which I talked about earlier, giving advertisers the ability to drive reach and relevance and action is really where YouTube excels. So, the big picture long term remained very encouraged by the opportunity for innovation at brand and DR and across YouTube. And I can also briefly touch on the Shorts piece. Consumers are increasing at consuming short-form videos, obviously. We’re seeing this across multiple platforms, including YouTube. Sundar noted earlier that Shorts are being watched by 1.5 billion plus locked in users every month. So, overall, we’re continuing to see good user engagement on YouTube And last quarter, we shared that over the past two years, YouTube has seen significant growth in watch time and even as people have returned to in-person activities, time spent on YouTube globally has continued to grow.

So, what is the mathematical form or way that you’re looking for that you’re driving towards? And then, to Philipp, I think people are wondering just -- and this is a big question, but the composition of the ad base -- and I think people are worried that some other companies may have really benefited from a lot of growth in younger, newer companies that were not profitable. So, can you just talk a bit about what you’re seeing in terms of mix of your composition?

And so, as he said a couple of times now, this notion of wanting to look at what are meaningful investments to deliver continued extraordinary experiences for services and users that then supports longer-term growth, it requires investments, and we just want to make sure that we’re getting that balance right and that we’re using resources effectively where we can to redeploy it and put it back into long-term investments.

It’s a broad question you’re asking, if you’re leaning a little bit more towards the total addressable market here. Let me reiterate what I said before. We’re not just addressing above-the-line marketing budgets, like traditional advertising or television advertising. There’s a lot of upside that we’ve seen below the line, budgets, whether it’s promotional pricing, product placements, sponsorships and so on, and the comps -- we see cuts across the universe of different players, sectors, verticals that I just described. But in the end, our mingle is on delivering great experiences for our users and driving incremental ROI for advertisers and then making them successful across all this big universe of sectors I just talked about.

You talked about, of course, AI and cloud as being key areas of long-term focus. Are there any areas worth calling out that may be a lower priority now, given that focus?

So, for example, we are obviously investing deeply in AI. We do everything from pure research to applied research to research, which is now things AI work, which is actually happening very close or within the areas like Search and YouTube, et cetera. And so, you can imagine a scenario in which we are prioritizing and on the margin moving resources to making sure we are driving product improvements, which flow through a moment like that. That would be an example of sharpening focus for me. And when I think about the opportunities out of AI, just coming out of I/O this year, looking at the progress we have made, how much we have made progress with multisearch, how multimodal things are getting and the fact that people are now actually doing voice searches a lot, visual searches a lot, all that is a good example of how we are driving value in our core products. Similarly, if you take at ads at Google Marketing Live, the team talked a lot about AI-driven products and features that really give value to advertisers in the most privacy-forward way. And cloud is, I would say, lot of the AI opportunity today plays out as more from a data analytics standpoint. It’s within that segment, we see the most strength. But over time, I think there’ll be broader opportunities as well. And on top of it all, we are continuing to see a lot of breakthrough work coming from our research teams, be it LaMDA 2, PaLM, Minerva or some of our recent advances. So, we’ll stay cutting-edge drive progress and keep focusing on turning that research into real products and applications, and we’ll take a long-term view.",310.0,139.0,12.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08633093525179857,0.007194244604316547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07913669064748201

So, some of the biggest retailers in the world, like Walmart, are really struggling and are looking to cut costs and sounded to me from what Ruth just said about supply chain inventory inflation that they might be cutting on YouTube. So, I’m just curious, can you flesh out what you guys are doing in search from a product perspective to keep that retail category as strong as it is? You mentioned PMax for some of the smaller advertisers, an omnichannel for the larger, but maybe just elaborate on how that -- what strategy you guys are using to keep that spend flowing, or is that just a timing thing and it might drop off at some point in the future?

As I noted in my opening remarks, retail continued to be an important driver of Search in the second quarter. We saw strong Search interest in several categories. I called out apparel categories, like women’s clothing earlier. I think it’s also worth clarifying when we talk about retail growth, we’re talking about our overall approach to retail, which runs through all of our ads products and services, and our shopping strategy is just one important piece of that. From a trend perspective, you’re absolutely right, omnichannel remains the way to win, retailers continue to build their digital presence to drive both online and offline sales, and we’re obviously helping them do it. Over the last few quarters, I think I’ve talked quite a bit about the ways how we’re doing this in Q2. Like in Q1, we saw a year-over-year increase in adoption of, for example, local inventory ads. These are mobile first and location-based and helping businesses of all sizes showcase their products and stock, in-store, online or available for store, curbside pickup, all different variations. Additionally, we’re midway through the migration from smart shopping campaigns into Performance Max, which you also mentioned, and advertisers have been pleased with increased reach and the increased performance. And our focus really has always been on building tools and features that help both, offline and online businesses connect directly with these customers across our platforms.

Our financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. Our reported results reflect the effect of foreign exchange. The growth in our advertising revenues was also impacted by lapping last year’s elevated growth levels and the challenging macro climate. We are sharpening our focus on a clear set of product and business priorities. The product announcements we have made in just the past month alone have shown that very clearly, including significant improvements to Search powered by AI, new ways to monetize YouTube Shorts, which will support the creator ecosystem, the strong series of hardware launches and a new partnership and product announcements at Cloud Next. These will all drive value for users, partners and our business. We have also started our work to drive efficiency by realigning resources to invest in our biggest growth opportunities. Over the past quarter, we have made several shifts away from lower priority efforts to fuel higher growth priorities. Our Q4 headcount additions will be significantly lower than Q3. And as we plan for 2023, we’ll continue to make important trade-offs where needed and are focused on moderating operating expense growth. Throughout Google’s history, periods of dedicated focus have enabled us to emerge strongly and unleash new eras of computing innovation. For example, over a decade ago, focusing the Company’s efforts on mobile helped us to build and grow our business for the shift to mobile computing. We are at a similar point now with AI, another transformational technology. Our investments in AI and deep computer science mean that we can deliver a wide range of breakthroughs across our products and services to help people, businesses and communities. Turning to the quarter. First, our core information products. At our Search On event, we shared how we are using AI advances to deliver a more natural and intuitive search experience. These advancements will soon help to surface things you might find helpful before you even finish typing. We are also making visual search more natural than ever before. People now use Google Lens to answer more than 8 billion questions every month using just a photo or an image. Now, we are supercharging our visual search capabilities to help people find what they are looking for at businesses nearby. Philipp will also talk in more detail about our work to make it easier to shop on Google, a key focus. Google Lens also has an amazing translation feature. It can now blend translated text seamlessly into the background of images, like menus or street signs in just 100 milliseconds, shorter than a blink of an eye. Through advanced language models, AI is unlocking new experiences that support more natural and conversational ways to interact with computing. LaMDA is one of our most promising models for this. It’s now available to demo in our AI Test Kitchen, which offers a way for people to experience and give feedback on emerging AI technology. DeepMind also debuted its most helpful and safest language model yet. Sparrow can talk to users, answer questions and provide evidence-based answers using Google Search. Moving to YouTube, another big priority. We remain focused on long-term growth for our community of viewers, creators and advertisers. To that end, we announced some exciting changes at our Made on YouTube event last month. First, improving the monetization of Shorts. This is a big deal for creators and for our business. We’ll introduce revenue sharing on Shorts early next year. This update makes YouTube the only platform where creators can monetize their content across short, long and live formats at scale. Shorts continues to show great user momentum, and we continue to invest in our mobile video tools for creators. We are seeing mobile-first creators investing more in the platform, creating content that helps the broader community grow. TV is a big area for us as well. Nielsen reported that YouTube was the leader in streaming TV viewership in the U.S. in September for the first time. Turning next to hardware. Hardware is an important area of investment for us. We are investing deeply from the silicon to the OS to powerful software experiences because it’s a big opportunity to move computing forward and build deeper relationships with people who love using Google products. It also really helps to guide the Android ecosystem beyond just building the underlying platform. Earlier this month, we introduced the Pixel 7, the Pixel 7 Pro and the very first Pixel Watch. We’ve also previewed more detail about the Pixel Tablet, which is coming in 2023. Pixel combines our foundational technologies, AI, Android and our Google Tensor G2 processor to bring state-of-the-art AI directly to the device. The Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro offer industry-leading photography features that can unblur or sharpen photos and shoot cinema-quality videos. We recently had our highest selling week ever for Pixel, and I’m really proud of the positive reviews so far. Along with great devices, we introduced our latest release of Android. Android 13 offers new personalization features, improved privacy controls and a more seamless experience with connected devices. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued momentum with Q3 revenue of $6.9 billion with Google Cloud Platform’s revenue growth rate above the aggregate. I’ve long shared that cloud is a key priority for the Company. The long-term trends that are driving cloud adoption continue to play an even stronger role during uncertain macroeconomic times. Google Cloud helps customers solve today’s business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs and unlock new growth engines. At Cloud Next, we unveiled more than 100 new products and announced new and expanding relationships with Toyota, Prudential plc, Coinbase and AppLovin. The shift to hybrid work continues with organizations evolving to support an increasingly distributed workforce. I’m proud to share that Google Workspace is now used by more than 8 million businesses and organizations worldwide. That includes Korean Air as well as the U.S. Army, which is transitioning 250,000 personnel to our secure communication and collaboration platform. In the past year, we have announced nearly 300 new capabilities to support hybrid work. Empowering a distributed workforce brings an increased need for cybersecurity to keep workers’ data and critical business systems safe and secure. It’s top of mind for nearly every CEO I speak with, and customers, including the City of Los Angeles, Roche and Banorte put their trust in Google Cloud’s industry-leading products. Our new Chronicle Security Operations Suite unifies security analytics, automation response and threat intelligence. This has helped Vertiv analyze 22 times more security data while cutting investigation time in half. In September, we closed our acquisition of Mandiant and are proud to welcome more than 2,600 colleagues to Google. With Mandiant, we add industry-leading threat intelligence and incident response capabilities to help customers stay protected at every stage of the security life cycle. Customers partner with Google Cloud because we offer a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud. Our leadership here is winning customers across industries, including the state of Hawaii and the Australia Securities Exchange. Our capabilities help solve difficult business challenges like supply chain and logistics while also creating new growth opportunities. And as companies globally are looking to drive efficiencies, Google Cloud’s open infrastructure creates a valuable pathway to reduce IT costs and modernize. In addition, with our new Media CDN product for large media streaming workloads, we are helping Major League Baseball and Paramount+ deliver flawless experiences to their customers. And with Google Cloud Edge, Rite Aid is more efficiently helping patients in their pharmacies. Across all of these areas, I’m proud of the trust and enthusiasm our customers are placing in Google Cloud. Briefly on our Other Bets, Waymo announced that Los Angeles will be its third ride-hailing city, joining Phoenix and San Francisco. Waymo will begin by mapping several neighborhoods in LA as it prepares to serve people there. Wing just surpassed 300,000 commercial deliveries. It’s servicing new areas in Australia and announced its first drone delivery trials in Ireland. To close, times like this are clarifying. As we head into 2023, we are going to focus on our most important priorities as a company. To support our growth, we’ll continue to invest responsibly for the long term in a way that is responsive to the current economic environment. I want to thank our employees around the world for their contributions over the last quarter. We help people, our partners and society when we focus on what we do best and execute on that really well.

Google Services revenues of $61 billion were up 2% year-on-year, negatively affected by a sizable foreign exchange headwind. Search and other revenues grew 4% year-over-year to $40 billion, led by travel and retail, while both YouTube Ads and Network had modest year-over-year revenue declines. Other revenues were up 2% year-over-year with growth in YouTube non-advertising and hardware revenues offset by a decrease in Play revenues. Play revenues were lower due to a number of factors, including a decline in user engagement in gaming from the elevated levels seen earlier in the pandemic. Among other factors, this shift in user behavior also created downward pressure on our advertising revenues, with lower revenues from ad promo spend on YouTube, Network and Play Ads in Search and other. I’ll highlight a couple of other trends that affected our ads business in Q3, and Ruth will provide more detail. On the second quarter earnings call, we noted a pullback in spend by some advertisers in YouTube and Network, and these pullbacks in spend increased in the third quarter. In Search and other, the largest factor in the deceleration in Q3 was lapping the outsized performance in 2021. In the third quarter, we did see a pullback in spend by some advertisers in certain areas and search ads. For example, in financial services, we saw a pullback in the insurance, loan, mortgage and crypto subcategories. There’s no question we’re operating in an uncertain environment, and that businesses big and small continue to get tested in new and different ways, depending on where they are in the world. When it comes to how we’re helping, our focus remains unchanged. The same AI driving breakthroughs in everything from protein folding, flood forecasting and language understanding is also fueling innovation across our Ads product. Via insights, automation and easier-to-use advertising tools and formats, we’re helping businesses stay agile, build resilience, anticipate the future and show up for customers in more connected, visual and consistent ways. We’re helping them understand demand, deal with inventory challenges, increase loyalty and much more. In challenging times like these, advertisers are carefully evaluating the effectiveness of their budgets. Search tends to do relatively well in such an environment, given its strong measurability and focus on delivering ROI. It’s also well suited to quickly adjust to changes in consumer behavior. And when Search is coupled with our automation products across bidding, creatives, targeting or Performance Max, it can drive performance even further. Let’s talk retail, an important vertical for us. No matter where shoppers are buying, whether it’s in store, online or both, we have the solutions to help them deliver results wherever their customers are. Take online fashion retailer REVOLVE, who uses global influencer network along with our category insights and automated tools to acquire new customers at lower costs. As festivals and events return to summer, REVOLVE used lower funnel solutions across search and shopping to engage with consumers in high-demand apparel categories, helping it cross $1 billion in trailing 12-month net sales for the first time. And then, there’s Magazine Luiza, a large Brazilian retailer, who embraced omnichannel by measuring and bidding directly to store sales. Coupled with in-store pickup and notations via PMAX, Magazine Luiza drove a 38% ROAS over 30 days and has since expanded the strategy to all eligible products, including 8 million-plus new offers. And whether shoppers know exactly what they’re looking for or are just seeking inspiration, we’re innovating to make it easier and more engaging for people to shop online across our services. From finding the best deals across all types of merchants, including 200 million-plus available daily deals in Q3 to new ways to search. Now when you type shop followed by whatever item you’re looking for, you’ll unlock a visual content stream of ideas that feel just like window shopping but online. And then there’s YouTube. Not only can users now buy more products and videos, but shopping as entertainment experiences are bringing the magic of our creators to the shopping experience. Like in September, when Kylie and Kris Jenner hosted an exclusive shopping stream event to celebrate the debut of a new Kris collection for Kylie Cosmetics. And at Adweek last week, not only did we announce that product feeds are coming to discovery, but that creators will soon be able to take products from brands across their videos, Shorts and live streams. This means viewers can shop products seamlessly while they watch their favorite content, while merchants can drive incremental reach and engagement for free listing offers when tagged by creators that viewers love and trust. I already touched on YouTube’s performance in the quarter. Let’s deep dive into what we’re focused on. First, we’re helping advertisers understand how they can drive effectiveness with every campaign they run on YouTube. Full funnel is a key way to do this. Buying YouTube across consideration, awareness and action allows marketers to meet customers at different stages in their purchasing journey, which we know are increasingly complex while delivering towards a key business goal. Creative and Media work together across the funnel to create new demand and convert current demand. Castlery, a single furniture retailer activated a full funnel approach as part of its U. S. expansion. It used brand and action formats, identified its most relevant audiences and built a robust measurement framework to boost sales and awareness, including a 65% increase in U.S. brand searches. Castlery is using the same strategy for the upcoming holiday season. Two other areas where we’re continuing to invest, Connected TV and Shorts. First on CTV. Eyeballs keep moving away from traditional TV. On average, global viewers are watching 700 million-plus hours of YouTube content on TV daily. And according to Nielsen, during the 2021-2022 U.S. broadcast seasons, YouTube reached more viewers during primetime on CTV than any linear TV network. Brands continue to take notice. Like Instacart, who tapped into CTV to maximize its TV screen strategy for its The World is Your Cart brand campaign featuring Lizzo. It drove breakout searches for its product and above-average brand lift across awareness, consideration and purchase intent. And it also engaged a significant increase in audience on top of TV with 66% lower CPMs. And then there’s Shorts. 1.5 billion users every month, 30 billion daily views. Engagement is strong. We’ve always said that we focus on building great user and creator experiences first and then follow that with monetization over time. As of September, ads on Shorts have officially launched via video action, app and Performance Max campaigns. As Sundar mentioned, we also extended the YouTube Partner Program and announced our revenue sharing model for Shorts creators, the first of its kind for short-form content. It’s early but we’re encouraged by the progress we’ve made this year in Shorts monetization and support for sustaining the creator ecosystem. I’ll close with something I’ve said before and I think it’s worth reiterating. Our success is only possible when our customers and partners succeed. Whether it’s helping individual YouTube creators or Play developers make a living and build thriving businesses or bringing the best across Google to our partners, our focus on driving growth for our partners and key ecosystems remain steadfast. I’m proud that over the past three years, we’ve paid creators, artists and media companies over $50 billion. In terms of how we’re helping our partners innovate, I’ll share two highlights. First, a transformative partnership with Transsion, the number one OEM in Africa and Pakistan, will help it close the digital divide by doubling annual activations by 2025 and build helpful products for the next billion users. And then in commerce with FEMSA Digital in Mexico, we’re bringing together solutions across Ads, Cloud, Maps, Waze and beyond to bolster its data and analytics capabilities so it can better reach and retain its beverage and retail customers. On behalf of many, a massive thank you to our customers and partners for their collaboration, trust and feedback. And another massive thank you to our sales, partnerships, product, engineering and support teams. The hard work, dedication and ingenuity of Googlers, especially during more challenging times, is truly second to none. On that note, over to you, Ruth.",1415.0,775.0,23.0,8.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,3.0,0.02967741935483871,0.01032258064516129,0.005161290322580645,0.0012903225806451613,0.0012903225806451613,0.01935483870967742

Our reported results clearly reflect the effect of foreign exchange. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.1 billion, up 6% or up 11% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $31.2 billion, up 13%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $19.3 billion, up 20%. The biggest factor here was costs associated with data centers and other operations, followed by hardware costs. Operating expenses were $20.8 billion, up 26%, reflecting the following: first, the increases in R&D and G&A expenses, which were driven primarily by headcount growth; and second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses, which was driven primarily by increased spending on ads and promotions, followed by headcount growth. Operating income was $17.1 billion, down 19% versus last year and our operating margin was 25%. Other income and expense was a loss of $902 million. Net income was $13.9 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $16.1 billion in the quarter and $63 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $116 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results. As a reminder, we provide fixed foreign exchange revenues only at the consolidated level and by geographic region. All segment revenues are reported on a GAAP basis. Starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $61.4 billion, up 2%. Across our advertising revenues, the year-over-year deceleration in growth rates versus the third quarter of last year was largely driven by lapping very strong performance, most notably in Search and other revenues. Additionally, the year-on-year deceleration on YouTube and Network reflects a pullback in spend by some advertisers as we first noted last quarter. In terms of the revenue lines, Google Search and other advertising revenues of $39.5 billion in the quarter were up 4%. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.1 billion were down 2%. Network advertising revenues of $7.9 billion were down 2%. Other revenues were $6.9 billion, up 2%, reflecting several factors: first, subscriber growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV continued to drive ongoing strong growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues; second, we delivered solid growth in hardware revenues, primarily from sales of the Pixel 6a; finally, the growth in these two areas was offset by a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, reflecting a slowdown in buyer spend due to a number of factors, including lower engagement levels in gaming compared with earlier stages of the pandemic. In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $11.8 billion, up 3%. Google Services operating income was $19.8 billion, down 17% and the operating margin was 32%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $6.9 billion for the second quarter, up 38%. GCP’s revenue growth was again greater than Cloud’s, reflecting significant growth in both, infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $699 million. As to our Other Bets for the third quarter, revenues were $209 million and the operating loss was $1.6 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. Our results in the third quarter reflect an increased headwind from foreign exchange, given the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus last year. Excluding the revenue benefit from hedging, there was a 6-point headwind year-on-year or 5 points with the hedge benefit compared with a slight tailwind in the third quarter of 2021. Looking to the fourth quarter, based on strengthening of the U.S. dollar quarter-to-date, we expect an even larger headwind from foreign exchange. In addition, as we have previously said, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenues, given that our expense base is weighted more toward the U.S. with most of our R&D efforts located here. Turning to our segment results. Within the Google Services segment, Search and other revenues had healthy fundamental growth in the third quarter, which was affected by the impact of currency movements. As I already noted, the largest driver of the deceleration in year-on-year growth of Search compared with 3Q ‘21 was lapping the outsized growth in 2021. The sequential deceleration in the year-on-year growth of Search in the third quarter versus the second quarter was also driven by lapping with an additional headwind from pullback in advertiser spend in some areas. In YouTube and Network, the sequential deceleration of year-on-year growth in the third quarter versus the second quarter primarily reflects further pullbacks in advertiser spend. In the fourth quarter, the very strong revenue performance last year will continue to create tough comps that will weigh on the year-on-year growth rates of advertising revenues. Within other revenues, we expect an ongoing headwind from the slowdown in buyer spend on Google Play due to a number of factors, including lower levels of user engagement in gaming that impacted results in the second and third quarters. As Philipp mentioned, among other factors, this shift in user behavior was also a headwind to advertising revenues, with lower revenues from app promo spend on YouTube, Network and Play ads in Search and other. Turning to Google Cloud. Our results reflect momentum across GCP and Workspace. Customers globally are adopting our products and services to digitally transform their businesses. We are excited about the opportunity, given that businesses and governments are still in the early days of public cloud adoption and we continue to invest accordingly. We remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability. In terms of profitability, we have an effort underway to ensure we redeploy investments against our most compelling opportunities. As we noted on our second quarter call, our actions to slow the pace of hiring will become more apparent in 2023. With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added 12,765 people in the third quarter, including more than 2,600 of those joining Google Cloud as part of our acquisition of Mandiant. As in prior quarters, the majority of hires were for technical roles. In the fourth quarter, we expect headcount additions will slow to less than half the number added in Q3. Within this slower headcount growth, next year, we will continue hiring for critical roles, particularly focused on top engineering and technical talent. Turning to CapEx, we continue to make significant investments in technical infrastructure with servers as the largest component. Thank you.

Sundar, first, I think what investors are very curious about is how much this change in terms of aligning investment against your priorities is a reflection of what you expect to happen over the next 6 to 12 months in the broader macro environment versus a longer term perspective of maybe maximizing for productivity and efficiency. Would love to get your philosophy on that. And then, Philipp, a lot of comments in there about YouTube and the potential for growth going forward. Can you go a little bit deeper on what you’re seeing in terms of both the opportunity set to drive revenue and turn a possible headwind to a tailwind with respect to Shorts and Connected TV over the medium to long term.",133.0,63.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.031746031746031744,0.031746031746031744,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.0,0.0

Obviously, as a company, over time, we’ve had periods of extraordinary growth, and then there are periods where I viewed it as a moment where you take the time to optimize the Company to make sure we are set up for the next decade of growth ahead. I view this as one of those moments. It gives us a chance to make sure we are with clarity identifying what are the most important areas and making sure we are directing our incremental investments towards those and as well as where we can realign.

And from my side, Eric, in the third quarter, as I mentioned, there was a further pullback in spend by some advertisers across both brand and direct response. But overall, I feel YouTube remains in a really good position to continue to benefit from the streaming boom. In direct response, we think there’s a lot of room to run to make really YouTube more shoppable, more actionable from video action campaigns to product feeds, app campaigns, live commerce features. Advertisers are turning to YouTube to convert intent into action and really drive performance at scale. Product feeds are coming to Discovery ads soon and recent expanded to Shorts. We’re already seeing results. And in fact, on average, video action campaigns with product feeds saw an over 70% increase in conversions on Shorts versus those without. On the brand side, as I said earlier, eyeballs are moving away from linear TV, and we’re helping brands move beyond tradition, lets -- to efficiently really achieve their reach and awareness goals. And obviously, you mentioned that as well as connected TV is an important part of this strategy. When you think about it, YouTube is really the best place for advertisers to reach new consumers across multiple formats and screens from shorts to long-form, podcast, music all the way to CTV.",221.0,122.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.040983606557377046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040983606557377046

Sundar, just to go back to the comment about earlier in the quarter, becoming 20% more efficient. I thought tonight, your comment on investing responsibly over the long term of being responsive to the environment is helpful. If I look at sort of the Excel sheet, I think you’ll have added about 51,000 new people to the company since the start of last year. Can you give us some examples of internal KPIs or quantifiable analysis you’re running just to ensure you’re generating ROI for investors from all your hiring as you sort of run through these analyses? That’s the first one. Then the second one, Philipp, just on Shorts, are you seeing Shorts lead to incremental time spent from those users, or is it more so you’re seeing the time shift from other forms of YouTube over to Shorts?",158.0,70.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

And to the second part of the question, as we discussed before, we’ve always focused on building a great user and creator experience first, followed by increasing monetization over time.

And as I alluded to earlier, the initial progress on Shorts monetization has been encouraging. And we’re focused on closing the monetization gap between Shorts and long-form content on YouTube over time.

It’s across a wide range of industries and geographies. And it really comes back to the team’s focus on helping them solve unique business issues and innovate in new areas as they digitally transform. I think more to your question, and we talked about this about last quarter, in some cases, certain customers are taking longer to decide, and some have committed to deals with shorter terms or smaller deal sizes, which we attribute to a more challenging macro environment. Some are impacted due to reasons that are specific to their business. But overall, as you can see from the results here again, we’re pleased with the momentum in Cloud and do continue to be excited about the long-term opportunities. So, that’s why I made the comment that we do continue to invest meaningfully in this business. We’re still focused very much so on the path to profitability and free cash flow strength here, but we are continuing to invest in the business.

I’m going to ask you about TikTok but not as it relates to YouTube, more about Search. It looks like younger consumers are spending more time on TikTok searching for product reviews, recommendations, advice. I’m interested in learning if you’ve seen any changes in your search behavior by demographics in Google. And then, do you think search has become more visual, less text-based going forward in order to maintain more relevance for its younger users? So that’s one. And then Ruth, can you kind of just dig in a bit on the OpEx growth in Google Services. You called out other cost of revenues being up 20%. It looks like as a percentage of revenues, it’s nearly an all-time high. Can you talk a bit about how much of that cost base is fixed versus variable?

And so, these are all learnings we are constantly taking in and we use it to improve Search. And if you saw Search On, we had many explorations and product directions, which move in that direction.

On other cost of revenues, the biggest driver of the year-on-year increase in other cost of revenues does continue to be data centers and other operations. The change really here this quarter in Q3, the second largest driver was hardware. And then, CAC moved from its usual number 2 spot down to number 3. And there were really two key factors for the change in the rank order between hardware and CAC. Probably pretty self-evident but just to spell them out, the year-on-year decline in YouTube Ads revenues obviously muted the growth in CAC. And then the growth of Pixel phone sales due primarily to the launch of Pixel 6a drove that shift. What we’re looking at overall sort of to your broader question about profitability in Google Services is the overall pace of investments. And now, we’re looking at how with the change -- mix change and ongoing opportunities to drive revenue growth, how it flows through all the way to op inc growth. And so to Sundar’s opening comments and as we’ve been talking about, some of the margin upside last year was due to timing issues with a very strong growth of revenues and there was a lag in investments.

So, we’re continuing to focus on both, the driver here, revenue, as well as the investments that we’re making. And I want to make sure, to Sundar’s comments about sharpening our focus that we are economizing, utilizing resources as effectively as possible. So, it is both, the efforts we’re taking around expense management and building for durable performance as well as the efforts we’re taking, which are in the investment line but drive top line performance. I would say we also contextualize it and I tried to do that in response to Michael’s questions. And we said this last year, we’ve noted that some of the margin upside last year was due to timing issues. And we had a very strong growth in revenues, surge in revenues and a lag in investments that we said was a timing difference, and you are seeing some of that here.

Because I want to make sure that one of the comments that we made in the opening comments was very clear, which was the year-on-year story in ads was really lapping the very strong third quarter. And so to get to your question, you’re really talking about sequential decline on year-on-year growth. I think what’s notable in Search, we had really healthy growth in Q3, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The sequential deceleration in Search in the third quarter versus the second quarter was again primarily driven by lapping, and just I want to make sure that that was clear. There was some pullback from advertiser spend in some areas so I’ve noted that in opening comments. And then, in YouTube and Network, the sequential deceleration of year-on-year growth in both the second quarter -- the third quarter versus the second quarter was really further pullbacks in advertiser spend.",177.0,83.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012048192771084338,0.024096385542168676,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.012048192771084338

And as I said earlier, in Search and other ads revenues, while lapping the outsized performance was the largest factor in Q3, we did see some advertiser pull back in certain areas in search ads. And I think the example I called out was in financial services, in the areas of insurance, loan, mortgage, crypto subcategories. And we also noted a pullback in spend by some advertisers on YouTube and Network. And these pullbacks in spend increased in the third quarter.

You’ve seen these cycles before. Can you put any context as to the -- as economic conditions wax and wane, the impact that has on Google? Like how does this environment look to you versus prior cycles that the Company has managed through? And then Ruth, on the cost side, I understand the comments. I understand the comments about the headcount adds and what you plan to do in the fourth quarter.

I mean, there is, as we have said before, there is more uncertainty as we go through. We definitely see indicators on both sides so that makes it a bit more unique. Number two, I would say the strength of Search, both as a product for users as well as for advertisers in terms of delivering ROI through a tough time in the ad market, I think, is great to see. Third, just like when we went through it last time, ahead of us was a decade of mobile and the opportunities it brought. And to me, sitting now, looking at all the work that’s going on in AI, we’ve been an AI-first company for the past seven years in all the investments. And it looks like a big opportunity ahead. So keeping all that in mind, focused on the long term, using this moment to be disciplined and prioritize and focus, I think, will set us up well for the next decade ahead.",186.0,84.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.011904761904761904,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571

And that drives opportunities to redeploy amazing talent we have into the highest priority efforts that we have and to be as effective and efficient as possible. There are, obviously, to your question, non-payroll-associated expenses that also then attach. And so an operating environment like this adds urgency to prioritization. We want to make sure we’re using all resources as effectively and efficiently as possible. At the same time, as we’ve tried to be very clear, there are very exciting areas that we will continue to invest in.

And we’ve been listening to feedback from advertisers and have continued to roll out more features since its initial launch to increase transparency and help advertisers steer the automation more effectively. And there are more future updates to come. In July, we launched a number of new settings, including seasonality setting that as marketers make quite typical adjustments for seasonal campaign bidding and an optimization score setting that gives an indicator for performance improvement and gives the recommendations for better results.

So it’s driven a massive improvement in Search quality and helped us extend the lead in quality over other products. We are definitely using it to make it multimodal. And I think going back to some of the earlier questions about making sure Search is visual, things like Google Lens bringing visual search into -- being able to point your phone at things and ask questions, all that really helps set up Search well for the future of where computing is headed.

It's clear that after a period of significant acceleration in digital spending during the pandemic, the macroeconomic climate has become more challenging. We continue to have an extraordinary business and provide immensely valuable services for people and our partners. For example, during the World Cup Final on December 18, Google Search saw its highest query per second volume of all time. And beyond our advertising business, we have strong momentum in Cloud, YouTube subscriptions and hardware. However, our revenues this quarter were impacted by pullbacks in advertiser spend and the impact of foreign exchange. I'll focus on two major things today in a bit more detail, and then I'll give a shorter-than-usual quarterly snapshot from across our business. First, how we unlock the incredible opportunities AI enables for consumers, our partners and for our business; and second, how we focus our investments and make necessary decisions as a company to get there. First, the AI opportunity ahead. AI is the most profound technology we are working on today. Our talented researchers, infrastructure and technology make us extremely well positioned, as AI reaches an inflection point. More than six years ago, I first spoke about Google being an AI-first company. Since then, we have been a leader in developing AI. In fact, our Transformer’s research project and our field-defining paper in 2017, as well as our path-breaking work in diffusion models are now the basis of many of the generative AI applications you're starting to see today. Translating these kinds of technical leaps into products that help billions of people is what our company has always thrived on. Everyone working on the various projects underway is excited. We'll pursue this work boldly, but with a deep sense of responsibility, with our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity at the core of all our work. We have been preparing for this moment since early last year, and you're going to see a lot from us in the coming few months across three big areas of opportunity; first, large models. We published extensively about LaMDA and PaLM, the industry's largest, most sophisticated model plus extensive work at DeepMind. In the coming weeks and months, we'll make these language models available, starting with LaMDA, so that people can engage directly with them. This will help us continue to get feedback, test, and safely improve them. These models are particularly amazing for composing, constructing, and summarizing. They will become even more useful for people as they provide up-to-date more factual information. And in Search, language models like BERT and MUM have improved searches for four years now, enabling significant ranking improvements and multimodal search like Google Nets. Very soon, people will be able to interact directly with our newest, most powerful language models as a companion to Search in experimental and innovative ways. Stay tuned. Second, we'll provide new tools and APIs for developers, creators, and partners. This will empower them to innovate and build their own applications and discover new possibilities with AI on top of our language, multimodal, and other AI models. Third, our AI is a powerful enabler for businesses and organizations of all sizes and we have much more to come here. There's a few flavors of this. Google Cloud is making our technological leadership in AI available to customers via our Cloud AI platform, including infrastructure and tools for developers and data scientists like Vertex AI. We also offer specific AI solutions for sectors like manufacturing, life sciences and retail and will continue to roll out more. Workspace users benefit from AI-powered features like Smart Canvas for collaboration and Smart Compose for creation. And we are working to bring large language models to Gmail and Docs. We'll also make available other helpful generative capabilities from coding to design and more. And for our advertising partners, Philipp will discuss in detail how AI is powering dramatic campaign improvements and value-adding features for them. Of course, in addition to all this, AI also continues to improve Google's other products dramatically. And we'll continue our work with others outside Google, including joint research collaborations to develop AI responsibly and to apply AI to tackle society's greatest challenges and opportunities. For example, DeepMind's protein database of all 200 million proteins known to science have now been used by 1 million biologists around the world. We continue to invest in AI across the board, and Google AI and DeepMind are integral to a bright AI-first future. Over the past few years, DeepMind has been increasingly working across groups within Google and the other bets and to reflect that progress, we'll be making a financial reporting change that Ruth will share more about in her comments. We are just at the beginning of our AI journey and the best is yet to come. The second thing I wanted to discuss is our sharpened focus. We are committed to investing responsibly with great discipline and defining areas where we can operate more cost effectively. We are focused on methodically building financially sustainable, vibrant growing businesses across Alphabet. For example, we are working to improve the economics and hardware as we focus more intently on the Pixel line and our overall cost structure there. Cloud remains very focused on its path to profitability. And there are many opportunities to build on our progress at YouTube over the years, starting with Shorts monetization. Overall, I see this as an important journey to reengineer the company's cost base in a durable way. There are several dimensions already underway, including prioritization of our product investments across Google and other bets. It also includes a careful focus on our hiring needs, reflecting these priorities, as well as efficiencies in our technical infrastructure and productivity improvements from our AI tools. As part of this, we did a rigorous review across product areas and functions to ensure that our people and roles are aligned with our highest priorities as a company and we announced a reduction in our workforce. I'm grateful to Googlers leaving us for all of their contributions and their hard work to help people and businesses everywhere. Let me give a few quick updates from across the business this quarter. Just this week, we started bringing revenue sharing to YouTube Shorts, which is now averaging over 50 billion daily views, up from the 30 billion I announced on the Q1 2022 call. This will reward creators and help improve the Shorts experience for everyone. Our subscription business continues to grow, with YouTube Music and Premium surpassing 80 million subscribers, including triallers. Together with YouTube Primetime channel subscriptions and YouTube TV, we have good momentum here. YouTube's NFL Sunday Ticket will accelerate that by helping to drive subscriptions, bring new viewers to YouTube's paid and ad-supported experiences and create new opportunities for creators. Turning to hardware. Many outlets and reviewers named Pixel 7 Pro, the phone of the year. Features like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur are incredible and help differentiate Pixel from others. 2022's Pixel 6A, 7 and 7 Pro are the best-selling generation of phones we have ever launched. And we gained share in every market we operate in this year. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued momentum with Q4 revenue growing 32%. Our differentiated products and focused go-to-market strategy continue to drive customer momentum, beginning with real-time data, analytics and AI. Customers are increasingly choosing BigQuery because we unify data lakes, data warehouses and advanced AI/ML into one system and now analyze over 110 terabytes of data per second. Customers like Kroger can analyze data in multiple clouds without moving data in most cases, and MSCI processes unstructured and structured data at scale. In infrastructure, our global network and an advanced TPU v4 AI supercomputer helped Snap triple the throughput for its business critical ad ranking workload, while significantly lowering cost. Our machine learning infrastructure with cloud TPU v4 Pods can run large-scale training workloads up to 80% faster than alternatives according to third-party benchmarks, which is helping customers like Bayer accelerate drug discovery. Our reliability advantages and open edge cloud power the mission-critical 5G network of Telefonica Germany. As I mentioned, our suite of AI/ML solutions across verticals are a key differentiator. We helped Wells Fargo automate the customer service experience for mobile users and HCA continually improve the quality of patient care. In 2022, Mandiant, which we are now integrating, helped over 1,800 customers prepare for or recover from the most critical cybersecurity incidents. In Workspace, the innovations mentioned earlier are helping drive new wins and expansions across geographies. In Other Bets, from Calico to Weibo, we are focused on investing sustainably across the portfolio and creating good business. Verily, for example, has recently honed its strategy and structure to more clearly focus its product development. To close, we are all standing on the cusp of an era of amazing opportunities. We are going to be bold, responsible and focused as we move into it. A healthy disregard for the impossible has been core to our company culture from the very beginning. When I look around Google today, I see that same spirit and energy driving our efforts. Thanks to our employees, our partners and people everywhere who use our services. I'm excited for what's next.

I'll start today with our Google Services performance in the fourth quarter and then dive deeper into our priority areas. Google Services revenues of $68 billion were down 2% year-on-year, negatively affected by sizable foreign exchange headwind. In Google advertising, Search and Other revenues were down 2% year-over-year, and YouTube Ads and Network had high single-digit revenue declines. Google Other revenues were up 8% year-over-year, with strong growth in YouTube, non-advertising and hardware revenues, offset by a decrease in Play revenues. I'll highlight two other factors that affected our Ads business in Q4. Ruth will provide more detail. In Search and Other, revenues grew moderately year-over-year, excluding the impact of FX, reflecting an increase in retail and travel, offset partially by a decline in finance. At the same time, we saw further pullback in spend by some advertisers in Search in Q4 versus Q3. In YouTube and Network, the year-over-year revenue declines were due to a broadening of pullbacks in advertiser spend in the fourth quarter. I'll now zoom out to share more broadly where we're investing and see clear opportunities for long-term growth. First, Google AI. It's important to recognize that our advertising business has obviously benefited over the past decade from the transition to mobile. More recently, we had outsized growth in advertising revenues during the pandemic, with 2022 advertising revenues $90 billion higher than in 2019. Going forward, we are focused on growing revenues on top of this higher base through AI-driven innovation. Sundar highlighted the incredible opportunities underway with AI and the transformative impact it will have on businesses. Already, breakthroughs in everything from natural language understanding to generative AI are fueling our ability to deliver results that drive meaningful performance for advertisers and are useful to users. Take smart bidding, which uses AI to predict future ad conversions and their value, helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand. In 2022, AI advances boosted bidding performance, allowing us to move advertiser outcomes down the funnel to drive better ROI and use budgets more efficiently. In search query matching, large language models like MUM matched advertiser office to user quarries. This understanding of human intent of language, combined with advances in bidding prediction, are why business can see an average of 35% more conversions when they upgrade exact match keywords to broad match in campaigns that use a target CPA. Google AI also underlies our creative products, like tech suggestions in Google ads and creative optimization and responsive search ads. We're excited to start testing our automatically created assets better, which uses AI to generate headlines and descriptions for search creative seamlessly once advertisers opt in. Then of course, there's Performance Max, which offers the best combination of our AI-powered systems to our customers. But we're not stopping here, and these examples aren't exhaustive. AI has been foundational to our ads business for the last decade, and we'll continue to bring cutting-edge advances to our products to help businesses and users. Number two, retail. Our foundation for delivering value over the long term includes three pillars: first, we are on a multi-year mission to make Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users. This means constantly improving our consumer experiences, starting with a more visual, immersive, browsable search. Second, we're empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ad experiences. In 2022, we saw an uptick in merchants, particularly SMBs and product inventory coming on to Google, adding more value for merchants remains a top priority. Third, to drive retail performance further, we focus on great ads products, from automation and insights to bidding tools and omnichannel solutions to AI-powered campaigns like PMax, we're helping retailers hit their goals and connect with customers no matter where or when they shop. Two quick insights on PMax, which we upgraded the majority of advertisers to from smart shopping campaigns last year. First, advertisers on average see a 12% uplift from SSC to PMax. Second, it was a success story during the holidays in Cyber Five, its ability to scale and adapt to changing traffic over a volatile peak retail season drove strong results for many retailers, particularly mid-market advertisers. Moving on to YouTube. Despite ongoing revenue headwinds in Q4, we're confident in YouTube's long-term trajectory. Here's how we think about our strategy. It all starts with a creator ecosystem. Creators are the lifeblood of YouTube. In 2022, more people created content on YouTube than ever before, long-form, short-form, audio, podcast, music, live streams. What sets YouTube apart is, we give creators more ways to create content and connect with fans and more ways to earn money than any other platform. More creators means more content, means more viewers, which leads to more opportunities for advertisers. The creator ecosystem and our multi-format strategy will continue to drive YouTube's long-term growth. And to support that growth, we're focused on: number one, ramping Shorts; number two, accelerating engagement on a large screen, number three, investing in our subscription offerings; and number four, a long-term effort to make YouTube more shoppable. First, Shorts. Viewership is growing rapidly, as Sundar said, 50 billion-plus daily views. We're also still pleased with our continuing progress in early monetization. On the creator side, it's been impressive to see the innovative ways creators are using Shorts to introduce their content and extend existing channels. We're focused on providing creators with the best content creation and monetization tools, new, richer features and analytics capabilities that help individualize and optimize their content strategies. It's early days for Shorts, but we're confident the runway is long. Next, connected TV, where users are increasingly watching their favorite creators on the big screen at home. According to Nielsen, YouTube is the leader in US streaming watch time. Advertisers are leaning in. With AI-powered solutions, we're helping brands deliver efficient reach and ROI and address pain points like frequency and measurement. Then there's our subscription offerings. It's clear the future of online video is about helping users seamlessly discover and watch content across ad-supported and premium services. Our goal is to be a one-stop shop for multiple types of video content. That's why we first offered Music and Premium, where 80 million-plus paid subscribers and trialers enjoy their favorite content and music ads-free. We then expanded into YouTube TV, significantly improving on the legacy television experience. And then last fall, Primetime Channels launched, making streaming subscription services available on YouTube on an à la carte basis. Given the potential we see in our subscription offerings, we recently announced a multiyear agreement to distribute NFL Sunday Ticket. As Sundar highlighted, we're excited about the opportunities this will open up. Lastly is our focus on shoppable YouTube. It's still nascent, but we see lots of potential and making it easier for people to shop from the creators, brands, and content they love. I'll close with something I've said many times before. Our success is only possible because of our customers and partners. The reality is we only do well when they do well. Since our earliest days, our revenue share models have been structured around ROI for our partners from Play developers and online publishers to YouTube creators, artists and media orgs around the world. Over the last three years, I'm proud to share that we've contributed more than $200 billion to these ecosystems. We remain as committed as ever to fueling the next generation of businesses, media companies and creativity on the web. On that note, a big thank you to our partners and customers for their ongoing collaboration and trust and to Googlers for their energy, focus, and dedication to helping our users, customers and partners succeed, especially through these tougher times.

I will briefly cover the main points of our fourth quarter results and then turn to our outlook to give you more context for Sundar's comments on how we're focused on investing for growth as well as on reengineering our cost base for long-term success. For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues were $76 billion, up 1% or up 7% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Our total cost of revenues was $35.3 billion, up 7%. Other cost of revenues of $22.4 billion were up 15%. The increase was driven by two factors; first, hardware costs due primarily to $1.2 billion in inventory related charges, and secondarily, to strong unit sales. The charges reflect ongoing pricing pressures and changes in expected future inventory needs. Second, costs associated with data centers and other operations. Operating expenses were $22.5 billion, up 10%, reflecting an increase in R&D expenses, primarily driven by headcount growth, followed by an increase in G&A expenses, primarily reflecting an increase in charges related to accrued legal matters. These increases were partially offset by a decline in sales and marketing expenses, primarily due to lower advertising and promotional spend. Operating income was $18.2 billion, down 17% versus last year, and our operating margin was 24%. Net income was $13.6 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $16 billion in the fourth quarter and $60 billion in 2022. We ended the year with $114 billion in cash and marketable securities. We also repurchased a total of $59 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2022. Turning to our segment results, starting with Google Services. Revenues were $67.8 billion, down 2%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $42.6 billion in the quarter were down 2%. Search delivered moderate underlying growth in Q4, absent the impact of currency movements on reported results. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion were down 8%. Network advertising revenues of $8.5 billion were down 9%. Other revenues were $8.8 billion, up 8%, reflecting several factors; first, significant subscriber growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV; second, strong growth in hardware revenues, primarily from the Pixel family. Offsetting growth in these two areas was a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, reflecting a particularly large foreign exchange headwind in APAC, as well as the impact of reductions of Play Store fees. TAC was $12.9 billion, down 4%. Google Services operating income was $21.1 billion, down 19%, and the operating margin was 31%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $7.3 billion for the quarter, up 32%. Revenue growth in GCP was again greater than Google Cloud, reflecting strength in both infrastructure and platform services. Google Workspace's strong results were driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. In Q4, we saw slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP costs, reflecting the macro backdrop. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $480 million. As to our Other Bets, for the full year 2022, revenues were $1.1 billion and the operating loss was $6.1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. In 2022, our year-on-year revenue growth was affected by a number of challenges. First, we faced very tough comps, given the outsized recovery in 2021 from the impact of the pandemic. Second, foreign exchange headwinds grew throughout the year. And third, we were operating against the backdrop of a more challenging economic climate that also impacted many of our customers, and which remains ongoing. Within Google Services, we are focused on investing in the opportunities we see for long-term revenue growth. First, within advertising, we are focused on using advances in AI to drive new and better experiences for users and search, as well as to deliver better measurement, higher ROI and tools for more compelling creative content to advertisers. In YouTube, we are prioritizing continued growth in Shorts engagement and monetization, while also working on other initiatives across our ad-supported products. As to our outlook for other revenues, in Play, 2022 results reflected the particularly sizable impact from foreign exchange, lapping the uplift in user activity during the pandemic and the impact from the fee reductions we introduced. We remain optimistic about the longer term prospects for mobile apps and gaming, although remain more cautious near term, given industry trends. With YouTube subscriptions, we're optimistic about building on its momentum across YouTube Music Premium, YouTube TV and Primetime Channels. In hardware, we continue to make sizable investments, particularly to support innovation across our Pixel family, while working to drive greater focus and cost efficiencies across the portfolio. For Google Cloud, we remain excited about the long-term market opportunity and the trajectory of the business. Enterprises and governments are increasingly turning to us for their digital transformation initiatives across verticals and geographies. While investing for growth, we remain very focused on Google Cloud's path to profitability. In terms of Other Bets, as Sundar mentioned, we will be making a financial reporting change as it relates to DeepMind. To reflect the increasing DeepMind collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets, beginning in the first quarter, DeepMind will no longer be reported in Other Bets and will be reported as part of Alphabet's corporate costs. I'll now walk you through the key elements of our efforts to deliver a durable reengineering of our cost base in order to slow the pace of operating expense growth. We expect the impact will become more visible in 2024. First, with respect to Alphabet headcount, we are meaningfully slowing the pace of hiring in 2023, while still investing in priority areas. In Q4, we added 3,455 people. As in prior quarters, the majority of hires were for technical roles. With respect to our recent announcement that we are reducing our workforce by approximately 12,000 roles, most of the impact will be seen in Q1. We will take a severance charge of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, which will be reported in corporate costs. We will continue hiring in priority areas with a particular focus on top engineering and technical talent as well as on the global footprint of our talent. Second, we have a longer term effort underway to reengineer our cost base in three broad categories; first, using AI and automation to improve productivity across Alphabet for operational tasks, as well as the efficiency of our technical infrastructure; second, managing our spend with suppliers and vendors more effectively; and third, optimizing how and where we work. In the first quarter of 2023, we expect to incur approximately $500 million of costs related to exiting leases to align our office space with our adjusted global headcount look. This will be reflected in corporate costs. We will continue to optimize our real estate footprint. Turning to CapEx. For 2023, we expect total CapEx to be generally in line with 2022, with an increase in technical infrastructure versus a decline in office facilities. Our ongoing investment in technical infrastructure is obviously a critical component of supporting our long-term growth opportunities. Finally, I will point you to our earnings release in which we noted that we adjusted the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment starting in Q1 2023. We expect these changes will favorably impact our 2023 operating results by approximately $3.4 billion for assets and service as of year-end 2022. Thank you.

I appreciate all the color about all the AI tools that are to come. I guess, first question is, how should we think about the potential impact on CapEx and the higher compute intensity of these AI tools to come, potentially impacting margins over the next couple of years? And then the second one, Ruth, I really appreciate the conversation about long-term efforts underway to improve efficiency. How should we think about potential impacts of those efforts in 2023 and in 2024? Have you sort of run any sizes of what types of savings we could see roll through the P&L over that period?

As I think Sundar and Philipp both noted, AI is already incorporated in many of our products, products like Performance Max and Smart Bidding and Cloud, as Sundar said. It is more compute-intensive, but also opens up many more services and products for our users, for creators, for advertisers. That being said, we're very focused on further optimizing the cost of compute, and that's across all elements, data center, servers and our supply chain. So we're continuing to invest with a keen lens on the return on that capital. And as I indicated in opening comments, when we look at CapEx for 2023, we do expect it's going to be generally in line with 2022 with an important mix shift. We're increasing our investments in technical infrastructure. And that's not just for AI. That's to support investments across Alphabet, in particular in Cloud as well. And at the same time, we're meaningfully decreasing our CapEx for office facilities. And then, with respect to the overall efficiency opportunities, yes, very keen focus on the three areas that I noted, the -- and one of the key elements of it is using AI and automation to improve productivity and efficiency of our technical infrastructure. We noted that we want to be focused and that we are focused on durable improvements to our expense base. And that's because if you go through the items, the work streams that we have in flight, they take longer to implement, execute. They're in process now, and they continue to build on themselves and continue to provide added upside as we go through time, which is why I indicated you would see more of an impact on 2024 than in 2023. But we're continuing to work through them.",311.0,134.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03731343283582089,0.014925373134328358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022388059701492536

For Sundar and Philipp, you both mentioned the NFL in your remarks and the opportunities it opens up. Can you comment and help us define, what do you see is that longer-term opportunity? Why is it so critical to have the NFL? Is this the first of many sports deals to be had? So anything just help us, why this is so important to you? And then just, Philipp, you've said in the past about the scaling of monetization, YouTube Shorts. What are the sticky factors? What's taking you the time to really bring advertisers on? I wonder some of the things you've seen in terms that you've solved to make this a more quickly monetizable product?

We think there is a lot of great opportunities to differentiate the user and creator experience, with our unique capabilities. It basically means that, every YouTube viewer, who is interested in the NFL can now have one-click access to the full offering of Sunday Ticket, as an add-on package on YouTube TV subscription, and as a stand-alone offering on Primetime Channels. This will be the first time that Sunday Ticket is actually available a la carte for fans. On YouTube TV, we're building the ability for subscribers to, for example, watch multiple screens at once. And on YouTube CTV, we'll be adding new features specific to the Sunday Ticket experience like comments, chats, polls, and so on. On the creator side, imagine all the innovative ways they can create with exclusive NFL content, behind-the-scenes event access and so on. And we're really excited to see, what they'll do across long-form, shorts, live streams and more. On your second question, on the Shorts side, as I said earlier, viewership is growing rapidly, 50 billion-plus daily views, up from 30 billion last spring. We're still pleased with our continuing progress in monetization. Closing the gap between Shorts and long-form is a big priority for us, as is, of course, continuing to build a great creator and user experience, which we're paying a lot of attention to. As on Shorts are now available, it gives you a bit of a sign for the progress. We have video action, app discovery, Performance Max campaigns and via product feed shorts are also shoppable. And again, we're the only destination where creators can produce all forms of content, across multiple formats, across multiple screens and really with multiple ways to make a living. And Sundar shared just yesterday, we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner Program. Ultimately, our goal is to make YouTube the best place for Shorts and creators.

For Sundar, can you just talk more about how you can bring the AI products to market with the principles and integrity that you talked about and how you can do that without kind of sacrificing quality or trust along the way? And then, Ruth, clearly, the language around reengineering the cost structure in a durable way and everything that went along with it is different than what we've heard in the past.

I think we've been investing for a while, and it's clear that the market is ready. Consumers are interested in trying out new experiences. I think I feel comfortable with all the investments we have made in making sure we can develop AI responsibly. And we'll be careful. We'll be launching -- we’ll -- more as labs products in certain cases, beta features in certain cases and just slowly scaling up from there. Obviously, we need to make sure we're iterating in public, these models will keep getting better, so the field is fast changing. The serving costs will need to be improved. So I view it as very, very early days, but we are committed to putting our experiences, both in terms of new products and experiences, actually bringing direct LLM experiences in Search, making APIs available for developers and enterprises and learn from there and iterate like we've always done.

And we're focused on revenue upside, as well as durable changes to the expense base to really ensure we have the capacity to invest in that growth. And clearly, the emphasis of revenue growth, there's a lot that's exciting ahead of us within Google Services, all of the AI advancements that are improving advertiser ROI and the search user experience. And more broadly, as we've talked about across the key product areas. And then very importantly, on expense growth, we have a very strong commitment to, we can’t keep emphasizing, durably reengineer our cost base, and that will benefit all of the segments across Alphabet. And the key components, slowing the pace of hiring as a starting point, product prioritization across Google, as Sundar said, is key, improving economics in hardware as we focus intently on the Pixel line and cost structure, then using AI and automation to improve productivity for operational tasks, as well as for the efficiency of our technical infrastructure, where we have a number of work streams. Managing our spend, as I said, with suppliers and vendors and then optimizing how and where we work, and you saw part of that with the real estate consolidation, given the slower headcount growth. All of those not only benefit Google Services, but many of those similarly drive greater efficiency across Alphabet. And so, as we've said, in Cloud, we remain very focused on the path to profitability. That's a revenue and margin driver. And then with Other Bets, we're similarly focused on investing sustainably. And so, to go back to it, it's the durable nature of change in some of the elements that I've talked about here where work is ongoing, you start to see impacting in 2023 but to really get full year run rate and the benefit of it, there is work ongoing. And that's why we've emphasized this notion of it comes in and then really you see the run rate in 2024.",368.0,171.0,9.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.05263157894736842,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.0,0.005847953216374269,0.03508771929824561

Sundar, for you, continuing on the AI theme, how do you think philosophically about capturing the opportunity set that you see in front of you, given all the investments you've made over the last five-plus years that we've been talking about going back to a lot of Google I/Os versus potentially disrupt the user experience or the monetization arc in your existing product set and striking the right balance between the opportunity set and being disruptive to yourself when you think about looking forward over the next couple of years? And then, Ruth, maybe just following on some of the questions and debates on the cost structure. Obviously, Other Bets is an area where the losses continue to be sort of higher than what some of us think from the outside looking in.

Look, I do think, first of all, we made such a foundational technology and we've been investing not just in terms of research, but actually getting it all production scale-ready. We had already deployed. If you look at the impact, things like BERT and MUM had on search quality, making search multi-modal, driving the usage of products like Google Lens. I feel like we've been scaling up well. In Google Cloud today with Vertex AI, we'd already been bringing AI APIs to enterprises, and they're on a pretty healthy growth path. So we do see secular opportunities ahead, both in terms of putting these APIs out, making sure every developer, every organization in the world can use it. And as I said earlier, we are in very, very early days and I think there's a lot of room ahead. In terms of Search too, now that we can integrate more direct LLM type experiences in Search, I think it will help us expand and serve new types of use cases, generative use cases. And so I think I see this as a chance to rethink and re-imagine and drive Search to solve more use cases for our users as well.

And at the same time, we are very focused on the overall pace of investment and the financial returns. And so what we're really looking at here are what are the opportunities for monetization and commercialization. As I've said on prior calls, there is no monolithic approach across the portfolio, but we are very focused on whether – what's the pace of investment opportunities for monetization and commercialization. And just a bit more with respect to the DeepMind move, to be very clear, we consolidate in Other Bets into Google only when that bet supports products and services within Google or for Alphabet broadly. And you saw us do that, some time ago when we moved Chronicle as an example into combining with our Cloud business and really the cybersecurity offering that is now in Cloud, and that was very effective. With AI, this is obviously an Alphabet strategic priority, and we see huge opportunity ahead, and DeepMind's research is core to that future across the product areas in Alphabet portfolio.

And so that's why you've heard so many comments about the application of AI and what that means for the ongoing opportunity. You had a number of different questions in there. I think one was on volumes. In the 10-K that we'll be filing shortly, you'll see that for the full year 2022, CPCs were down 1% versus last year. And as we've talked about in prior quarters, the change in CPCs can reflect a number of different factors; geographic mix, property mix, all sorts of things. Clicks were up 10% in 2022, reflecting a number of factors, including increased engagement, primarily on mobile devices and improvements in ad formats. But I think overall, we're really excited about what we see ahead. We're not going to predict the global environment. We did say the challenging backdrop is ongoing, and you can see that but we're very focused on what we can control. And I think most important and what we're really excited about here is innovation to help advertisers overall and our cost reengineering that really gets us to align this long-term sustainable value creation.",215.0,96.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0625,0.020833333333333332,0.010416666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664

First of all, very, very pleased with how Pixel has performed through a challenging macro environment. Look, I think our computing portfolio is incredibly important. It's what allows us to -- for us to invest and drive innovation forward. You have to put it all together as a product and ship it. And I think it ends up playing a very, very big role in guiding the ecosystem as well. And increasingly, I think users are thinking beyond phones and thinking through a holistic ecosystem. To give one example, us undertaking Pixel Watch and, as part of that, integrating Fitbit and bringing it to our ecosystem as well, partnering closely with Samsung on wearables. The combination is what has driven over a 300% increase in actives on Android watches ecosystem. So, just to give you a context on that. So, we are very thoughtful about how we are approaching this area. And as Ruth mentioned, across all these areas, too, we are working to drive greater focus and cost efficiencies in the portfolio. Obviously, we work through a challenging supply chain environment as well as a challenging environment on the demand side.

And so there's been meaningful investment to position ourselves to really have the momentum that the team has continued to deliver. That being said, they are, as both Sundar and I have noted, extremely focused on the path to profitability in every element of that and some of the items that I noted that benefit Alphabet generally most certainly are relevant here for Cloud as well, everything from our efficiency with our technical infrastructure, which we're very excited about, all the efforts that they're doing there and more broadly. So, this has been really to ensure, first and foremost, given the scale of the opportunity and the speed with which it's moving that we're positioned to be present with our customers, to provide them with the analytics, the skills, the capabilities that are needed to build for long-term growth.

I am pleased with our business performance in the first quarter with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation. On Cloud, we continue to be on a long and exciting journey to build that business. Cloud delivered profitability this quarter and we remain focused on long-term value creation here. Today, I will give an update on the two themes I spoke about last quarter: one, our advancements in AI and how they are driving opportunities in Search and beyond; and two, our efforts to sharpen our focus as a company. Then I will talk about our momentum in Cloud and close with our progress at YouTube. First, the incredible AI opportunity for consumers, our partners and for our business. I’ve compared it to the successful transition we made from desktop to mobile computing over a decade ago. Our investments and breakthroughs in AI over the last decade have positioned us well. In our last call, I outlined three areas of opportunity: continuing to develop state-of-the-art large language models and make significant improvements across our products to be more helpful to our users; empowering developers, creators and partners with our tools; and enabling organizations of all sizes to utilize and benefit from our AI advances. We have made good progress across all three areas. In March, we introduced our experimental conversational AI service called Bard. We have since added our PaLM model to make it even more powerful and Bard can now help people with programming and software development tasks, including code generation, lots more to come. For developers, we have released our PaLM API alongside our new MakerSuite tool. It provides a simple way to access our large language models and begin building new generative AI applications quickly. A number of organizations are using our generative AI large language models across Google Cloud platform, Google Workspace and our cybersecurity offerings. For years, we’ve been focused on making Search even more helpful, from Google Lens to multi-Search to visual exploration in Search, immersive view in Maps, Google Translate, to all the language models powering Search today, we have used AI to open up access to knowledge in powerful ways. We’ll continue to incorporate generative AI advances to make Search better in a thoughtful and deliberate way. We’ll be guided by data and years of experience about what people want and our high standards for quality. And we’ll test and iterate as we go because we know that billions of people trust Google to provide the right information. As it evolves, we’ll unlock entirely new experiences in Search and beyond just as camera, voice and translation technologies have all opened entirely new categories of queries and exploration. AI has also been foundational to our ads business for over a decade. Products like Performance Max used the full power of Google’s AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities. Philipp will talk more about this in a moment. And as we continue to bring AI to our products, our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity remain at the core of all our work. As one example, our perspective API helps to identify and reduce the amount of toxic text that language models train on with significant benefits for information quality. This is designed to help ensure the safety of generative AI applications before they are released to the public. We are proud to have world-class research teams who have been advancing the breakthroughs underpinning this new era of AI. Last week, I announced that we are bringing together the Brain Team in Google Research and DeepMind into one unit. Combining all this talent into 1 focused team, backed by the pooled computational resources of Google, will help accelerate our progress and develop the most capable AI systems safely and responsibly. On to my second theme, the company’s sharpened focus. I spoke last quarter about our commitment to invest responsibly and with discipline and to find areas where we can operate more cost effectively and with greater velocity. We have significant multiyear efforts underway to create savings, such as improving machine utilization and finding more scalable and efficient ways to train and serve machine learning models. We are making our data centers more efficient, redistributing workloads and equipment where servers aren’t being fully used. This is important work as we continue to significantly invest in infrastructure to drive our many AI opportunities. Improving external procurement is another area where data suggests significant savings, and this work is underway. And we are taking concrete steps to manage our real estate portfolio to ensure it meets our current and future needs. We’ll continue to use data to determine additional areas for durable savings. Next, Google Cloud. I’m pleased with the ongoing momentum in Cloud. Our disciplined expansion of our product road map and go-to-market organization has helped to build one of the largest enterprise software companies in the world. We have consistently grown top line revenues and improved annual operating margins, and we continue to do so this quarter. Our growth has come from our deep relationships with large enterprises, a strong partner ecosystem and our product leadership. Over the past 3 years, GCP’s annual deal volume has grown nearly 500%, with large deals over $250 million growing more than 300%. Nearly 60% of the world’s 1,000 largest companies are Google Cloud customers, and many leading start-ups and millions of small and medium enterprises use Google Cloud. We have also built a strong partner ecosystem. Over the last 4 years, the number of Google Cloud Partner certified practitioners around the world has increased more than 15x. The largest global system integrators have built 13 dedicated practices with Google Cloud compared to zero when we started. And today, more than 100,000 companies are part of our Google Cloud Partner Advantage program. Our growth is also driven by our product leadership. We are bringing our generative AI advances to our cloud customers across our cloud portfolio. Our PaLM generative AI models and Vertex AI platform are helping Behavox to identify insider threats, Oxbotica to test its autonomous vehicles and Lightricks to quickly develop text-to-image features. In Workspace, our new generative AI features are making content creation and collaboration even easier for customers like Standard Industries and Lyft. This builds on our popular AI Bard Workspace tools, Smart Canvas and Translation Hub used by more than 9 million paying customers. Our product leadership also extends to data analytics, which provides customers the ability to consolidate their data and understand it better using AI. New advances in our data cloud enable Ulta Beauty to scale new digital and omnichannel experiences while focusing on customer loyalty; Shopify to bring better search results and personalization using AI; and Mercedes Benz to bring new products to market more quickly. We have introduced generative AI to identify and prioritize cyber threats, automate security workflows and response and help scale cybersecurity teams. Our cloud cybersecurity products helped protect over 30,000 companies, including innovative brands like Broadcom and Europe’s Telepass. We are successfully integrating Mandiant with our products, including Mandiant Threat Intelligence and Breach Analytics. Our open approach to AI development, coupled with our industry-leading TPUs and best-in-class GPUs from NVIDIA, enable innovative companies to tackle any AI workload with speed and flexibility. AI21 Labs, Replit, Midjourney and many others build and train foundation models and generative AI platforms. We are the only cloud provider to announce availability of NVIDIA’s new L4 Tensor Core GPU with the launch of our G2 VMs, which are purpose-built for large inference AI workloads, such as generative AI. Turning next to YouTube, let me start by thanking Susan Wojcicki for her terrific leadership of YouTube for 9 years. She recently transitioned into an advisory role with Alphabet this quarter with Neal Mohan, a long-time leader at Google and YouTube, becoming the new head of YouTube. Here are a few highlights from the quarter. YouTube Shorts continues to see strong momentum with Creators. Last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. Those posting weekly on Shorts, saw the majority of new channel subscribers coming from their Shorts post. The living room remained our fastest-growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time, and we are seeing growth and momentum internationally. On our subscription business, we rolled out several new updates to YouTube Premium. Premium subscribers can now queue videos on phones and tablets, stream continuously while switching between devices and auto download recommended videos for off-line viewing. And we have great momentum around YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime channels. We have announced pricing for the NFL Sunday Ticket offering, which will help to drive subscriptions, bring new viewers to YouTube’s paid and ad-supported experiences and create new opportunities for Creators. To close across the company, we are excited about helping people, businesses and society reach their full potential with AI. We’ll share updates at Google I/O about how we are using AI across our products including our Pixel devices and share some exciting new developments for Android. Thanks to our employees around the world who continue to work hard to advance our mission. After nearly 25 years, the work to organize the world’s information and make it accessible and useful is as ever, and I look forward to the work ahead. Over to you, Philipp.",1621.0,874.0,61.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,4.0,1.0,0.06979405034324943,0.005720823798627002,0.004576659038901602,0.0011441647597254005,0.0011441647597254005,0.06407322654462243

I’ll kick off with Google Services’ performance in the first quarter, then provide color into our key opportunity areas and then turn it over to Ruth for more on our financial performance. Google Services revenue of $62 billion were up 1% year-on-year, including the effect of a modest foreign exchange headwind. In Google Advertising, Search and Other, revenues grew 2% year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the travel and retail verticals, offset partially by a decline in finance as well as in media and entertainment. In YouTube Ads, we saw signs of stabilization and performance, while in network, there was an incremental pullback in advertiser spend. Google Other revenues were up 9% year-over-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues. Now let’s double-click into the 3 areas I laid out last quarter, where we see clear opportunities for long-term growth in advertising. Number one, Google AI; number two, retail, which cuts across all of our ads products and services; and number three, YouTube. First, Google AI. I’ve said before, AI has long been an important driver of our business. Advancements are powering our ability to help businesses, big and small, respond in real time to rapidly changing market and consumer shifts and deliver measurable ROI when it’s needed most. In Q1, we continue to innovate across our products. Take Core Search, for example. In targeting, we updated search keyword relevance using the latest natural language AI from MUM models to improve the relevance and performance of shown ads when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible for an auction. In bidding, we improved our Smart Bidding models to bid more accurately based on differences in search ad formats. In other words, bid more effectively depending on how a user wants to engage with an ad. In creatives, we opened our automatically created assets beta to all advertisers in English. ACA generates text assets alongside your responsive search ads and uses AI to help reduce the amount of manual work to keep creatives fresh and relevant to users’ query, context and to the advertisers business. To then unlock Core Search further and maximize conversions across all of Google, we’re actively helping more advertisers pair together with Performance Max. Advertisers who use PMax are, on average, achieving over 18% more conversions at a similar CPA. This is up 5 points in just 14 months, thanks to advances in the AI underlying bidding, creatives, search query matching and new formats like YouTube Shorts. I mentioned earlier that travel was a contributor to growth. In March, we launched PMax for Travel Goals. Now even the smallest total DS can benefit from the expanded reach of hotel ads in PMax. Like family-run Corissia Hotels Group, who drove a 32% increase in revenue and a 26% increase in total direct bookings within just 1 month of using PMax for travel goals, there’s more to come here as we add even more AI part features. Stay tuned for more at Google Marketing Live in May. Moving on to retail, where we had a solid quarter. Our focus is on three pillars: number one, making Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users. Number two, empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ads experiences; and number three, driving retail performance further with great ads products. In a macro environment of do more with less, our tools and solutions are proving that we can deliver value for retailers online and omnichannel and drive high-value customers even in challenging times. Caraway, a direct-to-consumer maker of cookware, use target ROAS to uncapped budgets and PMax to optimize and deploy spend across Google inventory for its Q4 Black Friday campaign. PMax drove a 46% increase in revenue and 31% jump in ROAS leading to Caraway’s best business day in history and a robust reinvestment in its AI-first strategy for Q1. For omni-focused retailers, we recently rolled out store sales reporting and bidding in Performance Max for store goals. This is helping retailers go beyond just optimizing to online conversions to also optimize to their stores, reaching and bidding for high-value customers who are more likely to spend in store. Danish Department Store, Magazine, recently used our store sales solution to boost its omnichannel ROAS 128% versus online-only campaigns. Thanks to dynamic in-store values coming from its first-party data, including its high-value customers, magazine can now, with confidence, measure the full impact of its online investments on both e-commerce and physical store revenue. Turning to YouTube. Creators fuel YouTube success. Across Long Form and Shorts, Music and Podcasts, Vertical and Horizontal, YouTube is where creators are incentivized to make their best work, which means the best content, more of yours and more opportunities for advertisers. As I said last quarter, our creator ecosystem and multi-format strategy will be key drivers of YouTube’s long-term growth. And to support this growth, we’re focused on, number one, Shorts; number two, engagement on CTV; number three, investing in our subscription offerings; and number four, a longer-term effort to make YouTube more shoppable. First, Shorts. We’re seeing strong watch time growth. Monetization is also progressing nicely. People are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates. Number two, connected TV. As Sundar said we are seeing momentum globally. Viewers love watching YouTube creators and their favorite content on the large screen. Advertisers are leaning in. Zooming out more broadly for a second. Across YouTube, we’re helping brands benefit from our expansive reach and drive the profitability they are looking for. In one of our largest marketing mix modeling studies to date, YouTube ROI is 40% higher than linear TV and 34% higher than all other online video, according to a customer analysis from January 2020 to March 2022 of Nielsen Compass ROI benchmarks across 16 countries and 19 billion of total media spend measured. This proves YouTube’s ability to drive effectiveness at scale. Next up are subscription offerings. The goal is to be a one-stop shop for multiple types of video content across both ad-supported and Premium services. Our launch of MultiView on YouTube TV and our first-of-its-kind a la carte access for NFL Sunday Ticket are two examples of how we’re investing here. Expect more updates over the coming quarters. Number four, shopping on YouTube. It’s still super early days. One highlight. Last year, we brought shopping to more creators and brands by partnering with commerce platforms like Shopify. Now more than 100,000 creators, artists and brands have connected their own stores to their YouTube channels to sell their products. We’re excited about the potential ahead. I’ll close with an awesome example of we’re bringing the best across Google to our partners to accelerate innovation. Mercedes-Benz, in February, we announced a first-of-a-kind partnership to bring Google Maps platform and YouTube into future Mercedes-Benz vehicles, equipped with its next-gen MBOS operating system. Beyond enabling the luxury automaker to design a customized navigation interface, we will also provide AI and data cloud capabilities to advance their autonomous driving efforts and create an enhanced customer experience. On that note, a big thank you, first, to our customers and partners for their trust and collaboration; and second, to all Googlers for all of their incredible work this quarter.

As I go through the discussion today, I will reference some changes to our reporting and disclosures that are covered more fully in the 8-K we filed last week. I will conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.8 billion, up 3% or up 6% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth on a constant currency basis. In terms of expenses and profitability, year-on-year comparisons are impacted by three factors: first, the $2.6 billion in charges we took in the first quarter related to workforce and office space reductions. We provided a table in our earnings release that shows the impact of those charges on cost of revenues and operating expenses. Second, the adjustment we made to the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment at the beginning of 2023. As you can see in our earnings release, the effect for the first quarter was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million. Third, the shift in timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards from January to March delays the step-up in SBC from Q1 to Q2. This shift in timing does not affect the total amount of SBC over the full year 2023. Total cost of revenues was $30.6 billion, up 3%, driven by other cost of revenues of $18.9 billion, which was up 7%. The biggest factor of which was compensation costs associated with data centers and other operations and followed by content acquisition costs. Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, up 19%, with a significant impact from the charges related to workforce and office space reductions. Operating income was $17.4 billion, down 13%, and our operating margin was 25%. Net income was $15.1 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $17.2 billion in the first quarter and $62 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $115 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to our segment results. These were affected by two additional changes outlined in our 8-K filing. First, reflecting the increasing collaboration between DeepMind and Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. As of Q1, DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet’s unallocated corporate costs. And second, beginning in the first quarter, we updated our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. In our filing, we provided a recast of prior period results for the segment for these two changes. The highlights of the year-on-year performance of our segments that I will review reflect these recast results. Starting with Google Services. Revenues were $62 billion, up 1%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $40.4 billion in the quarter were up 2%. YouTube advertising revenues of $6.7 billion were down 3%. Network advertising revenues of $7.5 billion were down 8%. Other revenues were $7.4 billion, up 9%, reflecting primarily ongoing significant subscriber growth in YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium. TAC was $11.7 billion, down 2%, primarily reflecting a mix shift between search and Network. Google Services operating income was $21.7 billion, down 1%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $7.5 billion for the quarter, up 28%. Growth in GCP remained strong across geographies, industries and products. Google Workspace’s strong results were driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $191 million, and the operating margin was 2.6%. As to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $288 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. In terms of the operating environment, our results in the first quarter reflected ongoing headwinds due to a challenging economic environment and the outlook remains uncertain. Foreign exchange headwinds have moderated, and we expect less of a foreign exchange headwind in the second quarter based on current spot rates. With respect to Google Services, within advertising, Q1 results reflect the resilience of search with its unique ability to surface demand and deliver measurable ROI. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the revenue growth of search was similar to last quarter. In YouTube, we saw signs of stabilization in ad spend on a sequential basis. We continue to prioritize growth in Shorts engagement where we are encouraged by progress in monetization. As to other revenues, in YouTube subscriptions, we are pleased with the significant ongoing subscriber growth in both YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV. In Play, revenues were down year-on-year, primarily due to the continued impact of foreign exchange in APAC, although results have improved as we lapped the impact from our introduction of fee reductions last year. Turning to Google Cloud. Our investments in product innovation, our go-to-market organization and our partner ecosystem delivered strong results as customers across industries and geographies increasingly rely on Google Cloud to digitally transform their businesses. That being said, in Q1, we continued to see slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP costs reflecting the macro backdrop, which remains uncertain. In terms of operating performance, we remain focused on driving long-term profitable growth in Cloud, while continuing to invest given the substantial opportunity. Moving to Other Bets. In the first quarter, we similarly worked to refine strategies and prioritize efforts across the portfolio, including reductions to headcount. I will now walk you through an update on our efforts to reengineer our cost base, slowing the pace of operating expense growth while creating capacity for key investment areas, particularly in support of AI across the company. First, as discussed on the fourth quarter call, we have efforts underway in three broad categories; number one, using AI and automation to improve productivity across Alphabet for operational tasks as well as the efficiency of our technical infrastructure; number two, managing our spend with suppliers and vendors more effectively; and number three, continuing to optimize how and where we work. As we’ve noted previously, all three work streams are ramping up this year, and we plan to build on these efforts in 2024 and in subsequent years. Second, with respect to headcount growth. The reported number of employees at the end of the first quarter includes almost all of the employees impacted by the workforce reduction we announced in January. We expect most of the impacted individuals will no longer be reflected in our head count by the end of the second quarter. In terms of the outlook for headcount for the year, as we shared last quarter, we are meaningfully slowing the pace of hiring in 2023, while still investing in priority areas, particularly for top engineering and technical talent. In terms of our investments in AI, we are excited about the creation of Google DeepMind, combining the Brain Team from Google Research with DeepMind with the goal to accelerate innovation and impact. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the costs associated with teams and activities transferred from Google Research will move from Google Services to Google DeepMind within Alphabet’s unallocated corporate costs. Finally, as it relates to CapEx, for 2023, we now expect total CapEx to be modestly higher than in 2022. As discussed last quarter, CapEx this year will include a meaningful increase in technical infrastructure versus a decline in office facilities. We expect the pace of investment in both data center construction and servers to step up in the second quarter and continue to increase throughout the year. Thank you.

Sundar, I guess as you think over the course of the next 12 months, I know you have a lot of new AI tools to show us, what new behavior changes or capabilities are you most excited about for users, developers and advertisers as these tools come out? And then the second one for Ruth. Could you talk to us about how much of the AI tools have you incorporated internally to sort of drive more productivity out of your engineers, your sales force, your G&A? Or is that sort of something to come over the next couple of years? Thanks.",114.0,50.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0

I do think we see an opportunity to – across the breadth of what we do at Google to improve our experiences. Obviously, in search, we’ve been using AI for a while. It’s what has really helped lead search and search quality for the past few years using LLMs. We now have a chance to more natively use LLMs. And I think, I think the main way – and by the way, as I said in my remarks, we are going to be deliberate. We’re going to – our North Star is getting it right for users. So we will iterate and innovate as we’ve always done. The main area maybe I’m excited by is we do know from experience that users come back to search, they follow-on. They are engaging back on stuff they already did. And so for us, to use LLMs in a way we can serve those use cases better, I think it’s a real opportunity. Obviously, if it’s YouTube, the chance to really improve experiences for creators and consumers in terms of how the videos are viewed, etcetera, I think you can expect changes. Workspace, we already have changes rolling out, and it’s an area where I think we will see the biggest advances because I think productivity is a strong use case in which generative AI can help. And obviously, on Cloud, this has been an important moment as pretty much every organization is thinking about how to use AI to drive transformation. And so across the board, from start-ups to large companies, they are engaging with us. And so I view it as a point of inflection there as well.

One is, as I noted, we have a number of efficiency efforts underway, and one of them is about using AI and automation to further improve productivity across Alphabet. That being said, we already have AI in a lot of what we do, for example, in the way we operate and run the finance organization, it’s helpful in a lot of the analytics that we use. And one of the exciting things for us is the opportunity then to share that with Cloud customers. And Sundar just noted what we are doing within Google Workspace. We obviously all live on Google Workspace. And so that’s another example of how we benefit internally from the productivity from AI, but it’s also something that’s available for users and enterprise customers more broadly. And then finally, one of the areas that we’ve talked about is the opportunity with our compute capacity and all that we’ve done there and the infrastructure innovation, which, again, is helpful internally for what we do, but on behalf of our customers.",218.0,78.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.01282051282051282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0641025641025641

Sundar, just as you think about integrating Bard into your search products over time, can you just talk more about what percentage of search queries you think would utilize large language model-type responses? And how should we think about the cost of running search on these models relative to today? And then, Ruth, I was just hoping you could follow-up on your comment on CapEx. Maybe if you could help us understand the modest step-up in CapEx relative to 3 months ago?

But we will be bringing LLM experiences more natively into search as well. I do think, first of all, on – we will be rolling it out in an incremental way so that we can test it, create and innovate. So I think we will approach it that way. I think overall, I think it can apply to a broad range of queries. So I think I’m excited that it can allow us to better help users in a category of queries, maybe in which there was no right answer, and they are more creative, etcetera. So I think those are opportunities. But even in our existing query categories, where we get a chance to do some heavy lifting for the users and use AI to better give – guide them, I think you will see us exploring in those directions as well. It’s early days, but I think there is a lot of innovation to come. On the cost side, we have always – costs of compute has always been a consideration for us. And if anything, I think it’s something we have developed extensive experience over many, many years. And so for us, it’s a nature of habit to constantly drive efficiencies in hardware, software and models across our fleet. And so this is not new. If anything, the sharper the technology curve is, we get excited by it because I think we have built world-class capabilities in taking that and then driving down cost sequentially and then deploying it at scale across the world. So I think we will take all that into account in terms of how we drive innovation here and – but I’m comfortable with how we will approach it.",301.0,132.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.07575757575757576,0.0,0.007575757575757576,0.0,0.0,0.07575757575757576

Ads on Shorts are now available via video action app, Discovery and Performance Max campaigns and via product feeds. Shorts also are shoppable. Again, we are the only destination where creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats and screens with multiple ways to make a living.

So, I think I am going to start and address what I heard as the second question, as we are looking at higher cost of capital in this environment, what – how does that affect the way we are looking at Other Bets. Hopefully, we heard you correctly, it was crackling. Look, I think as we have talked about repeatedly, as it relates to Other Bets, our focus is to use deep technology to drive innovation, and we are very focused on the pace of investment and financial returns. That has been a consistent focus to generate attractive returns. And I think the core operating models and the long-term operating models are going to be the most relevant as we are looking at the returns we can generate. Yes, absolutely mindful of higher cost of capital. But I think its core, we are looking at what’s the value creation and the return on those. And as we indicated when we went through the reduction in force, we similarly worked across the Other Bets and some of them as they are on a path to ongoing growth, we were moderating what is the expense trajectory there as we are looking at what’s the overall return on invested capital. And we are continuing to work on these to make sure that we are delivering value it. Your point is an important one that’s part of a broader question about the underlying operating assumptions.",256.0,105.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01904761904761905,0.01904761904761905,0.009523809523809525,0.0,0.0,0.0

On the first part, again, it didn’t come across quite clearly, but I hope I understood correctly. In Search, revenues grew modestly year-over-year, again, reflecting an increase in the retail and travel verticals, offset partially by decline in finance and media and entertainment. So, excluding the impact of FX performance, it was actually similar to last quarter. The ongoing performance of Search, notwithstanding the headwinds, reflects really Search’s resilience with the, I would say, ability of Search to surface demand and deliver a measurable ROI in an uncertain environment. I called out the key verticals in the quarter. There is really no additional color on other verticals. I would say maybe more broadly, what we saw reflects what’s being reported elsewhere, and across the headlines, many companies are very focused on shorter term profitability amidst this uncertainty and some pullback at budgets as well.",150.0,82.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.012195121951219513,0.012195121951219513,0.036585365853658534,0.012195121951219513,0.0,0.0

I think Philipp, you talked about kind of a more of a pullback in network ad revenue versus Search and YouTube. Do you have any thoughts on why that was the case? And then Ruth, the cloud business, even with the accounting changes on this very steady march towards profitability, you turned the corner now. You talked about growing the business for long-term profitability. But are there any reasons why we wouldn’t – why they shouldn’t be sustainably profitable kind of starting from here as the business continues to scale, or could it be that, that profitability could be wobbly for a while before it’s sustainably profitable that segment cloud?

So, in network, really, it’s a continuation of what we talked about last quarter. We saw the ongoing pullback in advertiser spend. And I would contrast that last quarter, we talked about both a pullback in YouTube and network, and we were pleased that we saw the stabilization in ad spend on a sequential basis in YouTube. We still saw ongoing pullback in network, which tends to be a mix of businesses, as you know well. And then in terms of cloud, I tried to make that clear in my opening comments as well. I think it’s a really important question. We are very pleased with the Q1 results. And as both Sundar and I noted, we are intensely focused on all elements of the cost space and the long-term path to attractive profitability. At the same time, I think at the core of your question, and what we were trying to convey is we will continue to invest to support long-term growth, in particular, given the opportunities we see delivering AI capabilities to our customers.

And so both getting access to pool talent so that they can work together in a coordinated way and definitely will help us pool our computational resources too, which is going to be critical and will help us build. The core product is obviously building more capable models safely and responsibly and doing it taking into account all the capabilities our customers need, both on the consumer side and the cloud side and being able to iterate and getting that virtuous cycle going.

I also talked earlier about the macro climate and how we have established. We can really drive value for retailers, even in challenging times, whether it’s online, offline, both. And we are helping them drive their business goals, meet customers wherever they choose to shop, and maybe a little more some key trends here. Retailers are increasingly focused on maintaining margins and driving ROI right now. PMax, broad manage were key levers providing more incremental conversions, while insights on bids and budgets are really helping retailers identify opportunities for growth and efficiencies across our suite of products. I have talked at length on prior calls about omnichannel. Our local and omnichannel solutions are helping bridge the gap here between online and offline by using AI to reach nearby shoppers, promote local inventory, fulfillment options, optimize in-store visits and sales, for example. And then to help really retain loyal customers and acquiring new ones, we have YouTube app deep linking and new customer acquisition goals in PMax are helping here, making checkouts easy with tools like virtual cards on Chrome is obviously important. So, those are just some of the key points.

It's an important hub for us, and I'm excited to spend time with our local teams, including Google DeepMind as well as leaders and partners from across the region. This quarter, we shared great progress at I/O, Brandcast and Google Marketing Live, and we are looking forward to Cloud Next in August. The momentum across the Company drove our results this quarter. We delivered solid performance in Search and YouTube and ongoing strong growth in Cloud, where we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we continue our important work to operate more efficiently, creating durable savings to fund investments in our biggest priorities. Today, I'll talk about this momentum, including our continued leadership in AI and our excitement about the evolution of Search. At I/O, we shared how we are making AI helpful for everyone in four important ways: first, improving knowledge and learning. This is our seventh year as an AI-first company, and we intuitively know how to incorporate AI into our products. Large language models make them even more helpful, models like PaLM 2 and soon Gemini, which we are building to be multimodal. These advances provide an opportunity to reimagine many of our products, including our most important product, Search. We are in a period of incredible innovation for Search, which has continuously evolved over the years. This quarter saw our next major evolution with the launch of the Search Generative Experience, or SGE, which uses the power of generative AI to make search even more natural and intuitive. User feedback has been very positive so far. It can better answer the queries people come to us with today, while also unlocking entirely new types of questions that Search can answer. For example, we found that generative AI can connect the dots for people as they explore a topic or project, helping them weigh multiple factors and personal preferences before making a purchase or booking a trip. We see this new experience as another jumping off point for exploring the web, enabling users to go deeper to learn about a topic. I'm proud of the engineering excellence underlying our progress. Since the May launch, we've boosted serving efficiency, reducing the time it takes to generate AI snapshots by half. We'll deliver even faster responses over time. We are engaging with the broader ecosystem and will continue to prioritize approaches that send valuable traffic and support a healthy open web. Ads will continue to play an important role in this new search experience. Many of these new queries are inherently commercial in nature. We have more than 20 years of experience serving ads relevant to users' commercial queries, and SGE enhances our ability to do this even better. We are testing and evolving placements and formats and giving advertisers tools to take advantage of generative AI. Philipp will talk more about how we are using generative AI in our ads products to better serve both advertisers and users. Second, we are helping people use AI to boost their creativity and productivity. One example is Bard, our experiment in conversational AI. Since launching in March, it continues to get better. We rolled out a number of exciting features and capabilities earlier this month. Bard is now available in most of the world and over 40 of the most widely spoken languages. We also added Google Lens capabilities so you can take an image and ask all kinds of questions, turn it into code and more. This new feature has been really popular, and it's been great to see people sharing their experiences. Bard can now read its responses aloud, and you can adjust them for tone and style. We continue to see great interest in using Bard for coding tasks. On productivity, earlier this year, we introduced Duet AI in both Google Cloud and Workspace. It helps people collaborate with AI to code, write and get better insights from data and more. Today, more than 750,000 Workspace users have access to the new features in [preview] (ph). Third, we are making it easier for others to innovate using AI. One way is by providing Google Cloud's high-performance infrastructure, optimized for a range of generative AI models. It's being used by thousands of customers and partners to transform their businesses. I'll give an update on the cloud business in just a moment. Finally, we are making sure we develop and deploy AI technology responsibly so that everyone can benefit. Last week, we signed on to joint commitments with other leading AI companies at the White House, building on the principles that have guided our work for many years. To take advantage of the AI opportunities ahead, we have been sharpening our focus as a company, investing responsibly with great discipline and finding areas where we can operate more cost effectively. We have made good progress in data center machine efficiency, which will pay dividends as we continue to invest in AI. We continue to slow our expense growth and pace of hiring and ensure our teams are aligned to our highest priorities. This quarter, we reallocated a number of teams, including aligning Waze's ad sales with our existing business organization. We are combining various engineering efforts across core infrastructure and cloud. Products like Bard and SGE are being built by small fast-moving teams that have been reallocated to these high-priority efforts. Overall, we are actively moving people to higher priority activities within the Company, and we continue to optimize our real estate footprint for current and future needs. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued growth with Q2 revenue of $8 billion, up 28%, and operating profit of $395 million. Our AI-optimized infrastructure is a leading platform for training and serving generative AI models. More than 70% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers, including Cohere, Jasper, Typeface and many more. We provide the widest choice of AI supercomputer options with Google TPUs and advanced NVIDIA GPUs, and recently launched new A3 AI supercomputers powered by NVIDIA's H100. This enables customers like AppLovin to achieve nearly 2 times better price performance than industry alternatives. Our new generative AI offerings are expanding our total addressable market and winning new customers. We are seeing strong demand for the more than 80 models, including third-party and popular open source in our Vertex, Search and Conversational AI platforms with a number of customers growing more than 15x from April to June. Among them, Priceline is improving trip planning capabilities. Carrefour is creating full marketing campaigns in a matter of minutes. And Capgemini is building hundreds of use cases to streamline time-consuming business processes. Our new anti-money laundering AI helps banks like HSBC identify financial crime risk. And our new AI-powered Target and Lead identification suite is being applied at Cerevel to help enable drug discovery. Our generative AI capabilities also give us an opportunity to win new customers and upsell into our installed base of 9 million paying Google Workspace customers. I mentioned Duet AI earlier. Instacart is using it to improve customer service workflows. And companies like [Xtend] (ph) are scaling sales outreach and optimizing customer service. Customers confidently choose Workspace because of the safety and security we provide their distributed workforces. Our AI capabilities are helping us differentiate core products like cybersecurity. We have integrated AI throughout our portfolio, winning organizations like Pfizer who are using Google Cloud to transform their security operations. Chronicle Security operations suite with Mandiant fully integrated is helping customers stay protected at every stage of the security life cycle. In the first half of 2023, we saw a 35% increase in incident response engagements compared to the same period last year. Finally, our AI capabilities are also expanding our partner ecosystem with hundreds of ISVs and SaaS providers, such as Box, Salesforce and Snorkel and the world's largest consulting firms like Accenture and Deloitte. They've collectively committed to train more than 150,000 people on Google Cloud generative AI. Turning next to YouTube. Earlier this year, we shared that revenues across YouTube products were nearly $40 billion for the 12 months ending in March. I'm really pleased with how YouTube is growing audiences and driving increased engagement. YouTube Shorts are now watched by over 2 billion logged-in users every month, up from 1.5 billion just one year ago. The living room remained our fastest-growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time. We are reaching more than 150 million people on connected TV screens in the U.S. and seeing growth in momentum internationally. And on Subscriptions, there is good growth. Late last year, we announced over 80 million YouTube Music and Premium subscribers. Sign-ups for NFL Sunday Ticket kicked off in April, and we look forward to hosting our first football season on YouTube this fall. Finally, hardware and Android. Pixel continues to have strong sales momentum. We introduced new Pixel devices at I/O, including Pixel Fold, Pixel Tablet and Pixel 7A, and we've had a great response. Android 14, our latest OS, will incorporate our advances in generative AI to personalize Android phones. The Pixel and Android teams are working together to advance the latest devices. The Pixel Fold is a great example with its many hardware and software innovations. Before I close, you may have seen that we just announced some exciting news that Ruth is taking on the important new role of President and Chief Investment Officer. As our longest-serving CFO, she has helped guide the company through an amazing period of growth, a global pandemic and the ongoing economic uncertainty that has followed. I'm excited to continue to work with Ruth, who will lead our 2024 planning and remain as CFO while we do a full search for a successor. So, it's business as usual now and no change in approach for the future. I look forward to seeing the impact Ruth will have in our new role, driving our investments, engaging with our stakeholders and creating opportunities for people and communities everywhere. To close, I'm energized by the pace of innovation and the momentum across the Company. With 15 products that each serve 0.5 billion people and 6 that serve over 2 billion each, we have so many opportunities to deliver on our mission. Thank you to our employees around the world for their great work this quarter.

Let's jump right into our performance for the quarter. Google Services revenues of $66 billion were up 5% year-on-year. In Google Advertising, Search and Other revenues grew 5% year-on-year, led by solid growth in the retail vertical. In YouTube ads, revenues were up 4% year-on-year, driven by growth in brand, followed by direct response, reflecting further stabilization in advertiser spend. In Network, revenues declined 5% year-on-year. Google Other revenues were up 24% year-on-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues. Let's now take a few minutes to cover our 3 key priority areas: Google AI, Retail and YouTube, which I've laid out in prior quarters as clear opportunities for long-term advertising growth. I'll then turn it over to Ruth for more details on our financial performance. Q2 was a big quarter for Google AI and our ads products. I/O, GML and Brandcast were a testament to our deep commitment to building cutting-edge tools and solutions that help businesses navigate complexity in real time and deliver the results they need, all while improving the experience for users. Sunder covered some of these innovations. I'll share more. It's worth reiterating that while generative AI is now supercharging new and existing ads products with tons of potential ahead, AI has been at the core of our ads business for years. In fact, today, nearly 80% of advertisers already use at least one AI-powered search ads product. Our approach to AI and ads remains grounded in understanding what drives real value for businesses right now and what's most helpful for users. Advertisers tell us they're looking for more assistive experience to get set up with us faster. So at GML, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads powered by a LLM tuned specifically from ads data to make campaign construction easier than ever. Advertisers also tell us they want help creating high-quality ads that work in an instant. So, we're rolling out a revamped asset creation flow in Performance Max that helps customers adapt and scale their most successful creative concepts in a few clicks. And there's even more with PMax. We launched a new asset insights and new search term insights that improve campaign performance understanding and new customer life cycle goals that led advertisers optimize for new and existing customers while maximizing sales. We've long said it's all about reaching the right customer with the right creative at the right time. So later this year, automatically created assets, which are already generating headlines and descriptions for search ads, will start using generative AI to create assets that are even more relevant to customer queries. Broad match also got updates. AI-based keyword prioritization ensures the right keyword, bid, budget, creative and landing page is chosen when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible. And then to make it easier for advertisers to optimize visual storytelling and drive consideration in the mid funnel, we're launching two new AI part ad solutions, Demand Gen and Video View campaigns, and both will include Shorts inventory. Sundar talked earlier about SGE and our early experiments with new ad formats. We're in active conversations with advertisers, publishers and partners to get their input on how to make these solutions work best for them and are excited to test and evolve this experience as we learn more. Let's pivot to Retail, where we had a good quarter. Profitability remains a top theme for retailers, so solutions like PMax that drive bottom line value continue to do well. We also continue to see success in helping businesses unlock efficient growth and deliver on their omnichannel goals. Take Ace Hardware, who tapped into AI-powered search and omnibidding to capture increased seasonal demand leading up to Memorial Day. This drove increases across online sales, store visits and in-store sales, resulting in 87% year-over-year growth in omni revenue from Google Ads and led to one of the largest revenue weeks ever for Ace store owners. Q2 also brought innovation on the consumer and merchant front. We've rolled out a new gen AI-powered virtual try-on tool that brings the fitting room experience online. Shoppers can try on women's tops across a wide array of models from brands like Anthropologie, Everlane, H&M and Loft. Rich, visual engaging content is a win-win for both consumers and merchants. In fact, product offers with more than one image see a 76% average increase in impressions and a 32% increase in clicks. Our new product studio uses gen AI to help retailers create tailored eye-catching imagery for free, and we are working towards optimizing for performance. We think this will be a game changer, especially for SMBs who can now create high-quality images to use both across Google and their own sites without spending a lot of time or money. As we continue to make Google a valuable place for merchants to grow their businesses and connect with users, Merchant Center Next is another win. We've seen 2x growth in the number of businesses using Merchant Center in the past two years. And we're now simplifying it by automating inventory management and giving a consolidated view of performance insights. Better tools means better growth for merchants and better experiences for users. Moving to YouTube. I've said it before, I'll say it again: YouTube starts with our Creators, and it's their success and our multi-format strategy that will drive YouTube's long-term growth. In prior quarters, I've laid out how we think about this. Enabling our Creators to make a living on our platform with more formats and awesome tools leads to more content, which leads to quality consumption of video content, another big focus of the team. And this leads to better opportunities for monetization and for advertisers to support this incredible ecosystem. As we think about growth, we're focused on Shorts, Connected TV and our subscription offerings, all of which grew nicely this quarter. Let me double-click into Shorts and CTV. First, Shorts. Momentum remains strong. Watch time and monetization are moving in the right direction. Last year, we introduced ads on Shorts to help drive performance in direct response campaigns. We have video action, Performance Max and ad campaigns. As of Q2, brand advertisers can start testing Shorts ads and awareness campaigns. It's still early days, but we're excited by the results. LANEIGE, Amorepacific's number one premium skin care brand, was an early adopter. It leaned into video reach campaigns and new creative over a 10-day test to drive a 21% increase in unique users reached from Shorts and in Feed, all in a more efficient CPM. Second, Connected TV. Substantial engagement by viewers and ROI for advertisers is driving monetization of the living room. We are very pleased with the growth we've seen and how we're delivering the reach, results and relevance that businesses are looking for at scale. At Brandcast, we announced two new ad offerings for streaming. First, 30-second unskippable ads are coming to YouTube Select, which is landing 70% plus of impressions on the TV screen. 30-second ads are a TV industry staple, and now YouTube is bringing our advanced audience capabilities and unparalleled reach to the format. We're also exploring new pause experiences so brands can drive awareness or action when you hit pause. Looking at YouTube holistically, according to our measurement partners, Nielsen, TransUnion and Ipsos MMA, YouTube delivers higher ROI than TV and other online video on average. Take The Hershey Company. As part of a multiyear partnership to optimize its YouTube strategy, Hershey's brands have been tapping into CTV, efficient AI-powered formats and Made for Platform creative, leading to YouTube becoming its number one ROI driving media partner, producing a 65% plus increase in ROI from 2018 to 2023. One last highlight that bridges the power of YouTube with our continued efforts to bring the best across Google to our partners. With Warner Bros. Discovery, we expanded our multiyear relationship across our entire Android ecosystem, including partnering on the launch of Max, a deepened mutually beneficial relationship on Google TV, and plans to work together on new surfaces. YouTube's expanded deal for Max, inclusive of a Max NFL Sunday Ticket bundle on YouTube TV, also underscores our joint commitment to bring the highest quality content and experiences to our customers. I'll close by echoing Sundar with a huge thank you to Googlers everywhere for their incredible passion and hard work and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust.

I'm very excited about the new role, and I look forward to it. So, turning to the results. We're very pleased with our financial results for the second quarter, which reflect an acceleration of growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $74.6 billion, up 7% or up 9% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. Total cost of revenues was $31.9 billion, up 6%, driven by other cost of revenues of $19.4 billion, which was up 8%. Growth here was driven by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube subscription offerings, followed by hardware costs associated with Pixel family launches in the second quarter. As noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we discussed last quarter. Operating expenses were $20.9 billion, up 4%. Operating income was $21.8 billion, up 12%, and our operating margin was 29%. I will cover our expense and margin performance in our outlook. Other income and expense was $65 million. Net income was $18.4 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $21.8 billion in the second quarter and $71 billion for the trailing 12 months, reflecting improved operating performance as well as the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023 as noted in our earnings release. We ended the quarter with $118 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to our segment results. Prior period results have been recast for two changes that we made as of the first quarter. First, DeepMind is now reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. Second, we updated our cost allocation methodologies. In the second quarter, we then combined the Brain team from Google Research with DeepMind to form Google DeepMind. Costs associated with the Brain team, which were previously included in Google Services, are now reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. We have not recast prior period results to reflect this additional change. Within Google Services, revenues were $66.3 billion, up 5%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $42.6 billion in the quarter were up 5%, led by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were up 4%, driven by brand advertising, followed by direct response, reflecting further stabilization in spending by advertisers. Network advertising revenues of $7.9 billion were down 5%. Other revenues were $8.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, primarily from subscription growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV, followed by growth in hardware revenues, primarily driven by the launch of the Pixel 7a in the second quarter. Finally, Play returned to positive growth in the second quarter. TAC was $12.5 billion, up 3%. Google Services operating income was $23.5 billion, up 8%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $8 billion for the quarter, up 28%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries and products. That being said, we saw a continued moderation in the rate of consumption growth as consumers optimize their spend. Google Workspace strong revenue growth was driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $395 million and the operating margin was 5%. As to our Other Bets, for the second quarter, revenues were $285 million, and the operating loss was $813 million. The decrease in operating loss was primarily driven by a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising. We were pleased with the acceleration of Search advertising revenue growth in the second quarter. Our continued ability to generate sustained growth reflects our unparalleled engineering innovation that creates extraordinary experiences for users and capabilities for advertisers and delivered with the deep expertise of our go-to-market team. And in YouTube, we saw ongoing signs of stabilization in advertiser spending. We are prioritizing product focus on increasing quality consumption of video content with both Shorts and in the living room, which is translating into improved monetization. Second, within other revenues. In our YouTube subscription products, the sustained, strong growth in revenues reflects significant subscriber growth. You may have seen that last week, we increased subscription prices for YouTube Music and Premium, which underscores the value of the products. Strong year-on-year growth in hardware revenues was due, in large part, to a timing change given the Pixel 7a was launched in the second quarter, whereas the Pixel 6a launch occurred in the third quarter last year. Looking ahead, the launch timing change will be a headwind to hardware revenue growth in the third quarter. Play returned to positive growth in the second quarter, driven primarily by a solid increase in the number of buyers. Turning to Google Cloud. We are particularly excited about the customer interest in our AI-optimized infrastructure, our large language models, our AI platform services and our new generative AI offerings such as Duet AI for Google Workspace, although we are still clearly in the early days. At the same time, we continue to experience headwinds in the second quarter for moderation in consumption growth as customers optimize their spend. We continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth. In terms of expenses and profitability, we remain very focused on durably reengineering our cost base. Most evident to date are the actions we have taken to reduce the pace of headcount growth, including the workforce reductions we announced in the first quarter and a slower pace of organic hiring, in part given our focus on reallocating talent from within to fuel our growth priorities. A quick comment on the sequential improvement in operating margins in the second quarter. There are two factors to note. First, the benefit from an acceleration in search advertising revenue growth in the second quarter. Second, the vast majority of the charges related to our workforce reduction and optimization of our global office space were taken in Q1. Finally, as it relates to CapEx, in Q2, the largest component was for servers, which included a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute. The sequential step up in the second quarter was lower than anticipated for two reasons. First, with respect to office facilities, we continue to moderate the pace of fit-outs and ground-up construction to reflect the slower expected pace of headcount growth. Second, there were delays in certain data center construction projects. We expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure increasing through the back half of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024. The primary driver is to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet, including investments in GPUs and proprietary TPUs as well as data center capacity. With all that said, we remain committed to durably reengineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments in support of long-term, sustainable financial value. Thank you.

And what new behaviors or consumer utility are you most excited about as you think about what Gemini could provide for people over the course of the next year or so? And then the second one for Ruth. Ruth, congrats on the new position. One question just about the durable expense comment. I think last quarter, you talked about the idea that expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024. Is that still the right way to think about it? And just to confirm, does that include the impact of depreciation in those comments?

It's definitely early days, but both across Bard and Search Generative Experience, feedback has been very positive from our users. I think we are definitely now able to serve, I would say, deeper and broader information use cases, which is very exciting. I wouldn't say surprised. So for example, people are really using it to -- for coding, something we understood, but it's definitely on the new side. There's a lot of excitement around -- we integrated Google Lens into Bard. We have known how big Google Lens can be. We see that in the visual searches we get and how much it has grown over the last two years, and so we've been doing this for a while. But definitely, that, in Bard, has been super well received. So which gives me a sense that as -- given Gemini is being built from the ground up to be multimodal, I think that's an area that's going to excite users. When I go back many years ago when we did universal search, whenever, for users, we can abstract different content types and put them in a seamless way, they tend to receive it well.

We are really pleased with the operating performance in the second quarter.

And we do remain very focused on durably reengineering our cost base. There are a lot of stream -- work streams that are in flight, and I mentioned a couple of them in opening comments.

That would be number one. And then, Ruth, I'll echo Brian's congrats as well on the new role.

I would broadly say, the investments for AI, when you look at the type of deep computer science work, the talent we have worked hard to bring to the Company, and from the ground up, the infrastructure we have built from the earliest days, Google has been a company, we've thought about the switches in our data centers, wherever we think we can do the best and get an advantage by innovating, we have chosen to do so. We have done that on AI, on the silicon side. But what's important to us is really stay focused on our users and customers and support all the innovations that's needed. So for example, with cloud, we've been -- we've really embraced open architecture. We have embraced customers wanting to be multi-cloud when it makes sense for them. So similarly, you would see with AI, we will embrace -- we will offer not just our first-party models, we'll offer third-party models, including open source models. I think open source has a critical role to play in this ecosystem. Google contributes -- we are one of the largest contributors to -- if you look at Hugging Face and in terms of the contribution there, when you look at projects like Android, Chromium and so on, Kubernetes and so on. So, we'll embrace that and we'll stay at the cutting edge of technology, and I think that will serve us well for the long term. On the second part of your question, first of all, I'm very grateful and thankful to all the work that Ruth has done for the Company. It's too invaluable to capture in words. I am super thrilled that she's going to continue on an impactful new role. And the scale of our company, with the broad changes in technology, I think it's more important than ever before to engage on these issues globally at scale and advocate on the economic opportunity of the investments we make across Alphabet and Google. And I'm glad that she's going to continue as CFO. And so no changes there, and we'll take the time to find a successor, and Ruth will be closely involved, not just on that, but also our long-range planning, including 2024.

While it's exciting new technology, we've constantly been bringing in AI innovations into Search for the past few years, and this is the next step in that journey. But it is a big change, so we thought about from first principles. It really gives us a chance to now not always be constrained in the way Search was working before, allowed us to think outside the box. And I see that play out in the Experience. So I would say we are ahead of where I thought we'd be at this point in time. The feedback has been very positive. We've just improved our efficiency pretty dramatically since the product launch. The latency has improved significantly. We are keeping a very high bar, and -- but I would say we are ahead on all the metrics in terms of how we look at it internally and so couldn't be more pleased with it.

It is an exciting moment overall in Cloud because there is definitely a lot of interest from customers on AI, and they definitely are engaging in many more conversations with us.

Can you talk a bit about how you're visiting that R&D spend? Any near-term cadence updates you can give us for growth? And any factors that could change the growth going forward for research and development spending for you guys?

And taking that and applying it and building new products and services and generating value is the virtuous cycle. And nothing changes in that fundamental thesis. We are definitely, both -- as Ruth mentioned, on AI investments, we are going to be committed to making sure we invest to realize the opportunity. But all the work we are doing on efficiency and optimization applies to -- on the AI side as well. And so we're bringing all that lens there so that we do this responsibly.

Look, I can't comment on others, but our focus continues, obviously, to be helping customers through whatever uncertainty or complexity they're facing, and a lot of companies are focused on profitability, driving efficiencies, and they're carefully evaluating the effectiveness of their budgets. And our goal is really to help them maximize efficiency and drive strong ROI. And I think we have the proven AI-powered tools and solutions to actually do it.

AI is a foundational component that really allows us to help users advertise those pubs partners at scale. And we've been on a journey for years, right, to take the key components of advertising, whether it's bidding, targeting and creatives as well as innovation, frankly, in the core advertiser and publisher experiences and improve them dramatically through AI. And Performance Max is an example of how all this comes together at scale for advertisers. They provide us with a business goal, of assets, and we can then take care of the rest to meet consumer demand and really deliver on advertiser ROI. And as you heard it at GML, we've seen over many quarters, we continue to build new AI features really on top of this. I think I talked a bit in my prepared remarks about where we're taking some of our products from a gen AI perspective. And if you take a look at some of the things we announced there, it's fair to say, whether you look at our revamped asset creation flow in Performance Max, whether you look at Automatically Created Assets, whether you look at Product Studio and so on, there we're on a right path to deliver some really exciting new innovation in automated -- let me call it, asset creation in the broader sense.",233.0,113.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035398230088495575,0.008849557522123894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02654867256637168

Actually, I'll follow up on that last question, Philipp. You pointed out AI has been used to improve the advertising mousetrap at Google for many years. Do you view generative AI as just a material accelerant of your ability to improve return on ad spend for the millions of marketers who use Google? And if you think about where generative AI would have the most impact, could you peel it apart, what's your guess now over the next couple of years where it's going to have the most impact on the creative, on the audience creation, on the campaign optimization? Where do you think the most impact will come from generative AI, just for all the -- your advertising customers? Thanks.",124.0,50.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.06,0.02,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.04

And we're really helping advertisers here make better decisions, solve problems, enhance creativity. And I covered this earlier. For example, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads, the asset creation flow in PMax. I mentioned the Automatically Created Assets, the Product Studio and so on. When I talk to customers, they're very excited about AI, and understandably, have some questions. One of the top questions is, for example, what's the next best step I should take. And this is a key reason why we launched our Google Ads AI Essentials, which was a big announcement at GML. It's a checklist of simple steps customers can take right now to unlock the power of AI, and it has to do with the foundation of data and measurement. It has to do with taking action with our AI products and really is a mindset shift to set up organizations for AI success. So those are just some of the examples.

I'm pleased with our business results this quarter, which demonstrates strong growth in Search and YouTube and momentum in Cloud. Google turned 25 in September, which offered an opportunity to reflect on our progress over the last quarter century and to look ahead to the opportunities enabled by AI we are so excited and confident about. Our product momentum continued this quarter, as you saw with Cloud Next, Made on YouTube and Made by Google. It's all part of our focus on making AI more helpful for everyone, and we are making good progress across the four areas that we shared last quarter. First, improving knowledge and learning. This includes our work with the Search Generative Experience, which is our experiment to bring Generative AI capabilities into Search. We have learned a lot from people trying it, and we have added new capabilities, like incorporating videos and images into responses and generating imagery. We've also made it easier to understand and debug generated code. Direct user feedback has been positive with strong growth and adoption. In August, we opened up availability to India and Japan with more countries and languages to come. As we add features and expand into new markets, we are engaging with the broader ecosystem and will continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users, send valuable traffic to publishers, and support a healthy open Internet. With Generative AI applied to Search, we can serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. We are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered. Of course, ads will continue to play an important role in this new Search experience. People are finding ads helpful here as they provide useful options to take action and connect with businesses. We'll experiment with new formats native to SGE that use Generative AI to create relevant high-quality ads customized to every step of the Search journey. The second area we are focused on is boosting creativity and productivity. Bard is particularly helpful here. It's a direct interface to a conversational LLM, and we think of it as an early experiment and complementary experience to Google Search. Bard can now integrate with Google apps and services, showing relevant information from Workspace, Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and Hotels. We've also improved the Google it feature. It provides other sources to help people evaluate Bard's responses and explore information across the web. Earlier this month, we announced Assistant with Bard, a personal assistant powered by Generative AI. It combines Bard's generative and reasoning capabilities with Assistant's personalized help. You can interact with it through text, voice, or images, and in the coming months, you'll be able to opt in on Android and iOS mobile devices. Our collaborative tools in Workspace and YouTube are also part of how we boost creativity and productivity, and they are seeing great initial traction. Third, we are enabling developers, businesses, and other organizations to build their own transformative products and services. For example, thousands of customers and partners are already using Google Cloud to capture the potential of AI and we'll share more there in a minute. And fourth, we are building and deploying AI responsibly, so that everyone can benefit. One area we are focused on is making sure people can more easily identify when they are encountering AI-generated content online. Using new technology powered by Google DeepMind SynthID, images generated by Vertex AI can be watermarked in a way that is invisible to the human eye without reducing the image quality. Underlying all this work is the foundational research done by our teams at Google DeepMind and Google Research. We are excited to roll out more of what they've been working on soon. As we expand access to our new AI services, we continue to make meaningful investments in support of our AI efforts. We remain committed to durably re-engineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments in support of long-term sustainable financial value. Across Alphabet, teams are looking at ways to operate as effectively as possible focused on their biggest priorities. Turning next to YouTube, which saw solid momentum in both its ads and subscription businesses in Q3. NFL Sunday Ticket is now live and receiving excellent reviews. Fans love our multi-view feature, which can live stream up to four games on a single screen. We’ve heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and live stream reliability. This is a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence and at scale. I'm really pleased with the growth and engagement on YouTube Shorts. We continue to work on closing the monetization gap here. Shorts now average over 70 billion daily views and are watched by over 2 billion signed-in users every month. At Made on YouTube in September, we announced new tools that make it easier to create engaging content. Dreamscreen is an experimental feature that allows creators to add AI-generated video or image backgrounds to shorts. And YouTube Create is a new mobile app with a suite of production tools for editing shorts, longer videos, or both. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued growth with Q3 revenue of $8.4 billion, up 22%. Today, more than 60% of the world's 1,000 largest companies are Google Cloud customers. At Cloud Next, we showcased amazing innovations across our entire portfolio of infrastructure, data and AI, workspace collaboration, and cybersecurity solutions. We offer advanced AI-optimized infrastructure to train and serve models at scale. And today, more than half of all funded Generative AI startups are Google Cloud customers. This includes AI21 Labs, Contextual, Elemental Cognition, Rytr, and more. We continue to provide the widest choice of accelerator options. Our A3 VMs powered by NVIDIA's H100 GPU are generally available, and we are winning customers with Cloud TPU v5e, our most cost efficient and versatile accelerator to date. On top of our infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform helps customers build, deploy, and scale AI-powered applications. We offer more than 100 models, including popular third-party and open source models, as well as tools to quickly build, search, and conversation use cases. From Q2 to Q3, the number of active Generative AI projects on Vertex AI grew by 7x, including Highmark Health, which is creating more personalized member materials. Duet AI was created using Google's leading large foundation models and especially trained to help users to be more productive on Google Cloud. We continue expanding its capabilities and integrating it across a wide range of cloud products and services. With Duet AI, we are helping leading brands like PayPal and Deutsche Bank boost developer productivity. And we are enabling retailers like Aritzia and Gymshark to gain new insights for better and faster business results. In fact, companies are increasingly using AI for the purpose of analyzing data. And customers are choosing Google Cloud because we are the only large cloud provider with a unified platform to analyze structured and unstructured data. In Workspace, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duet AI. They are writing and refining content in Gmail and Docs, creating original images from text within slides, organizing data in Sheets and more. These innovations enable us to provide new services and grow our base of 10 million paying customers, including enterprises like Grupo Boticario, Unilever and Warner Music. We also integrated Duvet AI across our cybersecurity portfolio to differentiate in the marketplace, providing Generative AI-powered assistance in Mandiant Threat Intelligence, Chronicle Security Operations, and Security Command Center. This reduces the time security teams spend writing, running, and refining searches by seven times. We are the only leading security provider that combines frontline intelligence and expertise, a modern security operations platform, and a trusted cloud foundation, all infused with Generative AI, helping protect customers and partners like BT, Jack Henry & Associates, and CoverMyMeds. Turning to hardware. We unveiled our new products this month. We introduced our new Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Pixel Watch 2 to very positive consumer feedback and reviews. Pixel is the fastest growing smartphone brand in our top markets and the only one that grew in units sold year-over-year. Our portfolio of Pixel products are brought to life, thanks to our combination of foundational technologies, AI, Android, and Google Tensor. Google Tensor G3 is the third generation of our tailor-built chip. It's designed to power transformative experiences by bringing the latest in Google AI research directly to our newest phones. A new AI-powered editing features in Google Photos on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro remove distractions, generate the best shot from multiple images and reduce distracting sounds in videos. Pixel and our third-party ecosystem are powered by Android. We just released Android 14 with more accessibility features. I also want to mention Chromebook Plus, a new category which provides the best of Chrome on great hardware with built-in Google Apps and powerful AI capabilities. We also shared that Chromebooks will now get regular automatic updates for 10 years, more than any other operating system. In Other Bets, Waymo is onboarding more riders to its commercial ride hailing service as it gradually adds over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist. Austin will follow as its next ride hail city. Wing and Walmart announced a new partnership to provide drone delivery service in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Before handing over to Philipp, I want to thank our employees around the world who are working to create innovative products and provide great services to people and businesses who use our products.

GOOGL,2023-10-24,2023-10-25,,2023-10-24,2023-10-24T16:30:00-04:00,0,2023-10-24,prepared,,Philipp Schindler,"Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. I'll start with our performance for the quarter and then give color into the three key priority areas for ads. Google AI, Retail and YouTube that we've identified on past calls as opportunities for long-term growth in advertising. Google Services revenues of $68 billion were up 11% year-on-year. In Google Advertising, Search and Other, revenues grew 11% year-on-year, led by solid growth in the Retail vertical. In YouTube Ads, revenues were up 12% year-on-year, driven by growth in both brand and direct response. In Network, revenues declined 3% year-on-year. Google Other revenues were up 21% year-on-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscription revenues. Let's start with Google AI. Recent dramatic advances in everything from foundational research models to LLM to Generative AI are improving our ability to deliver better performance and profitability for advertisers and more helpful, delightful experiences for users. We covered many innovations last quarter after GML, like our conversational experience in Google Ads, significant updates to Performance Max and new campaign types like Demand Gen. And as Sundar said, we're continuing to experiment with new ad formats on SGE. It's extremely important to us that in this new experience, advertisers still have the opportunity to reach potential customers along their Search journeys. I'll highlight more ways we're innovating with the best of Google AI as we double-click into our core business. In Retail, we had a great quarter. In a market where every dollar counts, our proven AI-powered solutions like Search and PMax are helping retailers drive reliable, strong ROI and meet customers wherever they are across the funnel. In Q3, we also started prepping retailers for what will be a long holiday season. Let me share some things. Number one, with a maximum number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and expectations for many micro peaks beyond Cyber-Five, we're arming businesses with insights and planning tools, including OptiScore and Performance Planner to uncover new opportunities, plan budgets and targets to stay competitive and be smarter with their inventory and pricing strategy. Number two. Consumer expectations are shifting, especially around price and convenience. We've seen 4x deals queries during the holidays versus other periods. 75% of users say they'll shop with those offering free shipping. Retailers are capitalizing on these trends with our differentiated merchant offerings like merchant promotions and fulfillment options. And we're making improvements to significantly boost the number of deals shown to shoppers in Search this holiday season. Look out for more in the coming days about new ways we'll help shoppers browse deals across the web this year. Number three. No surprise, omni-channel is the way to succeed. With our suite of omni product solutions, including local inventory ads, omnibidding, and PMax for store goals, retailers big and small, are capturing demand and incremental store budgets while engaging with high value customers. Innovation continues across our shopping and merchant experiences powered by Google AI. Our virtual try-on tool for apparel launched in June and has been a hit with consumers and brands. Users engage with virtual try-on images at a higher rate versus regular brand provided images. Product Studio is another launch from GML getting positive feedback in pilot mode. It uses the best of Gen.AI to help businesses create unique and tailored imagery for free that they can then scale across their channels. We're seeing early merchant testers using it to seasonalize their content for the holidays. Let's shift to YouTube. It's worth repeating, our intense focus on creator success coupled with our multi-format strategy are at the center of how we think about YouTube's long-term growth. Shorts, connected TV and our subscription offerings are key drivers here and we're investing across each to solidify YouTube's position as the best place to create, the best place to watch and the best place to deliver results. Sundar mentioned watch time and engagement momentum on shorts as well as our monetization progress. He also covered subscription growth and NFL Sunday Ticket. As for connected TV, we continue to be the number one overall streaming destination according to Nielsen. 150 million plus people are watching YouTube on CTV screens every month in the US. Whether it's music videos, NFL Sunday Ticket, free movies, shorts, a continuous stream of MrBeast or some other creator-led content, viewers want choice and variety, and we're giving it to them all in one place. And to help creators and advertisers connect with these billions of viewers across moments, screens, and formats, we're bringing Google AI to awesome new creation tools and ad solutions. AI will do wonders for creation and storytelling. From Dreamscreen and YouTube Create, which Sundar talked about, to features that audit up content in multiple languages, flip and trim existing assets, remix and clip videos, and more, we're just getting started. We're also helping brands break through at speed and scale across the funnel to drive results. Spotlight Moments launched last week. It uses AI to identify trending content around major cultural moments for brand sponsorship opportunities. There's video reach campaigns, which are expanding to in-feed and shorts and will be generally available in November. AI is helping advertisers find as many people as possible in their ideal audience for the lowest possible price. Early tests are delivering 54% more reach at 42% lower cost. And then with video view campaigns, AI is serving skippable ads across in-stream, in-feed, and shorts and helping advertisers earn the maximum number of views at the lowest possible cost. So far, they're driving 40% more views on average versus in-stream alone. Then for YouTube and other feed-based services, there's our new Demand Gen campaign, which launched in April, rolled out worldwide last week, and was designed for the needs of today's social marketers to engage people as they stream, scroll and connect. It combines video and image ads in one campaign with access to 3 billion users across YouTube and Google, and the ability to optimize and measure across the funnel using Google AI. Demand Gen is already driving success for brands like Samsung and Toyota. Before I wrap, one quick highlight on our close collaboration and commitment to our most important ecosystems and partners. In July, we launched Google News Showcase in the US, our curated online news experience and licensing program with more than 150 news publications, 90% of which are local or regional. Globally, over 2,500 news publications have signed onto News Showcase, and the product is live in 23 countries today. Our commitment to open access to news and information remains strong. With that, I'll end with a thank you to our customers and partners around the world for their continued trust and collaboration, and our Googlers everywhere for their incredible hard work and dedication. Ruth, over to you.",1166.0,640.0,31.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,10.0,3.0,2.0,0.0484375,0.0046875,0.0046875,0.0,0.003125,0.04375

My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were $76.7 billion, up 11% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.2 billion, up 7%, primarily reflecting other cost of revenues of $20.6 billion, which was up 6%. Growth here was primarily driven by content acquisition costs mainly for YouTube subscription offerings. As noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of the year. Operating expenses were $22.1 billion, up 6% reflecting the following. First, an increase in R&D expenses, driven primarily by compensation. Second, an increase in G&A expenses, reflecting the impact of charges related to legal matters. And finally, sales and marketing expenses, which were relatively flat to last year. Operating income was $21.3 billion, up 25%, and our operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was a loss of $146 million. Net income was $19.7 billion. This reflects an effective tax rate of 7% in the third quarter from an IRS change related to the use of foreign tax credits, which had an outsized impact on the third quarter rate because the change resulted in a catch-up for prior periods. We delivered free cash flow of $22.6 billion in the third quarter and $78 million for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $120 billion in cash and marketable securities. As a reminder, our cash balance and free cash flow in the second and third quarters benefited from the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023. As noted in our earnings release, on October 16, we made an estimated tax payment of $10.5 billion related to this deferral, which will be reflected in our cash balance and free cash flow in the fourth quarter. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $68 billion, up 11%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $44 billion in the quarter were up 11%, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion were up 12%, driven by both brand advertising and direct response. Network advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were down 3%. Other revenues were $8.3 billion, up 21%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues driven by subscriber growth in YouTube TV followed by YouTube Music Premium. TAC was $12.6 billion, up 7%. Google Services operating income was $23.9 billion, up 27% and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $8.4 billion for the quarter, up 22%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries and products, although the Q3 year-on-year growth rate reflects the impact of customer optimization efforts. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $266 million, and the operating margin was 3%. As to our Other Bets, for the third quarter, revenues were $297 million and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services. First, within advertising. After a period of historic volatility, we were pleased with the year-on-year revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising in the third quarter. Second, within other revenues, in our YouTube subscription products the substantial growth in revenues primarily reflects subscriber growth. Looking ahead, a full quarter of NFL Sunday Ticket revenues as well as associated content acquisition costs will be reflected in Q4 results compared to only a few weeks in the third quarter. Play had growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. With respect to hardware, there is a headwind to revenues in the fourth quarter, reflecting efforts to optimize the portfolio with tighter targeting of our go-to-market investments as well as the ongoing impact from the difference in launch timing for the Pixel 6a and 7a that we mentioned last quarter. Turning to Google Cloud. We are pleased with the ongoing customer engagement with GCP and Workspace and the potential benefit of our AI solutions including infrastructure and services such as Vertex AI and Duet. We continue to invest aggressively given the significant potential we see while remaining focused on profitable growth. In terms of expenses and profitability, we're pleased with our operating performance. As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain focused on durably reengineering our cost base to create investment capacity to support our growth priorities, most important of which is with AI. We have a number of workstreams in place. First, we are maintaining a slower pace of headcount growth, reflecting product prioritization and reallocation of talent to support our most important growth opportunities. Second, we remain focused on optimizing our real estate footprint, including how and where we work to reduce our expense growth. As you can see from our earnings release, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and depreciation in the third quarter related to these actions. Third, we have engineering work streams underway to improve productivity across Alphabet. Given the magnitude of investment in our technical infrastructure, we have a superb team focused on efficiency of our operations there. We are also making progress in streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI. Finally, there are ongoing workstreams that are improving the efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization. And to be clear, across the portfolio of other bet companies, we have also been working to identify opportunities to create sharper focus and to operate more efficiently and effectively. With respect to sequential quarter-on-quarter trends, two further points. First, cost of sales in the fourth quarter will reflect both higher hardware costs given Pixel family launches as well as increased CAC for YouTube as previously noted. Second, as usual, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year, in part to support product launches in the holiday season. Finally, our reported CapEx in Q3 was $8 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers, followed by data centers, reflecting a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute. The growth in reported cash CapEx in Q3 is somewhat muted due to the timing of supplier payments, which can cause variability from quarter-to-quarter. We continue to invest meaningfully in the technical infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet and expect elevated levels of investment, increasing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024. In closing, we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead and committed to deliver sustainable financial value. Thank you.

There's somewhat of an investor debate about sort of the incremental return on capital to Search when it comes to AI. I know it's early, but are there any examples that you're seeing with SGE or Bard on higher utility, higher conversion rates, more engagement, just something to sort of show signal around the return that could come from these investments? And the second one, Ruth, I know you've spoken a lot about durably reengineering the cost base. I think in the past, you've talked about how expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024. Is that sort of still the high-level way to think about it or is that potentially changing a bit as investments are continuing?

Through it all, we are making sure the product works well, and we are generating value for our ecosystem, and that adds transition as well.

I'm very excited at the progress there and as we're working through getting the model ready. To me, more importantly, we are just really laying the foundation of what I think of as the next generation series of models we'll be launching throughout 2024. The pace of innovation is extraordinarily impressive to see. We are creating it from the ground-up to be multimodal, highly efficient tool and API integrations and more importantly, laying the platform to enable future innovations as well. And we are developing Gemini in a way that it is going to be available at various sizes and capabilities, and we'll be using it immediately across all our products internally as well as bringing it out to both developers and cloud customers through Vertex. So I view it as a journey and each generation is going to be better than the other, and we are definitely investing and the early results are very promising. On Cloud, maybe what I would say is, overall, we had definitely started seeing customers looking to optimize spend. We leaned into it to help customers given some of the challenges they were facing. And so that was a factor. But we are definitely seeing a lot of interest in AI. There are many, many projects underway now, just on Vertex alone, the number of projects grew over 7x.

And I wanted to know if we could get your updated thoughts on how AI might impact the broader advertising industry and how you're aligning Alphabet in Google's goals with AI and where it might take the advertising industry in the years ahead? That would be the first question. And then about a year ago, Philipp and Ruth started talking about some of the brand advertising headwinds that YouTube was facing. As we start to lap those headwinds, how should we be thinking about a broad recovery in brand advertising versus elements of still headwinds that are being faced in the broader ad space, specifically with YouTube?

It gives advertisers really maximum performance across all inventory from, one, really AI-powered campaign, and it's probably the ultimate example of AI in action across our ads product. It's delivering excellent ROI. Those using it achieve like on average, over 18% more conversions at a similar cost per action. So since rolling it out about two years ago, we've continued to expand the features, give advertisers additional ways to steer how it works. There are a lot of things like account level, negative keywords, other details here. We launched new life cycle goals, customer life cycle goals, we call them revamped asset creation flow. That really helps business adapt and scale the most successful creatives. I think that's one to watch. We will also continue to build other new PMax features based on all the advertiser feedback we're seeing. So we're very, very encouraged by the progress here. Overall, maybe there was a second part to your question a bit on what we're hearing from the customers out there, look, driving ROI and efficiency is still top of mind for many, right? It's a rapidly shifting and still quite unpredictable consumer landscape out there. Our AI tools are very well received. AI, Gen AI are top of mind for everybody, really. There's a ton of excitement, lots of questions about it. Many understand the value. Nearly 80% of our advertisers already use at least one AI-powered search ads product. And yeah, we're hearing a lot of good feedback on, number one, our ads AI essentials, which are really helping to unlock the power of AI and set up for durable ROI growth on the advertiser side. This is -- those are products like the foundation for data and measurement, things like Google Tag, Consent Mode and so on. And obviously, Search and PMax we talked about it and then all the Gen AI products, all those different ones.

But very much to your question, yes, there was a stabilization in spending by advertisers. We're really pleased about that. We're particularly pleased about the ongoing performance in the Living Room and on Shorts. And as I said, that's both watch time growth and monetization I'd say the other thing benefiting YouTube is the retail strength we talked about with Search, retail strength in APAC in both Search and YouTube, and that really began in the second quarter, continued in the third quarter, but that was another contributor.

Two, if I can, First, as we just think about the rollout of SGE across the user base, like how far along is that? And how do you balance the product rollout and consumer uptake versus monetization in that transition? And then the second one, also sort of Generative AI related. How quickly are you guys finding new ways of optimizing whether that's shrinking model sizes, chip efficiencies or anything else?

It improves the experience and -- but there are areas to improve, which we are fine tuning. Our true north here is getting at the right user experience we want to and pretty comfortable seeing the trajectory. And we've always worked through these transitions, be it from desktop to mobile, or from now mobile to an AI-enhanced experience. And so it's nothing new, and I feel very comfortable that as we go through it, the strength of our teams, both on the organic side as well as ad side to drive the right experience for users, including ads will pay dividends. So -- and I think we'll continue to make improvements and make progress there. On your second question, at a high level, I would say, all through the -- we just celebrated 25 years and of all the things I was proud about when I looked at the strength of the work we have done across our infrastructure as a company, our technical infrastructure as a company and various given stages at a given moment in time, when we adopted new generations of technology, we have looked at the cost of it. But then the curves, the efficiency curves we have driven on top of it has always been phenomenal to see. And I see the current moment is no different. Already through this year, we are driving significant efficiencies, both in our models, in training costs and serving costs and our ability to adapt what's needed to the right use case.

And then in terms of the second question, Sunday Ticket, the only thing I tried to call out there is that clearly, this is the first full quarter of Sunday Ticket that is contributing overall to the subscription revenues that we see.

They always look for it in many, many different ways. We've given the product search example. People can directly go to Amazon as an example or come to Google. So if you zoom back and take an information view of the world, there's always been many different ways to get it. And part of our work we do in making Search be world-class and give users what they're looking for so that we can get it as much of that intent as possible. So I don't see that changing. With mobile, there were more ways people could get information, but we worked out to make Search work better in the mobile world. And similarly, a view with AI, there'll be many ways people get information, but it also offers us an opportunity in Search and in Assistant to take it to the next level and answer use cases, which we couldn't have done before and expand the diverse set of needs where we are sourced.

Our ads team is testing these APIs.

We also recently announced that in Q1 of '24, we plan to deprecate third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users, and this will support developers, obviously, in conducting their real-world experiments to assess the readiness and effectiveness of their products in this -- without third-party cookies.

I was trying to make the point that we are committed to meaningfully investing in CapEx, given all the opportunities we see. We do continue to expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. It it will be increasing in the fourth quarter and talked about some of the difference in timing, muted timing in the third quarter due to the timing of supplier payments and then try to make it clear that we will continue to grow CapEx in 2024 or more specifically to your question, 2024 aggregate CapEx will be above the full year 2023. So that was the main one. And then as it relates to Cloud, as Sundar said, what we're really excited about is the revenue growth does reflect healthy customer adoption across the portfolio, and that's infrastructure, data analytics, security. And so we’re -- I can't comment on others, but we feel good about where we're sitting here and looking forward, and we'll let you do the forecasting. DCP growth in the third quarter was above the growth rate for Cloud overall, and we feel really good about the work that they're doing there.

Our results reflect strong momentum and product innovation continuing into 2024. Today, I'm going to talk about four main topics. One, our investments in AI, including how it's helping search. Two, subscriptions which reached $15 billion in annual revenue, up 5x since 2019. Subscriptions is growing strongly, powered by YouTube Premium and Music, YouTube TV and Google One. Three, Cloud which crossed $9 billion in revenues this quarter and saw accelerated growth driven by our Gen AI and product leadership. And four, our investments and focus to meet the growth opportunities ahead. First, AI and Search. As you know, we have long led the way in using AI to improve many of our products from search to ads, to most of our consumer and enterprise products, helping billions of people already. Last year brought new excitement around Gen AI and I'm proud of how we responded, responsibly with deep advances in foundation models and a number of great launches. We closed the year by launching the Gemini era, a new industry-leading series of models that will fuel the next generation of advances. Gemini is the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind, bringing together our two world-class research teams. It's engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video and code in a natively multimodal way and it can run on everything from mobile devices to data centers. Gemini gives us a great foundation. It's already demonstrating state-of-the-art capabilities and it's only going to get better. Gemini Ultra is coming soon. The team is already working on the next versions and bringing it to our products. That starts with Search. We're already experimenting with Gemini in search where it's making our Search Generative Experience or SGE faster for users. We have seen a 40% reduction in latency in English in the U.S. I'm happy with what we are seeing in the earliest days of SGE, it's available through search labs in seven languages. By applying generative AI to Search, we are able to serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. People are finding it particularly useful for more complex questions like comparisons or longer queries. It's also helpful in areas where people are looking for deeper understanding such as education or even gift ideas. We are improving satisfaction including answers for more conversational and intricate queries. As I mentioned earlier, we are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page and will continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users and send valuable traffic to publishers. Beyond SGE, we are continuing to use AI to make searching more accessible and intuitive. Circle to Search, lets you search what you see on Android phones with a simple gesture without switching apps. It's available starting this week on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro and the new Samsung Galaxy S24 Series. And Lens now offers generative AI overviews. You can add text to a visual search to ask questions about anything you see and get AI-powered insights in the moment. In addition to Search, we are also seeing a lot of interest in our AI-powered solutions for advertisers. That includes our new conversational experience that uses Gemini to accelerate the creation of search campaigns. Then there is Bard, our conversational AI tool that complements search. It's now powered by Gemini Pro and is much more capable at things like understanding, summarizing, reasoning, coding and planning. It's now in over 40 languages and over 230 countries around the world. Looking ahead, we'll be rolling out an even more advanced version for subscribers powered by Gemini Ultra. That's a good segue to subscriptions. As I said earlier, it's now a $15 billion business annually. YouTube is the key driver of our subscription revenues. Available in over 100 countries and regions, YouTube Music and Premium have real momentum. They're engaging passionate users and driving great returns for the music industry and creators. YouTube TV is also doing well. We've had great consumer feedback on the viewing experience. People love the navigation, multi view and unlimited DVR. NFL Sunday Ticket has found it’s perfect home on YouTube and Philipp will talk about that more. Let me also talk about our subscription service, Google One. It's doing incredibly well with strong user growth. It provides expanded storage, unlocks exclusive features in Google products and allows us to build a strong relationship with our most engaged users. Google One is growing very well and we are just about to cross 100 million subscribers. From here, we are going to bring in more AI features and look forward to more strong growth to come. Next, Google Cloud. Throughout 2023, we introduced thousands of product advances, including broad Gen AI capabilities across our AI infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform and our new Duvet AI agents. In Q4, our product and Gen AI leadership enabled us to win and expand relationships with many leading brands including Hugging Face, McDonald's, Motorola Mobility and Verizon. Google Cloud offers our AI Hypercomputer, a groundbreaking supercomputing architecture that combines our powerful TPUs and GPUs, AI software and multi-slice and multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models. Customers like Anthropic, Character AI, Essential AI and Mistral AI are building and serving models on it. For developers building Gen AI applications, we offer Vertex AI, a comprehensive enterprise AI platform. It helps customers like Deutsche Telekom and Moody's discover, customize, augment and deploy over 130 Gen AI models, including PaLM, Med-PaLM, Sec-PaLM and Gemini, as well as popular open source and partner models. Vertex AI has seen strong adoption with the API request increasing nearly 6x from H1 to H2 last year. Using Vertex AI, Samsung recently announced its Galaxy S24 Series smartphone with Gemini and Imagen 2, our advanced text-to-image model. Shutterstock has added Imagen 2 to their AI image generator, enabling users to turn simple text prompts into unique visuals and Victoria's Secret & Company will look to personalize and improve the customer experience with Gemini, Vertex AI search and conversations. Customers are increasingly choosing Duvet AI, our packaged AI agents for Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform to boost productivity and improve their operations. Since its launch, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duvet AI. It will incorporate Gemini soon. In Workspace, Duvet AI is helping employees benefit from improved productivity and creativity at thousands of paying customers around the world, including Singapore Post, Uber and Woolworths. In Google Cloud Platform, Duvet AI assist software developers and cybersecurity analysis. Duvet AI for developers is the only Gen AI offering to support the company development and operations lifecycle, fine-tune with the customers’ own core corpus and policies. It's helping Wayfair, GE Appliances and Commerzbank write better software, faster with AI code completion, code generation and chat support. With Duvet AI and security operations, we are helping cybersecurity teams at Fiserv, Spotify and Pfizer. Our robust growth has been driven by strong direct and indirect channels. With ISVs, we have nearly tripled the number of co-sell deals from 2022 to 2023. In our ecosystem, there are nearly 90,000 Google Cloud Gen AI-enabled consultants. And Accenture has teamed up with Google Cloud to create a joint generative AI center of excellence. Next, let me turn to our focus and discipline as we pursue the opportunities ahead. Search, YouTube and Cloud are supported by our state-of-the-art compute infrastructure. This infrastructure is also key to realizing our big AI ambitions. It's a major differentiator for us. We continue to invest responsibly in our data centers and compute to support this new wave of growth in AI-powered services for us and for our customers. Through this, we are being disciplined in how we run the company. You've heard me talk about our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base and to improve our velocity and efficiency. That work continues. Teams are working to focus on key priorities and execute fast, removing layers and simplifying their organizational structures. As just one example, our devices team has brought together different teams from across Nest, Fitbit and other teams into a new functional structure. This will help us pull resources and drive progress across our Pixel portfolio. Across different teams, we have wound down some non-priority projects, which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas. We are also improving our machine utilization, building on our years of experience in driving cost efficiencies in our computing infrastructure and operations. And through our supplier efficiency efforts and automation of certain processes, we have made major improvements in areas like procurement, achieving significant savings. That's a snapshot of the quarter. Before I close, a couple of other highlights. Pixel 8, our AI-first phone, was awarded Phone of the Year by numerous outlets. It now uses Gemini Nano with features like Magic Compose for Google Messages and more to come. In our Other Bets portfolio of companies, Waymo, which is deeply focused on safety, reached over 1 million fully autonomous ride-hailing trips. And Isomorphic Labs entered into strategic partnerships with Eli Lilly and Novartis to apply AI to treat diseases, which has great potential. 2023 was a year of profound innovation and product momentum. Thank you to our many partners. We succeed when our partners do, and we are grateful for the work we do together, from our partners across the Android ecosystem who are on display at CES to our deep relationships with retailers, small businesses and advertising partners, to the next generation of AI start-ups and developers and many more. I also want to thank all of our employees for their hard work throughout 2023 and the start of the new year. I'm excited for what's ahead in 2024.

Google Services revenues of $76 billion were up 12% year-on-year. In Google advertising, Search and other revenues grew 13% year-on-year, led again by solid growth in the retail vertical. We had particular strength in retail in APAC, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the end of the year. YouTube ads revenue were up 16% year-on-year, driven by growth in both direct response and brand. And network revenues declined 2% year-on-year. In Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices, which was previously named Google Other, year-on-year revenues increased 23% driven by strong growth in subscriptions. Now for some color on the quarter and where we see continued upside for long-term advertising growth. Over the last few calls, I have consistently highlighted how we're putting Google AI to work for our customers to deliver profitability and help them achieve their goals in a do-more-with-less environment. From a product perspective, in Q4, Performance Max remained a bright spot. We're also excited about [demand gen] momentum. This is our big bet to help social advertisers find and convert consumers via immersive, relevant visual creatives across YouTube, including YouTube Shorts, Gmail and Discover. In a single campaign, you get access to over three billion users as they stream, scroll, connect and decide what to buy. Tens of thousands of advertisers are testing and on average seeing 6% more conversions per dollar versus image-only ads and discovery campaigns. As we look ahead, we're also starting to put generative AI in the hands of more and more businesses to help them build better campaigns and even better performing ads. Automatically created assets help advertisers show more relevant search ads by creating tailored headlines and descriptions based on each ads’ context. Adoption was up with strong feedback in Q4. In addition to now being available in eight languages, more advanced Gen AI-powered capabilities are coming to ACA. And then last week's big news was that Gemini will power a new conversational experience in Google Ads. This is open in beta to U.S. and UK advertisers. Early tests show advertisers are building higher-quality search campaigns with less effort, especially SMBs who are 42% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. We can't wait to see how this continues to drive performance and level the playing field for advertisers of all sizes. As we shared last quarter, ads will continue to play an important role in the new search experience, and we'll continue to experiment with new formats native to SGE. SGE is creating new opportunities for us to improve commercial journeys for people by showing relevant ads alongside search results. We've also found that people are finding ads either above or below the AI-powered overview helpful as they provide useful options for people to take action and connect with businesses. Looking at our strong Search performance for the fourth quarter. Retail was a highlight. We continue to see a stronger start to the season up to and including Cyber Five. In Q3, we indicated that we were seeing early trends of consumers being very price-conscious, and we saw this play out in Q4. With promotional demand at an all-time high, deal seekers using Google had access to 2x the deals in the U.S. versus last season as well as a better shopping experience. Launches included a one-stop shop deals destination, new filters like GetItFast and AI-generated gifting recommendations in SGE. These new features drove incremental query growth during key shopping moments like Cyber Five. Our proven AI-powered ad solutions were also a win for retailers looking to accelerate omni growth and capture holiday demand. Quick examples include a large U.S. big-box retailer who drove a 60%-plus increase in omni ROAS and a 22%-plus increase in store traffic using Performance Max during Cyber-Five; and a well-known global fashion brand, who drove a 15%-plus higher omnichannel conversion rate versus regular shopping traffic by showcasing its store pickup offering across top markets through pickup later on shopping ads. Moving on to YouTube. We're obviously pleased with YouTube's advertising revenue growth in Q4 and also significant growth in our subscription revenue. I'll reiterate what I have said before. YouTube success starts with creator success. We give millions of creators more ways to create content and connect with fans and more ways to make money and build their own businesses than any other platform. More creators means more content, which leads to more viewers. And via ads and subscriptions, these viewers fund our creators and drive the eyeballs and engagement our advertisers want. To keep this momentum going, we're focused on delivering value across four pillars: creation, viewers, monetization and responsibility. First, creation, which increasingly takes place on mobile devices. We've invested in a full suite of tools, including our new YouTube Create app for Shorts, to help people make everything from 15-second Shorts to 15-minute videos to 15-hour live streams with a production studio in the palm of their hands. Gen AI is supercharging these capabilities. Anyone with a phone can swap in a new backdrop, remove background extras, translate their video into dozens of languages, all without a big studio budget. We're excited about our first products in this area from Dream Screen for AI-generated backgrounds to allowed for AI-powered dubbing. There is more to come. Number two, viewers. We continue to grow watch time across YouTube with strong growth in Shorts and Connected TV. Shorts remains a top priority. We have 2 billion-plus logged-in users every month, and we are averaging 70 billion in daily views. Connected TVs or what we refer to as the living room is where viewership is growing the fastest. We're investing to make this experience even better with interactive features tailored to TVs, plus the content people love: our creators, NFL Sunday Ticket and the range of live sports and studio content via YouTube TV and Primetime Channels. Put this all together, and YouTube is the must-have app on every Connected TV. Monetization is pillar number three and realized through a combination of ad-supported and subscription offerings. Advertising generates the bulk of our revenue, and we continue to invest heavily here. We've rolled out CTV-first formats like 30-second non-skippable ads and pause experiences as well as an industry-first send-to-phone experience that lets people use a second screen to engage with ads. For Shorts, we've developed new formats that are less interruptive to viewers. It's early. We're learning but excited by the opportunities for ads this can unlock. Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely. Our AI part video format from video reach and video view campaigns to demand gen and video action continue to make advertiser dollars go further and drive results across the funnel. We're also introducing new and existing advertisers to YouTube via sports content. 90-plus upfront and scatter advertisers, including Unilever, are partnering with YouTube in our first year across NFL Sunday Ticket in-game advertising opportunities. Our subscription offerings are also growing at a healthy clip. YouTube Music and Premium performed well. Premium users are delivering more value to our partners and YouTube than even ad-supported users do. On average, each additional Premium sign-up boost earnings for creators, music and media partners and YouTube itself. And we've made Premium even more attractive with new features, bundles and other enhancements. We're also pleased with our first season of NFL Sunday Ticket. It gave creators new opportunities to create content and feed user engagement across traditional user content and professional sports content. Feedback on the user experience, including MultiView, has been great. We're excited to continue to innovate here. Responsibility is our fourth pillar, and it underlines everything we do across YouTube. We continue to focus relentlessly on this. As always, deepening our relationships with key partners to bring them the best of Google is a key priority for us, and we continue to do this across industries in Q4. We just talked about the NFL. Sundar mentioned Samsung, among others earlier. Another highlight was our expanded partnership with Porsche to enhance customers' digital experiences with a deeper in-vehicle integration of Google built-in services, including Google Maps and Play. Whether it's continued collaboration with our partners and key ecosystems, we're putting Google AI to work for more customers. I'm excited about the opportunities for continued impact in 2024. I'll wrap with a huge note of gratitude to our customers and partners. Our success is only possible because of their success and then to our Googlers for their outstanding work and focus this year. Ruth, over to you.",1484.0,812.0,42.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.05172413793103448,0.0012315270935960591,0.0012315270935960591,0.0,0.0,0.050492610837438424

We ended with a strong fourth quarter with consolidated revenues of $86.3 billion, up 13% versus last year in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. Total cost of revenues was $37.6 billion, up 6%. Other cost of revenues was $23.6 billion, up 5%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube subscription offerings. The growth rate also reflects the offsetting benefit of lapping $1.2 billion in inventory-related charges that we called out in the fourth quarter last year as well as a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of 2023. In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect an additional $1.2 billion in exit charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated headcount. Operating expenses were $25 billion, up 11%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D expenses, which were driven by the real estate charges, followed by compensation. Operating income was $23.7 billion, up 30%, and our operating margin was 27%. Net income was $20.7 billion, and EPS was $1.64. We delivered free cash flow of $7.9 billion, which was affected by the timing of the $10.5 billion tax payment we made on October 16 that we called out previously related to the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter. For the full-year 2023, free cash flow was $69 billion. We repurchased a total of $62 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2023 and ended the year with $111 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $76.3 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48 billion in the quarter were up 13%, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $9.2 billion were up 16% driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $8.3 billion were down 2%. Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices revenues, which we previously referred to as other revenues, were $10.8 billion, up 23%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $14 billion, up 8%. Google Services operating income was $26.7 billion, up 32%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $9.2 billion for the quarter, up 26%. We're very pleased with the momentum of GCP with an increasing contribution from AI. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $864 million and an operating margin of 9%. As to our Other Bets, for the full-year 2023, revenues were $1.5 billion, and the operating loss was $4.1 billion. Results in the fourth quarter benefited from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising. We were pleased with the sequential revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising throughout 2023, which reflects the extraordinary work across our teams to drive improved experiences for users and attractive ROI for advertisers. As we enter 2024 with advertising revenues of more than $100 billion higher than 2019, we remain focused on sustaining healthy growth on this larger base. Second, within Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices, our total revenues from subscription products reached $15 billion for the full-year 2023, driven primarily by substantial growth in subscribers for our YouTube subscription offerings. The substantial increase in our subscription revenues over the past few years demonstrates the ability of our teams to deliver high value-add offerings and provides a strong base on which to build, including through YouTube and newer services like Google One. Play had solid growth again in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. In Devices, we continue to make sizable investments with increased emphasis on our Pixel family, particularly with AI-powered innovation while driving further efficiencies across the portfolio. Turning to Google Cloud. We are pleased with operating performance in the year. Full year revenues of $33 billion were up 26% versus prior year, ending with strong Q4 performance. The Cloud team is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini, our industry-leading AI technology, to enterprises and governments globally, and we are gratified with the level of engagement. The strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area. In terms of profitability, the improvement in 2023 reflects sustained focus across the team with the intent to maintain healthy profitability while we continue to invest to support long-term growth. Turning to margins and expenses. As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain committed to our framework to durably reengineer our cost base as we invest to support our growth priorities. Key contributors to moderating our expense growth include: first, product and process prioritization to ensure we have the right resources behind our most important opportunities and to reallocate resources where we can; second, organizational efficiency and structure. We're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity. Both product prioritization and the organization design efforts result in a slower pace of hiring, as you can see with our headcount down year-on-year, reflecting the reductions we announced in the first quarter of 2023 and a much slower pace of hiring. We will continue to invest in top technical and engineering talent. Finally, we continue to execute the other work streams to slow expense growth, including improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI, increasing efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization, and optimizing our real estate portfolio. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the fourth quarter was $11 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. The step-up in CapEx in Q4 reflects our outlook for the extraordinary applications of AI to deliver for users, advertisers, developers, cloud enterprise customers and governments globally and the long-term growth opportunities that offers. In 2024, we expect investment in CapEx will be notably larger than in 2023. With regard to Other Bets, we've been working to sharpen our investment focus while capturing the upside given compelling technology breakthroughs across the portfolio. For example, last week, Alphabet's X announced that it would be moving to spin out more projects as independent companies through external capital, giving X the opportunity to bring more focus to the breakthrough technologies it is working on to address some of the world's most pressing challenges.

You obviously have a lot of irons in the fire here. You've been talking about some of the early momentum with tens of thousands of advertisers. The question is, can you sort of walk us through some of the hurdles and gating factors that we should be thinking through that dictate the pace at which these tools can really be rolled out broadly just so we and advertisers can kind of get an understanding for when they could have a bigger impact on the whole business? And then secondly, how do you think about the long-term sales force intensity of the advertising business as you roll more AI-based tools like PMax impacting the overall ad allocation?",141.0,59.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.01694915254237288,0.0,0.01694915254237288,-0.01694915254237288

AI has been at the core of our advertising products for a very, very long time. And the recent advances are really allowing us to drive more value for advertisers across a large range of different areas: bidding, targeting, creative as well as our core advertiser and publisher experiences. We are seeing in core search ads, for example, the bidding side, the value-based bidding as a very significant one on the targeting side, the broad match on creative, responsive search ads automatically created ads assets. And we are very happy with the progress we're seeing in those areas. I think I mentioned in one of the previous calls that one. You asked about hurdles and gating factors. The AI essentials play neutral in this trying to get everybody ready to really take full advantage of those tools. We talked about the progress on PMax as well that we're very happy with in Q4. So overall, I think we are on track with what we're expecting here. On the sales force intensity side, we have done a few reallocations or let me call it portfolio adjustments. As you know, we have two large different teams. One is our LCS, Large Customer Solutions team that's really focused on transformational growth for our largest and most sophisticated customers. And we have our -- we call them GCS, Global Customer Solutions, team, which is the channel where really every customer starts from some of our largest customers now to also the millions of smaller ones and SMBs. The GCS is really then scaling growth by dynamically delivering really the right treatment for every customer. And important to note, it’s also our fastest-growing channel, and it delivered particularly strong growth in Q4. So we have done adjustments here to focus more resources on the GCS side. But I also want to be clear, when we restructure, there’s always an opportunity to be more efficient and smarter in how we service and grow our customers. We’re not restructuring because AI is taking away roles that’s important here. But we see significant opportunities here with our AI-powered solution to actually deliver incredible ROI at scale, and that’s why we’re doing some of those adjustments. So I look at sales force intensity as a stronger focus going forward on the channels I mentioned here.",414.0,201.0,14.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.06965174129353234,0.009950248756218905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05970149253731343

So we are very pleased with the progress we're continuing to make, and we are very committed to the framework to durably reengineer our cost base really as we're investing to support the growth priorities. I tried to call out a number of them in opening comments, but really, as you're looking at the work being done across Google, across Alphabet, it does start with product and process prioritization to make sure we've got the right resources behind the most important opportunities, and then that creates the opportunity for reallocating resources where we can. Then we talked a lot about this quarter about organizational efficiency and structure, and we're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity. The combination of those two, product prioritization and organizational design work, has resulted in the slower pace of hiring. You can see that in our headcount numbers down year-on-year. You can see it in some of the -- in the results that we delivered in the fourth quarter. You can -- and it also goes to the announcements around first quarter and much lower pace of hiring. At this point in the quarter, we do estimate that severance-related expense will be roughly $700 million in the first quarter as we've continued these efforts. But as I said in opening comments, we will continue to invest in top engineering. So that's sort of the big one, if you start with product prioritization and organizational design, which is why also the note about the severance-related expense, which helps pave the way as we're continuing to do the work that we're doing. But then we have a host of other work streams, which I talked about, everything with improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, which is a very large ongoing effort; streamlining operations across Alphabet through use of AI; all the work we're doing with our suppliers and vendors; the work we're doing optimizing our real estate portfolio. So when we've described durably reengineering, it's about continuing to build on work that started, and that is ongoing.",361.0,169.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.04142011834319527,0.011834319526627219,0.005917159763313609,0.011834319526627219,0.005917159763313609,0.029585798816568046

You asked about some of the learnings. Maybe I start with a viewing experience. We've received great feedback so far. People like the navigation, MultiView, the chat, the lack of latency, a really, really positive feedback on this one. You asked about the ads and the subs. Maybe I start with the subscribers. We're pleased with the NFL Sunday Ticket sign-ups and all for a season both as part of the YouTube TV bundle and as a stand-alone offering on YouTube Primetime Channels. Remember, you can access them via both. Nothing more to share on the sub side today on this one. On the ad side, as you know, advertisers can buy from an NFL lineup as part of our YouTube Select portfolio. And this actually allows advertisers to reach football fans across YouTube's pretty unique breadth of NFL content independently of whether you're doing live game on YouTube TV or Primetime Channels or watching NFL highlights, post game commentary on YouTube channels. And we saw solid demand across the ad market around our YouTube Sunday Ticket offering here. We're excited about the partnership ahead or the partnerships ahead. This is our first season.

And then, Ruth, I just want to make sure we understood some of the messaging from the release and the public comments around one-timers in the quarter itself. It seems as if they were not allocated to the segments but are more elements of Other Bets and Alphabet-level activities.

Clearly, as I said, as we are incorporating SGE in the product, the early feedback is positive. And we've been iterating on it, and it clearly works for certain type of queries very well. We are expanding the set of queries where it works very well. It definitely is answering a certain category of queries for the first time in a better way. So that gives us direction to proceed as well. Overall, one of the things I think people underestimate about Search is the breadth of Search, the amount of queries we see constantly on a new day, which we haven't seen before. And so the trick here is to deliver that high-quality experience across the breadth of what we see in Search. And over time, we think Assistant will be very complementary. And we will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models and Bard, and allows us to act more like an agent over time, if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow through for users even more.

You are obviously aware of the made YouTube announcement where we introduced a whole lot of new complementary creativity features on YouTube, including Dream Screen, for example, and a lot of other really interesting tools and thoughts. You can obviously imagine that we can take this more actively to the advertising world already. As you know, it continues already to power AI, a lot of our video ad solutions and measurement capabilities. It's part of video rich campaigns. Multi-format ads are -- actually, there is a generative creator music that actually makes it easier for creators to design the perfect soundtrack already. And as I said earlier, AI will unlock a new world of creativity. And you can see how this will -- if you just look at where models are heading, where multimodal models are heading, where the generation capabilities of those models are heading, you can absolutely see how this will impact and -- positively impact and simplify the flow for creators, similar to what you see already emerging in some of our core products like ACA on the Search side.",232.0,117.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.05982905982905983,0.008547008547008548,0.008547008547008548,0.0,0.0,0.05128205128205128

It was a great quarter led by strong performance from Search, YouTube, and Cloud. Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and Search. Then I'll take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube and beyond. Let's discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last 6 years, we have gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue. Of course, Search continues to power that as you see in our Q1 results. But in addition, we expect YouTube overall and Cloud to exit 2024 at a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion. This shows our track record of investing in and building successful new growing businesses. Now let's look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are 6 points to make: one, research leadership; two, infrastructure leadership; three, innovation in Search; four, our global product footprint; five, velocity in execution; six, monetization paths. First, our foundation of research leadership. We've been an AI-first company since 2016, pioneering many of the modern breakthroughs that power AI progress for us and for the industry. Last week, we further consolidated teams that build AI models under Google DeepMind. This will help simplify development and establish a single access point for our product teams as they build generative AI applications with these models. The teams are making rapid progress, developing Gemini and other models. In February, we rolled out Gemini 1.5 Pro, which shows dramatic performance enhancements across a number of dimensions. It includes a breakthrough in long context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model yet. Combining this with Gemini's native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text code and more, it's highly capable. We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of things. Beyond Gemini, we have built other useful models, including our Gemma open models as well as image and visual models and others. Second, infrastructure leadership. We have the best infrastructure for the AI era. Building world-leading infrastructure is in our DNA, starting in our earliest days when we had to design purpose-built hardware to power Search. Our data centers are some of the most high-performing, secure, reliable, and efficient in the world. They've been purpose-built for training cutting-edge AI models and designed to achieve unprecedented improvements in efficiency. We have developed new AI models and algorithms that are more than 100x more efficient than they were 18 months ago. Our custom TPUs, now in their fifth generation, are powering the next generation of ambitious AI projects. Gemini was trained on and is served using TPUs. We are committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure. You can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures. This will fuel growth in Cloud, help us push the frontiers of AI models and enable innovation across our services, especially in Search. AI innovations in Search are the third and perhaps the most important point I want to make. We have been through technology shifts before, to the web, to mobile, and even to voice technology. Each shift expanded what people can do with Search and led to new growth. We are seeing a similar shift happening now with generative AI. For nearly a year, we've been experimenting with SGE in search labs across a wide range of queries. And now we are starting to bring AI overviews to the main Search results page. We are being measured in how we do this, focusing on areas where gen AI can improve the search experience while also prioritizing traffic to websites and merchants. We have already served billions of queries with our generative AI features. It's enabling people to access new information, to ask questions in new ways and to ask more complex questions. Most notably, based on our testing, we are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in search usage among people who use the new AI overviews as well as increased user satisfaction with the results. And with Circle to Search, people can now circle what they see on their Android screens, ask a question about an image or object in a video and get an AI overview with Lens. Fourth, our global product footprint beyond Search. We have 6 products with more than 2 billion monthly users, including 3 billion Android devices. 15 products have 0.5 billion users, and we operate across 100-plus countries. This gives us a lot of opportunities to bring helpful gen AI features and multimodal capabilities to people everywhere and improve their experiences. We have brought many new AI features to Pixel, Photos, Chrome, Messages and more. We are also pleased with the progress we are seeing with Gemini and Gemini Advanced through the Gemini app on Android and the Google app on iOS. Fifth, improved velocity in execution. We've been really focused on simplifying our structures to help us move faster. In addition to bringing together our model-building teams under Google DeepMind, we recently unified our ML infrastructure and ML developer teams to enable faster decisions, smarter compute allocation, and a better customer experience. Earlier this year, we brought our Search teams together under one leader. And last week, we took another step, bringing together our platforms and devices teams. The new combined team will focus on delivering high-quality products and experiences, bolstering the Android and Chrome ecosystems, and bringing our best innovations to partners faster. We also remain focused on long-term efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. You can see the impact of this work reflected in our operating margin improvement. We continue to manage our head count growth and align teams with our highest priority areas. This speeds up decision-making, reduces layers, and enables us to invest in the right areas. Beyond our teams, we are very focused on our cost structures, procurement and efficiency. And a number of technical breakthroughs are enhancing machine speed and efficiency, including the new family of Gemini models and a new generation of TPUs. For example, since introducing SGE about a year ago, machine costs associated with SGE responses have decreased 80% from when first introduced in Labs driven by hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. We remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through Ads and Cloud as well as subscriptions. Philipp will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers, and in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Okay, those are the 6 points so now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past 8 months. At Google Cloud Next, more than 300 customers and partners spoke about their generative AI successes with Google Cloud, including global brands like Bayer, Cintas, Mercedes-Benz, Walmart and many more. Our differentiation in Cloud begins with our AI hypercomputer, which provides efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to train and serve models. Today, more than 60% of funded gen AI start-ups and nearly 90% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers. And customers like PayPal and Kakao Brain are choosing our infrastructure. We offer an industry-leading portfolio of NVIDIA GPUs along with our TPUs. This includes TPU v5p, which is now generally available and NVIDIA's latest generation of Blackwell GPUs. We also announced Axion, our new Google design and Arm-based CPU. In benchmark testing, it has performed up to 50% better than comparable x86-based systems. On top of our infrastructure, we offer more than 130 models, including our own models, open source models and third-party models. We made Gemini 1.5 Pro available to customers as well as Imagine 2.0 at Cloud Next. And we shared that more than 1 million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, Discover Financial has begun deploying gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers. Customers can also now ground their gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications. In Workspace, we announced that organizations like Uber, Pepperdine University and PennyMac are using Gemini and Google Workspace, our AI-powered agent that's built right into Gmail, Docs sheets and more. We also announced Google Vids, a new application to create stories in short video format. And we introduced Gemini for Meetings and Messaging and Gemini Security for Workspace. Customers are choosing Workspace because they have deep trust in our powerful security and privacy features. Our Cloud business is now widely seen as the leader in cybersecurity. I saw this firsthand when I went to the Munich Security Conference in February. Cybersecurity analysts are using Gemini to help spot threats, summarize intelligence and take action against attacks, helping companies like American Family Insurance aggregate and analyze security data in seconds instead of days. Turning next to YouTube, which continues to grow and lead in streaming. We announced that on average, viewers are watching over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TVs daily. AI experiments like Dream Screen will give anyone the ability to make AI-generated backgrounds for YouTube Shorts. And on subscriptions, which are increasingly important for YouTube, we announced that in Q1, YouTube surpassed 100 million Music and Premium subscribers globally, including trialers. And YouTube TV now has more than 8 million paid subscribers. Finally, in Other Bets, Waymo's fully autonomous service continues to grow ridership in San Francisco and Phoenix with high customer satisfaction, and we started offering paid rides in Los Angeles and testing rider-only trips in Austin. Overall, it was a great quarter, and there's more to come. IO is in less than 3 weeks, followed by Brandcast and Google Marketing Live. I want to thank our employees around the world who are at the heart of this progress and who continue to focus on building innovative products, helpful services and new opportunities for businesses and partners around the world. Thank you. Philipp?",1806.0,925.0,63.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0681081081081081,0.005405405405405406,0.004324324324324324,0.0,0.003243243243243243,0.0627027027027027
GOOGL,2024-04-25,2024-04-26,,2024-04-25,2024-04-25T16:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-25,prepared,,Philipp Schindler,"Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. Google Services revenue of $70 billion were up 14% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year led again by solid growth in the retail vertical with particular strength from APAC-based retailers, which began in the second quarter of 2023. YouTube Ads revenues were up 21% year-on-year driven by growth in both direct response and brand. Network revenues declined 1% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 18%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. Let's now talk about a few highlights from the quarter from a product innovation and advertising performance perspective. First, it bears repeating that AI innovation across our Ads ecosystem is core to every aspect of our product portfolio, from targeting, bidding, creative, measurement, and across campaign types. We've talked about whole solutions like Smart Bidding use AI to predict future ad conversions and their value in helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand and how products like broad match leverage LLMs to match ads to relevant searches and help advertisers respond to what millions of people are searching for. This is foundational. As advances accelerate in our underlying AI models, our ability to help businesses find users at speed and scale and drive ROI just keeps getting better. We're especially excited about the doors gen AI is opening for creative capabilities, helping deliver on the premise of getting the right ad to the right user in the right moment. Look at Performance Max. In February, we rolled Gemini into PMax. It's helping curate and generate text and image assets so businesses can meet PMax asset requirements instantly. This is available to all U.S. advertisers and starting to roll out internationally in English, and early results are encouraging. Advertisers using PMax asset generation are 63% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. And those who improve their PMX ad strength to excellent see 6% more conversions on average. We're also driving improved results for businesses opting into automatically created assets, which are supercharged with gen AI. Those adopting ACA see, on average, 5% more conversions at a similar cost per conversion in Search and Performance Max campaigns. And then there's Dimension. Advertisers are loving its ability to engage new and existing customers and drive purchase consideration across our most immersive and visual touch points like YouTube, Shorts, Gmail and Discover. Hollywood film and TV studio, Lionsgate, partnered with Horizon Media to test what campaign type will deliver the most ticketing page views for its The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes film. Over a 3-week test, demand gen was significantly more efficient versus social benchmarks with an 85% more efficient CPC and 96% more efficient cost per page view. Lionsgate has since rolled out demand gen for 2 new titles. We're also bringing new creative features to demand gen. Earlier this month, we announced new generative image tools to help advertisers create high-quality assets in a few steps with a few simple prompts. This will be a win for up-leveling visual storytelling and testing creative concepts more efficiently. And then there's obviously Search generative experience, which Sundar talked about. I laid out that innovation and the user experience on Search has historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We saw this when we successfully navigated from desktop to mobile. We're continuing to experiment with new ad formats, including search and shopping ads alongside search results in SGE. And we shared in March how folks are finding ads either above or below the SGE results helpful. We're excited to have a solid baseline to keep innovating on and confident in the role SGE, including Ads, will play in delighting users and expanding opportunities to meet user needs. Which brings me to Search and our strong performance in the first quarter. In Q1, retail was again the top contributor. Our focus remains on driving profitability and growth for retailers, helping them optimize digital performance for both online and off-line as well as innovate across our shopping and merchant experiences. Highlights include continued upsides for retailers, leading into agile budget and bidding strategies across Search, PMax, or both; take-home goods retailer IKEA, who leaned into Google's store sales measurement to understand its total omnichannel revenue opportunity across search. By measuring 2.3x more revenue and using value-based bidding solutions to bid to its omnichannel customers, IKEA drove a significant increase in omni revenue in Q1 and is now scaling this strategy globally. We also expanded local inventory ads into 23 countries, helping drive shopper confidence and off-line sales. Retailers can convert intent into action by showcasing in-store availability, pricing, pickup options and more all in one ad format. Moving to YouTube. Last quarter, I went deep into our strategy. It all starts with creation, which drives viewership, which leads to monetization. A few updates to build on Sundar's remarks. First, creation, which is all about giving creators the tools to create amazing content, grow their audiences and build their businesses. In 2023, more people created content on YouTube than ever before, and the number of channels uploading Shorts year-on-year grew 50%. We also hit a new milestone with 3 million-plus channels in our YouTube Partner Program. We recently shared that YPP has paid out more than any other creator monetization platform, including over $70 billion to creators, artists, and media companies over the last 3 years. From a viewer's perspective, watch time across YouTube continues to grow, with strength in both Shorts and CTV. According to Nielsen, YouTube has been the leader in U.S. streaming watch time for the last 12-plus months. In the first quarter, Livingroom. benefited from a combination of strong watch time growth, innovation in the user and advertiser experience, and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Viewers are watching YouTube because they expect to access everything in one place across screens and formats, their favorite creators, live sports, breaking use, educational content, movies, music and more. And advertisers continue to lean in to find audiences they can't find elsewhere. Which brings me to monetization. We're pleased with our Q1 performance across both our ad-supported and subscription offerings. Sundar covered subscription growth. On the Ads front, direct and brand were both strong this quarter. Shorts monetization continued to improve, with Shorts ads now supported on mobile, tablet, Livingroom. and desktop, and available to both performance and brand advertisers. In the U.S., the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the past 12 months, including a 10-point sequential improvement in the first quarter alone. Just last week, we introduced new ways for brands to get the most out of their Shorts ads with new lineups on YouTube Select, including sports, beauty, fashion and lifestyle, and entertainment. For YouTube advertisers, increasing brand lift is one of the core goals. In Q1, we saw strong traction from the introduction of a pause ads pilot on connected TVs, a new non-interruptive ad format that appears when users pause their organic content. Initial results show that pause ads are driving strong brand lift results and are commanding premium pricing from advertisers. Before I wrap, two quick highlights on how we're helping our partners transform and accelerate impact with the best across Google. Number one, to help McDonald's build the restaurant of the future, we're deepening our partnership across cloud and ads. Part of this includes them connecting Google Cloud's latest hardware and data technologies across restaurants globally and starting to apply Gen AI to enhance its customer and employee experiences. Number two, WPP. At Google Cloud Next, we announced a new collaboration that will redefine marketing through the integration of our Gemini models with WPP Open, WPP's AI-powered marketing operating system, already used by more than 35,000 of its people and adopted by key clients, including The Coca-Cola Company, L'Oreal and Nestle. We're just getting started here and excited about the innovation this partnership will unlock. With that, a huge thank you to our customers and partners, many of whom we're excited to see at Google Marketing Live and Brandcast in just a few weeks. And a huge thank you, as always, to our incredible teams for their agility and hard work this quarter. Ruth, you're up.",1416.0,779.0,55.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.07060333761232349,0.0012836970474967907,0.0025673940949935813,0.0,0.0012836970474967907,0.0693196405648267
GOOGL,2024-04-25,2024-04-26,,2024-04-25,2024-04-25T16:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-25,prepared,,Ruth Porat,"Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our financial results for the first quarter driven, in particular, by strength in Search and Cloud as well as the ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $80.5 billion, up 15% or up 16% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect the impact of the restructuring charges we took in the first quarter of 2023 of $2.6 billion as well as the $716 million in employee severance and related charges in the first quarter of 2024. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated head count. To help with year-on-year comparisons, we included a table in our earnings release to adjust other cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, and operating margin to exclude the impact of severance and related office space charges in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2024. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.7 billion, up 10%. Other cost of revenues was $20.8 billion, up 10% on a reported basis, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube given the very strong revenue growth in both subscription offerings and ad-supported content. On an adjusted basis, other cost of revenues were up 13% year-on-year. Operating expenses were $21.4 billion, down 2% on a reported basis, primarily reflecting expense decreases in sales and marketing and G&A, offset by an increase in R&D. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses were up 5%, reflecting, first, in R&D, an increase in compensation expense, primarily for Google DeepMind and Cloud; and second, in sales and marketing, a slight increase year-on-year, reflecting increases in compensation expense primarily for Cloud sales. Operating income was $25.5 billion, up 46% on a reported basis, and our operating margin was 32%. On an adjusted basis, operating income was up 31%, and our operating margin was 33%. Net income was $23.7 billion and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $16.8 billion in the first quarter and $69.1 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $108 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $70.4 billion, up 14%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $46.2 billion in the quarter were up 14% led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.1 billion were up 21% driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 1%. Subscriptions, platforms and devices revenues were $8.7 billion, up 18%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $12.9 billion, up 10%. Google Services operating income was $27.9 billion, up 28%. And the operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $9.6 billion for the quarter, up 28%, reflecting significant growth in GCP with an increasing contribution from AI and strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $900 million and an operating margin of 9%. As to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $495 million, benefiting from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. The operating loss was $1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within Advertising, we are very pleased with the momentum of our Ads businesses. Search had broad-based strength across verticals. In YouTube, we had acceleration in revenue growth driven by brand and direct response. Looking ahead, two points to call out: first, results in our advertising business in Q1 continued to reflect strength in spend from APAC-based retailers, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through Q1, which means we will begin lapping that impact in the second quarter; second, the YouTube acceleration in revenue growth in Q1 reflects, in part, lapping the negative year-on-year growth we experienced in the first quarter of 2023. Turning to subscriptions, platforms, and devices. We continue to deliver significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. The sequential quarterly decline in year-on-year revenue growth for the line in Q1 versus Q4 reflects, in part, the fact that we had only 1 week of Sunday Ticket subscription revenue in Q1 versus 14 weeks in Q4. Looking forward, we will anniversary last year's price increase in YouTube TV starting in May. With regard to platforms, we are pleased with the performance in Play driven by an increase in buyers. With respect to Google Cloud, performance in Q1 reflects strong demand for our GCP infrastructure and solutions as well as the contribution from our Workspace productivity tools. The growth we are seeing across Cloud is underpinned by the benefit AI provides for our customers. We continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth. As we look ahead, two points that will affect sequential year-on-year revenue growth comparisons across Alphabet: first, Q1 results reflect the benefit of leap year, which contributed slightly more than 1 point to our revenue growth rate at the consolidated level in the first quarter; second, at current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind from foreign exchange in Q2 versus Q1. Turning to margins. Our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base are reflected in a 400 basis point expansion of our Alphabet operating margin year-on-year, excluding the impact of restructuring and severance charges in both periods. You can also see the impact in the quarter-on-quarter decline in head count in Q1, which reflects both actions we have taken over the past few months and a much slower pace of hiring. As we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in Cloud, Google DeepMind and technical infrastructure. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. We believe these efforts will enable us to deliver full year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $12 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. The significant year-on-year growth in CapEx in recent quarters reflects our confidence in the opportunities offered by AI across our business. Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 level, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. With regard to Other Bets, we similarly have work streams underway to enhance overall returns. Finally, as I trust you saw in the press release, we are very pleased to be adding a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to our capital return program as well as a new $70 billion authorization in share repurchases. The core of our capital allocation framework remains the same, beginning with investing aggressively in our business as you have heard us talk about today. Given the extraordinary opportunities ahead, we view the introduction of the dividend as further strengthening our overall capital return program. Thank you.

To your first question, look, I think broadly, we've always found that over many years, when things work well on the organic side, monetization follows. So typically, the trends we see carry over well. Overall, I think with generative AI in Search, with our AI overviews, I think we will expand the type of queries we can serve our users. We can answer more complex questions as well as, in general, that all seems to carry over across query categories. Obviously, it's still early, and we are going to be measured and put user experience at the front, but we are positive about what this transition means.",111.0,56.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.017857142857142856,0.03571428571428571,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.0,-0.017857142857142856

And I made this point in opening comments, but we are very cognizant of the increasing headwind we have from higher depreciation and expenses associated with the higher CapEx, and so these efforts are ongoing. And they're very much the same that we've talked with you about previously. It starts with product and process prioritization, all of the work around organizational efficiency and structure. These are ongoing. And so as an example, the work that Sundar talked about, combining devices and services with our platforms and ecosystems, product area is a really good example because unifying the teams not only helps us deliver higher-quality products and experiences, but we think it enables us to move with greater velocity and efficiency.

Obviously, I think the AI transition, I think it's a once-in-a-generation kind of an opportunity. We've definitely been gearing up for this for a long time. You can imagine we started building TPUs in 2016, so we've definitely been gearing up for a long time. The real opportunities we see is the scale of research and innovation, which we have built up and are going to continue to deliver. I think for the first time, we can work on AI in a horizontal way and it impacts the entire breadth of the company, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Cloud, be it Waymo and so on. And we see a rapid pace of innovation in that underlying. So it's a very leveraged way to do it, and I see that as a real opportunity ahead. In terms of the challenges, I think it's been a mindset shift, which we've been driving across the company to make sure that we are embracing this opportunity but being very efficient in how we are approaching it, making sure we are redirecting our people to the highest priorities across the company, building on our 20 years of experience in driving machine efficiencies year-on-year so that we can put our dollars to work as efficiently as possible.

I mean, let's start with the fact that YouTube performance was very strong in this quarter. And on Shorts specifically in the U.S., I mentioned how the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the last 12 months. I think that's what you were referring to. And yes, we're obviously very happy with this development. The way to think about it is advertisers really only spend with us when they see a positive ROI. So you can assume that this wouldn't be happening unless it were to work for advertisers in the short term and also in the long term. That's an important part, I think. Overall, Shorts is a long-term bet for the business. It has really helped us respond to both creator and viewer demand for short-form video. We talked about the strong growth, averaging 70 billion daily views. I mentioned the number of channels uploading has increased 50% year-over-year, so again, very happy with us development.

And more importantly, when I look at the innovation that's ahead and the way the teams are working hard on it, I am very excited about the future ahead.",228.0,93.0,13.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.13978494623655913,0.053763440860215055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08602150537634409

They showed tremendous ongoing momentum in Search and great progress in Cloud with our AI initiatives driving new growth. Search had another excellent quarter. And in terms of product innovation, we are seeing great progress with AI overviews. In Q2, Cloud reached some major milestones. Quarterly revenues crossed the $10 billion mark for the first time, at the same time pass the $1 billion mark in quarterly operating profit. Year-to-date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for Cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers. As I spoke about last quarter, we are uniquely well-positioned for the AI opportunity ahead. Our Research and Infrastructure leadership means, we can pursue an in-house strategy that enables our product teams to move quickly. Combined with our model building expertise, we are in a strong position to control our destiny, as the technology continues to evolve. Importantly, we are innovating at every layer of the AI stack, from chips to agents and beyond, a huge strength. We are committed to this leadership long-term. This was underscored by the announcements we made at I/O, Cloud Next, and Google Marketing Live, and we'll touch on many of them here. Today, I'll start with Search, then move to our AI momentum more generally, followed by Cloud, YouTube, and some closing thoughts. Let's dive in. Over the past 25 years, we have continued to reimagine and expand Google Search across many technological shifts. With AI, we are delivering better responses on more types of search queries and introducing new ways to search. We are pleased to see the positive trends from our testing continue as we roll out AI overviews, including increases in search usage, and increased user satisfaction with the results. People who are looking for help with complex topics are engaging more and keep coming back for AI overviews. And we see even higher engagement from younger users, aged 18 to 24, when they use search with AI overviews. As we have said, we are continuing to prioritize approaches that send traffic to sites across the web. And we are seeing that ads appearing either above or below AI overviews, continue to provide valuable options for people to take action and connect with businesses. Beyond AI overviews, AI expands the types of queries we are able to address and opens up powerful new ways to search. Visual search via Lens is one. Soon you'll be able to ask questions by taking a video with Lens. And already we have seen that AI overviews in Lens, leads to an increase in overall visual search usage. Another example is Circle to Search, which is available today on more than 100 million Android devices. We are seeing tremendous momentum from our AI investments. More than 1.5 million developers are now using Gemini across our developer tools. And we recently unveiled new models that are more capable and efficient than ever. Gemini now comes in 4 sizes, with each model designed for its own set of use cases. It's a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything from data centers to devices. At 2 million tokens, we offer the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to-date, which powers developer use cases that no other model can handle. Gemini is making Google's own products better. All six of our products with more than 2 billion monthly users now use Gemini. This means that Google is the company that's truly bringing AI to everyone. Gemini is powering incredibly helpful features in search, workspace, Google messages, and more. At I/O, we showed new features coming soon to Gmail and to Google Photos. Soon you'll be able to ask photos questions like, what did I eat at that restaurant in Paris last year? For a glimpse of the future, I hope you saw Project Astra at I/O. It shows multimodal understanding and natural conversational capabilities. We've always wanted to build a universal agent and it's an early look at how they can be helpful in daily life. Our AI product advances come from our long-standing foundation of research leadership, as well as our global network of infrastructure. In Q2, we announced our first data center and cloud region in Malaysia, and expansion projects in Iowa, Virginia, and Ohio. Our TPUs are a key bet here, too. Trillium is the sixth generation of our custom AI accelerator, and it's our best performing and most energy efficient TPU to-date. It achieves a near 5 times increase in peak compute performance per chip and a 67% more energy efficient compared to TPU v5e. And the latest Nvidia Blackwell platform, will be coming to Google Cloud in early 2025. We continue to invest in designing and building robust and efficient infrastructure to support our efforts in AI, given the many opportunities we see ahead. Of course, as we do this, we'll continue to create capacity by allocating resources towards our highest priorities. We are relentlessly driving efficiencies in our AI models. For example, over the past quarter, we have made quality improvements that include doubling the core model size for AI overviews, while at the same time improving latency and keeping cost per AI overviews served flat. And we are focused on matching the right model size to the complexity of the query in order to minimize impact on cost and latency. Separately on our real estate investments, we are taking a measured approach to match the current and future needs of our hybrid workforce, as well as our local communities. Next, Google Cloud. We continue to see strong customer interest, winning leading brands like Hitachi, Motorola Mobility, and KPMG. Our deep partnership with Oracle significantly expanded our joint offerings to the large customer base. Our momentum begins with our AI infrastructure, which provides AI startups like Essential AI, with leading cost performance for models and high-performance computing applications. We continue to drive fundamental differentiation with new advances since Cloud Next. This includes Trillium, which I mentioned earlier, and A3 Mega powered by Nvidia H100 GPUs, which doubles the networking bandwidth of A3. Our enterprise AI platform, Vertex, helps customers such as Deutsche Bank, Kingfisher, and the US Air Force build powerful AI agents. Last month, we announced a number of new advances. Uber and WPP are using Gemini Pro 1.5 and Gemini Flash 1.5 in areas like customer experience and marketing. We broaden support for third-party models, including Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and open source models like Gemma 2, Llama and Mistral. We are the only cloud provider to offer grounding with Google Search, and we are expanding grounding capabilities with Moody's, MSCI, ZoomInfo, and more. Our AI-powered applications portfolio is helping us win new customers and drive upsell. For example, our conversational AI platform is helping customers like Best Buy and Gordon Food Service. Gemini for Workspace helps click therapeutics analyze patient feedback as they build targeted digital treatments. Our AI-powered agents are also helping customers develop better quality software, find insights from their data, and protect their organization against cybersecurity threats using Gemini. Software engineers at Wipro are using Gemini code assist to develop, test, and document software faster. And data analysts at Mercado Libre are using BigQuery and Looker to optimize capacity planning and fulfill shipments faster. Cyber security risks continue to accelerate and the number of breaches continue to grow, something we all see in the news every day and that our [Mandiant teams] (ph) help manage. Our strong track record of uptime, quality control and reliability made Google Cloud the trusted security choice for organizations like Fiserv and Marriott International. In Q2, we infused AI throughout our security portfolio, helping TELUS strengthen its proactive security posture. Turning next to YouTube, YouTube is focused on a clear strategy, connecting creators with a massive audience and enabling them to build successful businesses through ads and subscriptions, while helping advertisers reach their desired audience. We had a great brand cast this quarter, and Philip will say more. I'm pleased at the progress here. YouTube has remained number one in US Streaming watch time, according to Nielsen. Views of YouTube shots on connected TVs more than double last year. And we are making it easier for creators to add captions and turn regular videos into shots. Next, on Android and Pixel. We joined Samsung for their Galaxy Unpacked event a few weeks ago, and we shared that Samsung's new devices will include the latest AI-powered Google updates on Android. It was a great event. I'm looking forward to our Made by Google event happening in August. We'll have lots to share around Android and the Pixel portfolio of devices. Our Pixel line is doing well. We recently introduced the new Pixel 8a, powered by our latest Google Tensor G3 chip. It provides beautiful AI experiences like Circle to Search, Best Take, and a Gemini-powered AI assistant. In other bets, I'm really pleased with the progress Waymo's making, a real leader in the space and getting rave reviews from users. Waymo's served more than 2 million trips to-date and driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles on public roads. Waymo's now delivering well over 50, 000 weekly paid public rides, primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix. And in June, we removed the waitlist in San Francisco, so anyone can take a ride. Fully autonomous testing is underway in other Bay Area locations without a human in the driver's seat. Before I close, I want to acknowledge that today is Ruth's final earnings call. Let me take a moment to thank her for all she has done for Google and Alphabet as our longest-serving CFO. I'm excited to continue to work with her in her new role. And I look forward to welcoming our newly appointed CFO, Anat Ashkenazi. She starts next week, and you'll hear from her on our call next quarter. Thanks as always to our employees and partners everywhere for a great Q2. With that, over to you, Philip.",1709.0,888.0,62.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,1.0,3.0,0.06981981981981981,0.00563063063063063,0.0022522522522522522,0.0011261261261261261,0.0011261261261261261,0.06418918918918919
GOOGL,2024-07-23,2024-07-24,,2024-07-23,2024-07-23T16:30:00-04:00,0,2024-07-23,prepared,,Philipp Schindler,"Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. Starting with performance, Google Services delivered revenues of $73.9 billion for the quarter, up 12% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year, led by growth in the retail vertical, followed by financial services. YouTube ads revenues were up 13% year-on-year driven by growth and brand as well as direct response. Network revenues declined 5% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms, and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 14%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. For the rest of my remarks, I want to double click on two topics. First, how we're applying AI across the marketing process to deliver an even stronger ads experience. Second, YouTube's position as the leading multi-format platform. So let me start by sharing some of the ways we are applying AI to bring more performance benefits to even more businesses. Q2 brought several major opportunities to meet and learn from users, developers, creators, and customers. From I/O to Brandcast, Google Marketing Live and Can, a growing number of our customers and partners are looking to understand how to successfully incorporate AI into their businesses. This quarter, we announced over 30 new ads features, and products to help advertisers leverage AI and keep pace with the evolving expectations of customers and users. Across Search, PMax, DemandGen, and Retail, we're applying AI to streamline workflows, enhance creative asset production, and provide more engaging experiences for consumers. Listening to our customers, retailers in particular have welcomed AI-powered features to help scale the depth and breadth of their assets. For example, as part of a new and easier-to-use merchant center, we've expanded Product Studio, with tools that bring the power of Google AI to every business owner. You can upload a product image from the AI with something like, feature this product with Paris skyline in the background and Product Studio will generate campaign ready assets. I also hear great feedback from our customers on many of our other new AI-powered features. We're beta testing, virtual try on and shopping ads and plan to roll it out widely later this year. Feedback shows this feature gets 60% more high-quality views than other images and a higher click-out to retailer sites. Retailers love it because it drives purchasing decisions and fewer returns. Our AI-driven profit optimization tools have been expanded to performance max and standard shopping campaigns. Advertisers use profit optimization and smart bidding see a 15% uplift in profit on average compared to revenue-only bidding. Lastly, DemandGen is rolling out to Display in Video 360 and Search Ads 360 in the coming months with new generative image tools that create stunning high-quality image assets for social marketers. As we said at GML, when paired with Search or PMax, DemandGen delivers an average of 14% more conversions. The use cases we're seeing across the industry show the incredible potential of these AI-enabled products to improve performance. Let me briefly share two examples with you. Luxury jewelry retailer Tiffany leveraged DemandGen during the holiday season and saw 2.5% brand lift in consideration and actions, such as adding items to cards and booking appointments. The campaign drove a 5.6 times more efficient cost per click compared to social media benchmarks. Our own Google marketing team used DemandGen to create nearly 4,500 ad variations for a Pixel 8 campaign shown across YouTube, Discover, and Gmail, delivering twice the click-through rate at nearly a quarter of the cost. In addition to strengthening our ads products for customers, we continue to evolve our existing systems and products with improved models delivering further performance gains. In just six months, AI-driven improvements to quality, relevance, and language understanding have improved Broad Match performance by 10% for advertisers using Smart Bidding. Also, advertisers who adopt PMax to Broad Match and Smart Bidding in their Search campaigns, see an average increase of over 25% more conversions or value at a similar cost. We'll continue to listen to our customers and use their feedback to drive innovation across our products. As you can hear, I continue to be excited about the AI era for ads. Now let's turn to YouTube. I've talked before about our approach to making YouTube the best place to create, watch and monetize. First, the best place to create. What sets YouTube apart from every other platform are the creators and the connection they have with their fans. Audiences tuning in to watch their favorite creators continue to grow. For example, two weeks ago, Mr. Beast's channel hit more than 300 million subscribers. Next, the best place to watch. Our long-term investment in CTV continues to deliver. Views on CTV have increased more than 130% in the last three years. According to Nielsen, YouTube is the Number #1 most watched streaming platform on TV screens in the US for the 17th consecutive month. Zooming out, when you look not just at streaming, but at all media companies and their combined TV viewership, YouTube is the second most watched after Disney. And this growth is happening in multiple verticals, including sports, which has seen CTV watch time on YouTube grow 30% year-over-year. Lastly, the best place to monetize. CTV on YouTube is continuing to benefit from a combination of strong watch time growth, viewer and advertiser innovation and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Our largest advertisers across verticals, including retail, entertainment, telco and home and personal care, are partnering with creators on ads and organic integrations. Verizon, for example, worked with a YouTube creator and Verizon customer to show them many ways that plans and offerings can be customized to fit people’s lives. Using AI-powered formats, they created sketches in multiple lengths and orientations to serve the right creative to the right viewer and drive people to their site. Verizon's creator ads had a 15% lower CPA and a 38% higher conversion rate versus other ads. Turning to Shorts. Last quarter, I shared that in the US, the monetization rate of YouTube Shorts relative to in-stream viewing is showing a healthy rate of growth. Again, this quarter, we continue to see an improvement in Shorts monetization, particularly in the US. We are also seeing a very encouraging contribution from brand advertising on Shorts, which we launched on the product in Q4 last year. Lastly, a few words on shopping. Last year, viewers watched 30 billion hours of shopping-related videos, and we saw a 25% increase in watch time for videos that help people shop. While it is early days, shopping remains a key area of investment. At GML, we rolled out several product updates to YouTube shopping, helping creators sell products to their viewers. These updates included; product tagging where creators can tag products in their videos for viewers to discover and purchase, product collections and a new affiliate hub, a one-stop shop for creators to find deals and promotional offers from brands and track their affiliate earnings. With that, I'll finish by saying a huge thank you to Google's everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. And Ruth, thanks for your amazing leadership and partnership over all these years. Now for one last time, it's over to you.",1222.0,665.0,31.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,0.04661654135338346,0.0015037593984962407,0.004511278195488722,0.0,0.0015037593984962407,0.045112781954887216

We had another strong quarter, driven in particular by performance in Search and Cloud, as well as the ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $84.7 billion, up 14% or up 15% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $35.5 billion, up 11%. Other cost of revenues was $22.1 billion, up 14%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs, followed by depreciation as well as the impact of the Canadian digital services tax, which was applied retroactively. Operating expenses were $21.8 billion up 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D partially offset by a decline in G&A with sales and marketing essentially flat to the second quarter last year. The increase in R&D was driven primarily by compensation which was affected by lapping a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities in certain other bets in the second quarter last year followed by depreciation. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. Operating income was $27.4 billion, up 26% and our operating margin was 32%. Net income was $23.6 billion and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $13.5 billion in the second quarter and $60.8 billion for the trailing 12 months. As a reminder, last year, we had a timing benefit in the second and third quarters from a $10.5 billion deferred cash tax payment made in the fourth quarter, which depressed reported free cash flow growth this quarter, and we'll do so again next quarter. We ended the quarter with $101 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $73.9 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48.5 billion in the quarter were up 14%, led again by growth in retail, followed by the financial services vertical. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.7 billion were up 13% driven by brand followed by direct response advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 5%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues were $9.3 billion up 14%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $13.4 billion, up 7%. Google Services operating income was $29.7 billion up 27% and the operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $10.3 billion for the quarter, up 29%, reflecting first significant growth in GCP, which was above growth for cloud overall and includes an increasing contribution from AI. And second, strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $1.2 billion and an operating margin of 11%. As to our Other Bets for the second quarter, revenues were $365 million and the operating loss was $1.1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, First, within advertising. The strong performance of search was broad-based across verticals. In YouTube, we are pleased with the growth in the quarter. We had healthy watch time growth continued to close the monetization gap in Shorts and had continued momentum in Connected TV, with brand benefiting in part from an ongoing shift in budgets from linear television to digital. As we look forward to the third quarter, we will be lapping the increasing strength in advertising revenues in the second half of 2023, in part from APAC based retailers. Turning to subscriptions, platforms and devices. First, we continue to have significant growth in our subscriptions business which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. However, there was a sequential decline in the year-on-year growth rate, as we anniversaried the impact of a price increase for YouTubeTV in the second quarter last year. The impact will persist through the balance of the year. Second, with regard to platforms. We are pleased with the performance in play driven by an increase in buyers. Finally, with respect to devices. The most important point as we look forward is that our Made by Google launches have been pulled forward into the third quarter from the fourth quarter last year benefiting revenues in Q3 this year. Turning to cloud, which continued to deliver very strong results. For the first time, Cloud crossed $10 billion in quarterly revenues and $1 billion in quarterly operating profit. As Sundar noted year-to-date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers. We're particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our generative AI solutions. We continue to invest aggressively in the business. Turning to margins. The margin expansion in Q2 versus last year reflects our ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base, as well as revenue strength. Our leadership team remains focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. Once again headcount declined quarter-on-quarter, which reflects both actions we have taken in the first half of the year and a much slower pace of hiring. Looking ahead, we expect a slight increase in headcount in the third quarter, as we bring on new graduates. As we have discussed previously, we’re continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in cloud and technical infrastructure. Looking forward, we continue to expect to deliver full-year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023. However, in the third quarter operating margins will reflect the impact of both the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure, as well as the increase in cost of revenues due to the pull-forward of hardware launches into Q3. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the second quarter was $13 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. Looking ahead, we continue to expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 CapEx of $12 billion keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. With regard to other bets, we continue to focus on improving overall efficiencies, as we invest for long-term returns. Waymo is an important example of this, with its technical leadership coupled with progress on operational performance. As you will see in the 10-Q, we have chosen to commit to a new multi-year investment of $5 billion. This new round of funding, which is consistent with recent annual investment levels will enable Waymo to continue to build the world's leading autonomous driving technology company. To close, this is my 56th and last earnings call, 37 of them at Alphabet. So I have a few closing thoughts of gratitude. I've been so proud to be at Google and Alphabet as CFO and to work with some of the smartest people in the world every day. I think, we have accomplished a lot in the last nine plus years, and I am confident that progress will continue. Of course, I'm not going far and I'm honored to have my new role, which I've been slowly working my way into during the past 11 months and I look forward to continuing to work with Sundar, and our great team. Being CFO of one of the most important companies in the world has been the opportunity and responsibility of a lifetime. Google's Mission of advancing technology and bringing information to people throughout the world is as relevant today as it was when I worked on its IPO. Technology has been a catalyst for economic growth throughout human history. The people on this call know that if a technological advancement is not the focus of every business and government, they will be left behind. Underpinning this is the need for sound and responsible investment. That has never been more important than today and certainly, that is Google and Alphabet's focus. I want to end by thanking Googlers around the world for the innovation and commitment that has enabled us to deliver such extraordinary products and services globally. I also want to thank our investors and analysts for your long-term support and your feedback. Thank you.

First, thank you Ruth for all the help and significant impact over the past decade. The first one, it is a little bit of a jump ball, I guess for Sundar, Philipp or Ruth. I guess we're sort of 18 months this fever pitch around the GenAI focus in the world. Maybe from any of your perspective, can you just sort of talk to us about areas where you've seen faster than expected traction or testing adoption of some of the AI, generative AI capabilities versus slower than expected traction and testing from a Google perspective.

Obviously, I think there is a time curve in terms of taking the underlying technology and translating it into meaningful solutions across the Board, both on the consumer and the enterprise side. Definitely, on the consumer side, I'm pleased, as I said in my comments earlier in terms of how for a product like Search, which is used at that scale over many decades. How we've been able to introduce it in a way that it's additive and enhances the overall experience and this positively contributing there. I think across our consumer products, we've been able -- I think we are seeing progress on the organic side. Obviously monetization is something that we would have to earn on top of it.

But I think where the next wave is, working to build solutions on top of it.

Look, the reason we've consistently used the term, the phrase that we're focused on durably reengineering our cost base is because these are deep work streams. They are not tactical fixes, and we continue to build on them. And so the main areas that we've talked about are around product and process prioritization around organizational efficiency and structure. Both of those are reflected in the headcount and the fact that headcount is down year-on-year. And across all of those -- as I said, across our entire leadership team, we remain focused on continuing to execute against them. So in terms of the most recent examples, as we talked about last quarter with the combination of the devices and services product area with the platforms and ecosystems product area, we announced that back in April. And what we discussed last quarter and what we're seeing is that unifying teams across these organizations, helps with product execution and what we're really focused on is really adding to velocity and efficiency. So kind of the gift that keeps giving. And then more broadly, all of the work streams that we've talked to you about before, we continue to remain focused on. A big one, very important one, is all of the efficiency efforts, the work streams around technical infrastructure and improving efficiency there. We are also working on the use of AI across Alphabet. We are working on continuing to build on what we've done with our centralized procurement organization. We are continuing to optimize our real estate portfolio.

It will also reflect higher expenses associated with the Pixel launch, due to the pull forward. So those are important factors.

So Look, as we both noted, search revenues really reflected broad based growth across verticals. That was led by retail followed by financial services. I think your question really goes to the heart of the year-on-year growth comparison. And as both Philipp and I noted, we are really pleased with YouTube, the YouTube team all that was done, it was driven by brand followed by direct response, and they have very strong ongoing operating metrics, which Philipp will comment on. I think the important point to note, and I tried to tease out in opening comments, was that the deceleration in this year-on-year revenue growth for the second quarter versus the first quarter, primarily reflected the tougher comparison versus the first quarter because at that point, as you probably recall, YouTube was lapping negative year-on-year growth in Q1 last year. And then also Q1 benefited from the extra from leap year. And so what you are also seeing here is with YouTube, we were [anniversaring] (ph) the ramp in APAC based retailers that began in the second quarter last year and foreign exchange headwinds as well that we noted.

Look, on the Cloud and AI stuff, obviously, it is something which I think will end up being a big driver over time. I mentioned in my opening remarks, already if you take a look at our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud across everything we do, be it compute on the AI side, the products we have through Vertex AI, Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud, et cetera, we definitely are seeing traction. People are deeply engaging with Gemini models across Vertex and AI studio. We now have over 2 million developers playing around with these things, and you are definitely seeing early use cases. But I think we are in this phase, where we have to deeply work and make sure on these use cases, on these workflows. We are driving deeper progress on unlocking value, which I'm very bullish will happen, but these things take time. So -- but if I were to take a longer-term outlook, I definitely see a big opportunity here.

Look, I -- obviously, we are at an early stage of what I view as a very transformative area and in technology when you are going through these transitions, aggressively investing upfront in a defining category, particularly in an area in which in a leveraged way cuts across all our core areas our products, including Search, YouTube and other services, as well as fuels growth in Cloud and supports the innovative long-term Bets and Other Bets is definitely something for us makes sense to lean in. I think the one way I think about it is when we go through a curve like this, the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here, even in scenarios where if it turns out that we are over investing. We clearly -- these are infrastructure, which are widely useful for us. They have long useful lives and we can apply it across, and we can work through that. But I think not investing to be at the frontier, I think definitely has much more significant downside. Having said that, we obsess around every dollar we put in. Our teams are -- work super hard, I'm proud of the efficiency work, be it optimization of hardware, software, model deployment across our fleet. All of that is something we spend a lot of time on, and that's how we think about it. To your second question on whether -- how do the scaling loss hold. Are we hitting on some kind of wall or something? Look, I think we are all pushing very hard, and there is going to be a few efforts, which will scale up on the compute side and push the boundaries of these models. What I would tell is regardless of how that plays out, you still think there is enough optimizations we are all doing, which is driving constant progress in terms of the capabilities of the models. And more importantly, taking them and translating into real use cases across the consumer and enterprise side, I think on that frontier. I think there is still a lot of progress to be had.

The momentum across the company is extraordinary, as you've seen in recent product launches, and as you will hear on the call today. Our commitment to innovation as well as a long-term focus and investment in AI are paying off and driving success for the company and for our customers. We are uniquely positioned to lead in the era of AI because of our differentiated full stack approach to AI innovation, and we are now seeing this operate at scale. It has three components. First, a robust AI infrastructure that includes data centers, chips and a global fiber network. Second, world-class research teams who are advancing our work with deep technical AI research and who are also building the models that power our efforts. And third, a broad global reach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world, creating a virtuous cycle. Let me quickly touch on each of these. We continue to invest in state-of-the-art infrastructure to support our AI efforts from the U.S. to Thailand to Uruguay. We are also making bold clean energy investments, including the world's first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors, which will enable up to 500 megawatts of new 24/7 carbon-free power. We are also doing important work inside our data centers to drive efficiencies while making significant hardware and model improvements. For example, we shared that since we first began testing AI Overviews, we have lowered machine cost per query significantly. In 18 months, we reduced cost by more than 90% for these queries through hardware, engineering and technical breakthroughs while doubling the size of our custom Gemini model. And of course, we use and offer our customers a range of AI accelerator options, including multiple classes of NVIDIA GPUs and our own custom-built TPUs. We are now on the sixth generation of TPUs known as Trillium and continue to drive efficiencies and better performance with them. Turning to research. Our team at Google DeepMind continues to drive our leadership. Let me take a moment to congratulate Demis Hassabis and John Jumper on winning the Noble Prize in chemistry for their work on AlphaFold. This is an extraordinary achievement and underscores the incredible talent we have and how critical our world-leading research is to the modern AI revolution and to our future progress. Also, congratulations to Jeff Vinton, who spent over a decade here on winning the Noble Prize in physics. Our research teams also drive our industry-leading Gemini model capabilities, including long context understanding, multimodality and agentive capabilities. By any measure, token volume, API calls, consumer usage, business adoption, usage of the Gemini models is in a period of dramatic growth. And our teams are actively working on performance improvements and new capabilities for our range of models. Stay tuned. And they are building out experiences where AI can see and reason about the world around you. Project Astra is a glimpse of that future. We are working to ship experiences like this as early as 2025. We then work to bring those advances to consumers and businesses. Today, all seven of our products and platforms with more than 2 billion monthly users use Gemini models. That includes the latest product to surpass the 2 billion user milestone Google Maps. Beyond Google's own platforms, following strong demand, we are making Gemini even more broadly available to developers. Today, we shared that Gemini is now available on GitHub Copilot with more to come. To support our investments across these three pillars, we are organizing the company to operate with speed and agility. We recently moved the Gemini app team to Google DeepMind to speed up deployment of new models and streamline post-training work. This follows other structural changes that have unified teams in research, machine learning infrastructure and our developer teams, as well as our security efforts and our platforms and devices team. This is all helping us move faster. For instance, it was a small dedicated team that built Notebook LM, an incredibly popular product that has so much promise. We're also using AI internally to improve our coding processes, which is boosting productivity and efficiency. Today, more than a quarter of all new code at Google is generated by AI, then reviewed and accepted by engineers. This helps our engineers do more and move faster. I'm energized by our progress and the opportunities ahead, and we continue to be laser-focused on building great products. Let me turn now to the quarterly highlights. In search, recent advancements, including AI Overviews, Circle to Search and new features in Lens are transforming the user experience, expanding what people can search for and how they search for it. This leads to users coming to search more often for more of their information needs, driving additional search queries. Just this week, AI Overview started rolling out to more than 100 new countries and territories. It will now reach more than 1 billion users on a monthly basis. We are seeing strong engagement, which is increasing overall search usage and user satisfaction. People are asking longer and more complex questions and exploring a wider range of websites. What's particularly exciting is that this growth actually increases over time as people learn that Google can answer more of their questions. The integration of ads within AI Overviews is also performing well, helping people connect with businesses as they search. Circle to Search is now available on over 150 million Android devices with people using it to shop, translate text and learn more about the world around them. A third of the people who have tried Circle to Search now use it weekly, a testament to its helpfulness and potential. Meanwhile, Lens is now used for over 20 billion visual searches per month. Lens is one of the fastest-growing query types we see on search because of its ability to answer complex multimodal questions and help in product discovery and shopping. For all these AI features, it's just the beginning, and you will see a rapid pace of innovation and progress here. Next, Google Cloud. I'm very pleased with our growth. This business has real momentum and the overall opportunity is increasing as customers embrace GenAI. We generated Q3 revenues of $11.4 billion, up 35% over last year with operating margins of 17%. Our technology leadership and AI portfolio are helping us attract new customers, win larger deals and drive 30% deeper product adoption with existing customers. Customers are using our products in five different ways. First, our AI infrastructure, which we differentiate with leading performance driven by storage, compute and software advances, as well as leading reliability and a leading number of accelerators. Using a combination of our TPUs and GPUs, LG AI research reduced inference processing time for its multimodal model by more than 50% and operating costs by 72%. Second, our enterprise AI platform, Vertex, is used to build and customize the best foundation models from Google and the industry. Gemini API calls have grown nearly 40x in a 6-month period. When Snap was looking to power more innovative experiences within their My AI chatbot, they chose Gemini's strong multimodal capabilities. Since then, Snap saw over 2.5 times as much engagement with My AI in the United States. Third, customers use our AI platform together with our data platform, BigQuery, because we analyze multimodal data no matter where it is stored with ultra-low latency access to Gemini. This enables accurate real-time decision-making for customers like Hiscox, one of the flagship syndicates in Lloyd's of London, which reduced the time it took to code complex risks from days to minutes. These types of customer outcomes, which combine AI with data science have led to 80% growth in BigQuery ML operations over a 6-month period. Fourth, our AI-powered cybersecurity solutions, Google Threat Intelligence and Security operations are helping customers like BBVA and Deloitte prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity threats much faster. We have seen customer adoption of our Mandiant-powered threat detection increased 4x over the last 6 quarters. Fifth, in Q3, we broadened our applications portfolio with the introduction of our new customer engagement suite. It's designed to improve the customer experience online and in mobile apps, as well as in call centers, retail stores and more. A great example is Volkswagen of America, who is using this technology to power its new myVW Virtual Assistant. In addition, the employee agents we delivered through Gemini for Google Workspace are getting superb reviews. 75% of daily users say it improves the quality of their work. Moving now to YouTube. For the first time ever, YouTube's combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters has surpassed $50 billion. Together, YouTube TV, NFL Sunday Ticket and YouTube Music Premium are driving subscription growth for the platform. And we are leaning into the living room experience with multi-view and a new option for creators to organize content into episodes and seasons, similar to traditional TV. At Made on YouTube, we announced that Google DeepMind's most capable model for video generation VO is coming to YouTube Shorts to help creators later this year. Next, platforms and devices. Gemini's deep integration is improving Android. For example, Gemini Live lets you have free flowing conversations with Gemini. People love it. It's available on Android, including Samsung Galaxy devices. We continue to work closely with them to deliver innovations across their newest devices with much more to come. At Made by Google, we unveiled our latest Pixel 9 series of devices featuring advanced AI models, including Gemini Nano. We have seen strong demand for these devices, and they've already received multiple awards. Turning to Other Bets. I want to highlight Waymo, the biggest part of our portfolio. Waymo is now a clear technical leader within the autonomous vehicle industry and creating a growing commercial opportunity. Over the years, Waymo has been infusing cutting-edge AI into its work. Now each week, Waymo is driving more than 1 million fully autonomous miles and serves over 150,000 paid rides. The first time any AV company has reached this kind of mainstream use. Through its expanded network and operations partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta, plus a new multiyear partnership with Hyundai, Waymo will bring fully autonomous driving to more people and places. By developing a universal driver, Waymo has multiple paths to market. And with its sixth generation system, Waymo significantly reduced unit costs without compromising safety. Before I close, I'm delighted to welcome our new CFO, Anat. We are thrilled to have her on board, and you will hear from her shortly. And as always, I want to express my gratitude to our employees worldwide. Your dedication and hard work have made this another exceptional quarter for Alphabet.

I'll start with performance for the quarter and then describe the progress we're seeing across ads, YouTube and partnerships, highlighting the impact AI is already having on our business. Google Services delivered revenues of $76.5 billion for the quarter, up 13% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 12% year-on-year, led by growth in the financial services vertical due to strength in insurance, followed by retail. YouTube ads revenues grew 12% year-on-year, driven by brand, closely followed by direct response. Network revenues were down 2% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms and devices, year-on-year revenues were up 28%, driven by growth in subscriptions as well as the launch of our Made by Google devices in the third quarter. Before I double-click into ads, YouTube and partnerships, a few comments on search. Whether they're using their voice to find answers on the go or opening their camera to explore the world around them, people are expanding how they ask questions in search as well as the type of questions they ask. New behaviors create new opportunities to help us connect businesses and consumers via amazing commercial experiences. As GenAI expands what's possible, we continue to see a significant opportunity in search. Let me take a minute to explain why. AI really supercharges search. Our new AI-powered features make searches more helpful, and we continue to see great feedback, particularly from younger users. For example, with Circle to Search, where we see higher engagement from users aged 18 to 24. AI is expanding our ability to understand intent and connect it to our advertisers. This allows us to connect highly relevant users with the most helpful ad and deliver business impact to our customers. Let me share two new ad experiences we have rolled out alongside our popular AI-powered features in search. First, as you heard from Sundar, every month, Lens is used for almost 20 billion visual searches with 1 in 4 of these searches having commercial intent. In early October, we announced product search on Google Lens. And in testing this feature, we found that shoppers are more likely to engage with content in this new format. We're also seeing that people are turning to Lens more often to run complex multimodal queries, voicing a question or inputting text in addition to a visual. Given these new user behaviors, earlier this month, we announced the rollout of shopping ads above and alongside relevant Lens visual search results to help better connect consumers and businesses. Second, AI Overviews, where we have now started showing search and shopping ads within the overview for mobile users in the U.S. As you remember, we've already been running ads above and below AI Overviews. We're now seeing that people find ads directly within AI Overviews helpful because they can quickly connect with relevant businesses, products and services to take the next step at the exact moment they need. As I've said before, we believe AI will revolutionize every part of the marketing value chain. Let's start with creative. Advertisers now use our Gemini-powered tools to build and test a larger variety of relevant creatives at scale. Audi used our AI tools to generate multiple video image and text assets in different links and orientations out of existing long-form videos. It then fed the newly generated creatives into demand gen to drive reach, traffic and booking to their driving experience. The campaign increased website visits by 80% and increased clicks by 2.7 times, delivering a lift in their sales. Last week, we updated image generation at Google Ads with our most advanced text-to-image model, Imagine 3, which we tuned using ads performance data from multiple industries to help customers produce high-quality imagery for their campaigns. Advertisers can now create even higher-performing assets for PMax, Demand Gen app and Display campaigns. Turning to media buying. AI-powered campaigns help advertisers get faster feedback on what creatives work, where and redirect their media buying. Using Demand Gen, DoorDash tested a mix of image and video assets to drive more impact across Google and YouTube's visually immersive surfaces. They saw a 15 times higher conversion rate at a 50% more efficient cost per action when compared to video action campaigns alone. Last and most importantly, measurement. This quarter, we extended availability of our open source marketing mix model, Meridian to more customers, helping to scale measurement of cross-channel budgets to drive better business outcomes. On YouTube, we remain focused on building a platform that enables creators to thrive and unlocking a whole new world of creativity with AI. Creators are at the heart of the YouTube ecosystem and the content they are making is driving robust growth in watch time across the platform. We're also using AI to greatly improve recommendations on YouTube. Driven by Gemini, our large language models have a deeper understanding of video content and viewers' preferences. As a result, they can recommend more relevant, fresher and personalized content to the viewer. Short-form creation continues to thrive on YouTube. Shorts monetization improved again this quarter, and we continue to significantly close the gap with in-stream video, particularly in the U.S. and other more highly monetizing markets. Of all the channels uploading to YouTube each month, 70% are uploading shorts. And we recently announced a top requested feature, the ability to upload shorts up to 3 minutes long. Also, advertisers can now book first position on Shorts blocks in close to 40 markets. We're unlocking more opportunities in the living room. Our momentum here continues as we maintain our status as the number one streamer in the U.S. according to Nielsen. This is driven by the strength of our creators, such as Michelle Carr and Rhett & Link, who are increasingly crafting experiences designed specifically for the big screen, and it's paying off. The number of creators making the majority of the YouTube revenue on TV screens is up more than 30% year-on-year. YouTube is becoming a premier destination for sports watching. People come for the game and stay for the commentary and around the game content from creators like Evelyn Gonzalez, Adam W and Brad Coleman. During the Olympics, content from Paris 2024 had over 12 billion views on YouTube. More than 850 million unique viewers watched over 40 billion minutes of content with 35% on their TV screens. And recently, we kicked off our second season of NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV, which continues to receive a positive reception from advertisers, our partners at the NFL and fans. We have continued to invest in our product experience with improvements to multiview and deeper integrations for fantasy football fans. Following up on my remarks from last quarter about Brandcast, we had a strong upfront performance with commitments up about 20% year-on-year. As always, let me wrap with the strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships. More and more of our partners are recognizing the breadth of our technologies and building solutions that leverage the very best of Google. For example, our recently announced strategic partnership with Vodafone Group spans Google Cloud, AI, Android ads and digital services. This multibillion-dollar partnership will bring these technologies to more than 330 million customers across Europe and Africa. We are collaborating on more than 30 initiatives across 7 areas, including generative AI from consumers, a best-in-class TV platform, hardware and cybersecurity. With that, a heartfelt thank you to Google everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. Anat, welcome to the team. It's great to have you with us.

My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with the results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with high-level commentary on investment at the Alphabet level. We had another strong quarter in Q3 with robust momentum across the business. Consolidated revenue increased by 15% or 16% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth, followed by a robust 35% growth in cloud. Total cost of revenue was $36.5 billion, up 10%. Tech was $13.7 billion, up 9%. We continue to see a revenue mix shift with Google Search growing at double-digit levels, while network revenue, which have a much higher TAC rate declined. Other cost of revenue was $22.8 billion, up 11%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, an increase in depreciation associated with higher level of investment in our technical infrastructure and higher hardware costs associated with the pull forward of our Made by Google launches from the fourth to the third quarter. Total operating expenses increased 5% to $23.3 billion. The increase was primarily driven by facilities-related charges as results of actions were taken to further optimize our office space footprint globally, followed by depreciation, partially offset by year-on-year decline in charges for legal and other matters. R&D investments increased by 11%, primarily driven by increases in compensation and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 5%, primarily reflecting investment in advertising and promotional efforts related to the Made by Google launches, as well as for AI and Gemini. G&A expenses declined by 10%, primarily due to lower charges for legal and other matters. Operating income increased 34% to $28.5 billion and operating margin increased to 32%. Net income increased 34% to $26.3 billion and earnings per share increased 37% to $2.12. We're pleased with the progress we're making in reengineering our cost structure, which is reflected in our operating margin expansion this quarter, while also continuing to invest in the business to bring innovation to consumers, creators and enterprises. We delivered free cash flow of $17.6 billion for the third quarter and $55.8 billion for the trailing 12 months. Year-on-year free cash flow was negatively impacted by the following items. In 2023, we deferred cash tax payments from the second and third quarter to the fourth quarter. And in Q3 2024, we made a $3 billion cash payment related to the 2017 EC shopping fine. We ended the quarter with $93 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now turning to segment results. Google Services revenue increased 13% to $76.5 billion. Google Search and other advertising revenue increased by 12% to $49.4 billion. The robust performance of search was broad-based across verticals, led by the financial services vertical due to strength in insurance followed by retail. YouTube advertising revenue increased 12% to $8.9 billion, driven by brand, followed by direct response advertising. As Philipp mentioned, we're seeing strong momentum in YouTube, including robust growth in watch time across the platform and are excited about the new features and products we're bringing to creators. Network advertising revenue of $7.5 billion were down 2%. In the third quarter, the year-on-year growth in all our advertising revenue lines was impacted by the increase in strength in advertising revenue in Q3 of last year, in part from APAC-based retailers. Subscription platforms and devices revenue increased 28% to $10.7 billion, reflecting growth in subscription revenues, as well as the launch of our Made by Google devices in the third quarter. We continue to have significant growth in our subscription products, driven primarily by YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium, as well as Google One, primarily due to increases in the number of paid subscribers. With regards to platforms, we're pleased with the performance in play, primarily driven by an increase in buyers. Google Service operating income increased by 29% to $30.9 billion, and operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which continued to deliver very strong results this quarter. Revenue increased by 35% to $11.4 billion in the third quarter, reflecting accelerated growth in GCP across AI infrastructure, generative AI solutions and core GCP products. Once again, GCP grew at a rate that was higher than cloud overall. We also saw strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. As you just heard from Sundar, the robust innovation and expanded AI offerings within our cloud business are allowing existing and new customers to realize measurable business benefits, including reduced cost, greater customer engagement, faster response time and better revenue conversion. Google Cloud operating income increased to $1.9 billion and operating margin increased to 17%. The operating margin expansion was driven by strong revenue performance across cloud AI products, core GCP and Workspace, as well as ongoing efficiency initiatives. As to our Other Bets, for the third quarter revenue were $388 million and operating loss was $1.1 billion. I'll highlight just a couple of accomplishments in the quarter for Waymo and Wing. We're excited about the progress we're seeing in Waymo, as Sundar mentioned, and the increase in the number of paid rides. We're planning to continue to expand our geographic coverage and reach more customers in existing markets and new markets. Wing, our drone delivery company, recently passed the 1-year anniversary of scaling its partnership with Walmart in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, now operating in 11 stores and serving 26 different cities and towns. Turning to Alphabet level activities. The largest component of this line is our investment in AI research and development activities, which support all of Alphabet. There were two notable items that impacted the operating loss in Alphabet level activities. First, a $607 million charge related to decisions we've made to further optimize our physical footprint and office space globally; and second, our ongoing investments in AI R&D, including the full quarter effect of the organizational changes we've made in May to move some additional AI teams from Google Services to Google DeepMind. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the third quarter was $13 billion, reflecting investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers and networking equipment. Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx in the fourth quarter to be at similar levels to Q3, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. Our expansion of data center capacity is expected to bring economic benefits to countries and communities where we are investing. In the third quarter alone, we made announcements of over $7 billion in planned data center investments with nearly $6 billion of that in the U.S. In Q3, we also returned value to shareholders in the form of $15.3 billion in share repurchases and $2.5 billion in dividend payments. Overall, we returned a total of nearly $70 billion over the trailing 12 months to shareholders. As we look forward, we're working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities. As we think about the remainder of 2024, there are a couple of dynamics to consider. In terms of revenue, year-on-year growth in advertising revenue will continue to be impacted by the increasing strength in advertising revenue in the second half of 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers. And there will be a headwind to year-over-year growth in subscription platforms and devices revenue in the fourth quarter due to the pull forward of our Made by Google launches into the third quarter this year. In terms of expenses, we'll continue to see increases in depreciation and expenses associated with higher level of investment in our technical infrastructure, partially offset by a slight benefit from the cost revenue associated with our devices due to the pull forward of hardware launches into Q3. Now before going into Q&A, as the new CFO, I would like to share a few thoughts on how I'm approaching and thinking through growth, cost structure and capital allocation and expect to hear more from me on these topics in the coming quarters. As I look at the business, I see opportunities for further growth propelled by AI and the underlying momentum across the business. You heard about some of these on the call today. I also believe that we are well positioned to deliver meaningful innovation, which will translate to revenue given our strength in the core pillars that are required to succeed in AI at scale. Realizing those opportunities and great innovation in AI requires global reach, which we have through our products and platforms, as well as continued meaningful capital investment. And while we have a strong balance sheet to be able to support these investments, we will be looking for efficiencies so that we can fund innovation in priority areas. Sundar, Ruth and our leadership team started important work to reengineer our cost structure including efforts such as optimizing our headcount growth, our physical footprint, improving the efficiencies of our technical infrastructure and streamlining operations across the company through the use of AI. I plan to build on these efforts, but also evaluate where we might be able to accelerate work and where we might need to pivot to free up capital for more attractive opportunities. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.",1558.0,847.0,35.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,8.0,5.0,1.0,0.04132231404958678,0.008264462809917356,0.008264462809917356,0.0023612750885478157,0.0023612750885478157,0.03305785123966942

The first one, over the course of the last year plus, you've sort of showcased a lot of different types of new GenAI enabled search products to sort of reimagine the search experience. Can you help us hone in on one or two 0these products that you're most excited about that you think over the next 2 to 3 years could really lead to more durable multiyear search growth once they scale? And then the second one, just as we're sort of thinking through constraints to how quickly they come out, what are sort of the key constraints that you see to really reimagining search and scaling it out across 2 billion to 3 billion people?

I mentioned in my remarks about Circle to Search Lens now with video search approaching over 20 billion queries a month and obviously, AI Overviews. And with each of these changes, we are definitely expanding what's possible in search. And it's been really heartening to see users adapt. They understand they can ask more queries. They come back more often. And so - and we have seen growth there. I think we are with very - while we've rolled out AI Overviews to over 1 billion users, there is a lot more innovation there we are actively working on. So I expect search to continue to evolve significantly in 2025, both in the search product and in Gemini. And so I think that's the opportunity ahead. I think we are in early days of what is a powerful new technology. And with it, I think we can do a lot more for our users, but at the same time, underpin it on the foundational bedrock of quality and trust and user experience, which we have always done. So we are at 1 billion people. I don't necessarily see a constraint there. Obviously, things like latency, cost per query, et cetera. But as you've seen us over the past 18 months make substantial progress. So we'll continue rolling it out more, and we'll keep evolving it. I think search, if I were to take a 12-month outlook, I think is going to continue to evolve and we'll be at the forefront of that innovation.",268.0,111.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.04504504504504504,0.009009009009009009,0.009009009009009009,0.0,0.009009009009009009,0.036036036036036036

Look, I think one of the - we are well positioned because in our AI infrastructure, we have a comprehensive solution set, right? We have all the leading AI accelerators GPUs, TPUs as well as CPUs, and we are investing in all of them. We have a wonderful partnership with NVIDIA. We are excited for the GB200s, and we'll be one of the first to provide it at scale. On the TPU front, I think we have - not only are we in our sixth generation. I just spent some time with the teams on the road map ahead. I couldn't be more excited at the forward-looking road map, but all of it allows us to both plan ahead in the future and really drive an optimized architecture for it. And I think because of all this, both we can have best-in-class efficiency, not just for internal at Google, but what we can provide through cloud, and that's reflected in the growth we saw in our AI infrastructure and GenAI services on top of it.

So let me provide a little more color on our capital investments and certainly an important area in the - this time of investments in AI. As you saw in the quarter, we invested $13 billion in CapEx across the company. And as you think about it, really it's divided into two categories. One is our technical infrastructure, and that's the majority of that $13 billion. And the other one goes into areas such as facilities, the Bets and other areas across the company. Within TI, we have investments in servers, which includes both TPUs and GPUs. And then the second categories are data centers and networking equipment. This quarter, approximately 60% of that investment in technical infrastructure went towards servers and about 40% towards data center and networking equipment. And as you think about them, we offer both GPUs and TPUs both internally and to our customers. So we have choices and options based on what our customer needs and what our internal needs are. And as you think about the next quarter and going into next year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we will be investing in Q4 at approximately the same level of what we've invested in Q3, approximately $13 billion. And as we think into 2025, we do see an increase coming in 2025, and we will provide more color on that on the Q4 call, likely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24, but additional increase.",244.0,103.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02912621359223301,0.0,0.0,0.0

So I think all of that has been on the positive side. And obviously, the product will continue to improve. So for us, we are mainly focused on each city as we go, the pace at which we can now do additional city gets easier. So we are definitely accelerating that way.

On the monetization side, the monetization rate of shorts relative to in-stream viewing is continuing to show a healthy rate of growth. The gap continues to narrow, particularly in the U.S. We also see it in other more highly monetizing markets. And we continue to work very closely with our advertisers. We're committed to providing them with very effective ways to reach the growing audience here. I talked about advertisers now being able to book first position on Shorts blocks. That's exciting.

So first, Sundar, given the high stakes around native AI product usage, are there any milestones you can share around where Gemini usage is compared to the 250 million weekly active users that ChatGPT is seeing right now? And then the second question is, I'm sure this is something you guys have been thinking about for a while, but it looks like the way that the Google versus DOJ search trial is going, there's a decent likelihood that the Apple ISA contract and some of the Android pre-install contracts are going to be voided out at some point in the future.

Look, I think, you know, obviously, we are serving Gemini across a lot of touch points, including it's now over 1 billion people are using it in search accessing. We are getting it across our products. The Gemini app itself has very strong momentum on user growth. Our API volume, I commented on the Gemini APIs having gone up 14x in the past 6 months. So we are seeing growth across the board. And the Gemini integration into Google Assistant is going super well on Android. The user feedback is positive. So we are continuing to roll that out more. So I think we'll - you will see us we are investing in the next generation of models. And as part of that, we are investing in scaling up the usage of the - both directly to the models as both on the consumer and the developer side. So I think I'm pleased with the momentum there. On the second - on the legal trials, obviously, I don't want to - it's not appropriate for me to speculate given it's in the middle of ongoing litigation. But what I would say is stepping back, look, we've always and even as the court acknowledged, clearly, we have reached a position of success because we have deeply innovated, and we are continuing to do so. People have chosen us because they view it as the best product, be it consumers or partners. And we have a long track record of working hard to make sure our products are as easily available to users as possible across all platforms. So all that approach and all the learnings over the years, I think, will all be - will give us a strong foundation. First of all, we plan to vigorously defend these cases. And some of the early proposals from the DOJ, et cetera, have been far reaching. And we plan to - I think they could have unintended consequences, particularly to the dynamic tech sector and the American leadership there.

We just rolled it out to 100 new countries and territories, and that's what will get us to billion users. But amongst the users where we had already rolled out, we clearly see strong engagement. It's one of the most positive user satisfaction launches we have done in search. And it is increasing overall search usage, like people are asking more complex questions, different types of questions. They are exploring a wider range of websites.

And I think the company, given the important moment, we had to gear up to build models from scratch that could be productionized at scale on our architecture. And that's what the Gemini era was about. So there was a fixed cost of getting it all set up and getting the Gemini era underway. But now I think we are in much more of a virtuous cycle with a lot of velocity in the underlying models. We've had two generations of Gemini model. We are working on the third generation, which is progressing well. And teams internally are now set up much better to consume the underlying model innovation and translate that into innovation within their products. So now all the seven products, which have 2 billion users each have done their first versions of incorporating Gemini, and there is aggressive road map ahead for 2025. I mentioned earlier, search alone. I think there's a lot more we can do. And we are also enabling smaller teams to ship newer experiences and Notebook LM was the first instantiation of those types of efforts as well. Through it all, within, we had to do this when the company evolved from desktop to mobile. We are restructuring the company.

And then secondly, just across the board, when you think about the business that's running at, what, 32% operating margins this last quarter, and you come in looking at this fresh, is it clear to you that there are a lot of kind of newfound cost efficiencies or ongoing cost efficiencies?

So certainly, very pleased to see not just the top line growth rate, but the margin expansion to 17%, really outstanding work by our cloud team to drive continued benefit to customers. And as you think about that margin expansion, really, it's a few things. You've mentioned one of them. The first is scale. Obviously, as we scale the business, we have more opportunity for margin expansion. But the second, and shouldn't be underestimated is the work the team has done to drive efficiencies across the cloud business, and we're seeing those come through, whether it's through headcount management or facilities management, other process efficiencies. We're seeing that go to the bottom line and driving the results you're seeing this quarter. Hard to obviously compare to any of our peers or competitors. It's a different business, but more to come. Now the one thing to remember, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, this is an area that requires investment. And a lot of these investments, you think about servers, et cetera, is based on demand we're seeing from customers. So this will translate to revenue in the fairly short term. But that means there are headwinds associated with the - overall, the annual run rate or costs associated with these investments, whether it's in the form of depreciation or just construction costs that are not capitalized, et cetera. So we'll continue to drive efficiency in the business to try and offset some of these. But this is how I'm thinking about the dynamics for cloud. Overall, for the business, this is one of my key priorities is to look across the organization to see what we can do in terms of driving further efficiencies. There's really good work that was done started by Ruth, Sundar and the rest of the lead team to reengineer the cost base. But I think any organization can always push a little further. And I'll be looking at additional opportunities really across all the elements that I've mentioned in my prepared remarks, think not just about the size of the organization, but mostly how we operate and how we run the business. And I think when you simplify the organization, Sundar just made a few comments on that. When we use AI within our own processes and how we get work done, there are some efficiencies or opportunities for efficiencies. Now all of that will go against substantial increases in capital investment, as I've mentioned, going into 2025. And again, I'll give more color when we are on the Q4 call. So hopefully, we'll be able to drive efficiencies to work towards offsetting some or all of that increase.",475.0,205.0,13.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.06341463414634146,0.014634146341463415,0.0,0.0,0.004878048780487805,0.04878048780487805

First, just on search, why does it make sense to have completely - why doesn't it make sense to have two completely different search experiences. One, an agent-like answers engine, and then two, a links-based more traditional search engine. You could innovate on both and let the consumer decide. It's - maybe think of it as the ultimate A/B test. So I'd be curious to get your thoughts there. And then the second, if you could touch a little bit on the consumer environment in 4Q. Perhaps nobody has a better view into the health of the consumer in multiple verticals. If you could talk a little bit about - you talked about tougher comps on the Asia e-commerce side, but any other trends you could point out be around the election or fewer holiday days this year, that would be really helpful.

On the first part, look, in this moment, people are using a lot of buzzwords like answer engines and all that stuff. I mean, Google started answering questions about 10 years ago in our search product with featured snippets. So look, I think ultimately, you are serving users. User expectations are constantly evolving. And we work hard to stay a step ahead, anticipate and stay a step ahead. And this is why we've kind of really brought multimodality on the input side and the output side in search pretty natively. And so we'll continue expanding innovations there. I do think having two surfaces for us allows us to experiment more. And there are - I view this moment as moment in which there are new use cases which we will be able to do, which we couldn't have done before. And so having the flexibility, having product surfaces where we can move very, very fast, I think, is actually helpful. And so we are embracing it and going to lean into this moment like we have done in the past year, and I think that will play out well for users.

On the vertical trends, look, I called out search and other revenues being led by growth in the financial services due to improved economics in the insurance industry, followed by retail.

I think in two separate blog posts from Google Cloud, talking about the real-life use cases for GenAI, I think you highlighted what was a pretty material increase in a number of companies that are starting to turn their, I guess, ideas into products. I think it was like an 80% increase in the 6-month period. And I think you guys also published some survey data saying that your customers are generating tangible ROI there. So can you update us on what you're seeing in terms of sales cycles, perhaps accelerating? And how much of the heavy lifting the cloud team may have to do to help your customers turn those ideas into reality more quickly? And Philipp, I think one of the feedbacks that we're getting from advertisers is that while the initial use case for PMax for them was in search, they're starting to use it more and more for mid and upper funnel campaigns and budgets as well. So can you talk about whether that's an anecdote or something that you're already seeing perpetuate among all of your advertisers?

And so I gave a few examples on my remarks. And I think customers are getting savvier. We ourselves are going through a lot of learnings, both in deploying this within Google as an enterprise and bringing those learnings to our customers outside. And as we see common patterns across the breadth of sectors we serve in, I think we are bringing those learnings. So I would say, if anything, I think over time, I think organizations are beginning to understand more. They are leaning in. Our models are getting better. We are building more comprehensive solutions on top of it.

We delivered another strong quarter in Q4, driven by our leadership in AI and our unique full stack. We're making dramatic progress across compute, model capabilities, and in driving efficiencies. We're rapidly shipping product improvements, and seeing terrific momentum with consumer and developer usage. And we're pushing the next frontiers, from AI agents, reasoning and deep research, to state-of-the-art video, quantum computing and more. The company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing, and launching products faster than ever before. This is translating into product usage, revenue growth, and results. In Search, AI overviews are now available in more than 100 countries. They continue to drive higher satisfaction in Search usage. Meanwhile, circle to search is now available on over 200 million android devices. In Cloud and YouTube, we said at the beginning of 2024 that we expected to exit the year at a combined annual revenue run rate of over $100 billion. We met that goal and ended the year at a run rate of $110 billion. We are set up well for continued growth. So today I'll provide an update on our AI progress and how it's improving our core consumer products. Then I'll touch on Cloud, YouTube, Platforms and Devices, and Waymo. Let's start with AI. Last quarter, I outlined the three areas of our differentiated full stack approach to AI innovation. Our leading AI infrastructure, our world-class research, including models and tooling, and our products and platforms that bring these innovations to people at scale. First, AI Infrastructure. Our sophisticated global network of cloud regions and data centers provides a powerful foundation for us and our customers, directly driving revenue. We have a unique advantage, because we develop every component of our technology stack, including hardware, compilers, models, and products. This approach allows us to drive efficiencies at every level, from training and serving, to developer productivity. In 2024, we broke ground on 11 new cloud regions and data center campuses in places like South Carolina, Indiana, Missouri, and around the world. We also announced plans for seven new subsea cable projects, strengthening global connectivity. Our leading infrastructure is also among the world's most efficient. Google data centers deliver nearly 4x more computing power per unit of electricity compared to just 5 years ago. These efficiencies, coupled with the scalability, cost and performance we offer, are why organizations increasingly choose Google cloud's platform. In fact, today, cloud customers consume more than 8x the compute capacity for training and inferencing compared to 18 months ago. We'll continue to invest in our cloud business to ensure we can address the increase in customer demand. Second, world class research including models. In December, we unveiled Gemini 2.0, our most capable AI model yet, built for the agentic era. We launched an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 flash, our workhorse model with low latency and enhanced performance. Flash has already rolled out to the Gemini app, and tomorrow we are making 2.0 flash generally available for developers and customers, along with other model updates. So stay tuned. Late last year, we also debuted our experimental Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Model. The progress-to-scale thinking has been super fast, and the reviews so far have been extremely positive. We are working on even better thinking models and look forward to sharing those with the developer community soon. Gemini 2.0 advances in multi modality and made of tool use enable us to build new agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant. One early example is Deep Research. It uses agentic capabilities to explore complex topics on your behalf, and give key findings, along with sources. It launched in Gemini Advanced in December, and is rolling out to android users all over the world. We are seeing great product momentum with our consumer Gemini app, which debuted on IOS last November. And we have opened up trusted tester access to a handful of research prototypes, including Project Mariner, which can understand and reason across information on a browser screen to complete tasks and Project Astra. We expect to bring features from both to the Gemini app later this year. We're also excited by the progress of our video and image generation models. Veo 2, our state-of-the-art video generation model, and Imagen 3, our highest quality text-to-image model. These generative media models, as well as Gemini, consistently top industry leader boards and score top marks across industry benchmarks. That's why more than 4.4 million developers are using our Gemini models today, double the number from just 6 months ago. And we continue to drive research breakthroughs in quantum computing. At the end of last year, we announced Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits. Willow is an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications. This technology holds so much promise, which is why there was real excitement around this breakthrough. Third, our Products and Platforms put AI into the hands of billions of people around the world. We have seven Products and Platforms with over 2 billion users and all are using Gemini. That includes Search, where Gemini is powering our AI overviews. People use Search more with AI overviews and usage growth increases over time as people learn that they can ask new types of questions. This behavior is even more pronounced with younger users who really appreciate the speed and efficiency of this new format. We also are pleased to see how Circle to Search is driving additional Search use and opening up even more types of questions. This feature is also popular among younger users. Those who have tried Circle to Search before now use it to start more than 10% of their searches. As AI continues to expand the universe of queries that people can ask, 2025 is going to be one of the biggest years for Search innovation yet. Now, let me turn to key highlights from the quarter across Cloud, YouTube, Platforms and Devices, and Waymo. First, Google Cloud. Our AI-powered cloud offerings enabled us to win customers such as Mercedes-Benz, Mercado Libre and Servier. In 2024, the number of first-time commitments more than doubled, compared to 2023. We also deepened customer relationships. Last year, we closed several strategic deals over $1 billion, and the number of deals over $250 million doubled from the prior year. Our partners are further accelerating our growth, with customers purchasing billions of dollars of solutions through our Cloud marketplace. We continue to see strong growth across our broad portfolio of AI-powered Cloud solutions. It begins with our AI Hypercomputer, which delivers leading performance and cost, across both GPUs and TPUs. These advantages help Citadel with modeling markets and training, and enabled Wayfair to modernize its platform, improving performance and scalability by nearly 25%. In Q4, we saw strong uptake of Trillium, our sixth-generation TPU, which delivers 4x better training performance and 3x greater inference throughput compared to the previous generation. We also continue our strong relationship with NVIDIA. We recently delivered their H200-based platforms to customers and just last week, we were the first to announce a customer running on the highly-anticipated Blackwell platform. Our AI developer platform, Vertex AI, saw a 5x increase in customers year-over-year, with brands like Mondelez International and WPP building new applications and benefitting from our 200+ foundation models. Vertex usage increased 20x during 2024, with particularly strong developer adoption of Gemini Flash, Gemini 2.0, Imagen 3, and most recently, Veo. We are also seeing strong growth in our AI-powered databases, data analytics, and cybersecurity platforms. Customers including Radisson Hotels are now using Gemini to Search and analyze multi-modal data from across multiple Clouds. Our AI-powered Threat Intelligence and Security Operations products help customers, including Vodafone and AstraZeneca, identify, protect and defend against threats. Our growing portfolio of AI applications is also seeing strong customer adoption. In Q4, we introduced Google Agentspace, which helps enterprises synthesize data with Google-quality Search, create Gemini-powered agents, and automate transactions for employees. In addition, we recently gave all Google Workspace Business and Enterprise customers access to all of our powerful Gemini AI capabilities to help boost their productivity. Moving to YouTube. Nielsen data shows YouTube continues to be number one in streaming watchtime in the U.S., with our share of streaming now at a record high. On election day alone, over 45 million viewers across the U.S. watched election-related content on YouTube. Our early investment in podcasts is paying off. We integrated podcasts into the core YouTube experience, particularly with video. We are now the most frequently used service for consuming podcasts in the U.S., according to a recent Edison report. This success reflects our long-term approach of investing in emerging trends, from mobile to the living room. We now have over 250,000 creators in the YouTube Shopping affiliate program in the U.S. and Korea alone. We expanded YouTube Shopping at the end of last year to three additional countries, allowing even more creators to share their favorite products with fans and grow their businesses. Philipp will talk more about YouTube performance later in the call. Next, Platforms and Devices. Google One's performance has been outstanding, and is one of our fastest growing subscription products in terms of subscribers and revenue growth. Last month, we announced the first beta of Android 16, plus new Android updates, including a deeper Gemini integration coming to the new Samsung Galaxy S25 series. We also recently announced Android XR, the first Android platform built for the Gemini era. Created with Samsung and Qualcomm, Android XR is designed to power an ecosystem of next-generation extended reality devices, like headsets and glasses. Finally, a few words on Waymo which made tremendous progress last year, safely serving more than 4 million passenger trips. It is now averaging over 150,000 trips each week, and growing. Looking ahead, Waymo will be expanding its network and operations partnerships to open up new markets, including Austin and Atlanta this year and Miami next year. And in the coming weeks, Waymo One vehicles will arrive in Tokyo for their first international road trip. We're also developing the sixth-generation Waymo Driver, which will significantly lower hardware costs. I want to thank our employees around the world for another great quarter. 2025 is going to be exciting and we’re all ready for it. Philipp, I will hand it over to you.",1761.0,957.0,53.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.055381400208986416,0.0073145245559038665,0.003134796238244514,0.0,0.0010449320794148381,0.04806687565308255

I will quickly cover performance for the quarter, then frame the rest of my remarks around the progress we are delivering across Search, Ads, YouTube and Partnerships, highlighting the impact AI is having on our business and our customers. Google Services revenues were $84 billion for the quarter, up 10%, driven primarily by 11% year-on-year growth in advertising revenues. Strong growth in Search and YouTube advertising was partially offset by year-over-year decline in network revenues. In terms of vertical performance, the 13% increase in Search and other revenues was led by financial services followed by retail. The 14% growth in YouTube advertising revenues was driven by strong spend on U.S. election advertising, with combined spend from both parties almost doubling from what we saw in the 2020 elections. Now, in Q4, we saw continued strong growth in revenues from Search. We had lots of exciting updates in December, and we're rapidly integrating our AI innovation into our consumer experiences. We've already started testing Gemini 2.0 in AI overviews and plan to roll it out more broadly later in the year. In Search, we're seeing people increasingly ask entirely new questions using their voice, camera, or in ways that were not possible before, like with Circle to Search. We're making these benefits available to more consumers. Google is already present in over half of journeys where a new brand, product, or retailer are discovered. By offering new ways for people to Search, we're expanding commercial opportunities for our advertisers. Shoppers can now take a photo of a product and, using lens, quickly find information about the product, reviews, similar products, and where they can get it for a great price. Lens is used for over 20 billion visual search queries every month, and the majority of these searches are incremental. Retail was particularly strong this holiday season, especially on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which each generated over $1 billion in ad revenue. Interestingly, despite the U.S. holiday shopping season being the shortest since 2019, retail sales began much earlier, in October, causing the season to extend longer than anticipated. People shop more than a billion times a day across Google. Last quarter, we introduced a reinvented Google shopping experience, rebuilt from the ground up with AI. This December saw roughly 13% more daily active users on Google shopping in the U.S. compared to the same period in 2023. Closing out on Search with travel, and sharing another interesting trend where we saw spend expand to travel Tuesday. This contributed to 20% year-on-year revenue growth for travel advertisers across Cyber Monday and Travel Tuesday. Moving to Ads. We continue investing in AI capabilities across media buying, creative and measurement. As I said before, we believe that AI will revolutionize every part of the marketing value chain, and over the past quarter, we've seen how our customers are increasingly focusing on optimizing their use of AI. As an example, Petco used DemandGen campaigns across targeting, creative generation, and bidding to find new pet parent audiences across YouTube. They achieved a 275% higher return on ad spend and a 74% higher click through rate than their social benchmarks. On media buying, we made YouTube select creator takeovers generally available in the U.S. and will be expanding to more markets this year. Creators know their audience the best and creator takeovers help businesses connect with consumers through authentic and relevant content. Looking at Creative, we introduced new controls and made reporting easier in PMAX, helping customers better understand and reinvest into their best performing assets. Using asset generation in PMAX. Event Ticket Center achieved a 5x increase in production of creative assets, saving time and effort. They also increased convergence by 300% compared to the previous period when they used manual assets. And finally, Measurement. Last week, we made Meridian, our marketing mix model, generally available for customers, helping more business reinvest into creative and media buying strategies that they know work. Based on a Nielsen meta-analysis of marketing mix models, on average, Google AI-powered video campaigns on YouTube deliver 17% higher return on advertising spend than manual campaigns. Turning to YouTube. We saw robust revenue growth backed by continued growth and watch time across ad supported and premium experiences. Our focus here remains on building a streaming platform that enables creators to thrive and unlock the full potential of AI. Expanding on our state-of-the-art video generation model, we announced Veo 2, which creates incredibly high quality video in a wide range of subjects and styles. It's been inspiring to see how people are experimenting with it. We'll make it available to creators on YouTube in the coming months. We continue to invest in helping YouTube creators work with brands. All advertisers globally can now promote YouTube creator videos and ad campaigns across all AI-powered campaign types in Google Ads. And creators can tag partners in their brand videos. Sephora used DemandGen's Shorts-Only channel to boost traffic and brand searches for the Holiday Gift Guide campaign and leverage creator collaborations to find the best gift. This drove an 82% relative uplift in searches for Sephora Holiday. Shorts continues its ascent and is closing the gap with long form. In 2024, the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing increased by more than 30 percentage points in the U.S., and we expect to make additional progress in 2025. We're making it easier for advertisers to benefit from Shorts on all screens. We're particularly excited by its success on connected TV, which now makes up 15% of shorts viewing in the U.S. Using a combination of ad formats, Louis Vuitton reached their overall objectives on both long-form and short-form content. Their shorts exceeded luxury goods benchmark for average view duration by 89% for equivalent video lengths, while their long-form content exceeded the benchmark by over 15%, with strong engagement from Gen Z and Millennials. Looking into the living room, we continue to be number one in streaming watch time in the U.S for nearly two years, according to Nielsen, and our share of streaming is at a record high. Viewers globally streamed over 1 billion hours of YouTube content daily on their TVs in 2024. YouTube makes multi-year investments to tap into shifting consumer behavior. The current surge in living room viewership directly reflects years of work to build the right products and partnerships. Creators are now prioritizing high-quality viewing experiences that truly shine on TV screens, inspiring even more viewers to tune in. In fact, the number of creators making majority of revenue from TV is up over 30% year-on-year. We have also invested in podcasts, where popular shows like Club Shay Shay and Lex Friedman are increasingly a visual format. YouTube creators and viewers are embracing this. In 2024, people watched over 400 million hours of podcasts each month on living room devices alone. YouTube is now the most popular service for podcast listening in the U.S., according to Edison. As always, let me wrap with the strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships, where the breadth of what Google has to offer is increasingly being recognized. Sundar mentioned our deepening partnership with Samsung. Another expanding partnership is with Citi, who is modernizing its technology infrastructure with Google Cloud to transform employee and customer experiences. Using Google Cloud, it will improve its digital products, streamline employee workflows, and use advanced high-performance computing to enable millions of daily computations. This partnership also fuels Citi's generative AI initiatives across customer service, document summarization, and search to reduce manual processing. With that, allow me a moment to thank Googlers everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued trust.

My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with the results at the Alphabet level and we'll then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary and expectations over the first quarter and full year 2025. We had another strong quarter in Q4 with robust momentum across the business. Consolidated revenue of $96.5 billion, increased by 12% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth, followed by Cloud. Total cost of revenue was $40.6 billion, up 8%. Tech was $14.8 billion, up 6%. We continue to see a revenue mix shift with Google Search growing at double-digit levels, while network revenues, which have a much higher tech rate, declined. Other cost of revenue was $25.8 billion, up 9%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisitions costs, primarily for YouTube, followed by depreciation, due to increasing investments in our technical infrastructure. Growth in content acquisition and depreciation were partially offset by our year-over-year decline in hardware costs due to the shift in timing of our made-by-Google launches to the third quarter 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. In terms of total expenses, the year-over-year comparisons reflect $1.2 billion in exit charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As previously disclosed, those charges were allocated across the expense lines in other costs of revenue and OpEx based on associated headcount. Total operating expenses decreased 1% to $24.9 billion. R&D investments increased by 8%, primarily driven by increase in compensation and depreciation expenses, partially offset by the impact of charges for office [ph] space optimization in the fourth quarter of 2023. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 5%, primarily reflecting the optimization charges last year, as well as declines in compensation and in ads and promotion expenses due to the timing shift of the Pixel launch from Q4 to Q3. G&A expenses declined by 15%, reflecting a shift of timing in our charitable contributions, as well as the optimization charges last year. Operating income increased 31%, the score [ph] to $31 billion, and operating margin increased to 32%, representing 4.6 points of margin expansion. Net income increased 28% to $26.5 billion, and earnings per share increased 31% to $2.15. We delivered free cash flow of $24.8 billion in the fourth quarter and $72.8 billion for the full year 2024. We ended the quarter with $96 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Google Service revenues increased 10% to $84.1 billion, reflecting the strong momentum across Google Search and YouTube ads. Google Search and other advertising revenues increased by 13% to $54 billion. The robust performance of Search was once again broad-based across verticals, led by the financial service vertical due to strength in insurance, followed by retail. YouTube advertising revenue increased 14% to $10.5 billion, driven by brand, followed by direct response advertising. Network advertising revenue of $8 billion, were down 4%. In the fourth quarter, the year-over-year comparison in all of our advertising revenue lines was impacted by the increase in strength in advertising revenue in Q4 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers. Subscription platforms and device revenues increase 8% to $11.6 billion, primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues, partially offset by the shift in timing of the launch of our made by Google devices to the third quarter, compared with the fourth quarter in 2023. We continue to have significant growth in our subscription products, primarily due to increase in the number of paid subscribers across YouTube TV, YouTube Music Premium, and Google One. With regards to Platform, we saw a slight increase in the growth rate in Play, primarily due to a strong increase in the number of buyers. Google's service operating income increased 23% to $32.8 billion, and operating margin increased from 35% to 39%, representing a meaningful margin expansion. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which continued to deliver very strong results this quarter. Revenue increased by 30% to $12 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in GCP across core GCP products, AI infrastructure, and generative AI solutions. Once again, GCP grew at a rate that was much higher than cloud overall. Healthy Google Workspace growth was primarily driven by increase in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud operating income increased to $2.1 billion, and operating margin increased from 9.4% to 17.5%. We're pleased with the work the cloud team is doing to deliver valuable solutions to the customer and generate revenue growth, as well as its continued focus on driving efficiencies across the cloud business. As for Other Bets, for the fourth quarter, revenue were $400 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. The year-over-year decline in revenue and increase in operating loss primarily reflect the milestone payment in the fourth quarter of 2023 for one of the Other Bets. Turning to Alphabet level activities, the largest component of this line is our investments in AI research and development activities which support all of Alphabet. As a reminder, Alphabet level activities have included nearly all severance charges from reductions in workforce and office space charges. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the biggest factor in year-over-year comparison is the $1.2 billion in charges in the fourth quarter of 2023, almost entirely in connection with office space optimization. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the fourth quarter was $14 billion, primarily reflecting investments in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers, to support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud, and Google DeepMind. In Q4, we returned value to shareholders in the form of $15 billion in share purchases and $2.4 billion in dividend payments. Overall, we returned a total of nearly $70 billion to shareholders in 2024. Turning to 2025, I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business performance in both the first quarter and the full year 2025. First in terms of revenue, I'll highlight two items that will have meaningful impact on Q1 revenue across the company. First in terms of revenues, I'll highlight two items that will have meaningful impact on Q1 revenues across the company. The first is the impact of foreign exchange rates. At the current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind to our revenues from the strengthening of the U.S dollar relative to key currencies in Q1 versus Q4 2024. Second is the impact of leap year. We expect a headwind from having one less day of revenue in Q1 2025 compared with leap year in the first quarter of 2024. As for our segments, Google Services, advertising revenue in 2025 will be impacted by lapping the strength we experience in the financial service vertical throughout 2024. And in Cloud, given the revenues are correlated with the timing of deployment of new capacity, we could see variability in cloud revenue growth rates depending on when new capacity comes online during 2025. Moving to investments, starting with our expectation for CapEx for the full year 2025. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, as we expand our AI efforts, we expect to increase our investments in capital expenditure for technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking. We expect to invest approximately $75 billion in CapEx in 2025 with approximately $16 billion to $18 billion of debt in the first quarter. The expected total investment level may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, primarily due to timing of deliveries and construction schedules. In terms of expenses, first, the increase in our investment in CapEx over the past few years will increase pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In 2024, we saw 28% year-over-year growth in depreciation as we put more technical infrastructure assets into service. Given the increase in CapEx investments over the past few years, we expect the growth rate and depreciation to accelerate in 2025. Second, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas such as AI and cloud. As you just heard from Sundar, we're delivering products and solutions to customer at a rapid pace, building, testing, and launching products faster than ever before. And as I mentioned on the Q3 call, we're doing that while also focusing on driving further efficiencies in how we operate the business. Before we take questions, I'd like to recap the financial results for the year. For the full year 2024, revenue grew by 14% or by $43 billion, reaching $350 billion. Google Services and Google Cloud each continue to see double-digit revenue growth coupled with margin extension. YouTube and cloud revenues combined, ended the year at $110 billion annual run rate. And in 2024, we generate total income of $112 billion, an increase of 33% from 2023. We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in AI innovation and monetization. We've been using AI to improve the performance of our ads business for well over a decade, and Cloud is generating billions in annual revenue from AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions. We're also excited about the potential to bring new experiences to users that will provide additional opportunities for monetization. And I look forward to sharing more in our progress throughout the year. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.",1548.0,853.0,20.0,10.0,10.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,6.0,2.0,0.023446658851113716,0.011723329425556858,0.011723329425556858,0.0011723329425556857,0.0011723329425556857,0.011723329425556858

Sundar, maybe kind of step back on Search, there's a -- it seems like there's a lot of advances to come with Gen AI and agentic possibilities with Search. Can you just sort of walk us through your big picture vision over the next few years of how you think about your Search product continue to evolve to stay at the top of the funnel and drive more engagement and monetization for your users and advertisers. And then the second one, Anat, I think about 90 days ago, you talked about sort of further efficiencies and areas of simplification on the OpEx space. Can you just sort of walk us through some examples of where you see the potential for further efficiencies to the OpEx space, excluding the DNA step-ups that we have to come in 2025.

AI overviews has been the next step. It's playing out positively, as we have indicated, the metrics look great, and we are obviously trading on that experience, bringing better and better models, expanding to the number of queries where it works and so on. But there's a lot more to come. I think we'll continue bringing AI in more powerful ways, in multi-modal ways. Things like what we've done with Lens Circle to Search, you can imagine the future with Project Astra. You can also imagine areas like we have done in Gemini Deep Research, possibilities where you are really dramatically expanding the types of use cases for which Search can work, things which don't always get answered instantaneously but can take some time to answer. Those are all areas of explorations and you will see us, putting newer experiences in front of users through the course of 2025. And so I do feel the opportunity space with AI, there's a lot of unlock ahead.",187.0,89.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0449438202247191,0.0,0.011235955056179775,0.0,0.0,0.0449438202247191

And for the question with regards to where do we see or where do I see leverage moving forward and some of the comments I've made on the previous call. I certainly see opportunities for further productivity and efficiency, and this is one of our priority areas. And we're going to do that so that we can make sure we continue to invest in areas such as AI and cloud where we see potential for continued growth. I'll remain focused on areas that I've mentioned before, which include the technical infrastructure, so the $75 billion in CapEx I mentioned for this year, the majority of that is going to go towards our technical infrastructure, which includes servers and data centers. So ensuring we do that in the most efficient way is critical. Second is managing headcount growth, and we're going to be investing in areas of growth, such as AI and cloud, but looking across the organization and moderating that growth will be important. Optimizing the real estate footprint is one of the areas I've mentioned. We're continuing to focus on that. As well as looking at how we simplify the organization, we've previously mentioned bringing like areas together. Sundar talked about bringing some of the AI research teams together so that we can operate with increased speed, but also how we operate within the organization. Using our own AI tools to how we run the business, whether it's the code that Sundar mentioned on the previous call, writing code with AI, or even running some of our key processes using AI tools. So we're looking at all that. It's going to -- it's -- this is not a one-quarter type of effort. It's going to continue throughout the year, and we're going to continue to focus on that so that we can support the growth in other areas.",322.0,141.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014184397163120567

Philipp, can you just talk more about the expanded rollout of ads on AI overviews and perhaps what additional things you may have learned in 4Q? And I guess in particular, just curious if you rolled out to a higher percentage of commercial queries and is it still fair to say that you're monetizing nearly on par with existing search? And then Anat, just on the -- on cloud growth, a little bit of decel 3Q to 4Q, but it sounded like you also suggested that your capacity constrained in the fourth quarter. I just wanted to push on that a little bit more. How -- is that accurate and is it fair to say that revenue growth could have been higher with much more capacity?

So, that's really good. And as you know, we recently launched the ads within AI overviews on mobile in the U.S., which builds on our previous rollout of ads above and below.

And as I've mentioned, the prepared remark, GCP grew at a much higher rate than overall cloud. Two items to think about from a deceleration perspective. The first is we are lapping a very strong quarter of [indiscernible] deployment in Q4 of 2023. The second is the one you've alluded to. We do see and have been seeing very strong demand for AI products in the fourth quarter in 2024. We exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity.

Sundar, with the news that came out of China a little over 2 weeks ago, I think investors have been asking a lot of questions about the long-term cost curve for AI as AI moves from the infrastructure layer to the application layer or from training to inference and maybe even custom silicon becomes more dominant across the theme. I would love to get your perspective on your take on that news a couple of weeks ago and what it might mean for Alphabet longer term. Thank you.",99.0,50.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.04,0.0,0.0,-0.04

First of all, I think a tremendous team. I think they've done very, very good work. Look, I think for us it's always been obvious, over time, there's frontier model development, but you can drive a lot of efficiency to serve these models really, really well. And if you look at one of the areas in which the Gemini model shine is the Pareto frontier of cost, performance, and latency and if you look at all three attributes, I think we lead this Pareto frontier. And I would say both are 2.0 flash models or 2.0 flash thinking models. They are some of the most efficient models out there, including comparing to DeepSeek's V3 and R1. And I think a lot of it is our strength of the full stack development into an optimization, our obsession with cost per query, all of that, I think, sets us up well for the workloads ahead, both to serve billions of users across our products and on the cloud side. Couple of things I would say are, if you look at the trajectory over the past 3 years, the proportion of the spend towards inference compared to training has been increasing, which is good because obviously inference is to support businesses with good ROIC. And so I think that trend is good. I think the reasoning models, if anything, accelerates that trend because it's obviously scaling upon inference dimension as well. And so I think, look, I think part of the reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is we know we can drive extraordinary use cases because the cost of actually using it is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible. And that's the opportunity space. It's as big as it comes. And that's why you're seeing us invest to meet that moment.",328.0,149.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0738255033557047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0738255033557047

Philipp, question for you is we're starting to see more AI tools on eCommerce sites and something like research with AI recommendations is on Google Shopping. Can you talk about how that product and other AI tools are impacting shopping behavior? I've had that impact in modernization. And then I guess the $75 billion question Anat is, how do you think about long-term capital intensity for this business? It sounds like there's a bit of constraint in terms of getting things built, but how do you think about the modeling of capital intensity going forward, and what are the things that you're looking forward to in terms of whether or not this is the right level of spend?

We've been using our advances in AI to make search for products on Google even easier, obviously. And in Q4, we actually introduced quite a transformed Google Shopping experience, which we rebuilt from the ground up with AI. And people shop more than a billion times a day across Google. Last quarter, we introduced this fully reinvented Google Shopping experience. In December, we saw roughly, I mentioned, as 13% more daily active users in Google Shopping in the U.S compared to the same period last year. So that's a good development here. And the new Google Shopping experiences, specifically to your question, uses AI to really intelligently show the most relevant products, helping to speed up and simplify your research. You get an AI-generated brief with top things to consider for your search, plus maybe products that meet your needs. So shoppers very often want low prices. So the new page not only includes like deal finding tools like price comparison, price insights, price tracking throughout, but there's also a new and dedicated personalized deals page where you can browse deals for you, and all this is really built on the backbone of AI.

So on the first one, certainly we are looking ahead, but we are managing very responsibly with a very rigorous even internal governance process looking at how do we allocate the capacity and what would we need to support the customer demand externally, but also across the Google, the Alphabet business. And as you've seen in the comment I've just made on cloud, we do have demand that exceeds our available capacity, so we'll be working hard to address that and make sure we bring more capacity online. We do have the benefit of having a very broad business, and we can repurpose capacity, whether it's through Google Services or Google Cloud to support, as I said, whether it's Search or GDM or Google Cloud Customers, we can do that in a more efficient manner. We also look at every investment that we make to ensure that we're doing it in the most cost-efficient way to optimize our data center.

I think historically we've had information use cases, but now you can have, you can act on your information needs in a much deeper way. It's always been our vision when we have talked about Google Assistant, et cetera. So I think the opportunity space expands. I think there's plenty of, it feels very far from a zero-sum game. There's plenty of room, I think, for many new types of use cases to flourish. And I think for us, we have a clear sense of additional use cases we can start to tackle for our users in Google Search.

We have the Pareto frontier we mentioned, and I think our full-stack approach and our TPU efforts all play -- give a meaningful advantage, and we plan, you already see that. I know you asked about the cost, but it's effectively captured. When we price outside, we pass on the differentiation. It's partly why we've been able to bring forward flash models at very attractive value props, which is what is driving both developer growth. We've doubled our developers to 4.4 million in just about 6 months. Vertex usage is up 20x last year.

I am not going to give any specific numbers as to what we expect to see in 2025, but I am pleased with the fact that we are seeing and continue to see strength across really all verticals including retail and exiting the year in a position of strength.

Of course, within that, AI overviews has seen stronger growth, particularly across all segments of users, including in younger users. So it's being well received. But overall, I think through this AI moment, I think Search is continuing to perform well. And as I said earlier, we have a lot more innovations to come this year.

The U.S. election advertising led brand revenue growth, and we saw nearly double the spending from 2020. I mentioned that we also had a strong contribution from finance, retail, and the tech verticals. So overall, strong operating metrics. Watch time growth remains robust, particularly in key monetization opportunity areas, such as Shorts and Living Room, just to set the stage here one more time. On your question specifically on the UGC side, look, we have a very strong position with creators and we've always said creators are at the center of YouTube success here. They're the number one most important thing we care about and this strong position really gives us a lot of confidence here.

Is it more aggressive marketing for Gemini as a standalone product, or is it tighter integration into existing experiences, whether it be search mail, maps, et cetera.

And some of it is we've made it more easily accessible. We've brought it to, for example, with a dedicated app on iOS, which has been super positively received and definitely getting a lot of traction there. So definitely driving organic growth by putting the product out. We just last week rolled out with our 2.0 series of models. So 2.0 Flash, I mean, I think that's one of the most capable models you can access at the free tier. So that's definitely contributing as well. And so we are rapidly trading. We've had a couple of key innovations there. Gemini Live, I think, has been definitely a hit with users, as well as for advanced users, Gemini Deep Research. So I think a combination of innovation, continually trading on the product and making it better, is driving a lot of usage. And we'll have a lot more to come as we go this year. And we obviously have a partnership with Samsung, so there are other things which will contribute to it as well. On the monetization side, obviously for now we are focused on a free tier and subscriptions, but obviously as you've seen in Google over time, we always want to lead with user experience, We do have very good ideas for native ad concepts, but you will see us lead with the user experience. But I do think we're always committed to making the products work and reach billions of users at scale. And advertising has been a great aspect of that strategy. And so just like you've seen with YouTube, we'll give people options over time.

We continue to see healthy growth and momentum across the business, including AI powering new features. In Search, we saw continued double-digit revenue growth. AI Overviews is going very well with over 1.5 billion users per month, and we are excited by the early positive reaction to AI mode. There's a lot more to come ahead. In Subscriptions, we surpassed 270 million paid subscriptions with YouTube and Google One as key drivers. And Cloud grew rapidly with significant demand for our solutions, and you saw our leadership in AI at Cloud Next across infrastructure, agents and more. Our differentiated full stack approach to AI continues to be central to our growth. This quarter was super exciting as we rolled out Gemini 2.5, our most intelligent AI model, which is achieving breakthroughs in performance and it's widely recognized as the best model in the industry. That's an extraordinary foundation for our future innovation, and we are focused on bringing this to people and customers everywhere. Looking ahead to I/O, Brandcast and Google Marketing Live, I can't wait for our teams to showcase the innovations they've been working on. Turning to our AI progress this quarter, which continues to enable significant growth opportunities. The elements of the AI stack I've previously mentioned are AI Infrastructure, World Class Research including models and tooling and our Products and Platforms. Starting with AI Infrastructure, our long-term investments in our global network have positioned us well. Google's network is robust and resilient supported by over 2 million miles of fiber and 33 subsea cables. Complementing this, we offer the industry's widest range of TPUs and GPUs and continue to invest in next-generation capabilities. Ironwood, our seventh-generation TPU and most powerful to-date, is the first designed specifically for inference at scale. It delivers more than 10x improvement in compute power or a recent high performance TPU while being nearly twice as power efficient. Our strong relationship with NVIDIA continues to be a key advantage for us and our customers. We were the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA's groundbreaking B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering their next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Second, this infrastructure powers our World Class Research, including our industry leading models. We released Gemini 2.5 Pro last month, receiving extremely positive feedback from both developers and consumers. 2.5 Pro is state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmarks and debuted at number one on the chatbot arena by a significant margin. 2.5 Pro achieved big leaps in reasoning, coding, science and math capabilities, opening up new possibilities for developers and customers. Active users in AI Studio and Gemini API have grown over 200% since the beginning of the year. And last week, we introduced 2.5 Flash, which enables developers to optimize quality and cost. Our latest image and video generation models, Imagen 3 and Veo 2 are rolling out broadly and are powering incredible creativity. Turning to Open Models, we launched Gemma 3 last month delivering state-of-the-art performance for its size. Gemma models have been downloaded more than 140 million times. Lastly, we are developing AI models in new areas where there's enormous opportunity. For example, our new Gemini Robotics Models. And in health, we launched AI Co-Scientist, a multi-agent AI research system, while AlphaFold has now been used by over 2.5 million researchers. Third, turning to Products and Platforms. All 15 of our products with a 0.5 billion users now use Gemini models. Android and Pixel are two examples of how we are putting the best AI in people's hands, making it super easy to use AI for a wide range of tasks just by using their camera, voice or taking a screenshot. We are upgrading Google Assistant on mobile devices to Gemini and later this year we'll upgrade tablets, cars and devices that connect to your phone such as headphones and watches. The Pixel 9a launched a very strong reviews, providing the best of Google's AI offerings like Gemini Live and AI powered camera features. And Gemini Live camera and screen sharing is now rolling out to all Android devices including Pixel and Samsung S25. Now moving on to key highlights from across Search, Cloud, YouTube and Waymo. First, Search. AI is one of the most revolutionary technologies for enabling and expanding our information mission. And for Search, we see it growing the number and types of questions we can answer. We are already seeing this with AI Overviews, which now has more than 1.5 billion users every month. Nearly a year after we launched AI Overviews in the US, we continue to see that usage growth is increasing as people learn that Search is more useful for more of their queries. So we are leaning in heavily here, continuing to roll the feature out to new countries to more users and to more queries. Building on the positive feedback for AI Overviews, in March we released AI Mode, an experiment in labs. It expands what AI Overviews can do with more advanced reasoning, thinking, and multimodal capabilities to help with questions that need further exploration and comparisons. On average, AI Mode queries are twice as long as traditional Search queries. We're getting really positive feedback from early users about its design, fast response time, and ability to understand complex nuanced questions. We also continue to see significant growth in multimodal queries. Circle to Search is now available on more than 250 million devices with usage increasing nearly 40% this quarter and monthly visual searches with Lens have increased by 5 billion since October. Moving on to Cloud. At Cloud Next, we announced major innovations and over 500 companies shared the business results they are achieving by working with us. We provide leading cost performance and reliability for AI training and inference. This enables us to deliver the best value for AI leaders like any scale and contextual AI as well as global brands like Verizon. And for highly sensitive data and regulatory requirements, Google distributed Cloud and our Sovereign AI make Gemini available on premises or in country. Our Vertex AI Platform makes over 200 foundation models available, helping customers like Lowe's integrate AI. We offer industry leading models including Gemini 2.5 Pro, 2.5 Flash, Imagen 3, Veo 2, Chirp and Lyria, plus Open Source and third-party models like Llama 4 and Anthropic. We are the leading Cloud Solution for companies looking to the new era of AI agents, a big opportunity. Our Agent Development Kit is a new Open Source Framework to simplify the process of building sophisticated AI agents and multi-agent systems. And Agent Designer is a low code tool to build AI agents and automate tasks in over 100 enterprise applications and systems. We are putting AI agents in the hands of employees at major global companies like KPMG. With Google Agent Space, employees can find and synthesize information from within their organization, converse with AI agents and take action with their enterprise applications. It combines Enterprise Search, Conversational AI or Chat and access to Gemini and third-party Agents. We also offer prepackaged agents across customer engagement, coding, creativity and more that are helping to provide conversational customer experiences, accelerate software development and improve decision making. And of course, Google Workspace, it delivers more than 2 billion AI assists monthly including summarizing Gmail and refining Docs. Lastly, our cybersecurity products are helping organizations detect, investigate and respond to cybersecurity threats. Our expertise coupled with integrated Gemini AI advances, detects malware, prioritizes threats, and speeds up investigative workflows. This quarter, we were excited to announce our intent to acquire Wiz, a leading cloud security platform that protects all major clouds and code environments. Together, we can make it easier and faster for organizations of all types and sizes to protect themselves, end-to-end and across all major clouds. We think this will help spur more multi-cloud computing, something customers want. Next, YouTube. Yesterday marked a historic milestone. The 20th anniversary of the first video uploaded to YouTube. From that single, 19-second upload, the platform has grown into a global phenomenon, fundamentally changing how billions of people create, share, and experience content. Through all this growth, subscriptions are now a big part of the business. We continue to diversify subscription options, recently expanding our Premium Lite pilot to the US, giving users a new way to enjoy most videos on YouTube ad-free. TV is the primary device for YouTube viewing in the US. According to Nielsen, YouTube has been number one in streaming watch time in the US for the last two years. And YouTube now has over 1 billion monthly active podcast users. YouTube Music and Premium reached over 125 million subscribers, including trials, globally. And finally, Waymo is now safely serving over a quarter of a million paid passenger trips each week. That's up 5x from a year ago. This past quarter, Waymo opened up paid service in Silicon Valley. Through our partnership with Uber, we expanded in Austin and are preparing for our public launch in Atlanta later this summer. We recently announced Washington, DC, as a future ride-hailing city, going live in 2026 alongside Miami. Waymo continues progressing on two important capabilities for riders, airport access and freeway driving. Thanks to all of our employees for their work this quarter. It was a great start to the year and Q2 will be even more exciting. With that, Philipp, over to you.",1585.0,837.0,51.0,6.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,6.0,0.06093189964157706,0.007168458781362007,0.0047789725209080045,0.0011947431302270011,0.0011947431302270011,0.053763440860215055

I'll quickly cover performance for the quarter and then frame the rest of my remarks around the progress we're delivering across Search, Ads, YouTube and partnerships. Google services revenues were $77 billion for the quarter, up 10% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in Search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues. To add some further color to the performance, the 10% increase in Search and other revenues was led by financial services, primarily due to strength in insurance, followed by retail. YouTube saw a similar performance across verticals. Its 10% growth in advertising revenues was driven by Direct Response followed by Brand. So let's start with Search, where we've seen robust growth in revenues. All around the world, over 2 billion people use Search every day to find information, compare products, or shop. And there are more than 5 trillion searches on Google annually. We've continued our efforts to help more people ask entirely new questions, bringing more opportunities for businesses to connect with consumers. And as we've mentioned before, with the launch of AI Overviews, the volume of commercial queries has increased. Q1 marked our largest expansion to-date for AI Overviews, both in terms of launching to new users and providing responses for more questions. The feature is now available in more than 15 languages across 140 countries. For AI Overviews overall, we continue to see monetization at approximately the same rate, which gives us a strong base on which we can innovate even more. Turning to Visual Queries. On the last earnings call, I mentioned the success we're seeing with Lens, where shoppers use their camera or images to quickly find information in ways they couldn't before. In Q1, the number of people shopping on Lens grew by over 10% and the majority of Lens queries are incremental. Sundar mentioned the significant growth we're also seeing with Circle to Search as multimodality continues to drive queries across Search. Moving to Ads. More businesses, big and small, are adopting AI powered campaigns. And the deployment of AI across our Ads business is driving results for our customers and for our business. Throughout 2024, we launched several features that leverage LLMs to enhance advertiser value, and we're seeing this work pay off. The combination of these launches now allows us to match Ads to more relevant Search queries, and this helps advertisers reach customers in searches where we would not previously have shown their Ads. Focusing on our customers, we continue to solve advertisers' pain points and find opportunities to help them create, distribute, and measure more performant Ads, infusing AI at every step of the marketing process. On Audience Insights, we released new asset audience recommendations, which tell businesses the themes that resonate most with their top audiences. On Creators, advertisers can now generate a broader variety of lifestyle imagery customized to their business to better engage their customers and use them across PMax, Demand Gen, Display, and App campaigns. Additionally, in PMax, advertisers can automatically source images from their landing pages and crop them, increasing the variety of their assets. On Media Buying, advertisers continue to see how AI powered campaigns help them find new customers. In Demand Gen, advertisers can more precisely manage ad placements across YouTube, Gmail, Discover, and Google Display Network globally and understand which assets work best at a channel level. Thanks to dozens of AI part improvements launched in 2024, businesses using Demand Gen now see an average 26% year-on-year increase in conversions per dollar spent for goals like purchases and leads. And when using Demand Gen with product feed, on average, they see more than double the conversion per dollar spent year-over-year. As an example, Royal Canin combined Demand Gen and PMax campaigns to find more customers for its cat and dog food products. The integration resulted in a 2.7 times higher conversion rate, a 70% lower cost per acquisition for purchases, and increased the value per user by 8%. Turning to YouTube, where we saw strong growth in revenues across Ads and subscriptions. This week, we're celebrating YouTube's 20th anniversary. We're proud of its leadership as a streaming destination where people come to watch everything they love, from live sports and creator produced content to shorts and podcasts. Creators are what drives viewership, and on average, they upload 20 million videos a day to YouTube. Our biggest creators generate a level of fandom and viewer engagement around large cultural moments on YouTube that brands can't find anywhere else. During March Madness, brands aligned not only with clips and highlights from the game, but also with the creators who drive basketball culture, like Jesser and The Ringer's J. Kyle Mann. In Q1, the growth of our reservation based Ads business more than doubled year-over-year. Brands and creators continue to use the opportunities that collaborations and partnerships offer. Toyota worked with Zach King, the king of short magical videos with over 42 million followers to take over his channel. The creator takeover and accompanying creator ad lifted Toyota's brand awareness by 25% compared to Control Group. And 9% compared to the Toyota brand ad. Looking at shorts, engaged views grew by over 20% in the first quarter. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making globally in shorts monetization relative to in-stream viewing and are particularly encouraged by the trend in the US. As always, I'll wrap up with a strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships where our customers increasingly recognize the strength and breadth of what Google has to offer. For instance, Roblox is partnering Google Ad Manager to bring immersive Ads to gamers. Gen Z gamers are Roblox's biggest users, and thanks to our partnership, advertisers will be able to reach this audience with Ads that blend seamlessly into the gaming experience. We also launched a YouTube shorts effect to help people release iconic Roblox heads and inspire fans to create content at scale. In closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions and commitment to our success and to our customers and partners for their continued trust.

My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless they state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary on our outlook for the second quarter and 2025. We had another strong quarter in Q1, Consolidated revenues of $90.2 billion increased by 12% or 14% in constant currency. Search and YouTube advertising, subscription platforms and devices, and Google Cloud, each had double-digit revenue growth this quarter reflecting strong momentum across the business. Total cost of revenue was $36.4 billion up 8%. TAC was $13.7 billion up 6%. We continue to see a revenue mix shift with Google Search growth at double-digit levels, while network revenues, which have much higher TAC rate, declined. Other costs of revenue was $22.6 billion up 9%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs largely for YouTube, followed by depreciation other technical infrastructure operations costs. Total operating expenses increased 9% to $23.3 billion. R&D investments increased by 14%, primarily driven by increases in compensation, and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 4%, primarily reflecting a decline in compensation expenses. G&A expenses increased by 17% reflecting the impact of charges for legal and other matters. Operating income increased 20% this quarter to $31 billion and operating margin increased to 33.9% representing 2.3 points of margin expansion. Operating margin benefited from healthy revenue growth a moderated pace of compensation growth, and a favorable mix shift towards lower TAC advertising revenues, partially offset by a year-on-year increase in depreciation expenses of just over $1 billion. Other income and expenses was $11.2 billion primarily due to unrealized gain on our non-marketable equity securities related to our investment in a private company, which we noted in our 10-K as a subsequent event. Net income increased 46% to $34.5 billion and earnings per share increased 49% to $2.81. We delivered free cash flow of $19 billion in the first quarter and $74.9 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $95 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Google services revenues increased 10% to $77.3 billion reflecting strength in Google Search and YouTube advertising as subscription. Google Search and other advertising revenues increased by 10% to $50.7 billion. The robust performance of Search was once again broad-based across verticals led by financial services due primarily to strength in insurance, followed by retail. YouTube advertising revenues increased 10% to $8.9 billion driven by Direct Response advertising followed by Brand. Network advertising of $7.3 billion were down 2%. Subscription platforms and device revenues increased 19% to $10.4 billion primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues. This growth was primarily driven by YouTube subscription offerings followed by Google One, with growth in the number of subscribers being the biggest driver of revenue growth. Google services operating income increased 17% to $32.7 billion and operating margin increased from 39.6% to 42.3%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which continued to deliver very strong results this quarter. Revenue increased by 28% to $12.3 billion in the first quarter, reflecting growth in GCP across core and AI products at a rate that was much higher than Cloud's overall revenue growth rate. Growth in Google Workspace was primarily driven by an increase in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud operating income increased to $2.2 billion and operating margin increased from 9.4% to 17.8%. As we scale our fleet, we continue to focus on driving improvements in productivity, efficiency, and utilization to offset the growth in expenses particularly from higher depreciation. As to Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $450 million and operating loss was $1.2 billion The year-on-year decline in revenue and increase in operating loss primarily reflect the milestone payment received in the first quarter of 2024 for one of our Other Bets. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $17.2 billion primarily reflecting investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers to support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud, and Google DeepMind. In Q1, we returned value to shareholders, in the form of $15.1 billion in share repurchases and $2.4 billion in dividend payments. As we announced today, our Board of Directors declared a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend and also approved and used $70 billion share repurchase authorization. Turning to our Outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business performance in the second quarter and the remainder of 2025. First, in terms of revenue, I'll highlight a couple of items that we mentioned last quarter that will have an impact on second quarter and 2025 revenue. First, in Google Services, advertising revenue in 2025 will be impacted by lapping the strength we experience in the financial service vertical throughout 2024. Second in Cloud, we're in a tight demand supply environment and given that revenues are correlated with the timing of deployment of new capacity, we could see variability in cloud revenue growth rates depending on capacity deployment each quarter. We expect relatively higher capacity deployment towards the end of 2025. Moving to investments, starting with our expectation for CapEx for the full year 2025. We still expect to invest approximately $75 billion in CapEx this year. The expected CapEx investment level may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, due to the impact of changes in the timing of deliveries and construction schedules. In terms of expenses, first, as I mentioned on our previous earnings call, the significant increase in our investments in CapEx over the past few years will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In the first quarter, we saw 31% year-on-year growth in depreciation from the increase in technical infrastructure assets placed in service. Given the increase in CapEx investments over the past few years, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate throughout 2025. Second, as we've previously said, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment area. As we've disclosed previously, due to a shift in the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation award beginning in 2023, our first quarter stock-based comp expenses is relatively lower compared to the remaining quarters of the year. In conclusion, as you heard from Sundar and Philip, we're pleased with the progress we're making across the organization. The results for the quarter and the opportunities ahead. Our success as a company is grounded in our experience driving advancements in deep computer science that enables us to create innovative new products and services for users, businesses, and partners around the world. We have a strong track record of incubating and then building these offerings into new profitable businesses for Alphabet. As we announced last quarter, YouTube and Cloud exited 2024 at a combined annual run rate of $110 billion. And as you heard from Sundar earlier, Waymo is continuing to progress in building on its impressive technological achievements to scale rapidly and develop a sustainable business model. Thank you. Sundar, Philip, and I will now take your questions.",1155.0,660.0,23.0,7.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,0.0,0.03484848484848485,0.010606060606060607,0.00909090909090909,0.0015151515151515152,0.0015151515151515152,0.024242424242424242

The first one is sort of the macro advertising backdrop. Maybe, Anat, I know it's April '24, and you call out some factors. You're kind of thinking about the second quarter. Any other factors you're seeing in advertising verticals or regions or categories that could be showing any signs of weakness quarter dates? We should think through any other changes from typical seasonality in 2Q '25 versus prior quarters? Then the second one on Philipp, I think I heard you mention now the volume of commercial queries has increased. Maybe can you just walk us through which of the products are driving that increase in commercial queries. And as you sort of think about the pipeline of Search products are there any others that you're particularly excited about to kind of continue to drive further commercial query growth throughout '25-'26?

We saw broad-based strength across ad verticals in Q1, and we saw it give you a bit of vertical color here, Search was led again, by finance due primarily to ongoing strength in the insurance, retail, healthcare, and travel were actually also sizable contributors here to growth. With regard to Q2, we're only a few weeks in, so it's really too early to comment. I mean, we're obviously not immune to the macro environment. But we wouldn't want to speculate about potential impacts beyond noting that the changes to the de minimis exemption will obviously cause slight headwind to our Ads business in 2025, primarily from APAC-based retailers. And maybe to zoom out, I would say, we have a lot of experience in managing through uncertain times, and we focus on helping our customers by providing deep insights into changing consumer behavior that is relevant to their business. Examples are auction dynamics, query trend insights on topics replacement purchases, and so on. So we have a lot of experience in this area. On the commercial query side, look, AI Overviews continue to drive higher satisfaction and Search usage. And as I noticed, Q1 was really our largest expansion to-date for AI Overviews, both in terms of launching to new users and providing responses for more questions. That's really the core already of the answer. AI Overview sits at the center of your question here. And when it comes to other products, look, I don't want to speculate on this, but we're happy with what we're seeing here on AI Overviews. And I am confident we can expand this to more products over time.",292.0,143.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.03496503496503497,0.013986013986013986,0.027972027972027972,0.0,0.0,0.02097902097902098

Can you just tell us how we should think about the 1.5 billion AI Overviews users just in terms of breadth of rollout? And I know you're saying monetization at approximately the same rate. But what does that mean in terms of click-through rates and conversion? And then, Anat, just curious if there have been any changes to Google's approach to durably reengineering the cost base since you've joined and if macro weakens and we see more of a slowdown, would you expect to find additional opportunities to cut back more on costs?

So this was a change we have. But as I talked about it before, for AI Overviews overall, we see the monetization at approximately the same rate, which gives us a strong base on which we can innovate even more.

I've mentioned my approach and our approach as a company at the end of 2024. And we're still focused on driving efficiency and productivity throughout the organization both in our operating expenses and in our CapEx. I've mentioned some of these during my prepared remarks. But certainly this helps us as we think about the investments we need to make in innovation to drive long-term sustainable growth profile for the company. We're able to repurpose some of these efficiencies into these investments as well as you think about the increase in CapEx we've seen over the past several years and what we're investing this year, this will put additional pressure on the income statement and the form of depreciation. So we're working hard to try and offset some of the headwinds. As well as within the CapEx investments themselves $75 billion, we're looking at how do we make sure every dollar is used efficiently. We have a highly rigorous process to determine the demand behind it and then the allocation of the compute associate with our technical infrastructure investments ensuring that we're utilizing that appropriately and that we're highly efficient with everything we're doing.

I think the foundation for everything is obviously the frontier model progress we are seeing and particularly with 2.5 Pro and Flash I think we're well positioned. We are seeing tremendous reception from developers, enterprises, and consumers too. And obviously, we are delivering consumer AI experiences across our product portfolio, including the primary way people experience it is obviously in Search with AI Overviews and very early days with AI Mode, but that will be a consumer AI forward experience. And we're already seeing very positive feedback. Queries are people are typing in roughly 2x longer queries compared to a traditional Search. So there's a lot of excitement there. And in the Gemini app, which you asked about, we've really seen increased momentum, particularly over the last few weeks as we have rolled out not just the newer models, but we are seeing users are really responding well to all the innovation Gemini Live, which is based on Project Astra has been very well received. Deep Research, I think, based on 2.5 Pro is SOTA and that's been well received. And Canvas, we've had a lot of traction as well. And so we are definitely investing more.

As I said, we're still planning to invest approximately $75 billion in CapEx this year. We do see a tremendous opportunity ahead of us across the organization, whether it's to support Google Services, Google Cloud, and Google DeepMind. Recall, I've stated on the Q4 call that we exited the year in Cloud specifically with more customer demand than we had capacity. And that was the case this quarter as well. So we want to make sure we ramp up to support customer needs and customer demands. Having said that, we're investing in long-term and we're investing in innovation. That's the essence of our business. And we want to do it in a responsible fashion. So you've seen us over the past couple of years and we're continuing to do this and you're seeing this in our results drive efficiency and productivity throughout the business. And we've announced things such as consolidation of teams which helps not just with cost, but with velocity and speed. We're able to get things to market faster. So that's one of the areas we're focused on. You heard from Sundar the last couple of calls on just a rapid pace of innovation we're bringing to the marketplace. So the way we're doing this across the business to drive productivity and efficiency should help us have a more resilient organization irrespective of macroeconomic condition.

Perhaps whether the capabilities are they in a place today in terms of either supplementing or augmenting the workforce?

Obviously, I had mentioned a few months ago in terms of how we are using AI for coding. We are continuing to make a lot of progress there in terms of people using coding suggestions. I think the last time I had said the number was like 25% of code that's checked in involves people accepting AI suggested solutions. That number is well over 30% now. But more importantly, we have deployed more deeper flows and particularly with the newer models I think we are working on early agentic workflows and how we can get those coding experiences to be much deeper. We are deploying it across all parts of the company. Our customer service teams are deeply leading the way there. We've both dramatically enhanced our user experience as well as made it much more efficient to do so. And we are actually bringing all our learnings and expertise in our solutions through cloud to our other customers. But beyond that all the way from the finance team preparing for this earnings call to everything. It's deeply embedded in everything we do, but I still see it as early days, and there's going be a lot more to do. On AI Mode, look, I think we are just leaning in on the early positive feedback, well, as we scale up AI Overviews. It's been one of our most positive launches and but it's been clear people have wanted even more of it. And so with AI Mode we are bringing our state-of-the-art Gemini models right into Search. And I mentioned people typing in longer queries. There's a lot more complex nuance questions. People are following through more. People are appreciating the clean design, the fast response time, and the fact that they can kind of be much more open-ended can undertake more complicated tasks, product comparisons, for example, has been a positive one exploring how-tos, planning a trip.

Anat, getting back to a question I think that Doug was asking earlier on. You just put up record high or multi-year record high margins for both Google Services and for Google Cloud. You talked, Philipp, about depreciation expenses accelerating rapidly throughout the year because of all the investments you've already you'd warn people about. Back in the September quarter, you seemed relatively confident that you had enough levers to kind of offset kind of rising infrastructure costs. Was that still your, six months later, is that still your view that you've got enough levers that even with the rising infrastructure costs you can there's enough in there to kind of counterbalance that. And then just briefly on Waymo, it continues to rise aggressively, the numbers, Sundar. The long-term business model for Waymo.

So on your first question on profitability and what levers do we have and do we still have levers to pull first, I think, every organization can always push a little further. I don't view productivity goals or efficiency as an episodic kind of project-based effort, but rather a continuous effort that when you get to a certain place, you push a little further. Having said that, we do have significant investments we're making across the organization and we have been making them for the past several quarters. And we've been able to do it because we were able to find efficiency to fund those investments across the organization. Those are for products and services that are going to drive long-term growth for the company. So while we're trying to offset as much of the headwind associated with the increase in infrastructure costs, it will become more difficult. As I said, the depreciation will accelerate. We had about a 31% year-over-year growth in depreciation this quarter and it will be higher as we go throughout the year. So think about that kind of as a headwind that we have to manage against. But we're continuing with, pushing across the organization leveraging, Sundar mentioned, the use of AI and kind of an AI-first Google across several of our functions to help us manage a larger scope of work using our AI, AI agents, and AI tools. As Sundar mentioned, we did leverage it in preparation for the earnings call and we're leveraging across several functions. So there are opportunities, but there are also great opportunities for investment and we want to make sure that we make room for, to make these investments to drive long-term growth and ensure we have a very resilient long-term growth profile for the company.",311.0,146.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.04794520547945205,0.02054794520547945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0273972602739726

I think this is probably the first question I've got on our earnings call on Waymo. So thank you. And I think it's a sign of its progress. Look, the thing that excites me is I think we've been laser-focused and we'll continue to be on building the world's best driver. And I think doing that well really gives you a variety of optionality and business models across geographies et cetera. It'll also require a successful ecosystem of partners and we can possibly do it all ourselves. And so I'm excited about the progress the teams have made through a variety of partnerships. Obviously highlight of it is a partnership with Uber. We are very pleased with what we are already seeing in Austin in terms of rider satisfaction. We look forward to offering the first paid rides in Atlanta via Uber later this year. But we are also building up a network of partners, for example, for maintaining fleets of vehicles and doing all the operations related to that with the recently announced partnership with Moove in Phoenix and Miami obviously partnerships with OEMs. There are future optionality around personal ownership as well. So we are widely exploring and but at the same time clearly staying focused and making progress both in terms of safety, the driver experience and progress on the business model and operationally scaling it up.",241.0,103.0,9.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.08737864077669903,0.009708737864077669,0.019417475728155338,0.0,0.009708737864077669,0.07766990291262135

First on AI-powered Search, you have a number of AI-powered Search interfaces including three most prominently, AI Overviews, AI Mode, and Gemini. In the future, should we think of these as distinct experiences that will be long-lasting or more experimental now and Google will eventually focus on one approach going forward? And the second one is more on the financial side. You continue to experience very healthy gross margin expansion. We see the TAC, sure, but Anat you also talked about the offsetting depreciation expense. Could you talk about beyond those two buckets where you're seeing the real savings on the COGS line and driving that gross margin expansion? And maybe even how we should be thinking about that going forward? Thank you.",134.0,69.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.0

Look I do think Search and Gemini obviously will be two distinct efforts, right? I think there are obviously some areas of overlap, but there are also like expose very, very different use cases. And so for example, in Gemini, we see people iteratively coding and going much deeper on a coding workflow as an example. So I think both will be around. Within Search we think of AI Overviews scaling up and working for our entire user base, but an AI Mode is the tip of the tree for us pushing forward on an AI forward experience. There will be things which we discover there which will make sense in the context of AI Overviews. So I think will flow through to our user base. But you almost want to think of what are the most advanced 1 million people using Search for, the most advanced 10 million people and then how do 1.5 billion people use Search for. And we want to innovate and so I think this allows us to do that. But the true north through all of this is user feedback, user satisfaction, user experience.

And I've mentioned this in the prepared remarks, you've seen improvement in TAC that's really driven by the change in revenue mix with a continued Search, growth and then network revenue declines. Network revenue has a much higher TAC rate. So that mix is helping us from a gross margin perspective. So think about that as well. Now we do have depreciation for technical infrastructure hits in two places primarily in two places in the income statement. One is in other cost of sales and the rest is in R&D. So it is in that line item that's impacting cost of sales. Now we've had some efficiencies there and I did mention the improvement in our overall cost of headcount growth and compensation kind of moderating those growth. So that helps us as well more than offset the depreciation increases in Q1. But as I mentioned this number will be higher in the coming quarters. Recall, we have we set approximately $75 billion in CapEx, which is up from $55 billion or just over $50 billion last year.

Q2 was a standout quarter for us with robust growth across the company. As you saw at IO, we are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace. AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum. This quarter, Search delivered double-digit revenue growth. Our new Search features continue to perform well. AI Mode has launched in the U.S. and India and is going well, while AI Overviews now has over 2 billion monthly users across more than 200 countries and territories and 40 languages. I'll give some more details on Search in a moment. We continue to see strong performance in YouTube as well as subscriptions, reflecting great momentum across these high-growth businesses. In the U.S., shorts now earn as much revenue per watch hour as traditional in-stream on YouTube. And in some countries, it now even exceeds in-stream's rate. Cloud had another great quarter of strong growth in revenues, backlog and profitability. Its annual revenue run rate is now more than $50 billion. We are seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio. Of course, this is all possible because of the long-term investments we have made in our differentiated full stack approach to AI. This spans AI infrastructure, world-class research, models and tooling and our products and platforms that brings AI to people all over the world. I'll briefly touch on the AI stack before turning to quarterly highlights. First, AI infrastructure. We operate the leading global network of AI-optimized data centers and cloud regions. We also offer the industry's widest range of TPUs and GPUs along with storage and software built on top. That's why nearly all GenAI unicorns use Google Cloud. And that's why a growing number, including leading AI research labs like Safe Superintelligence and Physical Intelligence use TPU specifically. Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand from cloud customers. Next, world-class AI research, including models and tooling. We continue to expand our Gemini 2.5 family of hybrid reasoning models, which provide industry-leading performance in nearly every major benchmark. In addition to improving our popular workhorse model Flash, we debuted an extremely fast flashlight version. We achieved gold medal level performance in the International Math Olympiad using an advanced version of Gemini with Deepting. We can't wait to bring Deepting to users soon. We have some of the best models available today at every price point. Our 2.5 models have been a catalyst for growth and 9 million developers have now built with Gemini. I also want to mention Veo 3, our state-of-the-art video generation model. It's been a viral hit with people sharing clips created in the Gemini app and with our new AI filmmaking tool Flow. Since May, over 70 million videos have been generated using Veo 3. And we recently introduced a feature in the Gemini app to turn photos into videos, which people absolutely love. It's also rolling out to Google Photos users starting today. Third, our products and platforms. We are bringing AI to all our users and partners through surfaces like Workspace, Chrome and more. The growth in usage has been incredible. At IO in May, we announced that we processed 480 trillion monthly tokens across our surfaces. Since then, we have doubled that number, now processing over 980 trillion monthly tokens, a remarkable increase. The Gemini app now has more than 450 million monthly active users, and we continue to see strong growth in engagement with daily requests growing over 50% from Q1. In June alone, over 50 million people used AI-powered meeting notes in Google Meet. And powered by Veo 3, our new short video product in Workspace called Google Vids reached nearly 1 million monthly active users. This month at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked, we announced new Android and AI features that are available on Samsung's latest devices. And we are really pleased with the growth in subscriptions, which got a boost from our Google AI Pro and Ultra plans. Now some key highlights from Search, Cloud, YouTube and Waymo for the quarter. First up, this is an incredibly exciting moment for Search. We see AI powering an expansion in how people are searching for and accessing information, unlocking completely new kinds of questions you can ask Google. Overall queries and commercial queries on Search continue to grow year-over-year. And our new AI experiences significantly contributed to this increase in usage. We are also seeing that our AI features cause users to search more as they learn that search can meet more of their needs. That's especially true for younger users. Let me go deeper on our new search experiences. We know how popular AI Overviews are because they are now driving over 10% more queries globally for the types of queries that show them, and this growth continues to increase over time. AI Overviews are now powered by Gemini 2.5, delivering the fastest AI responses in the industry. We also saw strong growth in the use of multimodal search, particularly the combination of lens or Circle to Search together with AI overviews. This growth was most pronounced among younger users. Our new end-to-end AI search experience, AI Mode continues to receive very positive feedback, particularly for longer and more complex questions. It's still rolling out, but already has over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S. and India. We plan to keep enhancing the AI Mode experience for users by shipping great features fast. That includes our advanced research tool Deep Search and more personalized responses. Next, Google Cloud. We see strong customer demand, driven by our product differentiation and our comprehensive AI product portfolio. Four stats show this. One, the number of deals over $250 million, doubling year-over-year; two, in the first half of 2025, we signed the same number of deals over $1 billion that we did in all of 2024. Three, the number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 28% quarter-over-quarter; four, more than 85,000 enterprises, including LVMH, Salesforce and Singapore's DBS Bank now build with Gemini, driving a 35x growth in Gemini usage year-over-year. Our models have served on our AI infrastructure, which offers industry-leading performance and cost efficiency for both training and inference. Along with our AI accelerators, we introduced new innovations in storage, including Anywhere Cache, which improves inference latency by up to 70% and rapid storage, which delivers a 5x improvement in latency compared to leading hyperscalers. In addition, we have optimized AI software packages, including PyTorch and JAX with full open source supports for various AI training and serving demands. We've also integrated AI agents deeply into each of our cloud products. Wayfair is leveraging our databases integrated with AI to streamline data pipelines and deliver more personalized customer experiences. Vantel is leveraging our Gemini-powered data agents and BigQuery to review and act on product feedback more quickly. Target is using our Gemini-powered threat intelligence and security operations agents to improve cybersecurity. Capgemini is utilizing our AI software engineering agents to deliver higher- quality software faster by automating tasks from code generation to testing. And BBVA says Gemini and Google Workspace is saving employees nearly 3 hours per week by automating repetitive tasks. It's now rolling it out to 100,000 employees globally. We are also focused on building a flourishing AI agent ecosystem. We introduced an open source agent development kit, which now has over 1 million downloads in less than 4 months. We also introduced Agentspace, an open and interoperable enterprise chat search and agent platform. Gordon Food Service is bringing Agentspace to its U.S. employees, which is enabling better, more efficient decision-making. And over 1 million subscriptions have been booked for Agentspace ahead of its general availability. Turning now to YouTube. Nielsen data shows YouTube has led U.S. streaming watch time for over 2 years. A generation that grew up with YouTube on their devices is now increasingly watching their favorite creators and content on their televisions. That includes billions of sports fans, too. Globally, they consume more than 40 billion hours of sports content on YouTube annually. And in September, we'll stream the NFL's first Friday game of the season, live from Brazil. From sports to shorts, we now average over 200 billion daily views on YouTube Shorts. AI is helping improve our recommendations and auto dubbing, which translates to better returns for creators and brands by dramatically increasing the potential audiences they can reach. And today, we began rolling out a whole draft of new AI tools for creators on YouTube Shorts. Finally, YouTube continues to diversify its subscription options, recently expanding its premium light offerings to 15 new countries with more to come. And lastly, Waymo continues to scale and expand to safely serve more riders in more places. Last month, Waymo launched in Atlanta, more than doubled its Austin service territory and expanded its Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area territories by approximately 50%. Waymo also launched teen accounts, starting with riders aged 14 to 17 in Phoenix. Overall, great momentum here. The Waymo driver has now autonomously driven over 100 million miles on public roads. And the team is testing across more than 10 cities this year, including New York and Philadelphia. We hope to serve riders in all 10 in the future. As I said, a standout quarter. A big thank you, as always, to our employees and partners for an amazing Q2.

I'll quickly cover performance for Google Services for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks around the great progress we're delivering across search, ads, YouTube and partnerships. Google Services revenues were $83 billion for the quarter, up 12% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in Search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues. To add some further color to our results. The 12% increase in Search and other revenues was led by growth across all verticals with the largest contributions from retail and financial services. YouTube saw similar performance across verticals. It's 13% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response followed by brand. Starting with search and other revenues, which delivered over $54 billion in revenue for the quarter. Shifts like AI are what propels our industry forward. Gemini's native multimodality is helping bring the offline audio and visual world back into the online world, creating a number of opportunities for Search. Let me share a few examples. Take visual queries. Google Lens search is one of the fastest-growing query types on Search and grew 70% since this time last year. Majority of lens searches are incremental, and we're seeing healthy growth for shopping queries using lens. And you can obviously take this to the next level by moving from image to video-based capabilities like Search Live. And then there's Circle to Search, which is now in over 300 million Android devices. We've been adding capabilities to help people explore complex topics and ask follow- up questions without switching apps. For example, gamers can now use Circle to Search while playing mobile games to see an AI overview or answers. And just last week, we brought in new agentic capability directly into search for all U.S. users with AI-powered calling to local businesses. Finally, shopping, where in Q2, we introduced a virtual trial experience for search labs users in the U.S. Now people can try billions of clothing products on themselves virtually. Early results and engagement have been extremely positive, particularly with Gen Z users and we'll be bringing this functionality to all U.S. users imminently. All these innovations are opening up completely new ways for people to use technology, bringing the off-line world into the online world in ways that simply have not been possible before. Add in our amazing AI translation capabilities and just imagine the possibilities. People can access more content in the language and businesses, large and small, international or local can reach even more customers. I'm excited about how all of these elements will come together and the opportunities ahead of us in Search. Moving to ads where our strategy to reinvent the entire marketing process with AI is delivering value for our customers and our business. Last quarter, we introduced AI Max and Search, a new suite of AI-powered features in existing search campaigns. Advertisers that activate AI Max and Search campaigns typically see 14% more conversions. On media buying, Smart Bidding Exploration, the biggest update to bidding strategy in a decade brings better performance to advertisers by allowing them to bid on a less obvious but potentially higher value queries more often. Campaigns using Smart Bidding Exploration, see a 19% increase in conversions on average. Demand gen continues to drive revenue growth and deliver measurable impact for our customers. As an example, Depop, Etsy's resell clothing marketplace used a short only demand gen campaign to drive new customers to the site. Short drove 80% buyer brand load and double click-through rates versus benchmarks. On creatives, we launched Asset Studio using our latest models to help businesses, large and small, generate creative assets. Small businesses benefit from top quality assets and deployment scaling capabilities, but larger businesses can go faster from proof of concept to launch and resize at lower cost. Over 2 million advertisers now use Google's AI powered asset generation tools to run ads, a 50% increase on this time last year. Turning to YouTube, where we saw continued strong revenue growth driven by direct response followed by brand. YouTube creators are connected to the global site guys and trusted by their audiences like no others. As part of Brand Connect, we launched Creator partnership hub, which allows brands to more easily work with the right creators and tap into cultural moments. We introduced Veo 3, photo to video and generative effects to shorts, making content creation easier and offering unexplored avenues for creativity. We're seeing both the volume and the price of ads and shorts increase, particularly in developed markets. The feed-based nature of the product allows for more ad opportunities on average, and this growth is further supported by ad formats native to shorts, AI-powered ad creative resizing tools, improved ad targeting and the rise in viewer engagement. McDonald's U.S.A. harnessed the influence of YouTube creators to ignite awareness for the Minecraft movie meal. It leveraged YouTube Shorts partnership adds to increase its reach, generating a 3.3x higher view through rate than the industry benchmark. Finally, on CTV where the momentum continues. According to the gauge report by Nielsen, YouTube has been #1 in streaming watch time in the U.S. for more than 2 years, hitting a record high of 12.8% of total TV viewing in June 2025. In the past 12 months, YouTube ads viewed on CTV screens drove over 1 billion conversions. We saw strong growth in retail thanks to CTV shopping ads, which allows viewers to shop directly via QR codes, helping us leverage direct marketing opportunities. As always, I'll wrap up with the momentum we're seeing in partnerships, where our customers increasingly recognize the strength and breadth of Google's ability to help them transform their business with AI. For instance, a new partnership with PayPal will improve the digital commerce experience for their merchants and customers. PayPal will expand its Google Cloud adoption for AI-driven recommendations, transaction processing and enhanced security. The partnership also broadens the availability and functionality of PayPal's payment services and capabilities across a range of Google products. In closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions and commitment to our success and to our customers and partners for their continued trust.

I will start with the results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary on our outlook for the second half of 2025. We had another solid quarter in Q2. Consolidated revenue of $96.4 billion increased by 14% or 13% in constant currency. Search and YouTube advertising, subscription platforms and devices and Google Cloud each had double-digit revenue growth this quarter reflecting strong momentum across the business. Total cost of revenue was $39 billion, up 10%. Tech was $14.7 billion, up 10%; and other cost of revenue was $24.3 billion, up 10%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, followed by depreciation. Total operating expenses increased 20% to $26.1 billion. The biggest driver of growth was expense for legal and other matters, which reflected the impact of $1.4 billion charge related to a settlement in principle of certain legal matters. R&D investments increased by 16%, primarily driven by increases in compensation and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in advertising and promotional expenses. Operating income increased 14% this quarter to $31.3 billion and operating margin was 32.4%. Operating margin benefited from strong revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base, partially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier, and a significant increase in depreciation expense. Net income increased 19% to $28.2 billion, and earnings per share increased 22% to $2.31. We generated free cash flow of $5.3 billion in the second quarter and $66.7 billion for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow in the second quarter was affected by a sizable sequential increase in CapEx and cash tax payments as we make federal tax payments in the second quarter for both Q1 and Q2. We ended the quarter with $95 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Google Services revenues increased 12% to $82.5 billion reflecting strength in Google Search and YouTube advertising and subscriptions. Google Search and other revenues increased by 12% to $54.2 billion. Search and other revenues delivered growth across all verticals with the largest contributions coming from retail and financial services. YouTube advertising revenues increased 13% to $9.8 billion, driven by direct response advertising, followed by brand. Network advertising revenue of $7.4 billion were down 1%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues increased 20% to $11.2 billion, primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues. This growth was driven by YouTube subscription offerings followed by Google One, with the growth in paid subscriptions being the biggest driver of revenue growth. Google Services operating income increased 11% to $33.1 billion. Operating margin was flat year-on-year at 40.1% as healthy revenue growth and continued efficiency in our expense base were partially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which delivered very strong results this quarter. Revenues increased by 32% to $13.6 billion in the second quarter, reflecting growth in GCP across core and AI products at the rate that was much higher than cloud's overall revenue growth and growth in Google Workspace, driven by an increase in average revenue per seat and the number of seats. Google Cloud operating income increased to $2.8 billion, and operating margin increased from 11.3% to 20.7%. The expansion in cloud operating margin was driven by strong revenue performance and continued efficiencies in our expense base partially offset by higher technical infrastructure usage costs, which includes the associated depreciation. As we ramp our AI investments, we continue to focus on driving improvements in productivity and efficiency to offset growth in technical infrastructure-related expenses, particularly from higher depreciation. Google Cloud backlog increased 18% sequentially in Q2 and 38% year-over-year, reaching $106 billion at the end of the quarter. This growth was driven by strong demand for our products and services from both new and existing customers. As Sundar mentioned, we have signed multiple billion dollar plus deals in the first half of the year. As to our Other Bets in the second quarter, revenue were $373 million, and operating loss was $1.2 billion. Within Other Bets, we're allocating more resources to businesses like Waymo, where we see opportunities to create additional value. With respect to CapEx in the second quarter, our CapEx was $22.4 billion. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical infrastructure with approximately 2/3 of investments in servers and 1/3 in data centers and networking equipment. In Q2, we returned capital to shareholders through repurchase of stock of $13.6 billion and dividend payments of $2.5 billion. Turning to our outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business performance in the second half of 2025 as well as an updated outlook for full year CapEx. First, in terms of revenues, we're pleased with the overall momentum we're seeing across the business. At current spot rates, we could see a tailwind to our revenue in Q3. However, volatility in exchange rates could affect the impact of FX on Q3 revenue. As for our segments in Google Services, advertising revenues in the second half of 2025 will be affected by the following: The continued lapping of the strength we experienced in financial service verticals throughout 2024 and year-over-year comparisons will be negatively impacted by the strong spend on U.S. Election in the second half of 2024 and particularly on YouTube. In Cloud, as I mentioned, the demand for our products is high as evidenced by the continued revenue growth and the cloud backlog of $106 billion. While we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the pace of server deployment, we expect to remain in a tight demand supply environment going into 2026. Moving to investments. Given the strong demand for our cloud products and services, we now expect to invest approximately $85 billion in CapEx in 2025, up from a previous estimate of $75 billion. Our updated outlook reflects additional investment in servers, the timing of delivery of servers and an acceleration in the pace of data center construction, primarily to meet cloud customer demand. Looking out to 2026, we expect a further increase in CapEx due to the demand we're seeing from customers as well as growth opportunities across the company. We will provide more details on the 2026 CapEx outlook on a future earnings call. In terms of expenses, first, as I mentioned in our previous earnings call, the significant increase in our investments in CapEx over the past few years will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In the second quarter, depreciation increased $1.3 billion year-over-year to $5 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 35%. Given the recent increase in CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate and depreciation to accelerate further in Q3. Second, as we've previously said, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas. In the third quarter, we expect a sequential increase in total headcount additions due in part to the hiring of new graduates. And third, Q3 will reflect the expense associated with the upcoming August launch of the new Pixel family of products. In conclusion, as you heard from Sundar and Philipp, we're pleased with the momentum in the business and excited about the pace of innovation. Our full stack approach, which combines AI infrastructure, AI research and AI products and platforms position us well to deliver new products and services across the company. We're seeing great momentum with our efforts as demonstrated by the increase in cumulative token processed. Search revenues are seeing healthy growth with features like AI Overviews, AI Mode and Lens, offering new ways for users to access the information. Cloud has reached an annual revenue run rate of more than $50 billion and is delivering margin expansion while continue to invest to meet customer demand. And YouTube has expanded its addressable market by building new services like shorts which now averages over 200 billion daily views. We're excited to see the value our products and services are bringing to customers and partners around the globe. Now I'll turn it over to the operator, and Sundar and Philipp and I will take your questions.",1340.0,755.0,23.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,10.0,2.0,1.0,0.030463576158940398,0.005298013245033113,0.006622516556291391,0.006622516556291391,0.0,0.025165562913907286

How do you think about some of the implications of changed consumer behavior and how investors should think about that from the volume perspective versus the monetization perspective. So I think there's a lot of long-standing dynamics out there about clicks and click monetization that might be very different when you look out over the next 3 to 5 years. And Philipp, when you think about the evolution of YouTube, you made a number of comments there about subscription revenue. I'm just curious how you think about the mix of advertising versus subscription?

I don't think looking ahead, based on everything we are seeing, it's -- people are excited about AI. They are adopting it well across our products. For me just in multimodality how people have modified their behavior to include images, both through Lens and Circle to Search seamlessly as part of interacting with Google are early indications that people are going to be adopting through these moments very, very well. I think I'm trying to understand your question in terms of about clicks and click monetization, maybe that's something Philipp can touch on. But overall, we expect as we build out our organic experiences. We have a good understanding of how to continue training on monetization, so that will work well with organic experiences. And -- but we will lead with the organic experience. So in terms of newer surfaces like Gemini app, et cetera, we'll focus on the organic experience for the near term. But just like we are doing with AI Overviews and with AI Mode over time, we'll be able to bring very, very good commercial experiences there as well.

So on your question on YouTube subscriptions versus ads, look, I mean we love our ads business. We love our subscription business. YouTube subscriptions are increasingly important for YouTube. We'll definitely continue our long-term focus here. We had a strong growth across the YouTube subscription products, which includes, just to be clear, YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium. And I think one common theme for our subscription services in general is offering viewers more choice here. We also have a very deep understanding of the monetization side here. Where are we monetizing more with ads, where can we potentially monetize more with subscriptions.

And so that's why both of them are true at the same time. And -- but we are planning ahead, and we are investing and -- but overall, it's exciting to see the traction, particularly in cloud.

We actually don't manage to pay clicks and CPC targets. Some of the product and policy changes we make actually drive better monetization at the expense of paid clicks.

First one, Sundar, there's a lot of discussion about agentic search for commercial activities and agents that can be broadly deployed. Maybe could you just -- from a technology perspective, when you sit down with the engineering teams working on some of these new agentic capabilities that could come, what are some of the predominant technological hurdles they think need to be cleared in order to launch scalable agents for commercial queries, is the first one. And second one, I think in the past, you've updated us on stats on sources of internal efficiency you've seen from GenAI-enabled capabilities. Any updates there? And then any sort of learnings on friction points that also need to be overcome for some of these internal tools for GenAI?",131.0,60.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.016666666666666666,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.016666666666666666

Look, overall, we are definitely, in many ways when we built 2.5 -- our series of 2.5 models, particularly with Pro, et cetera. It's the direction where we are investing the most. There's definitely exciting progress, including in the models we haven't fully released yet. And the main gaps we're all trying to do is you're obviously chaining a sequence of events. And so being able to do it reliably the latency compounds, the cost compounds and being able to do it reliably in a way for the users all of this comes together. In each of this, we are making progress, and it all needs to kind of hang together. The good news is we are making robust progress. We think we are at the frontier there. And in all of these areas, when you look back on a 12-month basis, you end up making the models much more efficient for any given capability. So the forward-looking trajectory, I think, will really unlock these agentic experiences. We see the potential being able to do them, but they're a bit slow and costly and takes time, and sometimes are brittle, right? But they're making progress on all of that. And I think that's what will really unlock. And I expect 2026 to be the year in which people kind of use agentic experiences more broadly, right? And so it's an exciting opportunity ahead. On the second part, I think, when you say a source of generalization, I presume you're talking about how we are using all of this internally. Again, given you've asked a question about agents, we are now beginning to roll out agentic coding journeys for our software engineers within the company. And it's been exciting to see just over the last few months, particularly over the last few weeks, people are definitely doing more agentic workflows and software engineering as well internally. And that's a good example of the kind of the same experiences a few months ago, had a lot of friction points, but we are overcoming it and people are beginning to use internally on the coding side as well as in certain other areas of the company as well. So exciting progress. I expect it to be an active area where we will roll out journeys for our users as well.

At IO, you announced a partnership to Warby Parker to develop glasses. So I wonder if you show your view of how important a cycle of new devices will be to further scale AI and do you envision a world in which the more functional are essential to our consumer experience. That's one. And secondly, how does Google Search with AI Mode usage different -- differs, sorry, versus Gemini stand-alone apps.

So I think AI will particularly enable. You long had the promise of glasses and other form factors. But I think AI will spur a whole new wave of innovation there. We are super excited about our investment in glasses and found the experiences have taken a dramatic step- up compared to the last iteration. So I think it's been an exciting new emerging category, but I still expect phones to be at the center of the experience for the next 2 to 3 years at least. And so I still think that's going to be phones, would continue to be at the center of the consumer experience. But we are excited about the emerging categories as well. On your second question on AI Mode versus Gemini stand-alone app, broadly, there are some use cases where you can get a great experience in both places, but there are use cases which are very specific. I think where the queries are information-oriented but people really want to rely on the information, but I have the full power of AI. I think AI mode really shines in that. You can go there, and you know it's backed up. The Gemini models are using search deeply as a tool. And so it's on grounded in that search experience. And I think users are responding very positively to it. And whereas the Gemini stand-alone app, you see everything from -- people can have a long conversation of chat just trying to pass time, right, in the Gemini app. You've seen early cases where people may get into it in a therapy like experience, right? So these are all emerging experiences of what people do. And I think this is why I'm glad we have both surfaces and we can innovate in both of these areas.

First, could you just describe maybe Philipp, what you see in terms of the ad environment maybe for the back half of the year maybe versus last year? Does it seem as certain or as uncertain as it was last year, the results seemed pretty strong. Are there any unusual concerns you would have for the back half of the year? And then, Sundar, I want to ask you again about the 2 surfaces approach to Search. And you obviously got some -- you must have some internal metrics that would tell you that that's the optimal way for you to approach the market. But there's -- I'm sure there's a counterargument that just having that unified search and being able to discern the intent of the search, whether it's pure information or commercial, just from the query that, that could give you a material advantage over other offerings in the market. Just talk a little bit about what metrics you've seen that make it -- that make the two surface solutions seem to be optimal.",182.0,81.0,3.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.024691358024691357,0.08641975308641975,0.0,0.0,0.012345679012345678

Give you maybe some vertical color of it in Q2, Search and other performance was led by growth across all verticals. We mentioned the largest contributions from retail and financial services, which was primarily due actually to strength in insurance. We saw health care as a sizable contributor to growth as well. Look, we're only a few weeks into Q3.

Look, I think between these 2 surfaces, you're pretty much covering the entire breadth and depth of what humanity can possibly do. So I think the split for 2 surfaces to tackle at this moment. Obviously, you are right, Search is more information focused. And we think of the Gemini app as more your assistant, more personal, proactive and powerful assistant for every aspect of your daily life. And so you can imagine wanting to call deeply or create a long video, et cetera, like those things can be done by the Gemini app today better. Over time, like we've always done, we've gone through these evolutions before, like, as you point out, we can understand user intent better and abstract some of the complexity for our users. At one point, people used to go to -- query separately for text, differently from images, definitely from videos, et cetera, and we kind of made it all seamless with Universal Search. So we have the experience of being able to bring together experiences in a way that makes sense for users and do the heavy lifting for them. But I think when you're in this early stage of new emerging paradigms, I think we want to make sure we can meet them where they -- what they are expecting today. And over time, I think it will give us an opportunity to serve them better. So I think that's how we are thinking about it.",252.0,115.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.05217391304347826,0.008695652173913044,0.008695652173913044,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216

The first on Cloud, I'm just hoping maybe you could clarify your back half outlook. Given last quarter, you talked about some supply constraints that would ease towards the end of 2025, but yet you put up a really nice acceleration in 2Q. Now you're talking about some supply constraints easing into '26. If you could just clarify a little bit on the back half outlook for cloud given the strong results in 2Q? And then the second is a bigger picture question, which is, in agentic experience, does it democratize the web like Search did 2 decades ago, enabling discovery in the long tail? Or does it lead to more concentration with a smaller group of vertical winners?

On your first question on the cloud second half outlook and the comments I previously made on with regards to where we're going to see the capacity increase. So obviously, we're working hard to bring more capacity online, which means data centers and servers that are coming online. And we see more of an increase towards the back end of the year. But we're increasing capacity with every quarter that goes by, as you can see with the growth rates we've had both this quarter and the previous quarter. As Sundar mentioned earlier, this is not the type of investment that's a light switch. It takes time to make this investment. So what you're seeing now is investment we made some time ago, that's now translating to additional capacity coming online, but more of that towards the back end of the year. I will say, it's important as you think about cloud growth, not to think about this in a linear fashion, because the quarter-on-quarter growth rates could depend on the timing of capacity delivery and when that comes online, so that could move a little bit from quarter-to-quarter.",202.0,98.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.01020408163265306,0.030612244897959183,0.0,0.01020408163265306,-0.01020408163265306

And certainly, Gemini 2.5 has got some much good reviews. How are you doing with Gemini subscriptions. I know it's a focus area for the company. And anything you can kind of do to accelerate the consumer subscriptions of Gemini within Google One.

On the first thing on subscriptions, we definitely -- Google One has been an attractive value proposition powered by storage. But with now our AI plans, including both Pro and Ultra and particularly with the 2.5 series of models, we have definitely seen accelerated traction. So it was a very healthy quarter. And so we are definitely excited about the opportunities ahead. And you will find through this moment, I think, we'll be able to drive growth in that area based on our AI offerings. And so it's definitely an area we are both excited by, and we are actually seeing traction, particularly in the last quarter ever since we introduced 2.5 Pro. So we are excited about the trajectory there. On the CapEx on the cloud side, look, I think, we are definitely investing because we are delivering a lot of value through our cloud offerings. And I think it's important to understand as we build more and more of an installed base with Google Cloud. We have very high customer satisfaction. Our churn rates are very low, and we are much more efficient in the investments needed to grow those lines of businesses. So you're seeing all that play out in our margin trajectory, particularly if you look at it annually sequentially over the past few years.

This was a terrific quarter for Alphabet, driven by double-digit growth across every major part of our business. We are seeing AI now driving real business results across the company. We delivered our first ever $100 billion quarter. 5 years ago, our quarterly revenue was at $50 billion. Our revenue number has doubled since then, and we are firmly in the generative AI era. In parallel, we've built for the long term and diversified with successful businesses in cloud, YouTube and subscriptions. Our momentum is strong, and we are shipping at speed. As just a few examples: our first-party models, like Gemini, now process 7 billion tokens per minute via direct API used by our customers. The Gemini app now has over 650 million monthly active users, and queries increased by 3x from Q2. Cloud had another great quarter of accelerating growth with AI revenue as a key driver. Cloud backlog grew 46% quarter-over-quarter to $155 billion. And we crossed $300 million paid subscriptions led by growth in Google One and YouTube Premium. Today, I'll discuss progress in our full stack approach to AI and then share highlights from search, cloud, YouTube and Waymo. As a reminder, our full stack approach spans AI infrastructure, world-class research including models and tooling, and our products and platforms that bring AI to people everywhere. First up, AI infrastructure. Our extensive and reliable infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products is the foundation of our stack and a key differentiator. We are scaling the most advanced chips in our data centers, including GPUs from our partner, NVIDIA, as well as our own purposeful TPUs. And we are the only company providing a wide range of both. As we announced yesterday at NVIDIA GTC, we are now shipping the new A4X Max instances powered by NVIDIA GB300 to our cloud customers. Our highly sought-after TPU portfolio is led by our 7-generation TPU, Ironwood, which will be generally available soon. We are investing in TPU capacity to meet the tremendous demand we are seeing from customers and partners, and we are excited that Anthropic recently shared plans to access up to 1 million TPUs. Next world-class AI research, including models and tooling. Our models are world-leading. GEMINI 2.5 Pro, Veo, Genie 3 under viral sensation Nano Banana are among the very best in class. Over 230 million videos have been generated with Veo 3, and more than 13 million developers have built with our generative models. We are looking forward to the release of Gemini 3 later this year. Our research leadership is advancing next frontier technologies. Last week, we announced that our Willow quantum chip achieved a major breakthrough, running an algorithm 13,000x faster than 1 of the world's best supercomputers, and the result is verifiable, paving the way to future practical applications. Speaking of quantum, let me congratulate Michel Devoret, our Chief Scientist for Quantum Hardware. He received a Nobel in physics for early research he did in the 1980s. Three Nobels awarded to current Googlers in 2 years, incredible. And third, our products and platforms. We are bringing AI to more people and developers than anyone else. In July, we announced that we processed 980 trillion monthly tokens across all our surfaces. We are now processing over 1.3 quarterly and monthly tokens, more than 20x growth in a year, phenomenal. This quarter, we took big steps to reimagine Chrome as a browser powered by AI through deep integrations with Gemini and AI Mode in search with more agentic capabilities coming soon. In August at Made by Google, we unveiled our Pixel 10 series of devices. They are the first with our most powerful chip designed to run on Gemini Tensor G5. They're our best reviewed devices ever. And last week, we launched Android XR, our new operating system at Samsung's Galaxy XR device. It brings new ways to use headsets and glasses with Gemini at the core. Now turning to highlights from Search. AI is driving an expansionary moment for Search. As people learn what they can do with our new AI experiences, they're increasingly coming back to Search more. Search and its AI experiences are built to highlight the web, sending billions of clicks to sites every day. During the Q2 call, we shared that overall queries and commercial queries continue to grow year-over-year. This growth rate increased in Q3, largely driven by our AI investments in Search, most notably AI Overviews and AI Mode. Let me dive into the momentum we are seeing. As we have shared before, AI Overviews drive meaningful query growth. This effect was even stronger in Q3 as users continue to learn that Google can answer more of their questions, and it's particularly encouraging to see the effect was more pronounced with younger people. We're also seeing that AI Mode is resonating well with users. In the U.S., we have seen strong and consistent week-over-week growth in usage since launch and queries doubled over the quarter. Over the last quarter, we rolled out AI Mode globally across 40 languages in record time. It now has over 75 million daily active users, and we shipped over 100 improvements to the product in Q3, an incredibly fast pace. Most importantly, AI Mode is already driving incremental total query growth for Search. Philipp will talk more about monetization and share how AI is helping people connect with businesses and shop on Search. Next, Google Cloud. Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins and backlog. In Q3, customer demand strengthened in 3 ways. One, we are signing new customers faster. The number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 34% year-over-year. Two, we are signing larger deals. We have signed more deals over $1 billion through Q3 this year than we did in the previous 2 years combined. Third, we are deepening our relationships. Over 70% of existing Google Cloud customers use our AI products, including Banco BV, Best Buy and FairPrice Group. As we scale, we are diversifying revenue. Today, 13 product lines are each at an annual run rate over $1 billion. And we are improving operating margin with highly differentiated products built with our own technology. This deep product differentiation starts with our AI infrastructure. We have a decade of experience building AI accelerators and today, offer the widest array of chips. This leadership is winning customers like HCA Healthcare, LG AI Research and Macquarie Bank, and it's why 9 of the top 10 AI labs choose Google Cloud. We are also the only cloud provider offering our own leading generative AI models including Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and Lyria. Adoption is rapidly accelerating. In Q3, revenue from products built on our generative AI models grew more than 200% year-over-year. Over the past 12 months, nearly 150 Google Cloud customers each processed approximately 1 trillion tokens with our models for a wide range of applications. For example, WPP is creating campaigns with up to 70% efficiency gains. Swarovski has increased e-mail open rates by 17% and accelerated campaign localization by 10x. Earlier this month, we launched Gemini Enterprise, the new front door for AI in the workplace, and we are seeing strong adoption for agents built on this platform. Our packaged enterprise agents in Gemini Enterprise are optimized for a variety of domains, are highly differentiated and offer significant out-of-box value to customers. We have already crossed 2 million subscribers across 700 companies. Next, YouTube. In the living room, YouTube has remained #1 in streaming watch time in the U.S. for more than 2 years, according to Nielsen. Last month marked YouTube's first time as a live NFL broadcaster. This exclusive global broadcast live from Brazil drew more than 19 million fans and set a new record for most concurrent viewers of a live stream on YouTube. YouTube Shorts also continues to perform well. In the U.S., Shorts now earn more revenue per watch hour than traditional in-stream on YouTube. At our Made on YouTube event, we rolled out a number of AI-powered features that are helping create a supercharged creation and build their businesses. AI is now streamlining the entire content creation workflow from generated video tools and more efficient editing to AI-powered insights that help creators optimize their channels. We are also using AI to expand monetization, automatically identifying products to make their videos more shoppable. Philipp will discuss in more detail. And finally, Waymo, next year Waymo aims to open service in London, and they are working to bring service to Tokyo. They've also announced expansions to Dallas, Nashville, Denver and Seattle and secured permission to operate fully autonomously at San Jose and San Francisco Airports. Autonomous testing continues to scale in New York City. The new Waymo for Business allows enterprises to offer Waymo as a work travel option. And we launched Waymo teens accounts in Phoenix this summer. We are pleased to see usage steadily increase with positive feedback from teens and their parents alike. Waymo's growth and momentum are strong, and 2026 is shaping up to be an exciting year. Overall, a milestone quarter, the incredible work of our teams is driving momentum across the board and our leadership in AI positions us so well for the opportunity ahead. I want to thank all of our partners and our employees for their hard work and an excellent Q3. With that, I'll turn it over to Philipp.",1577.0,791.0,39.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,0.0493046776232617,0.0012642225031605564,0.0037926675094816687,0.0,0.0012642225031605564,0.04804045512010114

I'll quickly cover performance for Google Services for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks around the great progress we're delivering across search, ads, YouTube and partnerships. Google Services revenues were $87 billion for the quarter, up 14% year-on-year driven by accelerated growth in Search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues. Adding some further color to our results. The 15% increase in Search and other was led by growth across all major verticals with the largest contributions from retail and financial services. YouTube saw similar performance across verticals. Its 15% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response followed by brand. Starting with Search and other revenues, which delivered over $56 billion in revenue for the quarter. As Sundar mentioned, AI is driving an expansionary moment and transforming how people use Google Search. Our investments in new AI experiences, such as AI Overviews and AI Mode, continued to drive growth in overall queries, including commercial queries, creating more opportunities for monetization. These AI experiences are enhancing how people connect with businesses and shop on Search. We recently added shopping capabilities in AI Mode, which now help people shop conversationally in Search, and we expanded try-on capabilities to more clothing items, now available to anyone in the U.S. Lastly, we're making it easier for consumers to benefit from deals through new loyalty offerings like personalized annotations on organic results and ads. Looking at monetization. Businesses can now tap into our most powerful AI search experiences. Using our most advanced AI models, we can understand and predict intent like never before, unlocking entirely new commercial pathways to provide valuable new consumer connections and helping us monetize even more efficiently. Rolled out globally in September, AI Max and Search is already used by hundreds of thousands of advertisers, currently making it the fastest-growing AI-powered search ads product. In Q3 alone, AI Max unlocked billions of net new queries. By delivering the most relevant ad across surfaces and matching advertisers against additional queries they weren't reaching before, AI Max helps advertisers discover new customers at the exact moment they need their product or service. Kayak, for example, look to grow conversions while staying within their ROAS goals. After turning on AI Max and Search, they grew their conversion value by 12% in early tests. We continue to infuse generative AI capabilities at every step of the marketing process. We rolled out Imagen 4 in Asset Studio and Product Studio, helping businesses produce more and better creatives. On the measurement front, we enriched the model supporting Meridian, our marketing mix model, with additional variables, and more granular reporting in PMax is making bidding more effective. Financial services company SoFi has been using PMax to meet its ambitious growth targets and help drive a 39% improvement in its conversion volume year-over-year. Moving to YouTube, where we saw accelerated revenue growth. Our recommendation systems are driving robust watch time growth in our key monetization areas like shorts and living room. As we leverage Gemini models, we're seeing further discovery improvement. On direct response, we're excited about the growth in revenue we're seeing, especially from small and medium advertisers adopting demand gen. We also improved performance on demand gen with over 100 launches helping to increase conversion value by more than 40% for advertisers using target-based bidding on YouTube. The retail vertical continues to lead our growth on YouTube with demand gen helping us further monetize shopping-related categories. Looking at the living room, our long-term bet, more advertisers are adopting interactive direct response ads, leading to an annual revenue run rate exceeding $1 billion globally for this format. For our viewers, we continue to give fans greater access across sports, while tapping into the best of YouTube's product innovation and creator-led content. Sundar mentioned that we expanded our NFL partnership with our first-ever exclusive global broadcast of an NFL game. Brands love the opportunity, and we sold all our ad inventory within a couple of weeks. Looking at creators. A significant force behind the thriving YouTube creator economy is the collaboration between creators and brands. Tools like direct linking to deals, websites and shorts and swappable brand segments in long form will soon help creators show how they deliver great value for brands. Thanks to a collaboration with Dude Perfect, Comcast, Xfinity drove an 8% search lift, beating other Xfinity ads, recall lift on shorts by 34%. At the same time, it decreased the cost per lifted user by 50% when compared to the next most efficient ad. We continue to invest in AI-powered features that are helping creators supercharge creation and build their businesses. with Veo 3 integration and speech to song, creators go from idea to iteration quicker, and new channel insights help them better understand performance. Ending on YouTube with our subscriptions product. We're also seeing momentum with strong growth in offerings such as YouTube Music and Premium and YouTube TV. We're also applying Gemini internally to help us serve customers with increased speed, intelligence and efficiency. Our sales teams use Gemini enriched with ads knowledge to streamline customer interactions. This increased productivity by over 10% led to hundreds of millions in incremental revenue and frees up sellers to engage with more customers at a deeper, more strategic level. In our customer support division, Gemini-powered solutions have managed over 40 million customer sessions so far this year and resolved hundreds of thousands of customer inquiries, and we're just getting started. As always, I'll wrap with the progress we're seeing across partnerships where our customers tap into the strength and breadth of Google's products to accelerate their transformation. Revolut, the global financial services company, leverages Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform and Gemini models to help power its advanced customer service chatbot, develop new hyper-personalized financial products and offer predictive insights.

I will start with results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary on our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2025. We had an outstanding quarter in Q3, continuing the strong momentum we've had throughout the year, delivering double-digit revenue growth across Search and YouTube advertising, subscriptions, platforms and devices, and Google Cloud. Consolidated revenue reached $102.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase or 15% in constant currency. Total cost of revenue was $41.4 billion, up 13%. TAC was $14.9 billion, up 8%. Other cost of revenues was $26.5 billion, up 16%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs largely for YouTube, followed by depreciation and other technical infrastructure operations costs. Total operating expenses increased 28% to $29.7 billion. R&D expenses increased by 22%, driven by compensation, depreciation expenses related to our AI efforts. Sales and marketing expenses were flat, and G&A expenses increased meaningfully, primarily due to the $3.5 billion charge related to the European Commission fine mentioned in the earnings press release. Operating income increased 9% this quarter to $31.2 billion, and operating margin was 30.5%. Excluding the EC fine, operating income increased 22%, and operating margin was 33.9%. Operating margin benefited from strong revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base, offset by the legal charge and a significant increase in depreciation expense. Other income and expenses was $12.8 billion, primarily due to unrealized gains in our nonmarketable equity securities portfolio. Net income increased 33% to $35 billion, and earnings per share increased 35% to $2.87. We generated free cash flow of $24.5 billion in the third quarter and $73.6 billion for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow in Q3 benefited from strong operating cash flow and recent tax changes regarding the timing of when research and development costs are expensed and assets are depreciated. This was partially offset by higher CapEx. We ended the quarter with $98.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Google Services revenues increased 14% to $87.1 billion, reflecting strength in Google Search, YouTube advertising and subscriptions. Google Search and other advertising revenues increased by 15% to $56.6 billion, representing another robust quarter with continued growth across all major verticals with the largest contributions from retail and financial services. YouTube advertising revenues increased 15% to $10.3 billion driven by direct response advertising, followed by brand. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 3%. Subscriptions, platforms and devices revenues increased 21% this quarter to $12.9 billion, driven by very strong growth in both YouTube and Google One subscriptions. Google Services operating income increased 9% to $33.5 billion. Operating margin declined year-over-year to 38.5% as healthy revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base were offset by the impact of the EC fine, which was fully reflected in the Google Services segment. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which again delivered very strong results this quarter as cloud continued to benefit from our enterprise AI optimized stack, including our own custom TPUs and our industry-leading AI models. Cloud revenue increased by 34% to $15.2 billion in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in GCP, which continued to grow at a rate that was much higher than Cloud's overall revenue growth rate. GCP's growth was driven by enterprise AI products, which are generating billions in quarterly revenue. We had strong growth in enterprise AI infrastructure and enterprise AI solutions, which benefited from demand for our industry-leading models, including Gemini 2.5. Core GCP was also a meaningful contributor to growth. And we had double-digit growth in Workspace, which was driven by an increase in average revenues per seat and the number of seats. Cloud operating income increased by 85% to $3.6 billion, and operating margin increased from 17.1% in the third quarter last year to 23.7% this quarter. The expansion in Cloud operating margin was driven by strong revenue performance and continued efficiencies in our expense base partially offset by higher technical infrastructure usage costs, which includes depreciation expense and other operations costs such as energy. Google Cloud's backlog increased 46% sequentially and 82% year-over-year, reaching $155 billion at the end of the third quarter. The increase was driven primarily by strong demand for enterprise AI. As Sundar mentioned earlier, Cloud has signed more billion-dollar deals in the first 9 months of 2025 than in the past 2 years combined. In Other Bets, revenues were $344 million, and operating loss was $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Within Other Bets, we continue to allocate more resources to businesses like Waymo, where we see opportunities to create substantial value. With respect to CapEx, in the third quarter, our CapEx was $24 billion. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical infrastructure with approximately 60% of that investment in servers and 40% in data centers and networking equipment. In Q3, we returned capital to shareholders through repurchases of stock of $11.5 billion and dividend payments of $2.5 billion. Turning to our outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on factors that will impact our business performance in the fourth quarter of 2025 as well as an updated outlook for CapEx for the year. First, in terms of revenues, we're pleased with the overall momentum of our business. At the current spot rates, we could see an FX tailwind to our revenues in Q4. However, the volatility in exchange rates could affect the impact of FX on Q4 revenues. As for our segments, in Google Services, year-over-year comparisons in advertising will be negatively impacted by the strong spend on U.S. elections in the fourth quarter of 2024, particularly on YouTube. In Cloud, demand for our products remains high as evidenced by the accelerating revenue growth and the $49 billion sequential increase in Cloud backlog in Q3. In GCP, we see strong demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, including TPUs and GPUs, enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for Gemini 2.5 and our other AI models, and core GCP infrastructure and other services such as cybersecurity and data analytics. As I've mentioned on previous earnings calls, while we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the pace of server deployments and data center construction, we still expect to remain in a tight demand-supply environment in Q4 and 2026. Moving to investments. We're continuing to invest aggressively due to the demand we're experiencing from Cloud customers as well as the growth opportunities we see across the company. We now expect CapEx to be in the range of $91 billion to $93 billion in 2025, up from our previous estimate of $85 billion, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in the reported CapEx number. Looking out to 2026, we expect a significant increase in CapEx, and we'll provide more detail on our fourth quarter earnings call. In terms of expenses, first, as I've mentioned on the previous earnings calls, the significant increase in our investments in technical infrastructure will continue to put pressure on the P&L in the form of higher depreciation expenses and related data center operations costs such as energy. In the third quarter, depreciation increased $1.6 billion year-over-year to $5.6 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 41%. Given the overall increase in CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate slightly in Q4. Second, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year in part to support product launches and the holiday season. Q3 was a strong quarter, and we're excited with the adoption of our AI products helped by a rapid pace of innovation and great execution by our teams. This translated into strong momentum in Search, YouTube ads, subscription, platforms and devices in Cloud, resulting in our first $100 billion-plus quarter. Now Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.",1292.0,714.0,29.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,0.04061624649859944,0.0070028011204481795,0.0070028011204481795,0.0014005602240896359,0.0,0.03361344537815126

There's a lot of external Wall Street discussion about agentic e-commerce potentially monetizing at a lower rate than search. So the question is what factors are you most focused on to sort of ensure a smooth transition for your search business and for your advertisers as you move over to a more agentic world? And the second one, Sundar, is on Waymo. How far are we from an integration of Waymo into more of the core Gemini capabilities and the users on the platform taking your user data of where I'm going, what hotel I'm staying at, what airport I'm staying at and having integrated that into Waymo? If you can actually have users use their profiles to pre-schedule Waymos, how far off is that?

This is all early, but we see agentic experiences really as additive to the way people seek information. It helps us answer people's tough questions. It helps us -- it helps people get stuff done, and it helps businesses in the process. And we're working on multiple agentic experiences across key verticals such as travel, commerce, shopping and so on, and we're paying a lot of attention to creating a seamless user experience but also to the fact that we need to integrate different partner ecosystems in a way that it creates value for them. And by the way, we're also working closely with a lot of our partners on the other side through our cloud services to improve their own agentic experiences. And so maybe we go a little deeper on the shopping side where we actually use AI already very actively to improve the shopping experience. As you know, we launched a more visual experience on AI Mode. That gives people a much more intuitive conversational way to shop. You can simply describe what you're looking for now like the way you talk to a friend, and we'll show you the visual shopping results. And then we think about building an agentic shopping future and it has to be one, again, that benefits both users and merchants here. And you know that AIO, we also introduced new agentic checkout, which will let shoppers use like agentic AI to buy products from merchant sites and so on. We have a partnership with PayPal to help merchants build agentic commerce experiences. We have a new open protocols for agent-to-agent transactions and so on and so on.",286.0,138.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,0.007246376811594203,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'm scheduled to meet with the team to do a review on it in a few weeks out. Look, it is an exciting time. Waymo clearly is scaling up, particularly in 2026. And I think the possibility, as you said, of Gemini, particularly with the multimodal experience as well as services like YouTube, I think there's a real opportunity to make the in-car experience dramatically better.

And I guess, in particular, when you think about AI Overviews and AI Mode, we know that query growth is accelerating. But can you help us understand from there kind of what happens in terms of clicks per query and conversion rates and pricing in these AI-driven search formats? And then, Anat, can you talk about where you see opportunities in the core cost base as you look to make room to absorb the rapid growth in infrastructure and depreciation going forward?",100.0,46.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216

In Q3, Search and other revenues again delivered growth across all major verticals, as we said, was from retail and financial services. Health care was also a contributor to the growth here. Our new AI experiences, you mentioned the AI Overviews, AI Mode, continued to drive growth in overall queries, including commercial queries, really creating more opportunities for monetization. AI Overviews is scaling up and working for our entire user base. We're now scaled to over 2 billion users here, and we're continuing to expand ads in AI Overviews in English to more countries, across desktop, mobile and so on. And as I've shared before, for AI Overviews, even at our current baseline of ads below and within the AI's response, overall, we see the monetization at approximately the same rate. So over time, we're excited about the opportunity of richer experiences in AI Mode and AI Overviews to basically open up then the opportunity for also much richer placements. And I think as I've said on a prior call, we manage the business to drive great outcomes for our users and an attractive ROI for advertisers. We don't really manage to paid clicks and CPC targets. But as you will see in the 10-Q, paid clicks were up 7% year-on-year and CPCs were up 7% year-on-year.",236.0,112.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.044642857142857144,0.0,0.008928571428571428,0.0,0.0,0.044642857142857144

Some of the areas are things that you've heard us talk about in the past such as moderating the pace of head count growth, optimizing real estate footprint but also as we invest more and more in our technical infrastructure, ensuring that we are optimizing that build-out and the overall technical infrastructure we have that a lot of the data centers, for example, that we build ourselves, so they're optimized and we make sure we do them in the most efficient way. Sundar mentioned on one of the previous calls the productivity associated with leveraging AI for Google. So this -- the example, the percent of code, now nearly half of all code generated by AI, that's a way for us to leverage AI to drive further productivity across the business. And obviously, we always look at making sure that when we provide services or products that we get the right economics and the right value for what we provide. So the one good example is Shorts, which has a lower revenue share than in stream that helps to improve some of our gross margins. So this is an effort. We have ongoing -- I've mentioned in the past that we have a headwind with depreciation, obviously, increasing alongside our CapEx increase. So we're -- we have efforts across the organization to ensure we run the business in the most disciplined and productive way while continuing to invest for future growth.",322.0,138.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.007246376811594203,0.007246376811594203,0.0,0.0,0.036231884057971016

Sundar, when you think about your custom silicon efforts across the organization, can you reflect a little bit about the opportunity set you see with each passing generation of custom silicon both in terms of driving operating efficiencies inside the organization and potentially increased monetization efforts around those outside of the organization? Second question would be for Philipp. Obviously, we could see the YouTube advertising revenue number in the reported results. Can you reflect little bit about the scaling of the subscription side of YouTube offerings and how the 2 parts together maybe represent an interesting framework in thinking about the monetization side of YouTube increasingly being a mix of both ads and subscription?",117.0,62.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.016129032258064516,0.06451612903225806,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516

It is one of the key drivers of our growth over the past year. And I think on a going-forward basis, I think we continue to see very strong demand, and we are investing to meet that. I do think a big part of what differentiates Google Cloud effectively, we are the -- we have taken a full -- deep full stack approach to AI. So we are -- and that really plays out, right? We are the only hyperscaler who is really building offerings on our own models, and we are also highly differentiated on our own technology.

Obviously, it, first of all, starts with the creators, and we have significantly invested here to be the place that YouTube creators really call their home. That's a big piece of it, the #1 piece. Viewers, of course, YouTube has billions of monthly logged-in users and every day, people watch billions of hours of video. And we talked about how our recommendation systems are driving robust watch time growth and so on and so on. So on the monetization side, YouTube's business is really powered, I would say, at, let's call it, a twin engine monetization strategy, combining its advertising business and its growing subscription services. Both YouTube ads and subscription saw strong growth this quarter. And so looking at YouTube Music and Premium, users are, on average, delivering more value to creators, to music, media partners and YouTube itself than even ad-supported users do. So in other words, on average, a YouTube Music and Premium subscriber generates a meaningful higher gross profit than they were simply an ad-supported users. Fans come from all over the world. You know this and this engagement through ads and subscription generates YouTube's revenues and funds what I started with, these creators here and this then drives more viewership and engagement and so on. And that's the flywheel. And so our priority continues like this growth cycle.

And then -- but there's a core group, which really likes AI Mode and is passionate about it, and so you see the early adopters. The product is resonating very strongly, and they are seeking it out. So I think that's how I would highlight the difference. With Gemini, again, a set of engaged user base who are seeking out the product and so on, but across the board, I think the trajectory has been we are definitely seeing in each of those use cases, a set of early adopters and then more people coming in and the people who are using it continue to use it more over time and report high user satisfaction.

And the question related to ROIC and how we look at just overall our business and where do we see early signs that are encouraging, so first, I would say it's not just early signs because we're seeing returns, obviously, in the Cloud business. You've heard us talk about the fact that we already are generating billions of dollars from AI in the quarter. But then across the board, we have a rigorous framework and approach by which we evaluate these long-term investments that are meant to do 2 things. One is to ensure we have -- we built a resilient growth profile for the company, but also that we meet the demand of the customers that we have here in the more near and midterm. So we look at it across the business. We evaluate the potential return for each one of them whether it's in Cloud, and I think that's more visible, obviously, externally given that you see the revenue generated and the fact that we're unable to meet, at this point, customer demand. We have more demand than we have supplied. In our ads business, you see the fact that we're investing to transform search, as you heard from Philipp and Sundar, with AIO and AI Mode. So we're excited to see what our investments are -- how our investments are helping advertisers as well; YouTube, where it's helping power recommendations. So we're -- when we make a decision on investment in the long term, we go through a very rigorous process of assessing what the return could be and over what time frame we will see that return to give us the high level of confidence to then invest and make those investments for the long term. So it's a very rigorous approach.",306.0,130.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.015384615384615385,0.007692307692307693,0.0,0.0,0.0

About 20% of Google's search queries are commercial historically, and you've talked a bunch on this call about how AI Overviews are kind of expanding the breadth of queries.

Separately, there is the question of whether queries actually increase with AI Mode, and Sundar actually talked about it and mentioned the opportunity that he sees here. So I think it's important to separate those 2 things. And I personally also see this, what I just said in my last remarks, that I think, over time, there's an opportunity to actually take, let's say, queries that are not fully commercial but could have an adjacent commercial relationship to basically expand this into more attractive ads offerings without -- while really creating a really interesting user experience at the same time.",125.0,60.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.016666666666666666,0.016666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.05

And the only thing I would add is just stepping back broadly, I think AI Overviews and AI Mode are dramatically improving search.

First, it appears more and more clear that all the new modes -- Google with Gemini Overview -- AI Overviews, AI Mode, even ChatGPT is growing the addressable market for engagement and search-like behavior. Could you talk about what gives you confidence that it will also grow the addressable market for marketing activity and overall revenue associated with that behavior? That's question one. And question two is just more about as you think about AI Mode, AI Overviews and traditional Google Search, how do you think -- do you see a world in 12 to 24 months, those all will exist? And does the user eventually pick what mode they want? Is -- does the algorithm pick the mode? Can you talk a little bit about how you think that will progress over the next 12 to 24 months?",136.0,65.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.046153846153846156,0.03076923076923077,0.0,0.0,-0.03076923076923077

Look, I think it's a dynamic moment, and I think we are meeting people in the moment with what they are trying to do. Obviously, search is evolving, and between AI Overviews and AI Mode, I think we are able to kind of give that range of experience for people in this moment. Over time, you will expect us to -- you can expect us to make the experiences simpler in a way that, just like we did universal search many, many years ago, we may have done text search, image search, video search, et cetera, and then we kind of brought it together as universal search. So you will see evolutions like that, but I think we want to be sensitive to making sure we are meeting the users in terms of what they are looking for. I think Gemini allows us to build a more personal, proactive, powerful AI assistant for that moment. And I think having the 2 surfaces search in Gemini allows us to really serve users across the breadth of their needs. And -- but over time, we will thoughtfully look for opportunities to make the experience better for users. And to the first part, I would broadly say, as I do think we've been consistently saying for a while now, this is an expansionary moment, and we are seeing people engage more. And I think when they do that, naturally, a portion of that information for users, those journeys are commercial in nature. So I would expect that to play out over time as well.",262.0,122.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.03278688524590164,0.0,0.00819672131147541,0.0,0.0,0.03278688524590164

Maybe you can comment on the pace of innovation in frontier models. Is there still just a tremendous amount of innovation? Or is it slowing at all?

Look, I think 2 things are both simultaneously true. I'm incredibly impressed by the pace at which the teams are executing and the pace at which we are improving these models. But it also is true at the same time that each of the prior model you're trying to get better over is now getting more and more capable. So I think both the pace is increasing, but sometimes we are taking the time to put out a notably improved model, so I think -- and that may take slightly longer. But I do think the underlying pace is phenomenal to see. And I'm excited about our Gemini 3.0 release later this year. On cloud, I would point out as a sign of the momentum, I think the number of deals greater than $1 billion that we signed in the first 3 quarters of this year are greater than the 2 years prior. So we are definitely seeing strong momentum, and we are executing at pace. And in terms of long-term economics, I would say that, again, us being a full stack AI player and the fact that we are developing highly differentiated products on our own technology, I think, will help us drive a good trajectory here as you have seen over the past few years.",230.0,104.0,8.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693
