I initially rated Alphabet as 'Hold' due to concerns about Gemini. But after the recent earnings, I've decided to upgrade to 'Buy' - read on. Revenue growth in Q2 2024 amounted to 14% YoY, while EPS went up by 31.25%. Both actual figures beat the consensus.

For Alphabet's Q3 earnings results, Street consensus is expecting $1.84 in EPS on $86.3 billion in revenue and $26.44 billion in operating income, for expected y-o-y growth of 19%, 13% and 24% respectively. Unlike the EPS estimate revisions, which have remained stable since the April '24 quarter, Google's revenue estimate revisions have seen downward revisions of late, particularly the 2026 column, even though 2025 estimates remain fairly stable. Trading at $165 per share, Google is valued at 22x '24 EPS for estimated EPS growth of 20% and 14% in 2024 and 2025. The stock is quite cheap on a PEG basis, even at today's levels."

Outside of NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) recent share price going stratospheric, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a Wall Street darling since the company IPO’d in May 1997 at a split-adjusted price of $.07. Today, Amazon stock trades for $206.35, which means that stock is up over 211324.18% since May 1997, turning every $1000 invested into $2.114 million today. The only thing that matters from this point on is what the stock will do for the next 1, 5, and 10 years and beyond. Let’s crunch the numbers and give you our best guest on Amazon’s future share price. No one has a crystal ball and even the Wall Street “experts” are often wrong more than they are right in predicting future stock prices. We will walk through our assumptions and provide you with the story around the numbers (other sites just pick a share price without explaining why they suggest the price they do). Key Points in this Article: Future stock performance hinges on Amazon’s growth in e-commerce, AWS, and advertising amidst increasing competition. Amazon’s revenue grew 540% in the last decade, with net income rising to $30.42 billion in 2023 and projections over the next 5 years at 4.5x.

Recent Amazon Stock Updates and News 11/12/2024- Amazon confirmed that a recent cyberattack has exposed sensitive data from its employees. The breach was facilitated through a third-party property management vendor. The threat actor, known as “Nam3L3ss”, is a prominent figure in the cybercrime world. They leaked over 2.8 lines of Amazon employee data on BreachForums, alongside data from 25 other major organizations. 11/11/2024- Amazon is in the process of developing a new tool for its delivery drivers: smart eyeglasses. These glasses are intended to help drivers with turn-by-turn navigation to hopefully shave time off deliveries. 11/8/2024- Amazon’s stock price dipped slightly today, falling 0.8% during midday trading, reaching as low as $208.29. Trading volume was much lower than usual, with only about 7.8 million shares changing hands compared to the average daily volume of over 41 million shares. 11/7/2024- Amazon’s recently approved delivery drone service has begun in the Phoenix metro area. The MK30 drones can deliver packages weighing 5 pounds or less, but only during daylight hours. 11/6/2024- Recent speculation has suggested that Amazon’s new five-day in-office mandate is a veiled attempt to downsize its workforce or fulfill a deal with local governments. However, CEO Andy Jassy has emphasized that the company’s decision is unrelated to either theory. 11/5/2024- The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved Amazon’s new delivery drones. These new drones are smaller and can fly beyond the visual line of sight of pilots. 11/4/2024- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) denied Amazon’s request to draw more power from a nearby Pennsylvania nuclear plant. This decision could hinder efforts by Amazon and other tech giants to secure additional energy from nuclear sources to fuel their growing AI operations. 10/31/2024- Amazon released its third-quarter financial report today, reporting numbers beyond Wall Street expectations. The company reported a revenue of $158.9 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $157.2 billion. Earnings per share came in at $1.43 compared to the $1.16 anticipated by Bloomberg analysts. 10/28/2024- Tom Hoggett, the driving force behind Amazon’s rapid grocery expansion, has left the company to become the Chief Operating Officer of Wonder, a food hall startup. 10/25/2024- Amazon’s third-quarter earnings report is scheduled for release next Thursday (October 31st). Investors are eager to see if the company can deliver results that meet their expectations this time around, especially after a mixed performance in the second quarter. Amazon’s Recent Stock Success Here’s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2017. Share Price Revenues* Net Income* 2014 $19.94 $89.0 ($.241) 2015 $15.63 $107.0 $.596 2016 $32.81 $136.0 $2.371 2017 $37.90 $177.9 $3.03 2018 $58.60 $232.9 $10.07 2019 $73.26 $280.5 $11.59 2020 $93.75 $386.1 $21.33 2021 $163.50 $469.8 $33.36 2022 $167.55 $514.0 ($2.72) 2023 $85.46 $574.78 $30.42 *Revenue and Net Income in Billions In the last decade, Amazon’s revenue grew about 540% while its net income moved from losing money to 30.42 billion in profits this past year. The ride up wasn’t always smooth, however. For example, in 2020, sales jumped 38%, and net income nearly doubled. 2021 saw a continued boom as people moved to e-commerce shopping during Covid. However, all those sales being “pulled forward” led to challenges in 2022, and the company swung to a surprise loss. As Amazon embarks into the back half of the decade, a few different key areas will determine its performance. 3 Key Drivers of Amazon’s Stock Performance E-Commerce Success: While Covid brought record sales to Amazon, it also led to many competitors investing heavily to compete with Amazon online. While e-commerce is still just 15% of retail sales, putting up huge growth rates in online sales won’t be as easy in the coming years as it was a decade ago. Amazon Web Services: Amazon Web Services 1st quarter 2024 revenue was $25.04 billion and the unit should break $100 billion in total sales this year. However, the unit’s 13% year-over-year growth isn’t as fast as competing cloud services like Microsoft’s (Nasdaq: MSFT) Azure and Google’s (Nasdaq: GOOGL) Cloud. Amazon is at risk of falling behind Microsoft before 2030 if it can’t stop market share losses. Advertising: Amazon exits 2023 with a $47 billion advertising business that grew 24% in 2023. Advertising has the ability to be another high-margin business line – Amazon currently gets most of its profits from its AWS cloud business – which has led the company past $100 billion in annual profits. Amazon (AMZN) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus 1-year price target for Amazon stock is $220.00, which is a 6.61% upside from today’s stock price of $206.35. Of all the analysts covering Amazon, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.37 “Buy” rating. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month forecast projects Amazon’s stock price to be $225. We see AWS continue its current 12% growth rate but see Amazon’s advertising business outperforming analyst expectations, particularly in the 4th quarter of 2024 with more streaming ad impressions being sold. Amazon (AMZN) Stock Forecast Through 2030 AWS: Assuming AWS stems its market share loss and investments in AI to counterbalance the threat from Microsoft and Google. E-Commerce: Amazon continues to pour investments into e-commerce, forgoing added profits to maintain market share. Our case model assumes growth in new logistics and efficiencies from robotics in warehouses leads to this unit finally delivering strong operating profits. Advertising: Amazon’s advertising continued to grow and the now $47 billion business unit and we see a high teens growth rate compounded annually. Add all these numbers up and take out some amount for “new bets” the company will surely be investing in (and a potential dividend boost)and we see revenue in 2030 at $1.15 trillion and $131 billion in net income. Today, the company trades for about 50X earnings, which we’ll take down to 35 times as the company matures (but continues showing growth). In our analysis, Amazon is worth $2.6 trillion in 2030. Here are our revenue, net income, and company size estimates through 2030: Revenue Net Income Total Enterprise Value 2024 $638 $48.56 $1.93 2025 $710 $62.13 $2.12 2026 $788 $79.68 $2.19 2027 $867 $96.53 $2.29 2028 $957 $114.17 $2.39 2029 $1,049 $136.69 $2.5 2030 $1,149 $131.39 $2.6 *Revenue and net income reported in billions and TEV in trillions Amazon’s Share Price Estimates 2025-2030 How Amazon’s Next 5 Years Could Play Out We expect to see revenue growth of just over 11% and EPS of $5.74 for 2025. We expect the stock to still trade at a similar multiple next year, putting our estimate for the stock price for Amazon at $287 in 2025, which is 39.08% higher than the stock is trading today. Going into 2026, we estimate the price to be $371, after revenue estimates to come in around 10% higher year-over-year. With an EPS of $7.42 and in our opinion the last year Amazon trades near its current P/E of 50, 2026 could mark the year Amazon starts trading at a more mature valuation closer to 35 times earnings. That would represent a 79.79% gain over today’s share price of $206.35. Heading into 2027, we expect the stock price increase not to be as pronounced as more tempered growth is expected from Amazon and even with earnings estimates of $8.80 per share, the stock price target for the year is $308.00. That is a 17% year hit from the previous year, but still up 49.26% from today’s stock price. When predicting more than 3 years out, we expect Amazon to continue growing its top line at 10% but be more efficient and operating margins to grow. In 2028, we have Amazon’s revenue coming in around $957 billion and an EPS of $10.34 suggesting a stock price estimate at $361.90 or a gain of 75.38% over the current stock price. 24/7 Wall Street expects Amazon to continue its 10% revenue growth again and to generate $12.30 per share of earnings. With a price-to-earnings multiple of 35, the stock price in 2029 is estimated at $430.50, or a gain of 108.63% over today’s price. Amazon Stocks Price Target for 2030 We estimate Amazon’s stock price to be $370 per share with 10% year-over-year revenue growth but compressed margins from more competition in its AWS unit. Our estimated stock price for Amazon will be 79.62% higher than the current stock price, marking a double in Amazon’s stock price today of 206.35. Year Price Target % Change From Current Price 2024 $226.50 Upside of 9.76% 2025 $287.00 Upside of 39.08% 2026 $371.00 Upside of 79.79% 2027 $308.00 Upside of 49.26% 2028 $361.90 Upside of 75.38% 2029 $430.50 Upside of 108.63% 2030 $370.65 Upside of 79.62% Sponsored: Attention Savvy Investors: Speak to 3 Financial Experts – FREE Ever wanted an extra set of eyes on an investment you’re considering?

Consensus sees Alphabet's Q4 revenue at $96.69 billion, but our estimates point towards a more conservative $95.88 billion, with diluted EPS of $2.19 versus consensus of $2.12. Google Search and YouTube revenues are projected to grow at 10% and 11%, respectively in Q4, showing slower growth compared to Q3, primarily due to strong comparisons. Our projected EPS CAGR of 15.2% through to FY27 has been baked in, with further upgrades unlikely on a fundamental level if Google's pace of AI development continues to lag its competitors."

Alphabet's Q4 results were mixed, with EPS beating estimates but revenue slightly missing, leading to a 7%+ stock drop in after-hours trading. Google Cloud's revenue growth decelerated to 30% YoY, missing expectations, but operating income improved significantly. The slight miss in Google Cloud revenues was not due to a lack of demand but due to a lack of capacity to meet the high demand."

A tech malaise fueled by Google parent Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) and chipmaker AMD (Nasdaq: AMD) is pressuring the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 moderately lower while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is eking out a gain.

Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) shares are down in sympathy ahead of the company’s earnings report after the closing bell tomorrow.

Google parent Alphabet stock is sinking 8% on aggressive AI capex plans despite a revenue miss. AMD shares are down a steep 9% on weak data center results, but Wall Street says the quarter was “better than feared.” Amazon shares are down in sympathy ahead of the company’s quarterly results on Thursday.

Shares of NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) was mostly flat on Tuesday, losing -0.58% after a strong five-day stretch that has seen the stock rise 9.10%. That has been welcome news to investors who endured the AI sell-off that hit the market in January amid news of low-cost Chinese competitor DeepSeek, which resulted in the company shedding nearly $600 billion from its market cap — by far the largest single-day value wipeout in market history. Year-to-date, NVDA remains down -3.98%. Investors will want to mark Feb. 26 on their calendars, when the company will announce its Q4 earnings. Last month, the stock got a bump from President Trump’s announcement that his administration is planning major AI infrastructure investments, which suggests a willingness for the new administration to work alongside Big Tech companies to expand the use of the technology. That continued the momentum from Jan. 5 when NVIDIA announced that it is hosting its first-ever “Quantum Day” at GTC 2025. The event will focus on exploring advancements in quantum computing. It will include expert discussions, a keynote address from CEO Jensen Huang, developer sessions, hands-on training and other special addresses. Over the past few years, AI has consistently fueled the largest gains for the market. And one company in particular is at the vanguard: NVIDIA. NVIDIA is the premier manufacturer of components critical to the surge in AI; namely, semiconductors, microchips, and graphics processing units (GPUs). As a result, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has seen its stock skyrocket in the recent past. Since the first day the market opened in 2023, shares have gained nearly 809%, and in the decade from August 2014 to the present, they are up a preposterous 33,951%. Despite those mind-boggling gains, analysts still expect enormous upside potential in the medium and long term. 24/7 Wall Street has performed analysis to provide prospective investors and current shareholders with an idea of where NVIDIA’s stock might be headed over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: NVIDIA’s track record of strong earnings suggests an ability to remain at the forefront of its industry, as competitors fight for the leftovers. Between NVIDIA’s client list of Magnificent Seven companies and the burgeoning trend in AI, growth in both revenue and net income is projected to continue its steep climb. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. NVIDIA’s Recent Stock Success Unless you have been living under a rock, chances are you have caught wind of the very well-documented and rather exponential surge in NVIDIA’s share price since 2022. But before 2022’s price-per-share explosion, it was steadily appreciating as it underwent a series of stock splits. Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $0.51 $4.130 $0.588 2015 $0.82 $4.681 $0.800 2016 $2.67 $5.010 $0.929 2017 $4.88 $6.910 $1.851 2018 $3.24 $9.714 $3.085 2019 $5.98 $11.716 $4.143 2020 $13.06 $10.918 $3.580 2021 $29.64 $16.675 $6.277 2022 $14.61 $26.914 $11.259 2023 $49.52 $26.974 $8.366 *Post-split adjusted basis **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, NVIDIA’s revenue grew by more than 553% while its net income increased by just over 1,323%. The company experienced a slight contraction in revenue and net income in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it rebounded soundly the following year and has continued to steadily grow both metrics since. Meanwhile, shares were able to increase by 9,610% from 2014 to 2023. As the AI lynchpin looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of NVIDIA’s Stock Performance Stronghold on the GPU Industry: No one makes GPUs like Nvidia makes GPUs, and the industry demanding them is well aware of that. While semiconductor competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) do command some attention in their respective corners of the market, simply comparing the three companies’ market caps demonstrates the discrepancies between NVIDIA and, well, every other company. While Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have respectable market caps of $194.67 billion and $861.41 billion, respectively, those are dwarfed by NVIDIA’s $3.34 trillion. Demand From Unrivaled Tech Customers: The company’s primary clientele are the other members of the Magnificent Seven, which are leading the way forward in the AI revolution. In fact, only four Big Tech rival companies — Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) — account for 40% of NVIDIA’s revenue as they vie with one another to become the front runner of the transition to generative AI. The AI Trend Is Just Getting Started: According to Grand View Research, the market size of AI in 2023 was $196.63 billion. As large as that seems, it pales in comparison to where the market is headed. From 2024 to 2030, it is expected that the industry will grow at an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6%, with “continuous research and innovation directed by tech giants that are driving adoption of advanced technologies in industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing,” according to Grand View Research’s report. NVIDIA (NVDA) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus one-year price target for NVIDIA, according to analysts, is $178.84, which represents a nearly 34.66% potential upside over the next 12 months based on the current share price of $132.80. Of all the analysts covering NVIDIA, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.3 ‘Strong Buy’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). However, by the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast projects shares of NVIDIA to be trading for $137.50 based on a projected EPS of $2.75 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50, with a best-case scenario of $192.50 per share and a worst-case scenario of $82.50 per share.

Dividend growth investing requires patience but pays off. Low-yield stocks with strong growth potential can outperform high-yield picks over time, offering both income and capital appreciation. I focus on three stocks with fantastic business models, pricing power, and long-term growth potential. These picks align with my belief in balancing income and growth for a resilient portfolio. While not ideal for immediate income, these stocks are perfect for long-term investors. They offer compounding power, strong fundamentals, and the potential to beat the market."

Saving for your children is a noble goal, which is why I enjoyed reading this post in the Fat FIRE subreddit. The Redditor is a 33-year-old male with a $1 million portfolio. He expects to reach his $5 million fat FIRE goal by the time he is 40-45 years old. The Redditor is wondering if he should invest heavily into his child’s education or set her up with a nest egg so she can fat FIRE at a young age. I will share my thoughts, but it is good to speak with a financial advisor first. Key Points A Redditor is deciding whether he wants to invest in his child’s education or give them early access to fat FIRE. The Redditor may want to consider alternatives. Retiring early is possible, and may be easier than you think. Click here now to see if you’re ahead, or behind. (Sponsor) You Don’t Want the Kid to Fat FIRE Too Early I am against letting the kid fat FIRE and coast in their early 20s for two reasons. First, the kid may spend the money lavishly and end up outliving it. It’s harder for someone to appreciate the value of a $5 million portfolio if they haven’t worked for it. Teaching your kids about money will make them more financially responsible, but it’s still good to avoidgiving them so much money too early. The second reason giving your child the ability to fat FIRE in their early 20s is a bad idea is because they don’t have to work for it. It’s very fulfilling to grow your career, save money, and reach long-term financial goals. However, having it given to you early can crush their sense of motivation, especially if they know they will receive the money. There isn’t as much of an incentive to try hard if a $5 million fat FIRE portfolio is waiting for them shortly after they turn 20. Of course, some children receive a lot of money shortly after becoming adults and do well. However, it’s important for them to work toward long-term goals and have a sense of achievement instead of being presented with money. The Redditor can offer financial support if he desires so she can pursue more options, but she shouldn’t be given a gigantic nest egg early in life. It’s better to prepare it for her so she can inherit it. An Expensive University May Not Be the Best Investment The college education has been losing value. It’s questionable why a 4-year college education can’t be condensed into a 2-year education, and the ROI isn’t what it used to be. Administrative bloat and federal loans have resulted in sky-high tuition prices that put people deep into student debt. Most people who incur student debt find it more difficult to buy a house and pursue other milestones like marriage. While the Redditor can pay for his child’s college education, the average graduate’s finances out of college makes it important to question the ROI. If you want to go the college route, it’s financially better to send your child to a community college first, where the credits are more affordable. Then, a reasonable state university can offer relatively low prices and a diploma. The child can also easily earn certificates by completing online classes, and some jobs take those certifications. For instance, you can get cybersecurity certificates from Alphabet’s training courses, which are available on Coursera. Looking at alternative educational routes like trade schools and online certificates from leading corporations can give your child quicker access to career options without excessive tuition costs.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Go Their Own Way 1:20 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market indices are trading mixed, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 posting fractional gains while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is sharply lower, losing 300 points. UnitedHealth Group stock has been a weight on the Dow and S&amp;P 500 today after its worrying quarterly results and outlook. Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON), which is part of the Nasdaq Composite, is gaining over 2% on the day. The company reports its quarterly results on April 29. The company is in the midst of spinning off a couple of business divisions, and the stock is nearing the $200 per share level. Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is down 1% after BMO Capital cut its price target on the stock to $200 per share, which still represents upside from current levels of $151 per share. Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) is gaining 1.5% on the day as the company expands its chip footprint in the auto sector. Market Gains Slip 8:17 am The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are struggling to keep their grip on gains after coming out of the gate higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains pressured with a 1.2% loss on the day. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) stock is a major drag on the Dow, owing to disappointing quarterly results, while CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) remains a bright spot, rising 1.2% on the day. Chip stock Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM) is up nearly 1% this morning on a bullish report out of Citi analysts. Sector performance is largely positive, led by a 2.4% gain in energy stocks but dampened by a tech sector that has just turned south. After yesterday&#8217;s massive technology sell-off, the markets are licking their wounds, with the three major stock market averages giving a mixed showing. Among the gainers is the Nasdaq Composite with a 0.63% advance and the S&amp;P 500 also fractionally higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently erasing over 400 points. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green today, a complete reversal from yesterday&#8217;s leader board. The markets are still processing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell&#8217;s comments from yesterday, which were on the hawkish side of monetary policy. Earnings are capturing some attention away from tariffs with railway CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) gaining 1% on the heels of its Q1 print. CSX faced challenges in the quarter, including a 7% year-over-year decline in revenue, but met consensus expectations amid a backdrop of weaker coal prices and dwindling fuel surcharges. Big Tech is mostly showing green this morning but remains mired in losses over the past five-day stretch, including a 2% drop in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), 14% decline in Meta (Nasdaq: META) and nearly 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) over the past week or so. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) is a big drag on the Dow, shaving off 18% of its value today alone on disappointing earnings results. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 446 (-1.09%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 118.75 (+0.65%) S&amp;P 500: Up 22 (+0.41%) Market Movers Qualcomm (Nasdaq; QCOM) is rising today on the heels of a bullish report out of Citi analysts, who reportedly raised estimates on the company and added it to their positive catalyst watchlist thanks to robust demand for its chipsets out of China. QCOM stock has been volatile and is down 11% year-to-date. Citi also likes Generac Holdings (Nasdaq: GNRC), upgrading the stock to &#8220;buy&#8221; with a &#8220;high-risk&#8221; tone from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; BMO has upgraded shares of wood producer (NYSE: TREX) Trex to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8220;market perform,&#8221; calling shares attractive. The stock is up 1.8% today. The post Live Nasdaq Composite: CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) Rises Amid Pivot to Earnings appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Alphabet's Q1 2025 earnings were strong, showing Google is safe from AI disruption. However, I maintain a HOLD rating due to lack of diversification and potential recession risks. Valuation appears reasonable with a P/E of 17 vs. a historical median of 22.5, projecting a potential $220+ share price at a 21.5x forward P/E. I think Alphabet's revenue relies too much on advertising (~75%), with promising but limited diversification from Cloud (28% growth) and Subscriptions/Platforms (18% growth)."

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Wall Street Bullish on GOOGL 1:06 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analysts are getting increasingly bullish on Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) stock, which is tacking on 2% in today&#8217;s market. Bank of America is bullish on GOOGL, raising its price target to $200 per share from $185 with a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating attached. Citi also raised its price target on GOOGL to $200 in the wake of the company&#8217;s strong quarterly results. Piper Sandler predicts GOOGL price will hit $195 and has an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on shares. Wells Fargo analysts lifted their price target on the stock to $175 with an &#8220;equal weight&#8221; rating. GOOGL stock is currently hovering at $163 per share. Markets Attempt Gains 12:08 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market is attempting to move higher, including a 0.36% gain in the Nasdaq Composite. Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is holding onto 2% gains while Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is soaring by 8%, helping to lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite as autonomous driving makes its way closer to the mainstream. Tesla shares are up 24% over the past five-day stretch. Resilient Consumers 11:21 am by Gerelyn Terzo Consumer sentiment surprisingly improved toward the end of April amid a resilient consumer despite the tariff uncertainty. The University of Michigan published the final reading of its consumer sentiment index, which rose 52.2 compared with its initial view of 50.8 earlier this month. Economists were expecting the reading to remain flat. Nevertheless, the index fell sharply from March levels and has been on the decline in 2025. Today is the ex-dividend date for Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), CSW Industrials (CSWI) and Fastenal Company (Nasdaq: FAST). After a three-day winning streak, the markets are getting off to a slower start, with all three of the major stock market averages meandering between positive and negative ground this morning. Small-cap stocks are out front with a 2% jump in the Russell 2000 index. Google parent Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is tacking on 4% after yesterday afternoon&#8217;s strong earnings print. Mag 7 stock Alphabet beat consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines, in response to which shares have been soaring ever since. Alphabet reported $2.81 per share on revenue of $90.2 billion compared with Wall Street estimates of $2.01 per share on revenue of $89.1 billion. Bank of America&#8217;s Michael Harnett is bearish on stocks due to the trade uncertainties, advising investors to remain defensive, sell the SPX/US$ rallies and buy price dips in gold. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 61.79 (-0.18%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 8.78 (-0.07%) S&amp;P 500: Down 5.01 (-0.09%) Tech Roundup Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) beat on the top and bottom lines with better than expected profits and revenue. But the markets are focused on the outlook, and Intel&#8217;s revenue guidance for the current quarter fell shy of consensus estimates, sending shares lower by 7% this morning. T-Mobile (Nasdaq: TMUS) shares are under pressure, falling 9% after the company revealed disappointing subscriber numbers in its quarterly print despite beating on the top and bottom lines. Pony AI (Nasdaq: PONY) shares are continuing their wild ride, soaring 17.7% today after yesterday&#8217;s double-digit percentage rally.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended All&#039;s Well That Ends Green 4:30 pm All three major market indices ended in the green Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up a bare 0.05%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained a more substantial 0.7%, and the Nasdaq closed up 1.2% gain. Despite an inauspicious start on Monday, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF&#8217;s gain of 0.7% Friday brought its total gain for the week to 4.6%. For the month of April, however, the Voo remains down 1.5%, with just three trading days remaining. Call It &quot;the Trump Effect&quot; 1:23 pm Markets have turned solidly green in afternoon trading, with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.66% and the Voo ETF ticking right along in its footsteps with a 0.64% gain. So what&#8217;s changed? Responding to China&#8217;s demurral yesterday that &#8220;there are absolutely no negotiations on the economy and trade between China and the U.S.,&#8221; which was itself in response to President Trump&#8217;s assertion Tuesday that talks were happening, the President insisted again today that, whatever the Chinese government may want people to believe, &#8220;we&#8217;ve been meeting with China&#8221; to talk about lowering tariffs after all. In this game of he said, Xi said, it&#8217;s honestly hard for an investor to know what&#8217;s really going on. But for now at least, the markets seem to believe Mr. Trump, and are hoping the trade war is nearing an end. S&amp;P 500 Just Turned Into a Horse of a Different Color 11:50 am Uh-oh. We&#8217;re 15 minutes from noonday now, and the S&amp;P 500 has just turned red, down 0.12%. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF, likewise, has lost its pleasant shade of green, and is now down 0.14%. In happier news (for investors), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) just won a ruling in Texas, where an Outsourcing Facilities Association lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the FDA suing them for making Ozempic copycat drugs just got rejected. S&amp;P 500 component Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) previously won a similar ruling, also in Texas. For the big publicly-traded GLP-1 drugmakers, things are finally going their way. S&amp;P Might Not Bounce Back This Time 10:52 am In mid-morning trading, we&#8217;re getting further disturbing news that may weigh on &#8220;the Voo.&#8221; CNBC reports that S&amp;P 500 component Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN), or more precisely third party retailers who sell on Amazon, are raising prices on hundreds of items to help them absorb the cost of new tariffs imposed by President Trump. Amazon&#8217;s stock price doesn&#8217;t seem to be suffering from the report yet. It&#8217;s still slightly in the green. But the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t moving any higher, despite trading having begun nearly an hour and a half ago already. And we&#8217;re off! The stock market opened for trading a bit lower today than it left off last night. But within five minutes of opening, the S&amp;P 500 (Index: SPX) was already, if only barely, in the green with an 0.06% gain. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: VOO), which closely tracks the performance of the index, is up 0.09%. It&#8217;s still a hesitant start, but a logical result in light of comments from President Trump, just published by Time magazine, to the effect that the President is looking to end his trade war with China (and the world) perhaps &#8220;a year from now&#8221; and with tariffs on foreign countries settling at &#8220;20% to 50%.&#8221; The prospect of trade war volatility dragging on for another 12 months, and of tariffs ending up two to five times higher than the 10% &#8220;reciprocal&#8221; tariffs already announced, is clearly not something that investors wanted to hear. Earnings Last night, after the close of trading on a third straight day of gains for &#8220;the Voo,&#8221; index component Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOG) (Nasdaq: GOOGL) reported earnings a staggering 40% better than Wall Street analysts were predicting, which seemed propitious enough news to keep the stock market rally going this morning. Unfortunately, comments from Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) seem to have canceled out Alphabet&#8217;s good news. The chipmaker reported a $0.19 per share loss for its own first quarter, warned that it&#8217;s not going to earn a profit in Q2 either (at best, Intel might break even), and its Q2 sales will be about $1 billion less than analysts had forecast. This mixed messaging on the earnings front, for two of the country&#8217;s biggest tech companies, is also weighing on the market today. Analyst Calls Perhaps unlucky for them, Wall Street analysts seem not to have had an opportunity to review the President&#8217;s comments before issuing their latest round of upgrades this morning. Citigroup for example is starting the day off with an upgrade of Hasbro (Nasdaq: HAS) stock, while KeyBanc is upgrading both Lowes (NYSE: LOW) and La-Z-Boy (NYSE: LZB) &#8212; all three of which companies are highly dependent upon goods imported from abroad. If the trade war keeps rumbling, and tariffs keep climbing, things could turn ugly for all of these stocks, and for the S&amp;P 500 in general.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Trade Deals 3:06 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly revealed that the U.S. has secured one trade deal, keeping most of the details close to the vest except to say that the White House is awaiting a green light from some unnamed country. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 300 points in response for a 0.84% gain, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are holding similar gains. Narrow Range 12:34 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are managing slight gains across the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average despite the absence of greater details on any global trade deals. Of the S&amp;P 500, Baird investment strategist Ross Mayfield is cited by CNBC as saying, “I think [stocks are] probably trapped in a in a pretty tight range here,&#8221; pointing to a range of 5,100-5,700. “I think we can bounce around there for quite a while in kind of some volatile, choppy trading. Until we get some resolution on the trade front, I don’t think much else matters,&#8221; he added. Consumer Weakness 11:03 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market averages are currently all moving higher despite some weaker than anticipated economic data. The U.S. consumer has long been credited with upholding the economy throughout the one-two punch of inflation and higher interest rates. Now the tariffs could be the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back, as consumer confidence shows signs of waning. The Consumer Confidence Index published by the Conference Board sank to a reading of 86 in April, a drop of nearly 8 points from the prior month and below economist estimates calling for 87.7. A separate index that reflects consumer sentiment over the next six months fell by a steep 12.5 points to a reading of 54.4, its worst level in over a decade. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that March job postings dropped to their lowest level in about six months. Tariffs, Earnings and Tech 10:00 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets continue to trade mixed this morning on tariff deal ambiguity as Q1 earnings results pour in. Stocks are weighing earnings results and a lack of certainty on the tariff deal front while tensions have emerged between Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and the White House over tariff-related costs. Magnificent Seven stocks are mixed, with Amazon and Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) trading in the red while Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) benefits from a Wall Street endorsement. Hims &amp; Hers HEalth (Nasdaq: HIMS) is soaring by 24% today on news of a deal to sell weight loss drug phenom Wegovy on its e-commerce platform. The markets are holding out for more tariff deal progress, digging in their heels and nearly standing still in the meantime. The three major stock market averages are moving fractionally in either direction, with the Nasdaq Composite posting slight declines alongside the S&amp;P 500 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is eking out modest gains. Sectors of the economy are evenly split between red and green, with real estate moving higher and consumer discretionary stocks headed lower. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is getting some unwanted attention after the White House took aim at the tech giant, calling its reported plans to list tariff cost impacts on its site as a &#8220;hostile and political act.&#8221; Big 3 automaker General Motors (NYSE: GM) reported better-than-expected quarterly results while reassessing its full-year outlook, sending the stock lower by 1.5%. GM and the auto sector have targets on their backs at the height of the tariff wars, in response to which the former Dow component has suspended all share buyback programs. The White House has affirmed its plans to provide tariff relief to the auto sector. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 138.11 (+0.36%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 67.15 (-0.40%) S&amp;P 500: Down 10.23 (-0.19%) Earnings &amp; Analyst Calls Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) surpassed Q1 expectations on the top and bottom lines and is keeping its full-year guidance intact amid expectations that it will be able to manage any tariff-related fallout, including rising aluminum costs. Rival company PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) recently lowered its earnings forecast due to the tariff impact. Evercore ISI has reiterated its &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock with a $250 price target, suggesting the company&#8217;s strategies should help it to offset any impact from the tariff frenzy. Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), saying that the China tariff uncertainties notwithstanding, the AI leader&#8217;s strong market relationships give the stock a place in the analyst firm&#8217;s top large cap pick universe. UBS has reiterated its &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) but lowered the price target to $253 from $272, owing to what it described as &#8220;potential demand destruction.&#8221; The post Live Nasdaq Composite: Markets Stand Still on Tariff and Tech Tussle appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Key Points You can use diversified ETFs (QQQI, SPYI) to generate the bulk of your passive income in retirement. To boost your monthly income potential, try a few high-yield funds that focus on single stocks (APLY, GOOY, AMZY, NVDY). It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. Retirement is almost here? No need to fear! Even if your monthly goal of earning $5,000 in dividends starts in just three months, it&#8217;s possible to achieve this by carefully investing in high-yield exchange traded funds (ETFs). To get dividends/distributions totaling $5,000 per month or $60,000 per year, you can use a combination of diversified income-producing ETFs and single-stock-focused funds. Assuming you&#8217;ll have saved up $500,000 for retirement three years from now, you will need to achieve a 12% average annual yield to get $60,000 worth of income per year. The plan is to allocate 80% of your investable capital toward a pair a diversified ETFs that offer annual yields of around 12% to 15%. Then, to put you decisively above the $5,000-per-month threshold, you could invest the remaining 20% of your retirement funds in a few ETFs that derive high yields from single stocks. So, let&#8217;s dive right in and see how this powerful plan works. 2 Diversified ETFs With High Yields The first part of the plan is to devote 80% of your investable retirement savings toward two diversified ETFs. More specifically you can allocate 40% of your capital toward the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) and other 40% toward the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). To earn passive income of $5,000 per month when you retire in three years, you&#8217;ll need to achieve at least 12% average annual yield on a $500,000 investment. The NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF exceeds the 12% objective with an annual distribution rate of 14.65%. You&#8217;ll end up paying annualized operating fees of 0.68%, but even after subtracting that, QQQI&#8217;s yield would still be above 12%. There&#8217;s still the question of whether this is safe yield, though. I would assess the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF as reasonably safe because this diversified fund invests in approximately 100 well-known technology firms. Based on the NASDAQ 100 index, the QQQI ETF&#8217;s holdings include tech leaders like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Furthermore, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF pays out its cash distributions each and every month. Consequently, you may be able to take advantage of the compounding effect by reinvesting the distributions. For even more diversification, you can match your QQQI allocation with an equal-sized investment in the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF. Centered around the prestigious S&amp;P 500 large-cap stock index, the SPYI ETF includes around 500 stocks in its list of holdings. You&#8217;ll probably recognize many of the names on that holdings list, such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Since the fund includes so many famous names across multiple market sectors, you can invest in the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF with confidence. Like QQQI, the SPYI ETF pays its distributions on a monthly basis, so that&#8217;s a nice benefit. Will the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF achieve a 12% yield, though? The fund currently advertises an annual distribution rate of 12.15%, but you&#8217;ll have to pay operating fees totaling 0.68%. Remember, though, that you can invest equally in the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF and the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF. That way, you should average 12% yield or more (assuming there are no distribution cuts) with 80% of your portfolio. Boost Your Yield With Single-Stock Funds Just to make sure that you&#8217;ll achieve at least $5,000 of monthly passive income, you can dedicate the remaining 20% of your portfolio toward a handful of single-stock funds. These ETFs are riskier because they&#8217;re not diversified, but their annual yields are quite impressive. I&#8217;m referring to four ETFs which all pay their distributions on a monthly basis. You can go here for detailed explanation of the four funds, but I&#8217;ll provide a quick summary right now. The YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:APLY) indirectly derives income from Apple stock. It advertises an annual distribution rate of 26.97% but you&#8217;ll have to deduct operating expenses of 1.06%. That still leaves you with an expected net yield of 26.97% &#8211; 1.06%, or 25.91%, which is nothing to sneeze at. Here are three similar ETFs to consider: The YieldMax GOOGL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:GOOY); based on the stock of Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL); annual distribution rate of 33.14% &#8211; 1.2% worth of operating expenses = expected net yield of 31.94%. The YieldMax AMZN Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMZY); based on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock; annual distribution rate of 47.52% &#8211; 1.17% worth of operating expenses = expected net yield of 46.35%. The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY); based on NVIDIA stock; annual distribution rate of 50.19% &#8211; 1.27% worth of operating expenses = expected net yield of 48.92%. Balancing Safety and Risk Since they involve more risk, you wouldn&#8217;t want to invest too much of your retirement money in APLY, GOOY, AMZY, and NVDY. However, it&#8217;s not excessive to allocate 5% toward each ETF for a total of 20%. After all, these are four gigantic technology firms and the huge yields will quickly boost your portfolio&#8217;s total yield above 12%. Besides, 80% of your investment account would be invested in the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF and the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF, which are safer because they&#8217;re more diversified. If you get started today, you can use these ETFs to build a safety-and-risk-balanced retirement portfolio generating $5,000 per month or more.The post Retiring in 3 Years and Need $5,000/Month—Here’s the Portfolio to Build Now appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Here’s the Smartest Way to Turn It Into Monthly Passive Income","Inherited $400,000? Here’s the Smartest Way to Turn It Into Monthly Passive Income
Key Points The SPHD and DIVO ETFs are ideal vehicles for volatility mitigation and reliable income. Furthermore, you can enhance your monthly income potential with single-stock ETFs. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) If you&#8217;re fortunate enough to inherit $400,000, it may be tempting to spend that money on cars and vacations. However, the smart-money move is to invest the funds wisely and plan for your financial future. One approach is to invest that $400,000 in exchange traded funds (ETFs) that provide passive income every month. That way, you can reinvest the cash distributions and take advantage of the compounding effect. So now, it&#8217;s time to reveal four funds that unlock monthly income opportunities so you can turn your inheritance into a cash-producing machine. SPHD: A Reliable Pick for Low Volatility $400,000 is a whole lot of money to inherit and invest. Therefore, your first priority shouldn&#8217;t be maximizing your monthly dividends. Instead, it should be mitigating your risk so you don&#8217;t lose all of that money. When safety and reliability are your top priorities, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA:SPHD) is a solid pick. This fund has 52 stocks in its holdings, all carefully selected from the S&amp;P 500 large-cap stock index. The SPHD ETF specifically chooses stocks &#8220;that historically have provided high dividend yields and low volatility.&#8221; Examples include Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Realty Income Corp. (NYSE:O), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Altria Group (NYSE:MO). These companies are known for providing consistent dividend payments, and their stocks typically aren&#8217;t volatile. Furthermore, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF features a 12-month distribution rate (i.e., a forward annual dividend yield) of 3.44%. Plus, the SPHD ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. With all of that in mind, you could take $150,000 of your inherited $400,000, put it into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF, and sleep soundly at night. Stay in the Safe Lane With DIVO With $400,000 to invest, you&#8217;ll have a large account and there&#8217;s no need to drive in the fast lane. Instead, you can stay in the &#8220;safe lane&#8221; but still get a passive income stream with the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO). Much like the SPHD ETF, the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF seeks to reduce share-price volatility while providing exposure to high-quality dividend-paying companies. Moreover, like the other funds mentioned today, DIVO puts cash distributions into your account on a monthly basis. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF has 24 stocks in its holdings, and you&#8217;ll see plenty of large-cap sector leaders in there. Among the top holdings in the DIVO ETF are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Visa (NYSE:V), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Again, we&#8217;re choosing safety first and then aiming for good yield. Since the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF invests in great companies and features an impressive 4.73% annual distribution rate, it checks all the right boxes. Thus, it would make sense to allocate $150,000 of a $400,000 inheritance toward the DIVO ETF. Accelerate Your Yield With Single-Stock ETFs It&#8217;s wise to dedicate $300,000 of your $400,000 inheritance toward diversified low-volatility funds like SPHD and DIVO. If you do that, then you can invest the remaining $100,000 in ETFs with greater risk but also higher yields. To that end, YieldMax offers a wide variety of ETFs that each focus on a single stock instead of a diversified basket of stocks. Typically, these YieldMax ETFs derive monthly income from U.S. Treasury bonds and sophisticated options-trading strategies. One way to reduce the risk is to stick to YieldMax ETFs that focus on established large-cap companies. For example, the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:APLY) indirectly derives income from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. Currently, the APLY ETF advertises an annual distribution rate of 26.99%. This fund shouldn&#8217;t be excessively risky as Apple is a reliable blue-chip business with staying power. So, you could invest $25,000 of your $400,000 inheritance in the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF. A reasonable plan would be to pick four single-stock ETFs with a focus on high-confidence companies. Then, you could allocate $25,000 toward each of the four funds you picked. A Mixed-Risk Approach APLY is just one example of many monthly-paying single-stock ETFs you can choose from. Here&#8217;s a summary of other funds in this category, and while you explore them, you might think about picking your four favorites: The YieldMax AMZN Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMZY); based on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock; 47.82% annual distribution rate The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY); based on NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock; 74.99% annual distribution rate The YieldMax GOOGL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:GOOY); based on the stock of Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL); 32.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax MSFT Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSFO); based on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock; 34.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax JPM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:JPMO); based on JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock; 39% annual distribution rate The YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMDY); based on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock; 68.07% annual distribution rate The YieldMax DIS Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:DISO); based on Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock; 38.55% annual distribution rate The YieldMax XOM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:XOMO); based on Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock; 38.04% annual distribution rate Just to provide an idea of what your overall plan might look like, you could invest $150,000 in SPHD, $150,000 in DIVO, and $25,000 each in APLY, MSFO, DISO, and XOMO. All in all, you can mix low-risk ETFs with a handful of higher-risk ETFs to turn your inherited $400,000 into a fairly reliable monthly income-producing machine.The post Inherited $400,000?

GOOGL's recent underperformance is largely due to slower advertising growth, a relatively muted capex outlook, and higher D&A, which could pressure earnings. Despite the gradual pace of AI monetization in advertising, Google Cloud delivered strong growth and continued margin expansion in 1Q. The valuation gap between GOOGL and META reflects Meta's stronger ad growth and more aggressive FY2025 capex, 36% of total revenue, vs 19% for GOOGL."

Key Points YouTube, now considered one of only two dominant global VOD platforms alongside Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), could be worth $500–600 billion on a standalone basis—making it the crown jewel in any Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) breakup. Media companies like Disney (NYSE: DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery appear structurally disadvantaged in streaming, while Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) use video content primarily to support unrelated core businesses like Prime and hardware. Investors who hold Alphabet could benefit significantly if YouTube is spun off, with a valuation comparable to Netflix’s $500+ billion market cap. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

[00:00:10] Lee Jackson: If that could be true. [00:00:12] Douglas: There was a story today in the New York Times that said there are only two VOD companies in the world, Netflix and YouTube. There&#8217;s, they said no one else matters. You know, so if you&#8217;re Amazon Prime video, if you&#8217;re Disney, they said, forget it. There&#8217;s a, this is a two horse race. Now at this point, if you take people looking at paid video online, [00:00:39] Lee Jackson: Right. [00:00:40] Douglas: has more people doing that Netflix, and to me it tells you three things. [00:00:48] Douglas: The first one is, is it sort of makes Netflix a buy. It sort of makes it a sell. It&#8217;s being mentioned as in the same breath as YouTube is the leader. if YouTube is gaining that much market share, then even Netflix has to, you know, management has to be worried about it. [00:01:08] Douglas: but the other thing is, is that if you look at all the other companies, like if it&#8217;s Disney, if it&#8217;s Warner, what the this story is saying is those people have now fallen so far behind that they can&#8217;t ever catch up. And as they will be permanently way, way behind. [00:01:32] Lee Jackson: Well, I think you&#8217;re right. And it, and it&#8217;s interesting because we&#8217;ve talked in previous videos about, you know, the breakup of Google may be coming. How valuable would YouTube be in that equation? I mean, the, the thing that&#8217;s so great about YouTube and, and I swear to God, everybody watching this will nod their head and go, yes, there&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t learn how to fix, take apart, do, or whatever, without saying. [00:02:01] Lee Jackson: I don&#8217;t know how to do this. I&#8217;m gonna get on YouTube and see how to do this and, and that Netflix doesn&#8217;t offer Amazon Prime and, and other video, they don&#8217;t offer that. So I think you&#8217;re right. They dominate an area that is such a wide moat that I don&#8217;t know if anybody can compete with that. [00:02:19] Douglas: here, here&#8217;s something interesting. So. I want you to think about this for a second. Netflix market cap is $537 billion. All right? If you look at Alphabet&#8217;s value, total valuation, I&#8217;m gonna guess that&#8217;s about half. Maybe, [00:02:41] Douglas: know, I mean, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s meaningful. If I&#8217;m doing a sum of the parts valuation [00:02:53] Douglas: very valuable. But if you just give it the valuation that you&#8217;re giving Netflix, you&#8217;re giving it a 500 or $600 billion valuation, which means means in a alphabet breakup, you may do really well. Just holding onto that. [00:03:18] Lee Jackson: they all did great when they broke up big, big companies. So, I mean, the, the, the story of GE (NYSE: GE) is just phenomenal. All the breakups, and then they were booted. You know, one of, one of the original members of the Dow Jones Industrial average was booted. [00:03:38] Douglas: kicked it out. Well, there&#8217;s another part to this, which is think important for investors. If this analysis is true, Disney is never going to make any real money on their streaming business. [00:04:05] Douglas: you&#8217;re never gonna be a really, really big player. I mean, you&#8217;re never, ever gonna be, look, I don&#8217;t care what people say, Amazon Prime video is there because they want to keep people glued to prime. [00:04:21] Douglas: Prime&#8217;s a huge money maker for Amazon. [00:04:50] Douglas: once you turn to all the other people. Who are media companies trying to, you know, stream media assets and that&#8217;s crummy. The only other guys I can think of who do it for an insane reason is Apple. Apple spends hundreds and hundreds. I mean, I don&#8217;t even wanna think what they spend, but it&#8217;s a way to make people glued to the device. [00:05:51] Douglas: so if you, if you believe, what I think is becoming the conventional wisdom, two things you wanna own, if you believe in streaming, are Netflix. [00:06:02] Douglas: own Alphabet because in the breakup you get, [00:06:06] Lee Jackson: You&#8217;ll get your share of the YouTube chunk. Yeah. Alright, so, we&#8217;re still, we&#8217;re pretty much a fan of Google at these, at these levels, aren&#8217;t we? [00:06:18] Douglas: I&#8217;m a fan of that. We are now listing many, many more reasons that we&#8217;re Alphabet fans, so The post Google&#8217;s Best Business Isn&#8217;t What You Think appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Key Points ETFs have generated higher returns than mutual funds. GLD, VYM, and QQQ have the potential to outpace S&amp;P 500. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) 2025 hasn’t been a smooth ride. The economy has seen volatility, the market has seen several ups and downs, and investors are scrambling to look for low-risk options to invest their money. There are concerns about the impact of tariffs, and consumer spending is low. Amidst the uncertainty, the only way to invest is to look for low-volatility investment options that can generate steady income. Exchange-traded funds have emerged as one of the top investment options this year. They allow investors to own a collection of stocks with just one investment and at a low cost. I was a die-hard fan of mutual funds, but the returns weren’t satisfactory, which is why I decided to make a switch to ETFs. With thousands of ETFs to choose from, it can become overwhelming, and the industry is getting more crowded. Here are the top 3 I invested in. SPDR Gold Shares Gold has always been considered a hedge against inflation, and the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) ETF is a top choice amid uncertain markets. Launched by State Street Global Advisors, the ETF is traded on exchanges in Hong Kong, Mexico, Japan, and Singapore. It is a trust that purchases, stores, and sells gold bullion, allowing investors to capitalize on rising gold prices. It has a low expense ratio of 0.40% and is the largest gold ETF in the market. Its NAV has soared over 40% in a year and about 12% in five years. The fund launched in 2004 and has kept pace with the S&amp;P 500 over the years. Gold prices will fluctuate in the short term, but the past year has seen a steady upside. Geopolitical tensions and the expanding money supply have lifted the commodity’s value. GLD is a defensive investment, and it brings stability to my portfolio. It is easier for me to pay the annual management fee as compared to buying and storing gold bullion. This ETF has become a centrepiece of my portfolio. Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF A reliable dividend ETF by Vanguard, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSE: VYM) has a strong history of delivering steady income and capital appreciation. It has an expense ratio of 0.06% and it tracks the performance of FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. VYM has a yield of 2.57% and holds 582 stocks. The sector distribution includes: Financials: 21.50% Industrials: 13.40% Technology: 12.30% Healthcare: 12.10% It holds some of the biggest dividend paying companies in the top 10, including Walmart, AbbVie, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Exxon Mobil. The ETF pays quarterly dividends, and the strong portfolio allows it to remain consistent at it. VYM has generated double-digit annualized market returns with a return of 10.4% in 5 years and 12.4% in the past year. The fund is filled with large-cap stocks that have a stable balance sheet and a record of strong financial performance. Despite market volatility, the fund has remained resilient and outperformed the S&amp;P 500. It offers a safety net and steady dividend income. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) I believe in the future of tech and wanted to make the most of the sector. Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) allows me to do that. It holds the Magnificent Seven and has a yield of 0.58%. The fund is known for its impressive capital appreciation. QQQ tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100 index and has the 100 largest companies listed on the stock exchange. It aims for high growth while providing exposure to the best U.S. non-financial companies. It is a tech-focused ETF with over 50% allocation to tech stocks, followed by 19.66% in consumer staples and 5.80% in healthcare. It is top heavy with the 10 holdings making up 51% of the portfolio and these include the Magnificent Seven like Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Apple. Slightly on the expensive side, QQQ has an NAV of 530.82 and is up 16% in 12 months. The NAV has soared over 100% in the past five years, generating impressive gains for investors. As long as the tech sector continues to expand, QQQ is set to benefit. The post I Switched from Mutual Funds to These 3 ETFs—Here’s Why appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Alphabet Inc. delivered a strong quarter, beating expectations on all fronts, yet the market fixates on $85B capex and misses the underlying quality and growth. I see Alphabet as a rare value: robust cash flow, accelerating cloud and YouTube profitability, and a fortress balance sheet, all trading at a discount. The market's anxiety over high capex is misplaced—these are strategic AI infrastructure investments, not reckless spending, and protect long-term competitiveness."

I will now turn the call over to Nick. Nick? Nick Fink Thanks, Curt, and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining our call. On today's call, I will start with the strategic actions that we are taking to generate growth while flexing our cost structure in response to market conditions. I will also provide an update on the tariff landscape and our mitigation strategy which is on track to fully offset the anticipated impact of tariffs this year and on an annualized basis. In addition to covering our execution and the drivers of our above-market performance within the quarter, I will also share my thoughts around the remarkable progress that we have made in our multiyear transformation. I'll close by discussing the macroeconomic environment and summarize our performance in the quarter. John will then review our financial results in more detail and provide color on our updated guidance for the remainder of 2025. In the second quarter, Fortune Brands delivered solid execution and outperformed our end market with impressive share gains across many of our businesses including in our core water and outdoors businesses. In a market environment that continues to be dynamic, we have demonstrated our ability to respond quickly and decisively. At the same time, we have maintained a relentless focus on our key strategic priorities and have continued to invest in our brands, accelerate innovation, and drive operational excellence. We have made significant progress on our multiyear transformation into a highly aligned and efficient growth company, which I will detail shortly and are driving our strategy to grow the core and accelerate digital. By harnessing best-in-class consumer and customer insights, we can anticipate market trends and meet evolving needs with precision. Through focused investment in our leading brands and targeted innovation, we are driving product leadership and differentiation across key categories. At the same time, our ongoing digital transformation allows us to introduce and refine digital products and solutions with supercharged growth trajectories. In addition to accelerating growth, this transformation continues to improve our operational efficiency, strengthen relationships with consumers and customers, attract top talent, and help us uncover new opportunities in a rapidly evolving world. As a consequence, we believe Fortune Brands is well positioned to deliver long-term exceptional opportunities for all of our stakeholders. I am proud of our team's focus and commitment and of their agility in addressing the challenging near-term market dynamics. During the second quarter, we executed several key growth and efficiency initiatives across our portfolio which I will detail shortly. We're already starting to see the positive impact from many of these actions, and we expect that we will continue to see the benefits throughout the remainder of the year and beyond. Starting with our water business. In the second quarter, we significantly outperformed our core North American market. We won new business as well as commitments for increased share with several large national builders with our powerful Moen brand. We also expanded our offerings in product categories targeted at the retail and e-commerce channels, which we expect will help us gain additional share over time. From a brand and product positioning standpoint, we continue to build momentum for the third and fourth quarters with multiple wins in both wholesale and retail, and we recently launched the important refresh of our market-leading chateau collection. These initiatives and wins are a testament to the strength of our Moen and House of Rohl brands, our unique ability to manage diverse and complex channels, and to the depth of our customer relationships. In outdoors, we launched a new comprehensive brand collective for outdoors brands. We expect the initiative to enhance our go-to-market strategy, accelerate innovation, and drive growth by providing a cohesive platform for building professionals seeking innovative and trusted products and is a great example of the power of the aligned Fortune Brands structure. In addition, we continue to roll out our large and perfect aisle reset in retail with great early results. By focusing on understanding why consumers purchase storm and screen doors and what attributes are most meaningful to them in this category, we were able to deliver an entirely new in-aisle experience with innovative product, and we're already seeing both accelerated growth and share gains as a result. Within security, we had a number of successful designs and product updates. During the quarter, we launched our Master It brand campaign from Master Lock and have already seen a 60% increase in our website traffic compared to the same time last year, which we expect to translate into growth in the coming quarters. This is our first major brand campaign in many years and was made possible by our newly aligned organizational structure. We've also made focused investments in redesigning the retail shelf and product strategy for Master Lock to see additional future growth in the channel. We expect our refreshed brand strategy will result in sales uplifts across our channels during the second half. We are seeing the results of our renewed focus on everyday great execution. For example, in our important back-to-school category for security, we are seeing double-digit improvement versus last year as the team developed more focused action plans under its new leadership and executed them with excellence. It will take a little more time before the full benefits are realized, but the progress is evident and concrete. Turning to our digital business. We now have around 5 million active users. We continue to see solid momentum. And in the second quarter of 2025, we had around 220,000 digital device activations. To reverse the flow, we expect to reach an important milestone in our digital journey with a pilot of a new subscription model during the third quarter. Designed to offer an attractive entry point for new flow customers, it will also provide us with a high-quality recurring revenue stream that has the potential to serve as a model for other portions of our connected business. We continue to secure new partnerships with leading insurance companies and are on track to more than double our sales through the insurance channel this calendar year. Additionally, we've concluded a study with a top three insurance carrier that again supports our value proposition of dramatically reducing preventable water damage claims for insurers, and we expect the white paper on this to be published shortly. Flow has consistently demonstrated impressive growth, including over 70% growth in the second quarter, and the opportunity pipeline is robust and keeps growing as the value proposition becomes more widely understood. We also successfully launched our new Yale Smart Lock with Matter designed for Google Home. This is a significant milestone in our longstanding partnership with Google and the evolution of the original Nest by Yale lock. It is also the culmination of a multiyear collaboration between Google and Yale to bring a more approachable easy-to-use smart lock to market and will be the first product with the Google home preferred product batch. We see great potential for the future product road map and an opportunity to expand applications for the Yale Smart Lock with Matter. We expect to see good results from this business as these partnerships continue to ramp up and we lap the discontinuation of the older generation Google product. Overall, our digital business is very strong, and we are on track to deliver significant year-over-year growth in 2025. As a result of slower load-ins, we now expect our digital sales to be around $250 million and expect annualized sales approaching $300 million in 2025. Our digital business remains a key differentiator for us, and we continue to expect this growth platform to only get stronger as we continue to build our scale and capabilities and drive awareness of these important and highly innovative products. Moving to tariffs. The landscape continues to evolve, but our core strategies remain intact and are delivering. We remain on track to fully offset the anticipated in-year impact in 2025 and the annualized impact in 2026 of tariffs through a combination of supply chain actions, cost-out opportunities, and strategic pricing actions across our portfolio. We are employing a surgical approach to strike the right balance between price, demand elasticity, and overall profitability in the light of a dynamic external environment. We're taking a long-term and highly strategic view, continuing to position ourselves as market leaders in categories where brands, quality, and innovation really matter and are working to preserve pricing integrity for our partners. We have accelerated investments in our revenue growth management and category management capabilities and expect to become even more agile and precise with our pricing strategies as a result. We have a proven track record of cost discipline, allowing us to focus our investments and flex our cost structure to deliver solid operating margins and fuel for growth. The second quarter was no different as we successfully navigated an uncertain consumer demand backdrop by delivering decremental margins in line with our expectations. As we outlined in our first quarter results, we have identified opportunities to control the pace of hiring related to our transition to our new headquarters campus, which will not only result in SG&A savings through the second half of 2025 but will also accelerate our efforts to create a more efficient and agile organization that will foster increased collaboration and ideation. Before I turn to the macro environment and provide an overview of our second quarter results, I want to take a moment to put our multiyear transformation to context and provide additional clarity on the remaining milestones ahead. Fortune Brands is evolving from a siloed operation with isolated strengths into a unified agile growth engine centered on brand-driven innovation, accelerated digital capabilities, and shared organizational strengths while preserving the unique identity of each business and brand. This transformation began about three years ago and consists of three main pillars. Our first pillar was centered around redefining and focusing our portfolio on high-growth segments of the market driven by leadership in brand and innovation. This was achieved through our spin-off of Master Brand Cabinets and the acquisition of Yale and Emtek, which massively accelerated our luxury and digital transformation. Next, we focused on creating a business unit-led organization supported by operational centers of excellence, which allow the organization to prioritize our greatest opportunities and deploy best-in-class resources accordingly. Finally, our last pillar focuses on accelerating our execution and growth through our simplified leadership structure, one HQ initiative, and our talent transition and upscaling. As of today, we have completed the first two pillars and are midway through executing the third pillar. I'm proud of the momentum that we have generated along the way, and I'm excited to fully unlock the tremendous growth potential of our company. Through these first two pillars, we crystallize the Fortune Brands advantage capabilities, which include category management, business simplification, global supply chain excellence, and digital transformation. We emphasize collaborating with channel partners to drive performance, leveraging our leading brand portfolio to optimize market positioning and capture share. Further, we streamlined operations to improve efficiency and agility. We have a robust North America focused supply chain with reduced reliance on China or single points of failure, allowing us to swiftly adapt to tariffs and other disruptions. Finally, we have been accelerating digital product development and integrating data science, technology, and analytics to enhance pricing strategies, speed to market, and customer engagement. This year, we initiated the third pillar of our transformation, focused on reaccelerating our execution and growth through a simplified leadership structure and a transition to a new unified campus in the Chicago area. Our new structure and leadership team are in place and are highly aligned and energized focusing on our innovation, solidifying our channel partnerships, and working to continually elevate our operational excellence. As our team builds momentum on these initiatives, I am confident that this will translate to continued above-market performance over the long term. While we are executing on the one headquarters transition, we are taking a very thoughtful approach to ensure continuity of institutional knowledge among our associates while maintaining laser focus on our operations and customer relationships. I want to recognize and acknowledge the tremendous efforts of our entire team in helping us ensure a smooth transition to our new headquarters. It is because of their contributions that we are in this position to take Fortune Brands to the next stage of our transformation. At the same time, I continue to be amazed by the exceptional quality of the talent we are attracting to the organization since we made the one headquarters announcement earlier this year. Coupled with our outstanding legacy talent, I'm confident our highly engaged and energized workforce will drive exceptional results. We expect this pillar of our transformation will extend into 2026 as we complete the headquarters move ahead of schedule. Turning now to our economic outlook. From a macroeconomic perspective, we continue to see broader uncertainty weigh on consumer demand. This has been evident in the monthly trends for single-family new construction and repair and remodel activity through the second quarter as home buyers and homeowners are hesitant to invest in the current environment. However, we are encouraged by more recent improving data points for R&R spending. Looking beyond the near-term uncertainty, the intermediate and longer-term fundamentals for our sector remain extremely attractive marked by significant underbuild in the U.S. housing stock and historically elevated home equity values, which point to a multiyear pent-up demand for our core products. In addition, our strategy remains to build out new idiosyncratic growth platforms less tied to macro concerns such as connected platforms and luxury products, which offer compelling value to customers and create additional value streams that augment our core businesses. Turning to our second quarter performance. Fortune Brands outperformed our end market with impressive share gains in our core water and outdoors businesses. Excluding China, we estimate that we outperformed the end market for our products by over 200 basis points, and we returned to positive point-of-sale growth across water and outdoors. Net revenue was 1.2 billion, down 3% versus the second quarter of 2024 or down 1% excluding the impact of China. We achieved these above-market results as we gained share in core product categories and built momentum in connected products. We effectively balanced tariff-related pricing actions with strategic promotional activity and leveraged our channel partnerships to deliver value to our customers and consumers. Additionally, we focused on everyday great execution to maintain our strong balance sheet by managing our cost structure and deliver decremental margins consistent with our targets. Our operating income was $199 million, and our operating margin was 16.5%. Our earnings per share were $1. Turning now to our individual business results. Starting with water. Excluding the impact of China, the segment saw net sales growth of 2% driven by strong results in [inaudible] North America and House of Rohl. Net sales declined 2% including the impact of China as the Chinese residential construction market was weaker than anticipated. Water point-of-sale outperformed the market and was up slightly excluding China compared to the broader market which we estimate was down low-single digit to mid-single digit. Our core Moen business clearly outperformed the market and gained share with retail point-of-sale up low-single digit, and we continue to see excellent brand recognition and loyalty in our retail business especially among pro consumers. We recently commissioned a study to evaluate the strength of our Moen brand with the pro. The study confirmed that the pro consumer strongly prefers the Moen brand on the basis of Moen's quality, reliability, customer service, and warranty programs. In fact, our research indicates that 70% of pros would change their shopping habits if Moen, their preferred brand, was unavailable. Our U.S. luxury business again performed well as the higher-end consumer remains resilient and continues to choose products based on craftsmanship, design, and brand prestige, demonstrating demand that is less influenced by price sensitivity in the housing market and more by lifestyle alignment. Our House of Rohl brand is the most highly rated with designers and leads on brand perception for luxury, trust, and innovation. Point-of-sale for House of Rohl was up an impressive high-single digits, which compares very favorably to the broader market which we estimate was down low-single digits. We're still in the early innings of building this business into a global luxury powerhouse. Looking forward to the remainder of 2025, we expect Moen to benefit from the newly won business with large national builders and several large retail promotional events that we were awarded for the second half of 2025. We still expect choppiness as the market adjusts to tariff pricing and consumer confidence normalizes, but we are well positioned for long-term share growth underpinned by our great portfolio and improved execution. Finally, our luxury brands exited the second quarter with excellent momentum which we expect to build upon in the second half. Turning to outdoors. We had a strong second quarter with low-single-digit point-of-sale growth, outpacing our core addressable markets, which we estimate were down low-single digits during the quarter. This was offset by lower channel inventory levels versus the second quarter of 2024, which resulted in a 3% decline in sales for outdoors compared to last year. Our market outperformance was driven by Therma-Tru doors, which had very strong performance in retail and wholesale, and Larson as our Larson perfect aisle continued to roll out and drive meaningful outperformance as we reinvigorated an entire category. We also saw a very strong wholesale demand for decking towards the end of the quarter and coming into July. Looking forward to the remainder of 2025, we are optimistic about the solid momentum being built across outdoors. Our outdoors brands have a very robust and vertically integrated North American and U.S. supply chain footprint, and we expect that this will continue to be a significant differentiator for us, particularly in fiberglass doors as cheap Chinese import inventory dwindles. For Therma-Tru, we are seeing incremental demand for slab doors from distributor and wholesale customers, which we expect to accelerate through the second half of the year as tariffs take full effect. Finally, our security segment sales decreased 7% in the quarter, primarily due to market softness, destocking, and a first half headwind from prior execution challenges in 2024, which have been addressed. This was partially offset by our commercial and professional business as well as the e-commerce channel where we gained share across all of our product categories. Looking forward to the remainder of 2025, we expect to benefit from the ramp-up of the new Yale Smart Lock with Matter including with Google. We also see tremendous opportunity to capitalize on the branding investments from the past year to expand share in retail and ecommerce. We have line of sight to new retail customer wins during the second half that we expect to contribute to our results this year and to carry into 2026. Under new and refocused leadership, we have realigned our general management organizations to drive direct accountability and have seen excellent momentum with our customers, which we expect will lead to incremental growth in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, with respect to back-to-school, we're already seeing the initial results of our focus on everyday great execution. Additionally, from a year-over-year growth perspective, we expect to benefit from easier comparisons in the second half as we lap the impact of destocking in last year's execution issues as well as other onetime events. To recap, I'm encouraged by our results. the progress we made on our strategic priorities and our solid market outperformance during the second quarter. Our agility in addressing the impact of tariffs coupled with our commitment to innovation, operational excellence, and cost management put us in an excellent position to navigate the current environment and strengthen our position going forward. Throughout our multiyear transformational effort, our underlying value proposition has remained the same. Our brands are synonymous with innovation, trust, and design. We aspire to be a true partner for our customers and are committed to meeting the changing needs of our consumers. And finally, we have inherent secular growth drivers that we expect will allow us to gain share and generate above-market returns in the long term. As we finalize the last leg of our transformation and accelerate execution, this is a great time to be at Fortune Brands. I couldn't be more excited for the future of our company, and I'm confident in our team's ability to execute on our strategic priorities with excellence. I will now turn the call over to Jon. Jon Baksht Thank you, Nick. Before I begin my discussion of our financial results, I'd like to take a moment to thank Nick and the broader Fortune Brands team for such a warm welcome to the company over the past three months. I've been extremely impressed by the extraordinary talent throughout the organization and the shared sense of purpose felt by all our associates. All the positive attributes that I observed from the outside have only been reinforced. I'm excited to join this organization at such an impactful inflection point for the company. I was initially drawn to Fortune Brands by the foundational strengths of the company, the enduring brands, high margin profile, and strong free cash flow generation, among many others. Overlaying the innovation story and upside growth potential with the connected business made the opportunity even more compelling. Nick described the three pillars in the ongoing transformation that is entering the third phase, and my initial interactions with various stakeholders, I believe one aspect that's underestimated is the value that will be created by moving from a holding company structure to an operating company structure, of which the one HQ initiative is a part of. In the quarter-to-quarter world of public companies, that value will always be visible immediately, and the returns won't be realized in a straight line, but I'm confident those along for the journey will be rewarded over the long term. We're taking this opportunity to build out a best-in-class platform across the portfolio, starting with a simplified and standardized data layer feeding modern systems leveraging AI with streamlined and standardized processes run by a passionate team with the shared vision for innovation and excellence. This next stage in our transformation will drive improved insights into the business with improved analytics which will ultimately drive enhanced financial performance, returns, and value creation. I'm grateful to be a part of such a talented and collaborative leadership team, and I'm excited about our opportunity to drive additional momentum as the team comes together at our new campus. Now let me discuss our second quarter results. As a reminder, my comments will focus on results before charges and gains to best reflect ongoing business performance. Additionally, comparisons will be made against the same period last year unless otherwise noted. In the second quarter, sales were $1.2 billion, down 3% in total and down 1% excluding China. Consolidated operating income was $199 million, down 8%. Total company operating margin was 16.5%, and earnings per share were $1. Our effective tax rate was elevated this quarter at 31% due to withholding tax triggered by a repatriation of cash from China as we previewed last quarter. On a full year basis, we anticipate an effective tax rate between 26.5% and 27.5%. Our second quarter sales performance was mostly driven by low-single-digit point-of-sale declines, which was indicative of the broader demand environment. Excluding China, our POS was essentially flat. Importantly, our POS performance in the quarter surpassed the market, reflecting the strength of our brands and the solid execution across our teams. Turning to our segments. Beginning with water, sales were $647 million, down 2% but up 2% excluding China. Our results reflect POS, which was up slightly, excluding China and channel inventory improvement in wholesale and retail as well as the impact of disciplined pricing actions across our portfolio. Within our water segment, Moen and House of Roll outperformed the market. Water's operating income was $165.5 million, an increase of 8% compared to last year. Operating margin was 25.6%, up 230 basis points as productivity improvements from strategic sourcing initiatives, manufacturing efficiencies, and lower SG&A were able to offset the lower sales revenue. For the full year, we are targeting operating margins to be 23% to 24%. Turning to outdoors. Sales were $379 million, down 3% as reduced channel inventories offset low-single-digit POS growth during the quarter. We made significant progress in the rollout of our Larson perfect aisle reset, which was largely complete at the end of the second quarter. Initial results have exceeded our expectations and have also led to share gains. Outdoor segment operating income was $48.6 million, down 23% from the prior year quarter. The primary driver of the decline in operating income was the lag effect of higher cost inventory from the second half of 2024 flowing through our cost of sales during the second quarter. Q2 segment operating margin was 12.8%, and we are targeting 14% to 15% for the full year. In security, our second quarter sales were $178 million and declined 7% driven by mid-single-digit POS declines, which largely reflect a first half headwind from prior execution challenges in 2024. We saw solid growth in our e-commerce channel where we gained share across all product categories during the quarter. Segment operating income was $26.3 million, down 27%, and segment operating margin was 14.8%, reflecting the impact of lower volumes as well as increased investment in branding and advertising for Master Lock and SentrySafe. It's important to note that these investments are effectively a reset of our marketing strategy with the brands and represent the largest investment in these brands in several years. For the full year, we are targeting operating margins of 16.5% to 17.5%. Turning to the balance sheet. We are managing our capital structure with the objective of balancing our cost of capital, returns and overall flexibility. Our balance sheet remains solid with cash of $235 million, net debt of $2.6 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage of 2.8x. We continue to expect our net debt to EBITDA to be between 2.2x and 2.5x at year-end, demonstrating the strong free cash flow generation of the business. During the quarter, we paid off our $500 million 2025 senior notes through a combination of commercial paper borrowings and cash on hand. We also have $613 million available on our revolver at quarter end. In the second quarter, we returned $93 million to shareholders including $63 million in share repurchases. We have spent $238 million on share repurchases through the second quarter year-to-date. Our second quarter free cash flow was approximately $119 million, reflecting a seasonal uplift from first quarter. Before turning to our outlook, I'll provide an update on our tariff exposure. Based on tariff rates as of July 29th and assuming country-specific rate changes that have been announced on or prior to July 29th take effect on August 1st, we anticipate unmitigated impact of approximately $80 million in 2025 and $260 million on an annualized basis. Of the anticipated $260 million of annualized impact, approximately half is related to China, and the balance is rest of world. Consistent with our previous guidance, we continue to expect to fully mitigate the anticipated in-year and annualized impacts. As a predominantly North America-based manufacturer, our footprint leaves us very well positioned to both service our customers at a high level and take share in the current environment. Since 2017, we have reduced our spend from China by over 60%. And by end of the year, we continue to expect our China COGS to be around 10%. Turning now to our outlook. Over the past quarter, we have taken decisive actions to mitigate the impact of tariffs and have worked with our customers and suppliers to find win-win solutions to address the challenges. In the process, we have progressed our expectations for 2025 performance and believe we have improved visibility into the range of potential outcomes for the remainder of the year. As a result, we are using this opportunity to provide updated full year 2025 guidance. We expect full year net sales to be flat to down 2%, and we expect full year EPS within the range of $3.75 to $3.95. Our guidance is driven by our view on the markets. For 2025, we expect the global market for our products to be down 4% to down 2% with the U.S. housing market to be down 4% to down 2%. Within this market forecast, we expect U.S. repair and remodel to be down 3% to down 1% and U.S. single-family new construction to be down 6% to down 5%. Compared to our initial guidance from February, the most notable change is U.S. single-family new construction, which at the start of the year, we had forecast to be down 2% to up 2%. This incorporates the single-family new construction trends observed during the first half. We've reduced our expectations for the other primary metrics by approximately 1 to 2 percentage points each. Looking ahead to the second half, we expect our results to benefit from market outperformance in each of our segments with momentum carrying into the third and fourth quarters. These are underpinned by the pull-through of customer commitments in water, highly visible incremental demand in outdoors, and new product launches and brand campaigns in security. We also benefit from lapping of onetime events that impacted our results in the second half of last year, particularly in outdoors and security. Throughout the cycle, we are continuing to invest for growth and committed to delivering shareholder value. That said, we're also highly aware that the external environment remains very dynamic, and that the consumer is cautious and sensitive to volatility. Overall, we remain thoughtfully optimistic as we have good line of sight about our ability to address what is in our control. While the long-term fundamentals of our market continue to be attractive, the near-term consumer demand environment remains dynamic. As we have in prior periods of uncertainty, we are focused on outperforming our markets, thoughtfully managing expenses while continuing to make key strategic investments and generating cash. In conclusion, our teams continue to execute at a high level across our businesses, and we remain well positioned to capitalize on future growth opportunities. As we have highlighted, the market backdrop continues to be dynamic, and the tariff-related uncertainty continues to weigh on consumer sentiment. Despite these challenges, our second quarter performance demonstrates the resilience of our business and Fortune Brands' ability to deliver sustainable results. In addition, we reiterate our expectation to fully offset the anticipated impact of tariffs in 2025 as well as in 2026. We remain confident in the long-term outlook for our core end markets and our ability to continue to generate shareholder value into the future. I will now pass the call back to Curt to open the call for questions. Curt Worthington Thanks, Jon. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin taking a limited number of questions. Since there may be a number of you who would like to ask a question, I will ask that you limit your initial questions to two and then reenter the queue to ask additional questions. I will now turn the call back over to the operator to begin the question-and-answer session. Operator, can you open the line for questions? Thank you. Operator We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up the handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we pull for questions. Our first question is from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Matthew Bouley Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to start out actually on the connected products business. I take a lot of promising progress that you spoke to, including that subscription model coming, so I would love to hear more detail on that. I think on the numbers, I think I heard you say the updated sales guide for this year is 250, but you still expect to get to that 300 million run rate. So, just any more details on kind of the pluses and minuses that are impacting 2025 as you get all these initiatives coming through and you get to that run rate kind of any early thoughts on how the business is shaping up perhaps for 2026. Thank you. Nick Fink Sure, Matt. Happy to jump in there and describe a little bit of what's going on. So, firstly, we're super pleased with the connected results. We've invested heavily in the space in the last few years, and it's just great to see this momentum and scale continue to build not just frankly on the sales line but just also the team that we've built, the digital fluency, the entire organization that's kind of come along for the journey with them and then now the leverage of that knowledge like into the legacy business in terms of driving AI tools and processes into the business. With [inaudible] connected business itself, I would say the performance is here -- you're right. 250 million is our expectation for the year, but the run rate we think we'll close out the year closer to 300 million. And as we look at the pipeline, I would say it's both broader and a little bit slower than we expected. So, broader in that we're touching on even more space and opportunity than we had anticipated, more insurance partners coming into the mix, sort of more adjacencies in terms of areas that we can impact with the connected portfolio including the recent launch of our connected lockout tagout portfolio and finding some huge white space there that we can go after. And then learning that as we build this giant pipeline of opportunity and contracts that we've built, converting those into sales and driving that process. And so, the teams are very, very focused on that bottom end of the funnel and that conversion piece. And then as you touched on, we're also very excited to be launching the subscription test this quarter. We think it's a win-win. Obviously, a win for us to get people onto subscription recurring revenue, right, now at 5 million users plus. So, that is a big part of the future. But our consumer research tells us it's a win for the consumer, too. They much prefer from the research the lower entry point of a subscription to a onetime purchase. And so, we think if this -- we want to test it and see if it works. But if it works not only will help us accelerate sales and penetration. It's going to put the company on a really solid recurring revenue footing. So, we're very, very excited about it. And then beyond the -- that piece also just the new partnership with Google. So, sunsetting that older first-generation Google product, which a lot of which was sunsetted last year, which is a part of the headwind that we went through as that sunset before the new products came online. But with that hitting the market now, we think it's a really great product that's going to do some exciting things. Matthew Bouley Okay. Great. No, that's really helpful. Thank you for that, Nick. And then secondly, jumping over to the water business, and I wanted to ask around market share. It sounded like POS outperformed the market. I heard you say you won maybe some new business with large builders and there might be some offerings coming down the pike here that would be targeted for retail. I think e-commerce, as well. So, maybe if you can just sort of level set us on what's happening with market share in the water business across your channels. And sort of what the impact of some of these wins may have as we think about the second half of the year. Thank you. Nick Fink Sure. Happy to do that. So, why don't I start with Moen. So, as you mentioned, builder business, we saw some really nice performance out of the team, both getting increased commitment for share from existing as well as converting new. And, as you know, a very large business for us to see that continued conversion. And I think it really speaks to the strength of the ecosystem. It's the product, the support, the service, the warranty, the professional support, and belief in the product. And so, that came through very strongly I'm happy with that. Retail performance also very strong in the quarter. So, very pleased, and we think that's just the beginning. We've done a lot to reinvigorate the work that we're doing with our retail partners, and I think we can elevate that even further. So, a lot of focus from the team coming. I think that will play out well through this year but really get some acceleration in '26. And then some opportunity I think still around e-commerce. I talked on the last call about how we had really started to enforce much stronger pricing discipline in e-commerce. And that takes time, and it takes it takes discipline, frankly, is the word to stick to it and to enforce it. And so, that over time, as that discipline starts to stick and we're able to then go in and really win on the basis of products and our ability to optimize search and do problems in the right way, we expect it will be a tailwind in the future. But I think some more work for the team to do there. If I flip over to the House of Rohl, really strong resilience with that luxury consumer. I mean, we saw excellent results out of the House of Rohl. Really delighted with the performance that the team has driven to continue to bring that to life in the portfolio and see that performance really compounding and growing into the back half of the year. So, resilient with that end luxury consumer, and I think the portfolio is really just answering the consumer needs and the designer needs. So, really good performance there. Matthew Bouley Well, all right. Thanks, Nick. Good luck, guys. Nick Fink Thank you. Operator Our next question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. My first question is on the -- Nick Fink Hey, Susan. Susan Maklari Hello. My first question is on the security segment. It sounds like you've had some really nice initiatives there as you're gaining in that e-commerce channel. Can you talk a bit about some of those retail wins, as well, in the second half and how we should be thinking about this new launch and focus on the brand coming together in the next couple of quarters? Nick Fink Yeah. So, just -- great question. And as a reminder, we've have been on a journey with security. I mean, we really set out I think even way back over to the last Investor Day talking about how we were going to take this segment on a journey to really, through some supply chain initiatives, rebuild the margin of the business.to create fuel for growth to then start to reinvest in brand. As you see the margin profile now coming through, that gives us much more room to make those investments. And then through our kind of one Fortune Brands initiatives to bring this company together, we're now able to leverage our marketing expertise to really bring the first major refresh and brand campaign to security in several decades. And so, we're very excited about where it's coming. The master [sp] campaign as I mentioned on the call, we've seen a 60% uptick in website visits. I think I mentioned on the last call, in SentrySafe we're early experimenting around doing some work there. We saw double-digit uptick in website visits there translating into double-digit point-of-sale growth in that quarter. So, this stuff works. What you should expect from us is this campaign to now roll out not just above line but all the way through the funnel with a very consistent, much clearer shelf set and product set and messaging to the consumer that allows them to navigate this category, which we do captain as the leader in a very simple way where they can understand the value of the different price points of our product. And we think that's going to be a really great opportunity. And so, new leadership in there. A lot has been done to really reorient that business, drive accountability with the GMs inside of that business. And as we get through the headwinds of some of the execution issues last year, we think we get into the back half of this year, we're going to see some really solid performance, but that performance is really just building momentum into '26 and beyond. Susan Maklari Okay. That's very helpful color, Nick. And then maybe turning to the margins, the consolidated margin. Can you talk a bit about the cost saving efforts that you are pursuing, where we are in that process, how we should think about those benefits coming through? And then any color on the path for profitability in the back half of this year? Nick Fink Yeah. So, why don't I start with some high-level thoughts. I'm going to hand it over to Jon to take us through some of the detail. But a couple of things. One thing is this management team feels that it's very much a duty to manage the P&L with discipline in a category that at times can have headwinds. And certainly, in the last couple of years, there's been more headwinds than we've expected, and I think we're proud of the way in which we've managed the P&L tightly not just to deliver for shareholders from a margin perspective but also to create the field to reinvest in the business. And we've continued to make those investments in brand and innovation and in digital. And so, that's very much the philosophy of the team including our presidents and general managers that's sort of part of the DNA. I think as we got into this year, this one headquarters move, which we're more than halfway through now, actually ended up giving us flexibility as we were moving people and at the same time rehiring people to control the pace of that and really think deeply about exactly what capabilities we needed and when. And that's given us flexibility as we built the cost base for this year and hopefully will allow us to leverage that as we get into next. So, I don't know if you want to add some color to that? Jon Baksht Yeah, sure. And just looking at the cost structure going into the back part of the year, we touched on in the opening remarks that moving into the new headquarters here in the fall. We've got move-in dates starting out in September. And as we do that, we're -- there's going to be some efficiencies that we're going to gain from just consolidating some of the operations there from a corporate basis. And then if you look at some of the business units in the segments, for example, both outdoors and securities are going to see higher margins as we go into the back part of the year. Different factors driving each of them. Within outdoors, one of the dynamics that impacted the first half this year was frankly just some higher costs that were in the back part of last year that -- for inventory we under absorbed last year in the back part of the year, which led to higher cost of goods for this particularly in the decking segment there. We're going to see that roll off going into the second half of the year, which should lead to some better market performance there. On security, we talked about some of the investments we've been making in the marketing and the branding there. Those are investments that we made largely in Q2. We're going to continue to invest to drive that growth. But if you look at some of the margin that we're expecting to get back and going into the back part of the year, we're expecting to get some of the benefits of that incremental spend this quarter seeing that into really translate next half. Susan Maklari Okay. That's helpful color. Thank you both and good luck with the quarter. Nick Fink Yeah, thanks. Jon Baksht Thank you. Operator And our next question is from John Lovallo with UBS. John Lovallo Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions, as well. The first one is just on the water segment, the 25.6% margin. I think is among the highest probably that you guys have achieved. And I know you talked about productivity, manufacturing efficiencies, SG&A, things of that nature. Just curious if there was anything kind of onetime in nature in that number, anything related to the prebuy or things like that? And also, what level of pricing have you guys realized here ahead of the tariffs? Jon Baksht Yeah. I can start, John. No, it's a great question. We're really proud of the 25.5% -- 25.6% that we achieved this quarter. There weren't any one timers that were flowing through there. It was all those things that you mentioned and that we prepared -- that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. All of those are a factor. I would say the -- from a kind of breakdown within there. The House of Rohl segment was a nice example of an area that we've touched on in the luxury segment where the consumer really has been more resilient, and we've been able to see some price increases, volume increases there within that segment, which has really helped to drive some of that increase. The other piece that I would point to just broadly speaking, we're going to be taking some promote -- we're going to be factoring in some other promotional events and other things to drive further sales going into the back part of the year, which we've guided to 23% to 24% on a full year basis. So, in not a large decremental margin, but that is going to normalize as we get into the back part of the year with that and some of the new business that we've won. Nick Fink And I'd just add on your question on pricing, I mean, we really try to be disciplined across the businesses and take pricing in a regular way and in an incremental way where we don't have to do large catch-up prices, et cetera. And you saw us do that during the supply chain shocks post COVID, and here we've really done our best to sort of keep it in the mid-single-digit range on average. As Jon mentioned, our target margin for the year 23, 24, so we're not going to try to overshoot the mark. We're going to trying to stay really competitive for our customers and our consumers and to the extent there is a court like this that allows us to continue to do so also while we invest to continue to drive the brand and innovation across this portfolio. John Lovallo Okay. That's helpful. And then on the updated tariff numbers, the 80 million in 2025 and the 260 in 2026 unmitigated. Maybe just help us understand the plan to offset maybe the mix between pricing cost savings, supply chain initiatives in each year would be helpful. Thank you. Nick Fink Yeah, I'll start, and Jon add some color. But what I'd say is, obviously, for competitive reasons, we don't break that down. But we are working the supply chain piece the hardest, right? Our goal is to get supply chain savings where we can, reorient the supply chain where we can, do all the work and -- the work that the team has done, there's really been second to none and the speed at which they've gone off to this. And you can see it, right, in the offsets. Really, again, leveraging the digital investments that we've made in our own systems, the ability to draw that data, analyze that data, and act on that data has been second to none. And so, we've been able to make a lot of progress there. And then we can't cover, we look to price to cover. But we will keep going back to the cost and supply chain opportunities and keep working them over. And to the extent that then starts to over deliver, that's going to give us more flex on the price piece, either to put that price back to work in promo or reinvest it for branded growth. Jon Baksht Sure. And just to add maybe a little bit of color in terms of where those tariffs are coming from. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that our exposure to China as part of our COGS is roughly 10%. Now, to put that into perspective of the 260 million annualized number, about half of that impact is China. And so, to the effect that we are able to manage that supply chain to mitigate that risk and looking through optimization there, that's a big part of those mitigation efforts. John Lovallo Great. Thanks very much, guys. Operator Our next question is from McClaran Hayes with Zelman & Associates. McClaran Hayes Hey. How's it going, guys? I was just wondering first on the tariffs, has that lower annualized number impacted the way that you guys are thinking about going after some of those cost-out actions and balancing that with the investments you're making? Nick Fink Yeah. I mean, every day. Like every day, we're rerunning the model it seems like. So, absolutely. Look, it changes the mix of what you're doing, but what it doesn't change is the principle of what we're doing. What we're doing is aiming to build a regionalized supply chain with redundancy that doesn't make us dependent on any one geography or any one single point of failure. And so, that philosophy stays the same, and we are going to continue to invest to make that happen. Fortunately, we're starting from a phenomenal place, which is one of the strongest if not the strongest U.S. North American manufacturing base any of our competitors. And so, what we've seen is a lot of customers come to us and say, how can we leverage what you guys have in the U.S.? How can we leverage what you guys have inside a US MCA to really drive it further? And so, a lot of the work we're doing is about what product sets we bring inside of that regional fence if you will and how, over time, we can use that to drive the business further. And so, I think there's what we've done today, which I'd say is fairly tactical. We've done it very quickly. But the future -- we won't -- even if we cover off on all the tariffs, we want to stop here. The future is the strategic element, which is how we keep driving CI out of this supply chain and build the most resilient and lowest cost supply chain that we possibly can and then use those funds to reinvest, to make our products competitive, and to build our brands and drive our innovation. McClaran Hayes Awesome. Thanks. And just on China within water, I guess any update on what you guys are seeing on the ground there and kind of how the outlook is shaping up for the back half? Nick Fink Yeah. Looking at China, I mean, if we look at all of last year, it was interesting, right, because the comps were up and down '24 versus '23, but the net sales line was very, very steady. I mean, every quarter almost exactly the same, and we saw it [inaudible]. We definitely saw it take a step down in Q1 of this year, and I think directly attributable to a lot of the uncertainty driven by these tariff wars, and that is impacting the consumer over there who's been much more cautious. So, we're working that with the China team. And that really is around the developer business. If we look at things like our showroom channel and what we call a designer channel, those are showing growth. And so, what we're going to do is really work with the team over there to understand how much of that development business we expect -- where do we expect it to land? And how do we expect it to then grow from there? And what's the point at which this becomes a growth vehicle for our organization? I'll just add, at this point, the team there has done such a great job managing the cost basis as the top line has declined that we do not have much exposure from an EPS perspective. So, it's not like there's a lot of EPS risk for us in China. They've managed it really, really well. And it does give us exposure to a lot of interesting products and innovation, and we like that window that that business gives us. So, optionality for growth and access to innovation. And so, the objective there is really to keep building these other channels that are growing while we start to find the bottom of the developer channel and then grow from there and really turn what's been a headwind into a tailwind for the business. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Aatish Shah [sp] Hi. This is Aatish on for Steve. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to the topic of tariffs, and thanks for all the detail there. On the last call, it was mentioned that the incremental tariff impact would be offset by the mitigation actions including mid-single-digit pricing across the business on average. Is that pricing expectation changed given the updated tariff expectations? Nick Fink Well, the tariffs have shifted around a lot, but I would say the pricing across the portfolio on an average we've been able to maintain around that mid-single-digit mark. And then to the extent that we're able to further mitigate the tariff impact we'll certainly look to that and work hard to be as competitive as we can in the marketplace. Jon Baksht And the only thing I'd add is that is -- that's not a peanut butter spread across the portfolio. Across different channels, we're being very surgical around how we implement those tariffs -- price actions and how we can best realize some recovery there. Stephen Kim Hey, guys. It's Steve. Just to follow up on that. Why is the -- the pricing action is going to remain the same, but the tariff gross headwind is less. Why wouldn't you be able to -- why wouldn't you be effectively over mitigating under that circumstance? I'm just trying to make sure I'm understanding conceptually what the change is. Nick Fink Yeah. Well, again, we run this model on this daily, right? And so, I would say it's very early stages to say, hey, it's set, and we know that we don't have enough [inaudible] we could start to move things around, but that is certainly the objective. But I said all of our pricing is in at this point. By and large -- I'm sure there's probably a couple of accounts out there that are still being discussed. But I think, by and large, all the pricing is in, and as we work those mitigations, if there's opportunity, we'll leverage that opportunity. And I think that's the way to think about it. And then as Jon just said, it's not a peanut butter spread either. I mean, there are places where we had to take more, and we'll see where those mitigations come out. There are other places -- I mean, look at the outdoors business. U.S. manufacturing fully vertically integrated, and we had a lot of competition in the last couple of years, frankly, some of it dumping in the market. And now that business will be hugely advantaged by the geopolitical and tariff opportunity. And so, thinking through there, well, how do you manage that? And we have the largest facility. How we're going to handle the volume that might come our way, and how do we balance that with pricing. And so, there's a different way of thinking about a similar issue that's impacted by the tariff I think in a very different way. Jon Baksht Yeah. And, Steve, the only thing I'd add is when you're looking at the math just from last quarter to this quarter, the one thing to also keep in mind is, when the tariff rates come down -- and a lot of them have come down since the last quarterly call. Some have gone up, but several have come down and meaningfully down. The mitigation actions from the supply chain affects that we've put into place, that also comes down because we measure those last call off of the baseline higher tariff rates for certain countries than they are today. So, [inaudible] to Nick's point, we're running these models every day. So, it's -- they all -- there's a lot of factors that go into it. Stephen Kim Got you. Okay. Thanks so much. Nick Fink Sure. Operator Our next question is from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Mike Dahl Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow up with a couple more on tariffs. Sorry to beat the horse here. On the ex-China piece, can you give us an update on some of these tariff rates have been moving around kind of what your what your largest country exposures are? And then I didn't hear you mention copper as being contemplated. There's obviously some moving pieces and puts and takes with copper, but if you've done any quick work to give us a sense of how that would impact I know probably not this year, but as you think about kind of an annual impact maybe looking to next year. Nick Fink I'll just start with the copper, and then I'll hand it over to Jon. And I'd say at this point, what we understand to be contemplated by copper does not have a material impact. Now, we'll see the HTS codes when they come out, but that's not our understanding of where it's come out this far. And so, we don't see that as a huge impact. That's [inaudible] -- let's give it a few more days or week or whatever it is before we see that, but we didn't see anything particularly alarming in the copper piece. Jon Baksht Yeah. And as it relates to the rest of the world piece, just to give you some more color there. I mean, it's a longer tail. So, China is the most meaningful and at about half. And then beyond that, it's really a lot of different countries. But if you were to take number two, it's probably Mexico, non-U.S. MCA Mexico. But again, it's not nearly as material. It is a long tail. Mike Dahl Okay. And would the largest be on Mexico, the other Southeast Asia countries? I guess that's just clarifying. And the second question again, given some of these moving pieces, if there's any help you can provide in terms of you often give some quarterly directional cadence around how to be thinking about margins and sales by business. I think that would help just given such a dynamic environment. Nick Fink Well, I'll just say on other countries, and Jon can answer the other piece. But I just -- recall --and [inaudible] like a lot of people in our sector are importing finished goods from Southeast Asian countries, and we certainly have some Southeast Asian countries in the mix. But for the most part, we're a U.S. manufacturer and U.S. assembler. And so, most of our tariff exposure is coming from that sort of remaining piece of the supply chain that today we've only made in China. That's sort of like getting down to the 10% that we then bring over here and assemble in the U.S. And so, that is the vast majority of the exposure. And what we'll do is work over time to create other sources for that component and then continue to leverage what is ultimately U.S. manufacturing. That's our goal. Jon Baksht And if you're looking for some of the back half some guidance, so if you look at our earnings release, we did reintroduce the table there that does have segment breakdowns for the full year that can give you some information around what we're expecting for the back half of the year. So, if you look at water, for example, just starting there, for the full year, we're looking at negative 3% to negative 1% on net sales, and operating margins for the year at 23% to 24%. Outdoors where net sales basis flat to 2% with an operating margin of 14% to 15%. And security net sales negative 1% to 2% and margins at 16.5% to 17.5%. Mike Dahl Okay. Thank you, both. Jon Baksht Thank you. Operator This concludes our question-and-answer session. Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Conference Call Is Over 6:10 pm Apple&#8217;s conference call has ended and shares are up 3%. Overall, the company did a lot tonight to push the narrative they&#8217;ll be aggressive to catch up in AI and that device sales are rebounding. It&#8217;s a good quarter for Apple that might start turning around what&#8217;s been a disappointing 2025. Tim Cook on AI 5:58 pm TD Cowen Analst: Tim, I was curious about your thoughts on AI for edge devices. There&#8217;s like some people who think that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you think &#8212; do you see a scenario where the LLM become a third part of your iOS or is the SLM the way to go and how to think about evolution of edge devices in a futuristic AI world and is smartphone going to be the choice of device. Just curious your thoughts on it, broadly speaking. Timothy Cook Chief Executive Officer The way that we look at AI is that it&#8217;s 1 of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. And I think it will affect all devices in a significant way what pieces of the chain are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn&#8217;t want to to really talk about today. because that gives away some things on our strategy. But I think it&#8217;s a good question. . Tim Cook on Apple Momentum 5:48 pm Here&#8217;s what Tim Cook had to say about Apple&#8217;s surprising momentum in China last quarter: &#8220;Yes. We did grow in Greater China by 4% during the quarter versus the previous quarter, it was driven by an acceleration by iPhone, although we also had substantial growth on the MAC year-over-year. From a &#8212; as you know, the government has placed certain subsidies that affects some of our products, not all of them, but there are some of them. And I think that had some effect. It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out. that cut in during a portion of the previous quarter. The other things I would say are that the installed base hit a record high in Greater China &#8212; and we set an all-time record for the iPhone installed base. The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter. And according to Boral Panel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top 3 models in Urban China, which is extraordinary. Also, if you look at the other products, Mac, iPad and watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China Mainland were new to the product. So lots of good things there. And the other thing I would point out, which is an interesting point, The MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model in all of China, and the Mac Mini was the top-selling desktop model in all of China. So overall, a positive &#8212; very positive quarter.&#8221; Apple&#039;s CFO Says AI Investments Will Rise 5:47 pm &#8220;I would say, a pretty significant driver as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. So that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we&#8217;ve been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers. The other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where in cases we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. So you are going to see an increase in CapEx. We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities in tooling, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you&#8217;re seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments.&#8221; &#8211; Kevan Parekh, Apple CFO Tariff Implications 5:22 pm On Apple&#8217;s conference call they just said they incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs last quarter.
