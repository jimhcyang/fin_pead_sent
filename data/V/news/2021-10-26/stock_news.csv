A recent Visa study found that nearly half of all global consumers (42%) expressed interest in installment financing that is offered on their existing credit card or one they could apply for.1 To help partners meet this demand, Visa Installments Solution is being deployed globally to make issuer-offered BNPL options available in-store and across ecommerce channels. With the network-based solution, financial institutions can add BNPL as a customized feature for credit card holders, on their already approved credit lines. And likewise, acquirers on the network can activate the ability to enable installments for any of their retailers that accept Visa. First launched as a pilot in 2019, the solution has expanded to Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Russia and the U.S. In North America, Visa is collaborating with Canada’s Moneris, and working with CIBC, Commerce Bank, Desjardins Group (Desjardins), Equinox Payments, i2c, ScotiaBank and Versapay. In Asia Pacific, following the recent launch with HSBC, Visa is rolling out installment programs with ANZ, GHL Systems Malaysia and Quest Payment Systems. And in Russia, Visa has partnered with Home Credit Bank and Russian Standard Bank. Visa is also working with Cybersource, FIS, Global Payments and TSYS, a Global Payments company, in several markets across the globe to enable the Visa Installments Solution. The global rollout of Visa Installments Solution complements Visa’s existing support of today’s leading BNPL fintechs, including: Afterpay, ChargeAfter, Klarna, Paidy, Sezzle, SplitIt and Zip. Since 2017, Visa’s fintech solutions have helped fintechs grow by: issuing digital credentials or virtual cards, so consumers can seamlessly use installments at checkout; leveraging Visa’s acceptance and reach with sellers; and taking advantage of the security and risk offerings Visa provides. Additionally, this week Visa announced that Klarna has signed a global brand deal with Visa to accelerate its expansion and scale in several markets. “For years, Visa has been enthusiastically embracing BNPL for the same reason we pioneered revolving credit, debit and prepaid decades ago: because it expands choice and convenience for buyers and sellers alike,” said Mary Kay Bowman, SVP and global head of payment and platform products, Visa. “If shoppers prefer a BNPL fintech solution, we are here and enabling it; if they want an option from their banks, we’re helping offer those too.” Visa’s recent survey showed that future interest in installment plans is high and outpaces current adoption in all countries tested, underscoring the strong opportunity for BNPL usage looking ahead.2 Research shows that when BNPL options are available at checkout, retailers also benefit from an increase in spend and see more shoppers completing their purchases. “At HSBC we strive to bring new and innovative solutions to our customers. We are excited to partner with Visa and be the first bank outside North America to launch the Visa Installments Solution, starting in Malaysia; announcing our entrance in the digital Buy Now, Pay Later space,” said Madhu Kejriwal, Group Head, Unsecured Lending & Partnerships, HSBC Wealth & Personal Banking. “This feature facilitates point of sale purchases for HSBC Visa credit card customers when they shop with partner merchants, by allowing them to split payments into monthly instalments at no additional cost and no credit application. We look forward to continuing to innovate with Visa, including delivering on our global BNPL strategy.” “BNPL solutions have emerged as a must-have capability for both card issuers and merchants across the globe. We are thrilled to partner with Visa and to add Visa Installments to our existing BNPL product offering for our issuers and their cardholders,"" said Ava Kelly, Global Head of Products of Silicon Valley-based i2c, a global Visa Ready and Fast Track member. “We’re happy to be working with a trusted brand like Visa on providing a Buy Now, Pay Later option to Canadians,” said Patrick Diab, Chief Product and Partnership Officer, Moneris. “Bringing flexible payment methods like Buy Now, Pay Later to our merchants helps them offer their customers more options when it comes time to pay.” “We are very pleased to partner with Visa on BNPL,” said Craig O’Neill, CEO of Versapay. “As a payment facilitator, we were able to seamlessly onboard merchants into the Visa program, and as the BNPL market matures, we see this becoming an attractive offering for business to business commerce, an area Versapay intimately knows and serves well.” For more information on Visa Installments, visit: https://usa.visa.com/partner-with-us/payment-technology/installments.html About Visa Visa Inc.

Eine aktuelle Studie von Visa hat gezeigt, dass weltweit fast die Hälfte der Verbraucher (42 %) Interesse an einer Ratenfinanzierung bekundet, die für ihre bestehende Kreditkarte angeboten wird oder die sie beantragen könnten.1 Um den Partnern zu helfen, diese Nachfrage zu befriedigen, wird die Visa-Ratenzahlungslösung weltweit eingesetzt, um die von den Kartenausstellern angebotenen BNPL-Optionen in Geschäften und über E-Commerce-Kanäle verfügbar zu machen. Mit der netzwerkbasierten Lösung können Finanzinstitute BNPL als individuelle Zusatzoption für Kreditkarteninhaber zu deren bereits genehmigten Kreditlinien hinzufügen. Ebenso können Akzeptanzstellen im Netzwerk die Ratenzahlungsoption für alle ihre Einzelhändler, die Visa akzeptieren, aktivieren. Die Lösung wurde im Jahr 2019 zunächst als Pilotprojekt eingeführt und ist inzwischen in Australien, Kanada, Malaysia, Russland und den USA verfügbar. In Nordamerika stellt Visa die Lösung gemeinsam mit dem kanadischen Unternehmen Monerisden Unternehmen CIBC, Commerce Bank, Desjardins Group (Desjardins), Equinox Payments, i2c, ScotiaBank und Versapay zur Verfügung. Im asiatisch-pazifischen Raum bietet Visa nach der kürzlich gemeinsam mit HSBC erfolgten Einführung nun Ratenzahlungsprogramme bei ANZ, GHL Systems Malaysia und Quest Payment Systems an. Und in Russland hat sich Visa mit den Partnern Home Credit Bank und Russian Standard Bank zusammengeschlossen. Weltweit arbeitet Visa mit Cybersource, FIS, Global Payments und TSYS, einem Unternehmen von Global Payments, zusammen, um die Visa-Ratenzahlungslösung in weiteren Märkten zu ermöglichen. Die globale Einführung der Visa-Ratenzahlungslösung ergänzt das bereits bestehende Angebotsportfolio von Visa für die führenden BNPL-Fintechs, wie zum Beispiel: Afterpay, ChargeAfter, Klarna, Paidy, Sezzle, SplitIt und Zip. Bereits seit dem Jahr 2017 unterstützen Fintech-Lösungen von Visa das Wachstum der Branche, indem sie digitale Legitimationen oder virtuelle Einwegkarten bereitstellen, mit denen Verbraucher nahtlos Ratenzahlungen an der Kasse tätigen können, während die Verkäufer gleichzeitig die Akzeptanz und Reichweite sowie die Sicherheits- und Risikofunktionen von Visa nutzen können. Darüber hinaus gab Visa diese Woche den Abschluss eines globalen Markenvertrags mit Klarna bekannt, um die Expansion und Skalierung in einer Reihe von Märkten zu beschleunigen. „Visa sieht bereits seit Jahren großartige Potenziale bei BNPL, und zwar aus demselben Grund, aus dem wir vor Jahrzehnten Pionierarbeit für revolvierende Kreditlinien, Debit- und Prepaid-Karten geleistet haben: Weil sich dadurch die Auswahlmöglichkeiten und der Komfort für Käufer und Verkäufer gleichermaßen erhöhen“, erklärte Mary Kay Bowman, SVP und Global Head of Payment and Platform Products bei Visa. „Wenn Kunden eine BNPL-Fintech-Lösung möchten, sind wir zur Stelle und ermöglichen sie. Wenn sie eine Option über ihre Bank bevorzugen, helfen wir auch hier, diese bereitzustellen.“ Die jüngste Studie von Visa hat gezeigt, dass sich das Interesse an Ratenzahlungsoptionen in Zukunft vergrößern und in allen untersuchten Ländern die derzeitige Akzeptanz bei weitem übersteigen wird, sodass die großen Chancen von BNPL für die Zukunft deutlich zutage treten.2 Untersuchungen zeigen, dass Einzelhändler, die an der Kasse BNPL-Optionen anbieten, von der höheren Kaufkraft ihrer Kunden profitieren können, da mehr Kunden größere Einkäufe tätigen. „Wir bei HSBC sehen es als unsere Aufgabe an, unseren Kunden neue und innovative Lösungen zu bieten. Wir freuen uns, mit Visa zusammenzuarbeiten und die erste Bank außerhalb Nordamerikas zu sein, die die Visa-Ratenzahlungslösung auf den Markt bringt – beginnend in Malaysia. Dies bedeutet den ersten Schritt unseres Einstiegs in den Buy Now, Pay Later-Sektor“, erklärte Madhu Kejriwal, Group Head, Unsecured Lending & Partnerships, HSBC Wealth & Personal Banking. „Die Funktion erleichtert Besitzern der HSBC-Visa-Kreditkarte den Einkauf am Point of Sale, wenn sie bei Partnerhändlern einkaufen, da sie die Bezahlung in mehrere monatliche Raten aufteilen können – ohne zusätzliche Kosten und ohne Kreditantrag. Wir freuen uns darauf, gemeinsam mit Visa in Zukunft weitere Innovationen zu schaffen und unsere globale BNPL-Strategie erfolgreich umzusetzen.“ „BNPL-Lösungen sind inzwischen für die Kartenaussteller als auch für Händler auf der ganzen Welt zu einem Muss geworden. Wir sind davon begeistert, mit Visa zusammenzuarbeiten, um unser bestehendes BNPL-Produktangebot für unsere Kartenaussteller und deren Karteninhaber um Visa-Ratenzahlungen zu erweitern“, erklärte Ava Kelly, Global Head of Products von i2c, einem weltweiten Visa Ready- und Fast Track-Mitglied mit Sitz im Silicon Valley. „Sehr gerne arbeiten wir mit einer so vertrauenswürdigen Marke wie Visa zusammen, um den Kanadiern die Option Buy Now, Pay Later anzubieten“, betonte Patrick Diab, Chief Product and Partnership Officer, Moneris. „Mit flexiblen Zahlungsmethoden wie Buy Now, Pay Later können unsere Händler ihren Kunden nun mehr Optionen für das Bezahlen anbieten.“ „Wir arbeiten sehr gerne mit Visa bei BNPL zusammen“, erklärte Craig O'Neill, CEO von Versapay. „Für uns als Zahlungsvermittler war es kein Problem, Händler nahtlos in das Visa-Programm einzubinden, und da der BNPL-Markt zu florieren beginnt, sind wir sicher, dass sich diese neue Option auch für den Business-to-Business-Bereich zu einem attraktiven Angebot entwickeln wird – ein Bereich, den Versapay sehr gut kennt und bedient.“ Weitere Informationen über Visa-Ratenzahlungslösungen finden Sie unter: https://usa.visa.com/partner-with-us/payment-technology/installments.html Über Visa Visa Inc.

Une récente étude de Visa a découvert que près de la moitié (42 %) de tous les consommateurs mondiaux avaient exprimé un intérêt dans la solution de financement échelonné qui est proposée sur leur carte de crédit existante ou une carte qu’ils pourraient demander.1 Pour aider ses partenaires à répondre à cette demande, Visa Installments Solution est déployée dans le monde entier afin de rendre disponible les options de BNPL proposées par l’émetteur en magasin et sur l’ensemble des canaux de commerce électronique. Avec la solution basée sur le réseau, les institutions financières peuvent ainsi ajouter l’option BNPL comme une fonctionnalité personnalisée pour les titulaires d’une carte de crédit, sur leur ligne de crédit déjà approuvée. De même, les acquéreurs sur le réseau peuvent activer la possibilité de permettre les paiements échelonnés, pour n’importe lesquels de leurs détaillants qui acceptent Visa. Lancée pour la première fois en 2019 en tant que projet pilote, la solution s’est étendue à l’Australie, au Canada, à la Malaisie, à la Russie et aux États-Unis. En Amérique du Nord, Visa collabore avec le Canadien Moneris, et travaille avec CIBC, Commerce Bank, Desjardins Group (Desjardins), Equinox Payments, i2c, ScotiaBank et Versapay. En Asie-Pacifique, suite au lancement récent avec HSBC, Visa déploie des programmes de paiement échelonné avec ANZ, GHL Systems Malaysia et Quest Payment Systems. Et en Russie, Visa s’est associée avec Home Credit Bank et Russian Standard Bank. Visa travaille également avec Cybersource, FIS, Global Payments et TSYS, une société de paiements mondiaux, sur plusieurs marchés dans le monde entier pour permettre le déploiement de Visa Installments Solution. Le déploiement mondial de Visa Installments Solution complète l’assistance existante que fournit Visa aux sociétés financières BNPL de premier plan, parmi lesquelles : Afterpay, ChargeAfter, Klarna, Paidy, Sezzle, SplitIt et Zip. Depuis 2017, les solutions fintech de Visa ont permis aux entreprises du secteur de se développer : en émettant des identifiants numériques ou des cartes virtuelles, afin que les consommateurs puissent utiliser de façon transparente les solutions de paiements échelonnés à la caisse ; en exploitant l’acceptation et la portée de Visa auprès des vendeurs ; et en profitant de la sécurité et des offres contre les risques offerts par Visa. Par ailleurs, Visa a annoncé cette semaine que Klarna avait signé un contrat de marque mondial avec Visa afin d’accélérer son expansion et sa mise à échelle sur plusieurs marchés. « Depuis des années, Visa a adopté l'option BNPL avec enthousiasme pour la même raison que nous avons été pionniers dans le crédit renouvelable, la carte de débit et les cartes prépayées il y a des décennies de cela : parce que cela étend le choix et la commodité pour les acheteurs comme pour les vendeurs, » a déclaré Mary Kay Bowman, VPS et directrice mondiale des produits de paiement et de plateforme, chez Visa. « Si les acheteurs préfèrent la solution fintech BNPL, nous sommes là pour le permettre ; s’ils préfèrent une option provenant de leurs banques, nous aidons ces dernières à la proposer également. » L’enquête récente de Visa a révélé que l’intérêt futur pour les plans de paiement échelonné va grandissant et dépasse son adoption actuelle dans tous les pays testés, soulignant ainsi la forte opportunité pour l’utilisation de BNPL à l’avenir.2 L’étude montre que lorsque les options BNPL sont disponibles à la caisse, les détaillants bénéficient également d’un augmentation des dépenses et voient plus d’acheteurs réaliser leurs achats. « Chez HSBC, nous nous efforçons d’introduire de nouvelles solutions innovantes auprès de nos clients. Nous avons hâte de nous associer avec Visa pour être la première banque hors de l’Amérique du Nord à lancer Visa Installments Solution, en commençant par la Malaisie ; annonçant ainsi notre entrée dans l’espace du Achetez maintenant, Payez plus tard numérique, » a déclaré Madhu Kejriwal, directeur du groupe, prêts en blanc et partenariats, chez HSBC Wealth & Personal Banking. « Cette fonctionnalité simplifie les achats sur le point de vente pour les clients de carte de crédit HSBC Visa lorsqu’ils achètent chez des commerçants partenaires, en leur permettant de diviser les paiements en versements mensuels sans frais supplémentaires ni demande de crédit. Nous avons hâte de continuer d’innover avec Visa, y compris en réalisant notre stratégie BNPL mondiale. » « Les solutions BNPL ont émergé comme une capacité incontournable pour les émetteurs de carte et les commerçants dans le monde entier. Nous sommes ravis de nous associer à Visa et d’ajouter Visa Installments Solution à notre offre de produits BNPL existante pour nos émetteurs et leurs titulaires de cartes, » a déclaré Ava Kelly, directrice mondiale des produits de la société i2c basée dans la Silicon Valley, un membre mondial Visa Ready et Fast Track. « Nous sommes heureux de travailler avec une marque de confiance comme Visa pour proposer une option Achetez maintenant, Payez plus tard aux Canadiens, » a déclaré Patrick Diab, directeur des produits et des partenariats chez Moneris. « Proposer à nos commerçants des méthodes de paiement flexibles comme Achetez maintenant, Payez plus tard, leur permet d'offrir à leurs clients davantage d’options de payements. » « Nous sommes très heureux de nous associer avec Visa sur la solution BNPL, » a déclaré Craig O’Neill, PDG de Versapay. « En tant que facilitateur de paiement, nous avons pu, en toute transparence, inscrire les commerçants dans le programme Visa, et tandis que le marché BNPL atteint sa maturité, nous le voyons devenir une offre attractive pour le commerce interentreprises (B2B), un secteur que Versapay connaît étroitement et dessert très bien. » Pour plus de renseignements sur la solution Visa Installments, consultez la page : https://usa.visa.com/partner-with-us/payment-technology/installments.html À propos de Visa Visa Inc.

Available features at launch or over time are expected to include: Carbon footprint calculator: insights offered by ecolytiq for cardholders into the estimated carbon footprint of their spend, including a new temperature score, which helps cardholders understand the climate impact of their personal spending behavior and how their consumption choices contribute to the 1.5°C Paris Climate Change Agreement goal Carbon offsets: ability for cardholders to offset their greenhouse gas emissions impacts Personalized education for customers on how to encourage more sustainable consumption Sustainable card materials, including a collaboration with CPI Card Group and digital receipts Donations to environmental organizations when Visa cards are used, including One Tree Planted, a global reforestation non-profit organization Expanded rewards for cardholders for sustainable behaviors “At Visa, we recognize the urgency of climate change and are committed to a new era of sustainable and inclusive economic growth,” said Charlotte Hogg, executive vice president and chief executive officer, Europe, Visa. “As an engine of global commerce, we have the opportunity to work with clients and partners around the world to help embed sustainability into the payments ecosystem and support cardholder and business choices through the transition.” According to a recent GlobeScan study of 31,000 people across 31 markets, consumers continue to have high ambitions for sustainable living. According to Visa cardholder research, these high aspirations for sustainable living carry through to banking and payments. For example, a majority of U.S. cardholders surveyed agreed that sustainability is important to them, with 62% very likely or somewhat likely to apply for a sustainability-focused payment card and trends skewing higher in the millennial generation. In Europe, cardholders ranked sustainability-focused features most important after traditional card benefits like fraud protection and acceptance in choosing their next payment card. The Visa Eco Benefits bundle is a continuation of Visa’s global aspiration to be a climate positive company, using its products, services, data, network and brand to drive sustainable commerce and support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Earlier this year, Visa announced a pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2040, ten years ahead of the Paris Climate Agreement goal. “Sustainability is the challenge of our time, but also one of the greatest opportunities for the finance industry,” said Ulrich Pietsch, co-founder and chief executive officer, ecolytiq. “Equipped with the right tools like the Visa Eco Benefits bundle, the finance industry becomes the driving force for change by educating millions of consumers about their impact and by empowering them to take effective climate action to build the sustainable future we all deserve.” Visa’s Eco Benefits bundle is the latest milestone in Visa’s sustainability leadership. The company’s recognition includes inclusion on the following: Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index, America’s Most Responsible Companies, and 100 Most Just Companies.

L’offre Visa Eco Benefits sera dans un premier temps disponible en Europe, puis déployée à travers le monde pour les clients de Visa au cours de l’année prochaine. À travers cette nouvelle offre, Visa continue de jouer un rôle de premier plan dans la promotion du commerce durable et de l’action climatique au sein du secteur des paiements, en soutenant les objectifs de ses clients consistant à répondre à une demande croissante de la part des titulaires de cartes autour d’une consommation et d’un mode de vie durables. L’offre Visa Eco Benefits permettra aux émetteurs Visa d’ajouter à leurs produits de crédit/débit existants pour titulaires de cartes Visa plusieurs avantages axés sur la durabilité, aux titulaires de cartes de mieux comprendre l’impact de leurs dépenses sur l’environnement, et encouragera une consommation et des comportements durables. Les fonctionnalités disponibles lors du lancement ou par la suite devraient inclure : Calculateur d’empreinte carbone : informations fournies par ecolytiq aux titulaires de cartes concernant leur empreinte carbone estimée en fonction de leurs dépenses, notamment un nouveau score de température, qui permet aux titulaires de cartes de comprendre l’impact climatique de leur comportement personnel de dépenses, ainsi que la manière dont leurs choix de consommation contribuent à l’accomplissement de l’objectif de 1,5°C fixé par l’Accord de Paris sur le changement climatique Compensations carbone : possibilité pour les titulaires de cartes de compenser leur impact en termes d’émissions de gaz à effet de serre Formation sur mesure pour les clients concernant la manière d’encourager une consommation plus durable Matériaux de cartes durables, notamment grâce à une collaboration avec CPI Card Group ainsi qu’à des reçus numériques Dons à des organisations environnementales lorsque des cartes Visa sont utilisées, notamment en faveur de One Tree Planted, une organisation mondiale à but non lucratif axée sur la reforestation Avantages plus nombreux en faveur des titulaires de cartes, pour des comportements durables « Chez Visa, nous sommes conscients de l’urgence du changement climatique, et déterminés à promouvoir une nouvelle ère de croissance économique durable et inclusive », a déclaré Charlotte Hogg, vice-présidente exécutive et présidente-directrice générale pour la région Europe, Visa. « En tant que moteur du commerce mondial, nous avons l’opportunité de travailler avec les clients et partenaires du monde entier pour contribuer à intégrer la durabilité dans l’écosystème des paiements, ainsi que pour soutenir les choix des titulaires de cartes et des entreprises dans le cadre de la transition. » Selon une récente étude GlobeScan visant 31 000 personnes sur 31 marchés, les aspirations de mode de vie durable des consommateurs demeurent élevées.

Une majorité de titulaires de cartes interrogés aux États-Unis, par exemple, considère la durabilité comme un aspect important, 62 % des répondants s’orientant très probablement ou assez probablement vers une demande de carte de paiement axée sur la durabilité, sachant par ailleurs que cette tendance est plus élevée pour la génération du millénaire. En Europe, les titulaires de cartes considèrent les fonctionnalités axées sur la durabilité comme les plus importantes après les avantages traditionnels de cartes tels que la protection contre la fraude et l’acceptation lorsqu’il s’agit de choisir leur prochaine carte de paiement.

Le présent communiqué de presse contient des déclarations prévisionnelles au sens de la loi américaine « Private Securities Litigation Reform Act » de 1995. Ces déclarations prévisionnelles sont généralement identifiées par l’usage du futur ou du conditionnel, ainsi que par des expressions telles que « prévoit de », « s’attendre à », et autres expressions similaires. Parmi les exemples de déclarations prévisionnelles figurent, sans toutefois s’y limiter, les déclarations que nous formulons concernant le calendrier et la probabilité de prendre des mesures liées à notre stratégie, nos projets et nos initiatives et objectifs climatiques futurs, ainsi que l’impact potentiel de nos actions. Par nature, les déclarations prévisionnelles : (i) n’ont de valeur qu’à la date où elles sont formulées, (ii) ne sont ni des énoncés de faits historiques, ni des garanties de performance future et (iii) sont assujetties à des risques, incertitudes, hypothèses et changements de circonstances qui sont difficiles à prévoir ou à quantifier. C'est pourquoi, les résultats réels pourraient différer sensiblement et défavorablement des déclarations prévisionnelles de Visa en raison d'une variété de facteurs, notamment ceux qui figurent dans notre Rapport annuel sur formulaire 10-K pour l'exercice financier clos le 30 septembre 2020 et nos autres rapports déposés auprès de la Securities and Exchange Commission des États-Unis. Le lecteur est donc prié de ne pas se fier outre mesure aux dites déclarations prévisionnelles.
