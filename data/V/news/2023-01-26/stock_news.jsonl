Visa Black Scholars also will participate in a Black Scholars Summit and be offered opportunities for paid internships, and those who meet program requirements will be invited to join Visa full-time after graduation. Since its August 2021 launch, the Visa Black Scholars and Jobs Program has supported 126 students as part of the company’s five-year $10 million investment in line with Visa’s inclusion and diversity efforts to drive lasting positive change. “It has been inspiring to see the positive effects that the Visa Black Scholars and Jobs Program has had on our scholars and company,” said Michelle Gethers, Visa’s Chief Diversity Officer and Head of Corporate Responsibility. “In addition to scholarship assistance, scholars are offered opportunities to strengthen their educational and professional development. The Visa Black Scholars and Jobs Program is one of Visa’s many commitments to build our inclusive culture and purpose-driven change for generations to come.” Through the program, Visa Black Scholars are given access to C-suite executives, industry leaders and the greater Visa community to expand their networks and professional growth. In June 2022, Visa welcomed the inaugural class to the first-ever Black Scholars Summit for a week of inspiring sessions, workshops and collaboration. Jonathan Whyte, scholar recipient from Winter Springs, FL, said that the opportunity “to hear the speaker’s insights into what they believe are the keys to their own success was really useful and will help me a lot in the future.” “At Visa, we foster a people-centric culture of continuous growth, learning and development,” said Kelly Mahon Tullier, Vice Chair, Chief People and Corporate Affairs Officer. “As someone who is passionate about mentoring, enabling and inspiring others in their careers, it has been rewarding to see our scholars grow through the opportunities provided by this important program. Equally important are the lessons they have taught us along the way. The Visa Black Scholars and Jobs Program is a perfect example of how Visa is actively living our purpose to uplift everyone, everywhere.” This summer, 32 scholars from the inaugural class will intern in Visa offices across the U.S., supporting all areas of the business, from software engineering and product development, to marketing, finance, and people teams. Due to the U.S. program’s success, Visa has expanded to develop similar programs for diverse students in the United Kingdom, Spain, Brazil and South Africa. The Visa Scholarship Programme UK, Visa Scholarship Programme Spain, Visa Brazil Black Scholarship program and the Learnership Program in South Africa increase access to the necessary tools, knowledge, training and network opportunities for the next generation of diverse leaders.
