Aligned closely with the company’s business strategy, this phase includes the debut of a dynamic global marketing campaign and a preview of a modernized look for Visa’s iconic brand. More than 60 years ago, when Visa was founded, few could imagine a world beyond cash and checks. Visa’s founding vision to introduce a more secure, reliable and convenient currency in digital form began with a simple question: what if money became fully electronic? Today, Visa continues to anticipate the future of digital commerce, providing access through its secure global network working for everyone, everywhere. “People think they ‘know’ Visa. Consumers and businesses trust the power of those four letters and see it when they open their wallet, pay a vendor, walk into a store or check out online. What they don’t see is how those four letters operate the most dynamic network of people, partnerships and products,” said Lynne Biggar, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Marketing Officer, Visa. “We are on a mission to ensure that Visa is seen as more than a credit card company and understood as a trusted network that drives commerce forward.” While Visa continues to shape the physical and digital credit or debit card transaction, it also increasingly sits at the center of enabling money movement. A company built on access to economic inclusion, the Visa network connects 3.6 billion credentials, over 70 million merchant locations, tens of thousands of partners and powers more than $11 trillion in total volume annually. Over the last five years alone, Visa has invested $9 billion in technology to shape the future of commerce, delivering a differentiated set of products, services and benefits.1 Visa’s network helps enable a gig-worker with the flexibility to get paid in real time, facilitates person to person payments that can send and receive money between billions of cards and accounts worldwide, and large corporate payments to be made more effortlessly across borders, as just a few examples. Illustrating the scope of Visa’s capabilities, initial elements of Visa’s brand evolution include: ‘Meet Visa’ films spotlight the power of the network. Developed by Visa’s global creative agency of record, award-winning Wieden+Kennedy, Visa is unveiling a short film directed by Malik Hassan Sayeed that invites the world to ‘Meet Visa,’ a network working for everyone. Complementing this introductory film is a series of shorter digital films and photography that showcase the breadth of the Visa network working to provide access and advancing commerce for real people in real places around the world. Brought to life by some of the best and most diverse creative talent including Sayeed, Visa also worked with photographer Camilla Falquez and Argentinian directing team Pantera & Co. – Brian Kazez, Pato Martinez and Francisco Canton – to vividly capture moments such as: Finding flexibility in how to get paid Connecting local merchants to global sellers Working on a future where crypto can buy cool things Helping turn side jobs into global sensations New Visa brand identity symbolizes change. Visa has long stood for trust, security, acceptance and inclusion. These core values, in addition to the goal of enabling access for everyone to participate in the global economy, will be expressed through a modernized, dynamic visual brand identity, built in partnership with leading global brand design firm Mucho. The ‘Meet Visa’ campaign shares an initial glimpse into the evolved visual brand identity launching later this year, featuring refreshed colors for digital impact, a custom font created for optimal digital experiences and an updated brand symbol designed to express the purpose behind the organization. Over the course of 2021, Visa’s new brand identity will become visible in all 200+ countries and territories Visa operates in, cutting across the company’s primary business strategy encompassing: Consumer payments, focusing on expanding access and moving the $17 trillion spent in cash and checks globally to digital payments. New payment flows including cross-border person-to-person payments and a range of value-added services that help businesses of all sizes navigate today’s landscape; identify new growth opportunities; and maintain our mission of making Visa the most secure, resilient and reliable network. A diversity of offerings and solutions through burgeoning partnerships with fintechs and established brands, relationships with governments around the world and innovative technology built for the future. “We are capturing the bold ambition of Visa with this brand evolution as a way to express what we stand for and what we strive for,” continued Biggar. “With the world reopening and with money increasingly moving in new ways, there’s no better time to showcase the work we do and the impact a purpose-driven brand with Visa’s scale can have to enable individuals, businesses and economies to thrive.” For more information on “Meet Visa,” visit https://usa.visa.com/our-purpose/leading-by-example.html.

The acquisition builds on an existing strategic partnership between the two companies and values Currencycloud at £700 million, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. The financial consideration will be reduced by the outstanding equity of Currencycloud that Visa already owns. Currencycloud’s cloud-based platform offers a broad set of APIs enabling banks and financial services providers to offer currency exchange services, including real-time notifications on foreign exchange transactions, multi-currency wallets, and virtual account management. The Currencycloud platform supports nearly 500 banking and technology clients with reach in over 180 countries. Currencycloud will strengthen Visa’s existing foreign exchange capabilities by extending them to better serve financial institutions, fintechs and partners while enabling new use cases and payment flows. Currencycloud will accelerate the time-to-market and improve payment transparency for clients looking to offer flexible, digital-first, international payment services that provide better visibility and control to consumers and businesses around the world. Cross-border payments have seen significant growth due to rising demand from businesses of all sizes to engage in international trade. A recent study revealed that 43% of all small businesses conducted international trade in 2020.1 The addition of Currencycloud’s capabilities to Visa’s network will widen access to innovative international payment products that help businesses meet their cross-border needs. “The acquisition of Currencycloud is another example of Visa executing on our network of networks strategy to facilitate global money movement,” said Colleen Ostrowski, Visa’s Global Treasurer. “Consumers and businesses increasingly expect transparency, speed and simplicity when making or receiving international payments. With our acquisition of Currencycloud, we can support our clients and partners to further reduce the pain points of cross-border payments and develop great user experiences for their customers.” “At Currencycloud, we’ve always strived to deliver a better tomorrow for all, from the smallest start-up to the global multi-nationals. Re-imagining how money flows around the global economy just got more exciting as we join Visa,” said Mike Laven, Chief Executive Officer, Currencycloud. “The combination of Currencycloud’s fintech expertise and Visa’s network will enable us to deliver greater customer value to the businesses moving money across borders.” Currencycloud will continue their operations from their headquarters in London and will retain their current management team.

Die Übernahme baut auf einer bestehenden strategischen Partnerschaft zwischen den beiden Unternehmen auf und bewertet Currencycloud mit 700 Millionen GBP, einschließlich Bar- und Retentionsanreizen. Die finanzielle Gegenleistung wird um das ausstehende Eigenkapital von Currencycloud reduziert, das Visa bereits besitzt. Die cloudbasierte Plattform von Currencycloud bietet eine breite Palette von APIs, die es Banken und Finanzdienstleistern ermöglichen, Währungsumtauschdienste anzubieten, einschließlich Echtzeitbenachrichtigungen zu Devisentransaktionen, Geldbörsen mit mehreren Währungen und virtuelle Kontoverwaltung. Die Currencycloud-Plattform unterstützt fast 500 Bank- und Technologiekunden mit Reichweite in über 180 Ländern.

Déclarations prévisionnelles Le présent communiqué de presse contient des déclarations prévisionnelles au sens de la loi américaine « Private Securities Litigation Reform Act » de 1995. Ces déclarations prévisionnelles sont généralement identifiées par l’usage du futur, ainsi que par des expressions, telles que « s’attendre à » et autres expressions similaires. Parmi les exemples de déclarations prévisionnelles, il convient de citer, sans que cette liste soit limitative, les déclarations que nous faisons concernant le calendrier et la probabilité de la clôture, le succès futur de Currencycloud, l’impact de l’acquisition sur la croissance de Visa, ainsi que les autres avantages attendus pour Visa, les institutions financières et les consommateurs. Par nature, les déclarations prévisionnelles : (i) n’ont de valeur qu’à la date où elles sont formulées, (ii) ne sont ni des énoncés de faits historiques, ni des garanties de performance future et (iii) sont assujetties à des risques, incertitudes, hypothèses et changements de circonstances qui sont difficiles à prévoir ou à quantifier. Par conséquent, les résultats réels pourraient différer de façon significative et défavorable par rapport aux déclarations prévisionnelles de Visa, et ce en raison de divers facteurs, notamment : le calendrier et le résultat du processus d’approbation réglementaire, les changements au sein du paysage réglementaire et concurrentiel, les incidents de cybersécurité, la vitesse et le succès de l’intégration, ainsi que divers autres facteurs, y compris ceux mentionnés dans notre rapport annuel sur formulaire 10-K pour l’exercice clos le 30 septembre 2020 et dans nos autres dépôts auprès de la Securities and Exchange Commission des États-Unis. Le lecteur est donc prié de ne pas se fier outre mesure aux dites déclarations prévisionnelles. Sauf dans les cas où la loi l’exigerait, Visa Inc. ne prévoit nullement de mettre à jour ou de réviser ses déclarations prévisionnelles quelles qu’elles soient, en réponse à de nouvelles informations, à des événements futurs ou pour d’autres raisons.

There are also five countries above the 50% adoption threshold: Chile, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, and Bermuda – and markets like Peru and Colombia follow suit with more than 40% contactless penetration. Consumer preference is clearly a result of contactless payments enabling a fast, convenient, safe and secure experience without the need for consumers to touch the checkout terminal. “We embarked on this contactless transformation journey back in 2018, because we truly believed migrating to contactless and its underlying technology had the power to be a catalyst for the next generation of payments in our region,” said Ricardo Tafur, Vice President of Consumer Products for Visa Latin America and the Caribbean. “The pandemic certainly resulted in an acceleration of our efforts that were already underway, and from June 2019 to June 2021, we moved from 4% to 25% face-to-face contactless penetration in our region – all of us at Visa feel great about this accomplishment.” Across the Latin America and Caribbean region, consumers and businesses alike have embraced contactless payments because of their speed and convenience. But convenience is not the only factor for the popularity; contactless cards are also secure and provide strong protection against fraud. Using the same secure technology as EMV® Chip, contactless cards are extremely effective in preventing counterfeit fraud by using a one-time use code that prevents compromised data from being re-used for fraud. In fact, contactless cards experience among the lowest fraud rates of any type of payment—significantly lower than magnetic stripe cards and comparable to conventional chip cards. As the world experienced an unprecedented shift toward digital commerce over the last year, tokenization is becoming one of the most effective ways to avoid fraud and allow for more secure and easy digital payment experiences. This invisible technology replaces sensitive card account details with a digital identifier, or \"tokens” that are more protected against fraudsters. So, whether a consumer is paying with a contactless card, digital wallet or wearable, Visa’s security layers are protecting the underlying transaction every step of the way. Visa will continue to work closely with bank, merchant, government and fintech partners in the region to build on this momentum and continue to drive adoption of contactless payments in the region, especially in new and niche sectors like urban mobility for instance. As a company Visa remains committed to its core mission to connect the world to enable individuals, businesses, and economies to thrive. About Visa Inc. Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) is the world’s leader in digital payments. Our mission is to connect the world through the most innovative, reliable and secure payment network - enabling individuals, businesses and economies to thrive.

También hay cinco países que superan el umbral de adopción del 50%: Chile, Costa Rica, Panamá, Guatemala y Bermudas. Mercados como Perú y Colombia les siguen con más del 40% de penetración de la tecnología sin contacto. La preferencia de los consumidores se debe claramente al hecho de que los pagos sin contacto facilitan una experiencia rápida, conveniente y segura, sin necesidad de que los consumidores toquen la terminal de pago. “Nos embarcamos en este proceso de transformación hacia los pagos sin contacto hace unos años en el 2018, porque realmente creíamos que la migración a los pagos sin contacto y su tecnología subyacente tenía el poder de ser un catalizador para la próxima generación de pagos en nuestra región”, dijo Ricardo Tafur, vicepresidente de Productos de Consumo de Visa América Latina y el Caribe. “La pandemia ciertamente provocó una aceleración de nuestros esfuerzos, que ya estaban en marcha, y de junio del 2019 a junio del 2021 pasamos del 4% al 25% de penetración de pagos sin contacto en el total de pagos realizados en persona en nuestra región; todos en Visa nos sentimos orgullosos de este logro”. En toda la región de América Latina y el Caribe tanto los consumidores como los comercios han adoptado los pagos sin contacto por su rapidez y conveniencia. Pero la conveniencia no es el único factor que lleva a su adopción: las tarjetas sin contacto también son seguras y proporcionan una fuerte protección contra el fraude. Usando la misma tecnología segura que el Chip EMV®, las tarjetas sin contacto son sumamente eficaces en prevenir el fraude por falsificación al utilizar un código de un solo uso que evita que si hubiera datos comprometidos puedan ser usados de nuevo para cometer fraude. De hecho, entre los diversos tipos de pago, las tarjetas sin contacto tienen algunos de los índices de fraude más bajos, significativamente más bajos que el índice de las tarjetas de banda magnética y comparables al índice de las tarjetas convencionales con chip. A medida que el mundo experimentó un cambio sin precedentes hacia el comercio digital en el último año, la tokenización se está convirtiendo en una de las formas más eficaces de evitar el fraude y permitir experiencias de pago digital más seguras y fáciles. Esta tecnología invisible sustituye los datos sensibles de la cuenta de una tarjeta por un identificador digital, o “token”, ya que los tokens ofrecen más protección contra los estafadores. Así pues, tanto si un consumidor paga con una tarjeta sin contacto, una billetera digital o un wearable, las capas de seguridad de Visa protegen la transacción subyacente en todo momento. Visa continuará trabajando con sus socios en América Latina y el Caribe –bancos, comercios, gobiernos y empresas Fintech– para aprovechar este impulso y seguir promoviendo la adopción de los pagos sin contacto en la región, especialmente en sectores nuevos y de nicho como la movilidad urbana, por ejemplo. Como compañía, mantenemos el compromiso con la misión central de conectar al mundo para ayudar a que personas, comercios y economías puedan prosperar. Acerca de Visa Inc. Visa Inc.
