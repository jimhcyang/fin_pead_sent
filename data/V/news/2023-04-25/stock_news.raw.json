    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V), a world leader in digital payments, was one of nine finalists tasked with exploring innovative blockchain-based use cases for the Real Digital (Brazil’s central bank-issued digital currency, or CBDC) as part of the most recent LIFT Challenge. The company partnered with Agrotoken, Microsoft, and Sinqia to develop its submission. After months of collaborative work between each company’s world-class researchers and engineers, Visa and its team are excited to share the results of their LIFT Challenge participation — a programmable finance platform for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), particularly farmers, that is designed to enable greater access to global capital markets, facilitate interoperability between currencies, improve operational processes, and uncover new growth opportunities. Small Businesses Drive Global Economies SMEs are often beholden to localized market structure in negotiating favorable contracts. For example, factoring is a well-known financing method today where a farmer can sell their future receivable at a discount to receive money today to purchase supplies and pay wages. This process routinely leads to a sizable percentage loss of the farmer’s receivable to the entity providing financing. Visa’s prototype is designed to provide local farmers with more timely and greater access to a global pool of investors for financing, allowing the SMEs to get the best price discovery for their goods. By empowering SMEs with additional options to finance their businesses in a secure and frictionless way, Visa’s prototype platform aims to improve existing money movement operations and alleviate pain points caused by inaccessibility to traditional services. “Small businesses are essential contributors to our local economies, such as in Brazil where they employ over half the population and contribute to nearly a third of the country’s GDP. At Visa, we are committed to help them grow, exploring new technologies that will empower them to more easily maintain and expand their business operations,” said Catherine Gu, Global Head of CBDC for Visa. “Brazil is one of the world’s leading markets for innovation,” she continues. “By contributing our expertise, scale, network, and cutting-edge technologies in this market, we are able to help advance real-world applications of digital currencies — in this case making it possible for a soybean farmer to create and globally auction a tokenized contract on a permissioned version of the Ethereum blockchain, while utilizing different forms of money and interoperating between them.” How Visa can Enable Programmable Finance in CBDCs With many of the world’s central banks exploring the value of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), Visa and its partners have demonstrated how CBDCs can enable new cross-border payments programmatically, as well as provide international investment resources to SMEs. The programmable aspects of digital currencies, which allow delivery and payment of assets and currencies to be automatically settled only when certain conditions are met, open the door for more efficient capital usage and reduced counterparty risks, while leveraging the security, stability, and safety of a central bank liability via CBDC as a reliable settlement currency. The prototype platform brings existing financial processes and assets on-chain, allowing farmers to tokenize traditional financing contracts. To achieve this, Agrotoken brought its agriculture-based tokenization expertise from their existing solutions in Brazil and Latin America and Visa delivered a tokenization process for turning existing Brazilian legal documents into an on-chain tradeable NFT. “Agrotoken has a mission to democratize agribusiness by making transactions with soy and corn more accessible. To achieve this, we have chosen solid partners, such as Visa, to join us in our journey towards this goal,\" said Anderson Nacaxe, Director of Agrotoken in Brazil. Combined with tokenization, Visa implemented a new onchain sealed-bid auction mechanism through smart contracts to enable a global pool of investors on the blockchain to participate in the financing process, achieving competitive price discovery. Additionally, the platform leverages a Visa technology called Universal Payments Channel (UPC), which can interconnect between the Real Digital (CBDC) and other CBDCs, stablecoins or tokenized deposits, to help ensure future interoperability between digital currencies across different markets and networks. This year’s LIFT Challenge Real Digital sought innovative tech research projects within the financial sector to assess use cases for the Digital Brazilian Real. Visa developed this Proof of Concept as part of the company’s ongoing efforts to work with industry partners, lead exploratory work and apply emerging technologies to creatively solve for well-known real world problems. Visa works with Central Banks around the world and other players of the payment ecosystem to identify compelling CBDC opportunities that can be scaled and executed through secure, innovative, convenient, and reliable technologies, with the goal of developing innovative digital payment solutions that can help individuals, businesses and governments participate in the digital economy and ultimately thrive. To learn more about Visa’s work with CBDC, visit our Digital Currency Innovation Hub. In addition, we have co-published an in-depth final report on the LIFT platform with the Brazilian Central Bank available here. About Visa Inc.

    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V), ein im Bereich digitales Bezahlen weltweit führendes Unternehmen, war einer der neun Finalisten, die mit der Erforschung innovativer blockchainbasierter Anwendungsfälle für den Real Digital (die von der brasilianischen Zentralbank ausgegebene digitale Währung, CBDC) im Rahmen der jüngsten LIFT Challenge beauftragt wurden. Das Unternehmen kooperierte mit Agrotoken, Microsoft und Sinqia, um seinen Beitrag zu erarbeiten. Nach monatelanger enger Zusammenarbeit der erstklassigen Forscher und Ingenieure beider Unternehmen freuen sich Visa und sein Team, die Ergebnisse ihrer Teilnahme an der LIFT Challenge bekannt zu geben - eine programmierbare Finanzplattform für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU), insbesondere Landwirte, die darauf ausgerichtet ist, einen besseren Zugang zu den weltweiten Kapitalmärkten zu ermöglichen, die Interoperabilität zwischen Währungen zu erleichtern, betriebliche Prozesse zu verbessern und neue Wachstumschancen zu erschließen. Kleine Unternehmen stärken die Weltwirtschaft KMU sind mit Blick auf die Aushandlung günstiger Verträge häufig an die lokale Marktstruktur gebunden. So ist beispielsweise Factoring inzwischen eine bekannte Finanzierungsmethode, bei der ein Landwirt seine Forderung vor Fälligkeit mit einem Abschlag verkaufen kann, um unmittelbar Geld für den Kauf von Vorräten und die Zahlung von Löhnen zu erhalten. Dieses Verfahren führt in der Regel zu einem beträchtlichen prozentualen Verlust der Forderungen des Landwirts an das finanzierende Institut. Der Prototyp von Visa wurde entwickelt, um lokalen Landwirten einen schnelleren und besseren Zugang zu einem weltweiten Investorenpool für Finanzierungen zu verschaffen, sodass für KMU der beste Preis für ihre Waren ermittelt werden kann. Indem KMU mit weiteren Optionen für die sichere und reibungslose Finanzierung ihrer Unternehmen gestärkt werden, zielt die Prototypplattform von Visa darauf ab, die bestehenden Geldbewegungen zu verbessern und Probleme zu lindern, die durch den gehinderten Zugang zu herkömmlichen Dienstleistungen entstehen. „Kleine Unternehmen sind wesentliche Leistungsträger in unseren lokalen Volkswirtschaften wie zum beispielsweise Brasilien, wo sie mehr als die Hälfte der Bevölkerung beschäftigen und fast ein Drittel zum BIP des Landes beitragen. Wir bei Visa engagieren uns dafür, ihnen beim Wachstum zu helfen, indem wir neue Technologien erforschen, die sie dabei stärken, ihre Geschäftstätigkeiten leichter aufrechtzuerhalten und auszuweiten“, sagte Catherine Gu, Global Head of CBDC bei Visa. „Brasilien ist einer der weltweit führenden Märkte für Innovationen“, ergänzte sie. „Indem wir mit unserer Expertise, Größe, unserem Netzwerk und unseren Spitzentechnologien einen Beitrag für diesen Markt leisten, können wir bei der Weiterentwicklung von Anwendungen digitaler Währungen in der Praxis helfen - indem wir es in diesem Fall einem Sojabohnenbauern ermöglichen, einen tokenisierten Vertrag auf einer genehmigten Version der Ethereum-Blockchain zu erstellen und weltweit zu versteigern und dabei verschiedene Formen des Geldes zu nutzen und zwischen ihnen zu interagieren.“ Wie Visa programmierbare Finanzen in CBDCs ermöglichen kann Da viele Zentralbanken der Welt den Wert einer digitalen Zentralbankwährung (Central Bank Digital Currency, CBDC) erkunden, haben Visa und seine Partner demonstriert, wie CBDCs neue grenzüberschreitende Zahlungen programmatisch ermöglichen und KMUs internationale Investitionsmittel zur Verfügung stellen können. Die programmierbaren Aspekte digitaler Währungen, mit denen es möglich ist, dass Lieferung und Zahlung von Kapitalien und Währungen nur dann automatisch erfüllt werden, wenn bestimmte Bedingungen erfüllt sind, eröffnen die Möglichkeit einer effizienteren Kapitalnutzung und geringerer Gegenparteirisiken sowie die Nutzung der Sicherheit, Stabilität und des Schutzes einer Zentralbankhaftung über CBDC als zuverlässige Abrechnungswährung. Die Prototyp-Plattform bringt die aktuellen Finanzprozesse und Vermögenswerte in die Chain und ermöglicht es Landwirten, traditionelle Finanzierungsverträge zu tokenisieren. Zu diesem Zweck hat Agrotoken seine auf Landwirtschaft beruhende Tokenisierungs-Expertise aus seinen bestehenden Lösungen in Brasilien und Lateinamerika eingebracht und Visa lieferte einen Tokenisierungsprozess, um die vorhandenen brasilianischer Rechtsdokumente in ein über die Chain handelbares NFT zu verwandeln. „Die Mission von Agrotoken ist es, das Agrobusiness zu demokratisieren, indem Transaktionen mit Soja und Mais zugänglicher gemacht werden. Wir haben zu diesem Zweck solide Partner wie Visa gewählt, die uns bei der Verwirklichung dieses Ziels begleiten sollen“, so Anderson Nacaxe, Direktor von Agrotoken in Brasilien. In Kombination mit der Tokenisierung implementierte Visa einen neuen Sealed-Bid-Versteigerungsmechanismus durch Smart Contracts in der Chain, um es einem weltweiten Investorenpool auf der Blockchain zu ermöglichen, am Finanzierungsprozess teilzunehmen und einen wettbewerbsfähigen Preis zu ermitteln. Darüber hinaus nutzt die Plattform eine Technologie von Visa mit der Bezeichnung Universal Payments Channel (UPC), die den Real Digital (CBDC) und andere CBDCs, Stablecoins oder tokenisierte Einlagen untereinander verbinden kann, um künftig die Interoperabilität zwischen digitalen Währungen über verschiedene Märkte und Netzwerke hinweg zu gewährleisten. Das Ziel der diesjährigen LIFT Challenge Real Digital war es, dass innovative technische Forschungsprojekte im Finanzsektor Anwendungsfälle für den digitalen brasilianischen Real bewerten. Visa entwickelte diesen Proof-of-Concept im Zuge der kontinuierlichen Bestrebungen des Unternehmens, mit Branchenpartnern zusammenzuarbeiten, Forschungsarbeiten anzuführen und neue Technologien anzuwenden, um aus der Praxis bekannte Probleme auf kreative Weise zu lösen. Visa arbeitet mit Zentralbanken auf der ganzen Welt und anderen Akteuren des Zahlungsökosystems zusammen, um überzeugende CBDC-Möglichkeiten zu finden, die durch sichere, innovative, bequeme und zuverlässige Technologien skaliert und ausgeführt werden können. Das Ziel ist die Entwicklung innovativer digitaler Zahlungslösungen, die Privatpersonen, Unternehmen und Regierungen dabei helfen können, an der digitalen Wirtschaft teilzuhaben und letztendlich erfolgreich zu sein. Um mehr über die Arbeit von Visa mit CBDC zu erfahren, besuchen Sie unseren Digital Currency Innovation Hub. Wir haben überdies gemeinsam mit der brasilianischen Zentralbank einen detaillierten Schlussbericht auf der LIFT-Plattform veröffentlicht, der hier abrufbar ist. Über Visa Inc. Visa (NYSE: V) ist ein weltweit führendes Unternehmen im digitalen Zahlungsverkehr, das Zahlungstransaktionen zwischen Verbrauchern, Händlern, Finanzinstituten und staatlichen Rechtsträgern in mehr als 200 Ländern und Gebieten ermöglicht. Unser Ziel ist es, die Welt über das innovativste, bequemste, zuverlässigste und sicherste Zahlungsnetzwerk zu verbinden, damit Einzelpersonen, Unternehmen und Volkswirtschaften gedeihen können. Wir glauben, dass Volkswirtschaften, die alle überall einschließen, alle überall voranbringen und betrachten den Zugang als grundlegend für die Zukunft des Geldverkehrs.

    "text": "舊金山--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美國商業資訊)--Visa (NYSE: V) 是數位支付領域的全球領導者，並在近期旨在探索 Real Digital (巴西中央銀行發行的數位貨幣，簡稱 CBDC) 基於區塊鏈之創新使用案例的 LIFT 挑戰賽上，成為九個入圍團隊之一。其參賽專案與 Agrotoken、Microsoft 和 Sinqia 合作開發完成。 經過了各公司出色的研究人員和工程師幾個月以來的密切合作，Visa 及其團隊很高興與大家分享其 LIFT 挑戰賽參賽專案：面向中小型企業 (SME) 打造的程式化金融平臺，尤其適合農場主，旨在幫助使用者更深入地進入全球資本市場，促進貨幣之間的互通性，並發現新的增長機會。 小型企業推動全球經濟發展 中小企業在談判有利可圖的合約時往往受當地語系化市場結構的約束。例如，應收帳款融資是目前十分常見的一種融資方式，農場主能夠以折扣價出售他們未來的應收帳款，以便現在獲得資金來購買物資和支付工資。這個過程通常會導致農場主應收帳款的很大一部分損失給提供融資的實體。 Visa 的原型平臺旨在為當地農場主提供更及時、更多的全球投資者融資管道，幫助中小企業以最佳價格出售他們的產品。透過 Visa 的原型平臺，中小企業可以獲得更多選擇，以安全和順暢的方式為其業務融資，從而改善現有的資金流動管理，緩解因無法獲享傳統服務而造成的痛點。 Visa CBDC 全球負責人 Catherine Gu 表示：「小型企業是我們當地經濟的重要貢獻者，例如在巴西，小型企業雇用了一半以上的人口，貢獻了該國近三分之一的 GDP。在 Visa，我們致力於助其成長，探索新技術，幫助他們更輕鬆地維護和擴大業務營運。」 她繼續說道：「巴西是世界領先的創新市場之一。我們在這個市場上貢獻專業知識、規模、網路和尖端技術，以推進數位貨幣的實際應用，具體而言，我們能夠幫助大豆種植者基於乙太坊區塊鏈的許可版本創建一份代幣化合約並在全球進行拍賣，同時利用不同形式的貨幣，並在這些貨幣之間進行交互操作。」 Visa 如何在 CBDC 中實現程式化金融 隨著全世界許多央行紛紛開始探索央行數位貨幣 (CBDC) 的價值，Visa 及其合作夥伴展示了 CBDC 如何透過程式設計實現新的跨境支付，並為中小企業提供國際投資資源。由於數位貨幣具有程式化特徵，只有在滿足特定條件時，才能自動結算資產和貨幣的交付和支付，這為更高效地使用資本和降低交易對手風險創造了條件，同時透過將 CBDC 作為可靠的結算貨幣，得以發揮中央銀行負債在安全、穩定和保障方面的優勢。 該原型平臺將現有的金融流程和資產帶入鏈中，幫助農場主讓傳統融資合約實現代幣化。為此，Agrotoken 發揮其在巴西和拉丁美洲的現有解決方案中的農業代幣化專長，同時 Visa 提供代幣化流程，將現有的巴西法律文件轉變為可在鏈上交易的 NFT。 巴西 Agrotoken 總監 Anderson Nacaxe 說：「Agrotoken 的使命是推動大豆和玉米交易，讓這些交易更容易達成，並實現農業綜合企業的大眾化。為實現這一目標，我們選擇了 Visa 這樣可靠的合作夥伴攜手並進。」 Visa 結合代幣化，透過智慧合約實施了新的鏈上密封競價拍賣機制，使區塊鏈上的全球投資者池能夠參與融資過程，獲享有競爭力的價格。此外，該平臺還應用了一項名為通用支付通道 (UPC) 的 Visa 技術，可以在 Real Digital (CBDC) 和其他 CBDC、穩定幣或代幣化存款之間進行互連，以幫助確保數位貨幣未來在不同市場和網路中的互通性。 今年的 LIFT Challenge Real Digital 旨在尋求金融領域的創新技術研究專案，以評估巴西雷亞爾數位貨幣的使用案例。Visa 開發的這一概念驗證體現了該公司在與行業夥伴合作、領導探索性工作以及應用新興技術來創造性地解決普遍存在的現實問題上的不懈努力。 Visa 與世界各地的中央銀行和支付生態系統中的其他參與者合作，發掘能夠透過安全、創新、便捷又可靠的技術進行擴展和執行的富有吸引力的 CBDC 機會，以開發創新的數位支付解決方案，幫助個人、企業和政府參與數位經濟並實現蓬勃發展。 若要詳細瞭解 Visa 與 CBDC 的合作，請造訪我們的數位貨幣創新中心。此外，我們還與巴西中央銀行共同發佈了一份關於LIFT平臺的深度最終報告，您可以按一下此處獲取。 關於 Visa Inc.

    "text": "旧金山--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美国商业资讯)--Visa（NYSE：V）是数字支付领域的全球领导者，并在近期旨在探索Real Digital（巴西中央银行发行的数字货币，简称CBDC）基于区块链的创新用例的LIFT挑战赛上，成为九个入围团队之一。其参赛项目与Agrotoken、Microsoft和Sinqia合作开发完成。 经过了各公司出色的研究人员和工程师几个月以来的密切合作，Visa及其团队很高兴向大家展示其LIFT挑战赛参赛项目，即一个专为中小型企业（SME）打造的可编程金融平台，尤其适合农场主，该平台旨在让他们能够更深入地进入全球资本市场，促进货币之间的互操作性，并发现新的增长机会。 小型企业推动全球经济发展 中小企业在为己方争取有利条件的合同谈判中往往受制于本地化的市场结构。例如，保理是目前十分常见的一种融资方式，农场主可以以折扣价出售其未来的应收账款，以便现在获得资金来购买物资和支付工资。这个过程通常会导致农场主应收账款的很大一部分损失给提供融资的实体。 Visa的原型旨在为当地农场主提供更及时、更广阔的全球投资者融资渠道，使中小企业能够以最佳价格销售其产品。通过Visa的原型平台，中小企业可以获得更多选择，以安全和顺畅的方式为其业务融资，从而改善现有的资金流动管理，缓解因无法获得传统服务而造成的痛点。 Visa CBDC全球负责人Catherine Gu表示：“小型企业是我们当地经济的重要贡献者，例如在巴西，小型企业雇用了一半以上的人口，贡献了该国近三分之一的GDP。在Visa，我们致力于助其成长，探索新技术，使他们能够更轻松地维护并扩大业务运营。” 她继续说道：“巴西是世界领先的创新市场之一，我们将专业知识、网络和尖端技术大规模地投入到该市场，旨在帮助推进数字货币的实际应用，具体到这里，就是使大豆种植者能够在以太坊区块链的许可版本基础上，创建代币化合同并在全球进行拍卖，同时利用不同形式的货币，并在这些货币之间进行互操作。” Visa如何在CBDC中实现可编程金融 随着全世界多家央行纷纷开始探索央行数字货币（CBDC）的价值，Visa及其合作伙伴展示了CBDC如何通过编程实现新的跨境支付，并为中小企业提供国际投资资源。由于数字货币的可编程性，只有在满足特定条件时，才能自动结算资产和货币的交付与支付，这为更高效地使用资本和降低交易对手风险提供了机会，同时通过将CBDC作为可靠的结算货币，得以发挥中央银行负债在安全、稳定和保障方面的优势。 该原型平台将现有的金融流程和资产带入链中，让农场主能够将传统融资合同代币化。为此，Agrotoken发挥其在巴西和拉丁美洲的现有解决方案中的农业代币化专长，同时Visa提供代币化流程，将现有的巴西法律文件转变为可在链上交易的NFT。 巴西的Agrotoken总监Anderson Nacaxe表示：“Agrotoken致力于通过简化大豆和玉米的交易过程，实现农业综合企业的大众化。为达成这一目标，我们选择了像Visa这样可靠的合作伙伴携手并进。” Visa结合代币化，通过智能合约实施了新的链上密封竞价拍卖机制，使区块链上的全球投资者池能够参与融资过程，获得有竞争力的价格。此外，该平台还应用了一项名为通用支付通道（UPC）的Visa技术，该技术可以在Real Digital（CBDC）和其他CBDC、稳定币或代币化存款之间进行互连，以帮助确保数字货币未来在不同市场和网络中的互操作性。 今年的LIFT Challenge Real Digital旨在寻求金融领域的创新技术研究项目，以评估巴西雷亚尔数字货币的用例。Visa所开发的概念验证体现了该公司在与行业伙伴合作、领导探索性工作以及应用新兴技术来创造性地解决普遍现实问题上的不懈努力。 Visa与世界各地的中央银行以及支付生态系统中的其他参与者合作，发掘能够通过安全、创新、便捷又可靠的技术进行扩展和执行的富有吸引力的CBDC机会，以开发创新的数字支付解决方案，帮助个人、企业和政府参与数字经济并实现蓬勃发展。 欲了解Visa与CBDC的合作详情，请访问我们的数字货币创新中心。此外，我们还与巴西中央银行共同发布了一份关于LIFT平台的深度最终报告，可在此处获取。 关于Visa Inc.

    "text": "米カリフォルニア州サンフランシスコ--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- デジタル決済ビジネスの世界的リーダーであるビザ（NYSE:V）は、ブロックチェーンを基盤とする、「レアル・デジタル」（ブラジル中銀発行のデジタル通貨、略称「CBDC」）の革新的ユースケースの提案を競う最終候補9社に残りました。CBDCはブラジル政府が主催する「リフト・チャレンジ」の最新プロジェクトです。ビザは提案を練り上げるうえで、Agrotoken、Microsoft、Sinqiaと協力関係にあります。 各社の世界的研究者とエンジニアが数か月にわたり共同で提案策定に取り組んだ結果、ビザはリフト・チャレンジの成果として、農家を中心とする中小事業者（SME）向けのプログラム可能な資金繰りプラットフォームの発表にこぎ着けました。このプラットフォームは、世界資本市場へのアクセス促進、各種通貨間の相互運用性向上、運営プロセス改善、新たな成長機会の発掘といったメリットを中小事業者にもたらします。 中小事業者が世界経済を牽引 中小事業者は、契約交渉を有利に進めるうえで地元の市場構造の枠に留まることがよくあります。例えば、ファクタリングは、農家が将来の売上債権を割引価格で売却し、その収入を当座の資材の購入や賃金の支払いに充てる現在よく知られる資金繰り手段ですが、当該債権は資金の提供企業から大幅に割り引いた価格で買い取られるため、農家にとって不利な取引となるのが通例です。 ビザの試作プラットフォームは、地元農家などの中小事業者が、世界の広範な投資家層からよりタイムリーに資金を調達する手段となり、作物・商品を最適な価格で販売する可能性を広げます。中小事業者向けの安全かつスムーズな資金繰り手段が加わることで、既存の資金移動プロセスの改善と閉鎖的な旧式サービスの弱点の軽減が図れます。 ビザでCBDCのグローバルヘッドを務めるキャサリン・グーは次のように説明します。「中小事業者は地域経済の重要な担い手です。例えば、ブラジルで人口の半分以上の雇用先であり、GDPへの寄与度は3分の1近くに達しています。ビザでは中小事業者の成長支援に力を入れており、事業活動の維持・拡大を促進する新技術の開発に取り組んでいます」 「ブラジルは革新分野における世界先端市場の1つです。ビザは社内の専門知識、規模、ネットワーク、市場最先端技術で貢献することにより、デジタル通貨の実用化促進を支援することができます。今回のケースでは、大豆農家は認定版イーサリアム・ブロックチェーンでトークン化されたコントラクトを作成して世界的に入札することも、複数の貨幣形態を利用して相互に運用することも可能になります」（キャサリン・グー）。 CBDC建てのプログラム可能資金繰りを実現したビザの手法 世界中銀の多くが中銀デジタル通貨（CBDC）の利用価値を模索するなか、ビザと提携企業はCBDCを利用してプログラム的に国際的な資金決済を実行する新しい方法と中小事業者に国際投資リソースを提供する方法を実演しました。デジタル通貨にはプログラム可能という側面があり、特定の条件が満たされたときのみ資産と通貨の送信と支払いが自動的に決済できるという特徴があります。この特徴を利用すれば、資本利用を効率化し、カウンターパーティリスクを軽減する道が開けます。しかも信頼性の高い決済通貨としてCBDCという形態で中央銀行がセキュリティ、安定性、安全性に責任を負う構造も活用できます。 試作プラットフォームでは、従来の金融プロセスと資産がブロックチェーンに移行するため、農家は伝統的な資金調達契約のトークン化が可能になります。この可能性を実現するために、Agrotokenは現在ブラジルと中南米で展開しているソリューションで培った農業ベースのトークン化ノウハウを提供しました。また、ビザは既存のブラジル用法務文書をブロックチェーンで取引可能なNFT（非代替性トークン）向けにアレンジするトークン化プロセスを提供しました。 「Agrotokenは大豆取引やトウモロコシ取引の門戸を拡大することで、農業ビジネスを民主化するという使命を担っています。この使命を達成するために、当社はビザをはじめとする堅実なパートナーを選び、目標に向けて共に歩んでいます」とブラジルのAgrotokenディレクターAnderson Nacaxe氏は語ります。 ビザではトークン化と共に、スマートコントラクトを通じたオンチェーンの封印入札方式を導入し、ブロックチェーン上の世界中の投資家が資金調達プロセスに参加し、競争を通じて価格が決定される工夫をしています。さらに、試作プラットフォームで活用されるビザの「ユニバーサル・ペイメント・チャネル（UPC）」技術により、レアル・デジタル （CBDC）と他のCBCD、法定通貨、トークン化預金の相互接続を可能にして、将来、異なる市場やネットワーク間でのデジタル通貨の相互運用を実現するための盤石な体制を築いています。 今年の 「リフト・チャレンジ：レアル・デジタル」 では、デジタル版ブラジル・レアルのユースケースを評価するために、金融セクターの革新的技術研究プロジェクトが比較・検討の対象となりました。ビザは業界パートナーと協力して、試験的な取り組みを統率し、新興技術を利用して周知の現実的な問題を創造的な方法で解決する努力を継続的に行っています。今回の概念事象となる試作プラットフォームはその一環として策定されました。 ビザは安全、便利で信頼性の高い革新的な技術を通じて大規模に実行可能なCBDCの魅力的な商機を見出すために、世界各国の中銀や決済エコシステムに属する他企業と連携活動を行っています。この活動の目標である「革新的なデジタル決済ソリューションの開発」が実現すれば、デジタル経済に参加する個人、企業、政府の役に立ち、最終的に繁栄をもたらすことになります。 CBDCに関するビザの取り組みの詳細は、Digital Currency Innovation Hub（デジタル通貨革新ハブ）をご覧ください。さらに、ブラジル中央銀行と共同出版した、リフト・プラットフォームに関する詳細な最終報告書も こちらからご覧いただけます。 ビザ・インクについて ビザ（NYSE: V）はデジタル決済の世界的リーダーであり、200以上の国・領域で、消費者、加盟店、金融機関、政府機関の間の決済トランザクションを円滑化しています。 革新性、利便性、信頼性、安全性に優れた決済ネットワークを通じて世界を結び、個人、企業、経済に繁栄をもたらすことを使命としています。ビザでは、世界各国で誰もが受け入れられる経済は、世界中の人々の生活を向上させると確信しています。そして、資金移動の未来へのアクセスがその基盤であると考えています。詳細情報は、 http://visa.com/をご覧ください 本記者発表文の公式バージョンはオリジナル言語版です。翻訳言語版は、読者の便宜を図る目的で提供されたものであり、法的効力を持ちません。翻訳言語版を資料としてご利用になる際には、法的効力を有する唯一のバージョンであるオリジナル言語版と照らし合わせて頂くようお願い致します。",
