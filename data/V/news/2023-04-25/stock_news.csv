Later this year, Venmo and PayPal users in the US will be able to start moving money seamlessly between the two platforms. Visa+ will not require users to have a Visa card; instead, by setting up a personalized payment address linked to their Venmo or PayPal account, individuals using either app will be able to receive and send payments quickly and securely between the platforms. As part of a joint effort to build interoperability across payment platforms, Visa partners DailyPay, i2c, TabaPay and Western Union, will also integrate Visa+ within their platforms. Through this collaboration, Visa+ will expand its reach and enable more use cases, including gig, creator and marketplace payouts. Participating digital wallets, neo-banks and other payment apps, reaching millions of US users, will be able to enable interoperability through Visa+. “Consumers continue to seek simple and seamless ways to digitally move money between friends and family, including the ability to send money between different payment platforms,” said Chris Newkirk, Global Head of New Payment Flows at Visa. “We are thrilled to partner with like-minded innovators to broaden the reach of P2P payments across platforms. Through this collaboration, Visa+ can help break down barriers for payment app users as they connect, engage and move money.” According to industry group U.S. Faster Payments Council, interoperability is considered one of the most important topics in the payments industry.1 Visa+ serves as a bridge that helps bring a new level of convenience, simplicity and reach to the world of person-to-person payments. “We are honored to partner with Visa on our mission to make Earned Wage Access available to everyone, everywhere,"" said Kevin Coop, CEO, DailyPay. “By empowering workers with choice and control over their earned pay, we enable them to pay bills on time, spend, save, or invest on their own schedule. And through participating wallets, their earned wages could be available the moment they earn it using DailyPay and Visa+.” “We’re excited to be a part of this forward-thinking initiative and to continue to be an innovation partner to Visa,” said Ava Kelly, chief product officer for i2c Inc., adding, “We continuously strive to help banks, credit unions and fintechs remove friction from the customer experience and make the ‘how’ of moving money an afterthought.” “We started TabaPay with a goal to make instant payments simple, reliable and universal. Visa+ is significant progress towards achieving that goal,” said Tim Astanov, Head of Commercialization at TabaPay. “As one of the largest processors for Visa Direct, we are excited to expand our relationship with Visa. This new and innovative solution for the fintech community will remove friction and make instant money movement easier for our clients and their customers.” “Western Union’s mission is to deliver accessible financial services around the world,” said Thomas Mazzaferro, Chief Data and Innovation Officer at Western Union. “We are delighted to partner with Visa on its new product launch of Visa+ to deliver upon that mission and offer new innovative payment options for our customers.” Visa+ is expected to launch for US consumers with select partners in late 2023. General availability is planned for mid-2024. For more information, visit our webpage and learn more about how Visa+ works: visa.com/visa+.

We look forward to seeing them unlock their greatest potential.” Athlete Spotlights from Around the World The footballers on Team Visa are helping change the game on and off the pitch. On the pitch, players such as Ellie Carpenter (Australia), Debinha (Brazil), Christine Sinclair (Canada), and Ghizlane Chebbak (Morocco) have each made historic strides for the game, earning various awards, ""firsts” and international records. Off the pitch, Team Visa athletes are blazing their own trails: Miriam Mayorga (Argentina) does double duty as a doctor; Sam Mewis’ (U.S.A.) leadership led to securing equal pay for her team; Huynh Nhu (Vietnam) broke down barriers as the first Vietnamese footballer to play abroad; and Didem Karagenc (Turkey) is a physical education teacher starting a grassroots football camp for local girls. “Joining Team Visa with this incredible group makes this experience even more surreal,” said Catarina Macario, U.S. Women’s National Team midfielder. “While we might go head-to-head on the pitch, we are all working together on the goal of a better future for women’s football and Visa is supporting us every step of the way.” Team Visa: A Platform to Inspire Since 2000, Team Visa has lent crucial support to more than 500 athletes around the globe providing them with a platform to tell their inspiring stories. To help athletes thrive personally and professionally, the program provides financial support, assistance with philanthropic endeavors, financial literacy tools, and mental health and wellness resources.

The company partnered with Agrotoken, Microsoft, and Sinqia to develop its submission. After months of collaborative work between each company’s world-class researchers and engineers, Visa and its team are excited to share the results of their LIFT Challenge participation — a programmable finance platform for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), particularly farmers, that is designed to enable greater access to global capital markets, facilitate interoperability between currencies, improve operational processes, and uncover new growth opportunities. Small Businesses Drive Global Economies SMEs are often beholden to localized market structure in negotiating favorable contracts. For example, factoring is a well-known financing method today where a farmer can sell their future receivable at a discount to receive money today to purchase supplies and pay wages. This process routinely leads to a sizable percentage loss of the farmer’s receivable to the entity providing financing. Visa’s prototype is designed to provide local farmers with more timely and greater access to a global pool of investors for financing, allowing the SMEs to get the best price discovery for their goods. By empowering SMEs with additional options to finance their businesses in a secure and frictionless way, Visa’s prototype platform aims to improve existing money movement operations and alleviate pain points caused by inaccessibility to traditional services. “Small businesses are essential contributors to our local economies, such as in Brazil where they employ over half the population and contribute to nearly a third of the country’s GDP. At Visa, we are committed to help them grow, exploring new technologies that will empower them to more easily maintain and expand their business operations,” said Catherine Gu, Global Head of CBDC for Visa. “Brazil is one of the world’s leading markets for innovation,” she continues. “By contributing our expertise, scale, network, and cutting-edge technologies in this market, we are able to help advance real-world applications of digital currencies — in this case making it possible for a soybean farmer to create and globally auction a tokenized contract on a permissioned version of the Ethereum blockchain, while utilizing different forms of money and interoperating between them.” How Visa can Enable Programmable Finance in CBDCs With many of the world’s central banks exploring the value of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), Visa and its partners have demonstrated how CBDCs can enable new cross-border payments programmatically, as well as provide international investment resources to SMEs. The programmable aspects of digital currencies, which allow delivery and payment of assets and currencies to be automatically settled only when certain conditions are met, open the door for more efficient capital usage and reduced counterparty risks, while leveraging the security, stability, and safety of a central bank liability via CBDC as a reliable settlement currency. The prototype platform brings existing financial processes and assets on-chain, allowing farmers to tokenize traditional financing contracts. To achieve this, Agrotoken brought its agriculture-based tokenization expertise from their existing solutions in Brazil and Latin America and Visa delivered a tokenization process for turning existing Brazilian legal documents into an on-chain tradeable NFT. “Agrotoken has a mission to democratize agribusiness by making transactions with soy and corn more accessible. To achieve this, we have chosen solid partners, such as Visa, to join us in our journey towards this goal,"" said Anderson Nacaxe, Director of Agrotoken in Brazil. Combined with tokenization, Visa implemented a new onchain sealed-bid auction mechanism through smart contracts to enable a global pool of investors on the blockchain to participate in the financing process, achieving competitive price discovery. Additionally, the platform leverages a Visa technology called Universal Payments Channel (UPC), which can interconnect between the Real Digital (CBDC) and other CBDCs, stablecoins or tokenized deposits, to help ensure future interoperability between digital currencies across different markets and networks. This year’s LIFT Challenge Real Digital sought innovative tech research projects within the financial sector to assess use cases for the Digital Brazilian Real. Visa developed this Proof of Concept as part of the company’s ongoing efforts to work with industry partners, lead exploratory work and apply emerging technologies to creatively solve for well-known real world problems. Visa works with Central Banks around the world and other players of the payment ecosystem to identify compelling CBDC opportunities that can be scaled and executed through secure, innovative, convenient, and reliable technologies, with the goal of developing innovative digital payment solutions that can help individuals, businesses and governments participate in the digital economy and ultimately thrive.

V,2023-04-25,2023-04-11,2023-05-09,V,,2023-05-09 07:35:00,2023-05-09T07:35:00-04:00,2023-05-09,Die blockchainbasierten Innovationen von Visa können kleine Unternehmen auf die nächste Stufe heben,"SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V), ein im Bereich digitales Bezahlen weltweit führendes Unternehmen, war einer der neun Finalisten, die mit der Erforschung innovativer blockchainbasierter Anwendungsfälle für den Real Digital (die von der brasilianischen Zentralbank ausgegebene digitale Währung, CBDC) im Rahmen der jüngsten LIFT Challenge beauftragt wurden. Das Unternehmen kooperierte mit Agrotoken, Microsoft und Sinqia, um seinen Beitrag zu erarbeiten. Nach monatelanger enger Zusammenarbeit der erstklassigen Forscher und Ingenieure beider Unternehmen freuen sich Visa und sein Team, die Ergebnisse ihrer Teilnahme an der LIFT Challenge bekannt zu geben - eine programmierbare Finanzplattform für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU), insbesondere Landwirte, die darauf ausgerichtet ist, einen besseren Zugang zu den weltweiten Kapitalmärkten zu ermöglichen, die Interoperabilität zwischen Währungen zu erleichtern, betriebliche Prozesse zu verbessern und neue Wachstumschancen zu erschließen. Kleine Unternehmen stärken die Weltwirtschaft KMU sind mit Blick auf die Aushandlung günstiger Verträge häufig an die lokale Marktstruktur gebunden. So ist beispielsweise Factoring inzwischen eine bekannte Finanzierungsmethode, bei der ein Landwirt seine Forderung vor Fälligkeit mit einem Abschlag verkaufen kann, um unmittelbar Geld für den Kauf von Vorräten und die Zahlung von Löhnen zu erhalten. Dieses Verfahren führt in der Regel zu einem beträchtlichen prozentualen Verlust der Forderungen des Landwirts an das finanzierende Institut. Der Prototyp von Visa wurde entwickelt, um lokalen Landwirten einen schnelleren und besseren Zugang zu einem weltweiten Investorenpool für Finanzierungen zu verschaffen, sodass für KMU der beste Preis für ihre Waren ermittelt werden kann. Indem KMU mit weiteren Optionen für die sichere und reibungslose Finanzierung ihrer Unternehmen gestärkt werden, zielt die Prototypplattform von Visa darauf ab, die bestehenden Geldbewegungen zu verbessern und Probleme zu lindern, die durch den gehinderten Zugang zu herkömmlichen Dienstleistungen entstehen. „Kleine Unternehmen sind wesentliche Leistungsträger in unseren lokalen Volkswirtschaften wie zum beispielsweise Brasilien, wo sie mehr als die Hälfte der Bevölkerung beschäftigen und fast ein Drittel zum BIP des Landes beitragen. Wir bei Visa engagieren uns dafür, ihnen beim Wachstum zu helfen, indem wir neue Technologien erforschen, die sie dabei stärken, ihre Geschäftstätigkeiten leichter aufrechtzuerhalten und auszuweiten“, sagte Catherine Gu, Global Head of CBDC bei Visa. „Brasilien ist einer der weltweit führenden Märkte für Innovationen“, ergänzte sie. „Indem wir mit unserer Expertise, Größe, unserem Netzwerk und unseren Spitzentechnologien einen Beitrag für diesen Markt leisten, können wir bei der Weiterentwicklung von Anwendungen digitaler Währungen in der Praxis helfen - indem wir es in diesem Fall einem Sojabohnenbauern ermöglichen, einen tokenisierten Vertrag auf einer genehmigten Version der Ethereum-Blockchain zu erstellen und weltweit zu versteigern und dabei verschiedene Formen des Geldes zu nutzen und zwischen ihnen zu interagieren.“ Wie Visa programmierbare Finanzen in CBDCs ermöglichen kann Da viele Zentralbanken der Welt den Wert einer digitalen Zentralbankwährung (Central Bank Digital Currency, CBDC) erkunden, haben Visa und seine Partner demonstriert, wie CBDCs neue grenzüberschreitende Zahlungen programmatisch ermöglichen und KMUs internationale Investitionsmittel zur Verfügung stellen können. Die programmierbaren Aspekte digitaler Währungen, mit denen es möglich ist, dass Lieferung und Zahlung von Kapitalien und Währungen nur dann automatisch erfüllt werden, wenn bestimmte Bedingungen erfüllt sind, eröffnen die Möglichkeit einer effizienteren Kapitalnutzung und geringerer Gegenparteirisiken sowie die Nutzung der Sicherheit, Stabilität und des Schutzes einer Zentralbankhaftung über CBDC als zuverlässige Abrechnungswährung. Die Prototyp-Plattform bringt die aktuellen Finanzprozesse und Vermögenswerte in die Chain und ermöglicht es Landwirten, traditionelle Finanzierungsverträge zu tokenisieren. Zu diesem Zweck hat Agrotoken seine auf Landwirtschaft beruhende Tokenisierungs-Expertise aus seinen bestehenden Lösungen in Brasilien und Lateinamerika eingebracht und Visa lieferte einen Tokenisierungsprozess, um die vorhandenen brasilianischer Rechtsdokumente in ein über die Chain handelbares NFT zu verwandeln. „Die Mission von Agrotoken ist es, das Agrobusiness zu demokratisieren, indem Transaktionen mit Soja und Mais zugänglicher gemacht werden. Wir haben zu diesem Zweck solide Partner wie Visa gewählt, die uns bei der Verwirklichung dieses Ziels begleiten sollen“, so Anderson Nacaxe, Direktor von Agrotoken in Brasilien. In Kombination mit der Tokenisierung implementierte Visa einen neuen Sealed-Bid-Versteigerungsmechanismus durch Smart Contracts in der Chain, um es einem weltweiten Investorenpool auf der Blockchain zu ermöglichen, am Finanzierungsprozess teilzunehmen und einen wettbewerbsfähigen Preis zu ermitteln. Darüber hinaus nutzt die Plattform eine Technologie von Visa mit der Bezeichnung Universal Payments Channel (UPC), die den Real Digital (CBDC) und andere CBDCs, Stablecoins oder tokenisierte Einlagen untereinander verbinden kann, um künftig die Interoperabilität zwischen digitalen Währungen über verschiedene Märkte und Netzwerke hinweg zu gewährleisten. Das Ziel der diesjährigen LIFT Challenge Real Digital war es, dass innovative technische Forschungsprojekte im Finanzsektor Anwendungsfälle für den digitalen brasilianischen Real bewerten.
