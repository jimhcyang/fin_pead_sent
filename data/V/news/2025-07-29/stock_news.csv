Meanwhile, SPYI and DIVO can help monthly payout seekers diversify beyond the tech sector. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) It wasn&#8217;t very long ago that passive income investors had to wait three full months before an exchange traded fund (ETF) would finally pay a dividend. Recently, however, an explosion in the number of ETFs has enabled more frequent cash distributions and powerful wealth-compounding possibilities. Five funds in particular are changing the ETF game with eye-catching yields and monthly cash payouts. Ambitious dividend harvesters can try out some of these funds or even, if they dare, buy all five of the following passive income ETF all-stars. MSTY, QQQI, and JEPQ for Tech Exposure All five of the ETFs featured today provide cash dividends/distributions each and every month. Yet, there are crucial differences between these funds, especially when it comes to their annual yields and risk profiles. To start off, I&#8217;ll direct your attention to an ETF that&#8217;s on the hotter end of the risk spectrum. I&#8217;m referring to the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSTY), which generates some income from U.S. Treasury bonds but mainly relies on option-trading strategies. More specifically, the MSTY ETF uses synthetic covered call strategies (or possibly synthetic covered call spread strategies) to indirectly derive income from Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock. As you may be aware, Microstrategy is a technology firm that aggressively invests in Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC). Since Microstrategy stock can be quite volatile and option-trading strategies can be risky, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF isn&#8217;t for the faint of heart. On the other hand, high risks can come with huge rewards as the MSTY ETF currently advertises a gigantic 72.93% annual distribution rate. While MSTY pays you every month and has an enormous annual yield, it&#8217;s not everybody&#8217;s cup of tea. Maybe you still want exposure to interesting technology companies but aren&#8217;t prepared to accept high risk. If so, then I&#8217;ve got two monthly-paying funds that emphasize the tech sector but aren&#8217;t overly volatile. The first one is the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI), which is centered around the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 stock index. This fund uses options-trading strategies to squeeze income from a basket of approximately 100 stocks, including NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). The NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF is reshaping portfolios by eliminating the need to pick individual tech stocks while also providing monthly income. In addition, QQQI&#8217;s 14.65% annual distribution rate will undoubtedly make it attractive to yield hunters. In a similar vein to QQQI, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) focuses on stocks in the NASDAQ 100. This fund collects income from 108 stocks that are mainly in the technology sector, and like MSTY and QQQI, the JEPQ ETF utilizes options-trading strategies. Thus, it shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising that the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF enables portfolio exposure to technology titans like NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon, Broadcom, and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). With a 12-month rolling dividend yield of 11.52%, the JEPQ ETF should impress any passive income enthusiast yearning for monthly wealth-building opportunities. SPYI and DIVO for Multi-Sector Diversification There&#8217;s no denying that audacious ETFs like MSTY, QQQI, and JEPQ are taking passive income investing to the next level. But then, you might prefer funds that venture beyond the technology sector while still paying out distributions each month. On that topic, I&#8217;ve got a pair of potent funds offering instant multi-sector diversification. One of them is the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). Instead of sticking to the NASDAQ 100, the SPYI ETF concentrates on the S&amp;P 500 and has around 500 stocks in its holdings. This fund can quickly diversify your portfolio across a wide variety of stocks and sectors. Within the SPYI ETF, you&#8217;ll see large-cap standouts like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Like the other funds on this list, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF relies on options-trading strategies to produce income. After you discover that SPYI features monthly cash payouts and a 12.15% annual distribution rate, you may find it hard to resist taking a share position. Rounding out this five-pack of passive income boundary breakers is the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO), which derives income from dividends and options-trading strategies based on 24 stocks. Those 24 stocks aren&#8217;t all tech stocks, mind you. Sure, you&#8217;ll find Microsoft stock in the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF&#8217;s holdings. However, you&#8217;ll also find non-tech-focused firms like Home Depot, Visa (NYSE:V), RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Maybe DIVO&#8217;s 4.73% annual distribution rate isn&#8217;t as mind-blowing as the other funds I&#8217;m highlighting today. Nevertheless, the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF&#8217;s diversified basket features some rock-solid companies and the fund&#8217;s monthly payouts will add up over the long run. As you can see, there are similarities but also important distinctions between MSTY, QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, and DIVO. All five of these ETFs are altering the landscape of passive income investing so, if you&#8217;re ready, feel free to try them out today.The post These 5 ETFs (MSTY, QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, DIVO) Are Reshaping Passive Income Portfolios appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/14/these-5-etfs-msty-qqqi-jepq-spyi-divo-are-reshaping-passive-income-portfolios/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/these-5-etfs-msty-qqqi-jepq-spyi-divo-are-20250715.jpg

Meanwhile, the RSPA ETF is widely diversified but also pays big dividends. It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. If you&#8217;ve managed to save up $500,000 to invest in stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs), pat yourself on the back. You&#8217;re in a great position to earn tens of thousands of dollars in worry-free income each and every year. Two passive income powerhouses are particularly well-suited for investors seeking relatively safe dividends/distributions. With these two high-yield funds, you could generate $40,000 per year from a half-a-million-dollar account. So, let&#8217;s look at a pair of ETFs that could help you grow your fortune while you sleep soundly at night. QDVO: Tech Exposure, Decent Diversification It might sound risky to take $500,000 and equally divide it among just two funds. However, this plan can make sense if the two funds provide good diversification across well-known stocks. The first ETF that fits this description is the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF (NYSEARCA:QDVO). This ETF generates income from dividends and premium payments from writing/selling call options. Since the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF includes 42 stocks in its holdings, you&#8217;ll achieve diversification with just this one fund. Plus, you&#8217;ll get portfolio exposure to highly established technology giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). While the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF emphasizes large-cap technology stocks, it also includes non-tech names such as Visa (NYSE:V), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), and RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX). Consequently, your $500,000 portfolio won&#8217;t be too tech-heavy with the QDVO ETF. An added bonus of the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF is that it pays out its dividends/distributions on a monthly basis. Hence, there&#8217;s no need to wait three full months to start seeing the cash show up in your account. Getting down to the nitty-gritty, the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF offers an annual distribution rate of 9.87%, but also deducts 0.55% worth of operating expenses. This means that QDVO&#8217;s expected annualized net yield for investors would be 9.87% &#8211; 0.55%, or 9.32%. RSPA: High Yield, Hundreds of Famous Names Even though the the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF has plenty of benefits, you don&#8217;t have to pour an entire $500,000 account into one fund. Instead, you could allocate $250,000 toward QDVO and the remaining $250,000 into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF (NYSEARCA:RSPA). Generally based on the S&amp;P 500 index, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF has 524 stocks in its holdings. Moreover, it&#8217;s not too heavily allocated toward technology or any other sector, as the RSPA ETF places roughly equal weighting on each stock. Within the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF you&#8217;ll find technology luminaries like Microsoft, Apple, and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). Yet, you&#8217;ll also discover non-technology-focused firms such as PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Hence, you can massively diversify your portfolio with the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF and sleep all night long worry-free. Furthermore, there&#8217;s an added benefit with this fund because, like QDVO, RSPA pays out its distributions every month. The annual distribution rate for the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF is 9.13%, which is quite impressive. When we subtract the operating fees of 0.29% per year, the RSPA ETF should provide an expected net annual yield of 9.13% &#8211; 0.29%, or 8.84%. Getting $40,000 Each Year From Two ETFs Now, let&#8217;s do the math with these two terrific funds. For extra-wide diversification, you could put $250,000 into the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF and another $250,000 into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF. Then, your average expected net annual yield would be (9.32% + 8.84%) / 2, or 9.08%. Actually, your yield could be even higher if you reinvest the cash distributions every month, but let&#8217;s keep it simple and assume a 9.08% yield for now. After one year, assuming the two funds don&#8217;t reduce their distribution rates, you could expect to receive cash distributions totaling $500,000 x 9.08%, or $45,400. This allows some room for error, as it easily beats your goal of earning $40,000 in dividends/distributions. Of course, you should monitor the share prices of the two ETFs and not only the distribution rates. After all, you&#8217;ll want to see some share-price appreciation to further build your $500,000 nest egg. There&#8217;s no need to lose sleep over this issue, though, since the QDVO and RSPA ETFs should gain value over the long run. These two funds hold a variety of blue-chip stocks so you can rest easy while collecting $40,000 in cash every 12 months.The post How to Turn $500K into $40,000 in Annual Passive Income Without Losing Sleep appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/15/how-to-turn-500k-into-40000-in-annual-passive-income-without-losing-sleep/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/how-to-turn-500k-into-40000-in-annual-passive-20250716.jpg

Here’s the Smartest Way to Turn It Into Monthly Passive Income","Key Points The SPHD and DIVO ETFs are ideal vehicles for volatility mitigation and reliable income. Furthermore, you can enhance your monthly income potential with single-stock ETFs. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) If you&#8217;re fortunate enough to inherit $400,000, it may be tempting to spend that money on cars and vacations. However, the smart-money move is to invest the funds wisely and plan for your financial future. One approach is to invest that $400,000 in exchange traded funds (ETFs) that provide passive income every month. That way, you can reinvest the cash distributions and take advantage of the compounding effect. So now, it&#8217;s time to reveal four funds that unlock monthly income opportunities so you can turn your inheritance into a cash-producing machine. SPHD: A Reliable Pick for Low Volatility $400,000 is a whole lot of money to inherit and invest. Therefore, your first priority shouldn&#8217;t be maximizing your monthly dividends. Instead, it should be mitigating your risk so you don&#8217;t lose all of that money. When safety and reliability are your top priorities, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA:SPHD) is a solid pick. This fund has 52 stocks in its holdings, all carefully selected from the S&amp;P 500 large-cap stock index. The SPHD ETF specifically chooses stocks &#8220;that historically have provided high dividend yields and low volatility.&#8221; Examples include Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Realty Income Corp. (NYSE:O), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Altria Group (NYSE:MO). These companies are known for providing consistent dividend payments, and their stocks typically aren&#8217;t volatile. Furthermore, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF features a 12-month distribution rate (i.e., a forward annual dividend yield) of 3.44%. Plus, the SPHD ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. With all of that in mind, you could take $150,000 of your inherited $400,000, put it into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF, and sleep soundly at night. Stay in the Safe Lane With DIVO With $400,000 to invest, you&#8217;ll have a large account and there&#8217;s no need to drive in the fast lane. Instead, you can stay in the &#8220;safe lane&#8221; but still get a passive income stream with the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO). Much like the SPHD ETF, the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF seeks to reduce share-price volatility while providing exposure to high-quality dividend-paying companies. Moreover, like the other funds mentioned today, DIVO puts cash distributions into your account on a monthly basis. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF has 24 stocks in its holdings, and you&#8217;ll see plenty of large-cap sector leaders in there. Among the top holdings in the DIVO ETF are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Visa (NYSE:V), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Again, we&#8217;re choosing safety first and then aiming for good yield. Since the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF invests in great companies and features an impressive 4.73% annual distribution rate, it checks all the right boxes. Thus, it would make sense to allocate $150,000 of a $400,000 inheritance toward the DIVO ETF. Accelerate Your Yield With Single-Stock ETFs It&#8217;s wise to dedicate $300,000 of your $400,000 inheritance toward diversified low-volatility funds like SPHD and DIVO. If you do that, then you can invest the remaining $100,000 in ETFs with greater risk but also higher yields. To that end, YieldMax offers a wide variety of ETFs that each focus on a single stock instead of a diversified basket of stocks. Typically, these YieldMax ETFs derive monthly income from U.S. Treasury bonds and sophisticated options-trading strategies. One way to reduce the risk is to stick to YieldMax ETFs that focus on established large-cap companies. For example, the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:APLY) indirectly derives income from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. Currently, the APLY ETF advertises an annual distribution rate of 26.99%. This fund shouldn&#8217;t be excessively risky as Apple is a reliable blue-chip business with staying power. So, you could invest $25,000 of your $400,000 inheritance in the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF. A reasonable plan would be to pick four single-stock ETFs with a focus on high-confidence companies. Then, you could allocate $25,000 toward each of the four funds you picked. A Mixed-Risk Approach APLY is just one example of many monthly-paying single-stock ETFs you can choose from. Here&#8217;s a summary of other funds in this category, and while you explore them, you might think about picking your four favorites: The YieldMax AMZN Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMZY); based on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock; 47.82% annual distribution rate The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY); based on NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock; 74.99% annual distribution rate The YieldMax GOOGL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:GOOY); based on the stock of Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL); 32.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax MSFT Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSFO); based on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock; 34.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax JPM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:JPMO); based on JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock; 39% annual distribution rate The YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMDY); based on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock; 68.07% annual distribution rate The YieldMax DIS Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:DISO); based on Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock; 38.55% annual distribution rate The YieldMax XOM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:XOMO); based on Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock; 38.04% annual distribution rate Just to provide an idea of what your overall plan might look like, you could invest $150,000 in SPHD, $150,000 in DIVO, and $25,000 each in APLY, MSFO, DISO, and XOMO. All in all, you can mix low-risk ETFs with a handful of higher-risk ETFs to turn your inherited $400,000 into a fairly reliable monthly income-producing machine.The post Inherited $400,000?

Smaller allocations into SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV will help you build a low-fee passive income foundation. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) How far can $25,000 get you? If you have a well-considered plan in place, you can actually turn your small account into a passive income factory. This can be done with a carefully selected group of high-yield, low-fee exchange traded funds (ETFs). With just $25,000, you can build a super-low-cost portfolio that consistently pays you cash dividends/distributions. Plus, you can de-risk your portfolio through multi-sector diversification and investment in famous large-cap companies. So, let&#8217;s start right now with a smart-money plan to extract sizable cash payouts from a small but growing account. Start With RSPA for Extra Diversification Out of a $25,000 account, you can confidently put $10,000 into just one ETF. That&#8217;s because the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF (NYSEARCA:RSPA) checks all of the right boxes for a small-sized high-growth portfolio. To populate a small-sized portfolio, I would want to use funds that invest in successful, blue-chip business. I would also insist that the ETFs should be diversified and need to have annual operating expenses below 0.5%. With a focus on companies in the prestigious S&amp;P 500 index, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF has 525 stocks in its holdings. Suffice it to say, then, that the RSPA ETF is widely diversified. When you examine the fund&#8217;s holdings list, you&#8217;ll find established large-cap leaders across multiple economic sectors. Some examples are Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED). An interesting feature of the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF is that each of the holdings has a small, roughly equal weighing to the other stocks in the fund. That way, you won&#8217;t over-invest in any single stock. In addition, the RSPA ETF is low-cost as it only deducts annualized operating fees of 0.29%. And for all of you yield hunters out there, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF currently features a 12-month distribution rate of 9.42%. All in all, this ultra-diversified fund is ideal for a $25,000 account and I would feel comfortable dedicating $10,000 toward RSPA. Expand Your Portfolio With SCHD and JEPQ Even though the RSPA ETF would already expose you to 500+ stocks, you still probably wouldn&#8217;t want to toss your entire $25,000 into just one fund. Consequently, we will now explore three more ETFs and, after conducting your own due diligence, you could invest $5,000 in each one of them. The first of these three intriguing funds is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and has a portfolio comprising 103 stocks. Again, we&#8217;re looking for famous large-cap names and multi-sector diversification. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF meets these expectations with recognizable stocks like Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Merck (NYSE:MRK), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF serves up a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.87% but only deducts 0.06% worth of annual operating expenses. Therefore, investors should have no objections to allocating $5,000 toward the SCHD ETF. Next up is the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ), which is centered around the technology-focused NASDAQ 100 index. This fund includes 107 stocks so you can participate in the growth of tech&#8217;s heavy hitters, such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Committing $5,000 of your $25,000 portfolio to the JEPQ ETF will unlock extra share-price appreciation potential from a variety of top tech firms. You&#8217;ll also get access to substantial cash distributions as the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF features an impressive 11.52% annual yield. We&#8217;re still sticking to the low-cost theme here since JEPQ only deducts operating fees of 0.35% per year. So, why not add some technology-fueled firepower to your small portfolio with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF? Round It Out With FDVV To round out your $25,000 passive-income plan, you could assign $5,000 toward the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:FDVV). Instead of concentrating on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, or NASDAQ 100, the FVDD ETF corresponds to the Fidelity High Dividend Index. Among the holdings list of the Fidelity High Dividend ETF, you&#8217;ll find large-cap superstars like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Visa (NYSE:V), Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Overall, you&#8217;ll get exposure to plenty of consistent dividend deliverers with FDVV. The other need-to-know stats are that the Fidelity High Dividend ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.07% but only deducts 0.16% in annualized operating expenses. With all of those benefits in mind, you can proudly add $5,000 worth of FDVV shares to your $25,000 account. Now, you&#8217;ve got a four-pack of funds with RSPA as your anchor as well as SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV for extra diversification. That&#8217;s a savvy plan to keep the fees to a minimum while turning your $25,000 account into a low-risk regular income producer.The post How to Build a Super Low Cost Passive Income Fund for Only $25,000 appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/23/how-to-build-a-super-low-cost-passive-income-fund-for-only-25000/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/how-to-build-a-super-low-cost-passive-income-20250723.jpg

You may get a good welcome bonus if you spend enough money within a few months, and you will also likely receive points or cash back on every purchase. However, a Fat FIRE advocate recently expressed dissatisfaction with Amex Platinum. This individual no longer feels valued by the company despite spending $50,000 each month. Other Redditors jumped into the comments to share their thoughts about this trend and recommend some ways to maximize credit card benefits. Key Points Some credit card companies don&#8217;t have the same reward structures that made them so popular. A Redditor who spends more than $50,000 per month is looking for alternatives after AMEX fell below their expectations. It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. Use Bank Of America The top commenter suggested putting $100,000 into a Merrill Lynch or Bank of America account and then using the company&#8217;s Visa card for maximum benefits. This setup will net you 3.5% cashback on travel and dining, plus 2.625% cashback on everything else. The recommendation came from someone who was fed up with using different credit cards for different categories and opening a bunch of cards just for their bonuses. This route can save you a lot of time while allowing you to secure top-tier rewards. Bank of America also doesn&#8217;t have an annual membership fee that is tied to those benefits. To top it all off, there are a lot of expenses that count as travel and dining, even if it&#8217;s not obvious. &#8220;They are *extremely* generous about how they code for travel and dining. For example, I pay monthly maintenance expenses on several rental properties with the card. Magically, that&#8217;s counted as lodging, so I get 3.5% back,&#8221; the top commenter stated. Fees Add Up The original poster isn&#8217;t the only one who&#8217;s fed up with Amex cards. One Redditor commented that the Amex Centurion card isn&#8217;t as good as it used to be, despite paying roughly $5,000 in fees. The Redditor got plenty of upvotes from that comment. You can choose from many credit cards that do not have annual fees. If you don&#8217;t have to contend with an annual fee, all of your rewards are pure profit as long as you pay off your credit card balance at the end of each month. Plenty of credit cards offer unlimited 2% cashback on every purchase, and that may be enough to edge out some of the credit cards with annual fees. While big spenders may be able to justify the high annual fee, it isn&#8217;t worth it for everyone. Travelers Benefit The Most From High-End Credit Cards Another Redditor mentioned that most of the top-tier credit cards only serve people who travel often. While this setup benefits regular travelers, it&#8217;s important to keep this distinction in mind if you do not travel. It&#8217;s important to view each credit card while considering how you spend your money and what you want out of life. Some people enjoy traveling, but opting for a simple cashback credit card may be the better choice for others. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re getting the deal of a lifetime if you enjoy boarding airplanes and going to new destinations. Some Redditors criticized the travel portals of various credit cards. They said that hotel and car prices include travel agent markups and are not competitive. It&#8217;s always good to review the numbers before opening a card or making any big travel purchases to ensure you are getting the best deal.
