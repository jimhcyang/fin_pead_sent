Smaller allocations into SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV will help you build a low-fee passive income foundation. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) How far can $25,000 get you? If you have a well-considered plan in place, you can actually turn your small account into a passive income factory. This can be done with a carefully selected group of high-yield, low-fee exchange traded funds (ETFs). With just $25,000, you can build a super-low-cost portfolio that consistently pays you cash dividends/distributions. Plus, you can de-risk your portfolio through multi-sector diversification and investment in famous large-cap companies. So, let&#8217;s start right now with a smart-money plan to extract sizable cash payouts from a small but growing account. Start With RSPA for Extra Diversification Out of a $25,000 account, you can confidently put $10,000 into just one ETF. That&#8217;s because the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF (NYSEARCA:RSPA) checks all of the right boxes for a small-sized high-growth portfolio. To populate a small-sized portfolio, I would want to use funds that invest in successful, blue-chip business. I would also insist that the ETFs should be diversified and need to have annual operating expenses below 0.5%. With a focus on companies in the prestigious S&amp;P 500 index, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF has 525 stocks in its holdings. Suffice it to say, then, that the RSPA ETF is widely diversified. When you examine the fund&#8217;s holdings list, you&#8217;ll find established large-cap leaders across multiple economic sectors. Some examples are Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED). An interesting feature of the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF is that each of the holdings has a small, roughly equal weighing to the other stocks in the fund. That way, you won&#8217;t over-invest in any single stock. In addition, the RSPA ETF is low-cost as it only deducts annualized operating fees of 0.29%. And for all of you yield hunters out there, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF currently features a 12-month distribution rate of 9.42%. All in all, this ultra-diversified fund is ideal for a $25,000 account and I would feel comfortable dedicating $10,000 toward RSPA. Expand Your Portfolio With SCHD and JEPQ Even though the RSPA ETF would already expose you to 500+ stocks, you still probably wouldn&#8217;t want to toss your entire $25,000 into just one fund. Consequently, we will now explore three more ETFs and, after conducting your own due diligence, you could invest $5,000 in each one of them. The first of these three intriguing funds is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and has a portfolio comprising 103 stocks. Again, we&#8217;re looking for famous large-cap names and multi-sector diversification. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF meets these expectations with recognizable stocks like Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Merck (NYSE:MRK), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF serves up a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.87% but only deducts 0.06% worth of annual operating expenses. Therefore, investors should have no objections to allocating $5,000 toward the SCHD ETF. Next up is the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ), which is centered around the technology-focused NASDAQ 100 index. This fund includes 107 stocks so you can participate in the growth of tech&#8217;s heavy hitters, such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Committing $5,000 of your $25,000 portfolio to the JEPQ ETF will unlock extra share-price appreciation potential from a variety of top tech firms. You&#8217;ll also get access to substantial cash distributions as the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF features an impressive 11.52% annual yield. We&#8217;re still sticking to the low-cost theme here since JEPQ only deducts operating fees of 0.35% per year. So, why not add some technology-fueled firepower to your small portfolio with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF? Round It Out With FDVV To round out your $25,000 passive-income plan, you could assign $5,000 toward the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:FDVV). Instead of concentrating on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, or NASDAQ 100, the FVDD ETF corresponds to the Fidelity High Dividend Index. Among the holdings list of the Fidelity High Dividend ETF, you&#8217;ll find large-cap superstars like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Visa (NYSE:V), Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Overall, you&#8217;ll get exposure to plenty of consistent dividend deliverers with FDVV. The other need-to-know stats are that the Fidelity High Dividend ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.07% but only deducts 0.16% in annualized operating expenses. With all of those benefits in mind, you can proudly add $5,000 worth of FDVV shares to your $25,000 account. Now, you&#8217;ve got a four-pack of funds with RSPA as your anchor as well as SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV for extra diversification. That&#8217;s a savvy plan to keep the fees to a minimum while turning your $25,000 account into a low-risk regular income producer.The post How to Build a Super Low Cost Passive Income Fund for Only $25,000 appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/23/how-to-build-a-super-low-cost-passive-income-fund-for-only-25000/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/how-to-build-a-super-low-cost-passive-income-20250723.jpg

You may get a good welcome bonus if you spend enough money within a few months, and you will also likely receive points or cash back on every purchase. However, a Fat FIRE advocate recently expressed dissatisfaction with Amex Platinum. This individual no longer feels valued by the company despite spending $50,000 each month. Other Redditors jumped into the comments to share their thoughts about this trend and recommend some ways to maximize credit card benefits. Key Points Some credit card companies don&#8217;t have the same reward structures that made them so popular. A Redditor who spends more than $50,000 per month is looking for alternatives after AMEX fell below their expectations. It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. Use Bank Of America The top commenter suggested putting $100,000 into a Merrill Lynch or Bank of America account and then using the company&#8217;s Visa card for maximum benefits. This setup will net you 3.5% cashback on travel and dining, plus 2.625% cashback on everything else. The recommendation came from someone who was fed up with using different credit cards for different categories and opening a bunch of cards just for their bonuses. This route can save you a lot of time while allowing you to secure top-tier rewards. Bank of America also doesn&#8217;t have an annual membership fee that is tied to those benefits. To top it all off, there are a lot of expenses that count as travel and dining, even if it&#8217;s not obvious. &#8220;They are *extremely* generous about how they code for travel and dining. For example, I pay monthly maintenance expenses on several rental properties with the card. Magically, that&#8217;s counted as lodging, so I get 3.5% back,&#8221; the top commenter stated. Fees Add Up The original poster isn&#8217;t the only one who&#8217;s fed up with Amex cards. One Redditor commented that the Amex Centurion card isn&#8217;t as good as it used to be, despite paying roughly $5,000 in fees. The Redditor got plenty of upvotes from that comment. You can choose from many credit cards that do not have annual fees. If you don&#8217;t have to contend with an annual fee, all of your rewards are pure profit as long as you pay off your credit card balance at the end of each month. Plenty of credit cards offer unlimited 2% cashback on every purchase, and that may be enough to edge out some of the credit cards with annual fees. While big spenders may be able to justify the high annual fee, it isn&#8217;t worth it for everyone. Travelers Benefit The Most From High-End Credit Cards Another Redditor mentioned that most of the top-tier credit cards only serve people who travel often. While this setup benefits regular travelers, it&#8217;s important to keep this distinction in mind if you do not travel. It&#8217;s important to view each credit card while considering how you spend your money and what you want out of life. Some people enjoy traveling, but opting for a simple cashback credit card may be the better choice for others. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re getting the deal of a lifetime if you enjoy boarding airplanes and going to new destinations. Some Redditors criticized the travel portals of various credit cards. They said that hotel and car prices include travel agent markups and are not competitive. It&#8217;s always good to review the numbers before opening a card or making any big travel purchases to ensure you are getting the best deal.
