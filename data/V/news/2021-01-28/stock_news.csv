Visa Cloud Connect underpins a new global agreement between Visa and TransferWise that will enable the expansion of TransferWise’s multi-currency debit cards in Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, U.K. and U.S. The TransferWise multi-currency account allows consumers and businesses to hold and convert 55 currencies at the real exchange rate. The multi-currency debit card lets customers spend and withdraw directly from any of the currency balances. Expanding the offering into new markets would have previously required significant investment in local data centers, telecommunications infrastructure and specialized payment hardware. With Visa Cloud Connect, TransferWise can quickly establish a secure connection to VisaNet through its cloud provider, eliminating the need for costly local connectivity and speeding up TransferWise’s roll out plans. “The TransferWise team came to us last year with a challenge: enable the global rollout of their debit card program, and do it entirely in the cloud,” said Jack Forestell, executive vice president and chief product officer, Visa. “It was an exciting opportunity for us to partner with TransferWise and show how we’re thinking and working differently to help today’s fintech innovators scale up quickly. With Visa Cloud Connect, we’ve created an approach that lets TransferWise tap into Visa’s global infrastructure—one of the most secure, reliable and resilient systems in the world—through a single integration. Through our work with TransferWise, we’ve created a blueprint for other fintechs to quickly and securely connect with Visa’s massive scale and reach.” “We’ve been working to remove borders in the world’s financial networks. Cards should work the same across borders too. In Visa, we found a partner who shares our ambitions to make money work seamlessly no matter where you are. We’re excited to see how the outcome of our collaboration impacts the next generation of multinational financial institutions across the globe,” said Kristo Käärmann, TransferWise co-founder and CEO. Connecting Visa’s state-of-the art infrastructure with the cloud Today, global card programs expanding into multiple countries require investment in local data centers using specialized hardware and telecommunications infrastructure as well as coordination with local partners to adhere to regional standards. This can slow down new rollouts and delay customer adoption. Visa’s new Visa Cloud Connect platform provides a secure cloud-based connection to VisaNet, including a unified certification and testing framework, Visa-hosted security services such as transaction encryption and PIN key management, and simplified settlement in local markets. This combination of technology and services simplifies global connectivity and testing, lowers IT costs through cloud integration, and speeds time to market for launching programs in new geographies. This is particularly beneficial for new types of clients like TransferWise who have been operating on cloud-based systems from their inception. Visa Cloud Connect is currently in pilot phase with TransferWise and is slated for global availability for other clients in August 2021. TransferWise Multi-currency Account TransferWise, now 4-years profitable, serving 10 million customers and moving $6 billion in cross-border transactions every month, will be the first company to integrate globally with Visa via a single integration. This will dramatically speed up TransferWise’s plans to rollout to customers the debit cards that accompany its multi-currency account in a host of new markets. Since launching the TransferWise multi-currency account in 2018, the company has issued more than 1 million debit cards through existing processors and partners. The account and card help people and businesses avoid high foreign transaction fees and costly exchange rates when travelling, managing their money in multiple currencies, or doing business across borders.

(NYSE: V) today announced VisaNet +AI, a suite of AI-powered services that address long-standing challenges and pain points for banks, merchants and consumers—including delays and confusion with managing account balances and the unpredictability of daily settlement for financial institutions. VisaNet +AI comprises several innovative concepts and new value-added services, including Visa Smarter Posting and Visa Smarter Settlement Forecast, as well as Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP), a capability announced in August of last year. These innovations harness Visa’s high-performance AI platform to help make payments more predictable, transparent, and speedy. “Our clients, partners and cardholders look to us for actionable data-driven insights to better manage their businesses and financial lives, especially during these unprecedented times. Today we’re announcing a set of services that use AI to make it easier for consumers to manage their accounts, and for financial institutions to manage their business,” said Jack Forestell, executive vice president and chief product officer, Visa. “With our investment in AI infrastructure, we’re unlocking novel, real-time solutions to complex problems. This is just the beginning of what we can do with the predictive power of AI.” Smarter Posting helps provide greater transparency for consumers Today’s digital-native consumers expect real-time visibility into their finances as they increasingly conduct banking on mobile and online platforms. However, the payment experience for consumers can be inconsistent, with some purchases taking longer to finalize on their balance than others. This lag can create confusion or concern for cardholders, resulting in increased call center volume or potential overdrafts. This delay occurs because the amount authorized in real-time at the checkout counter can differ from the amount eventually cleared from a consumer’s account. For example, the final amount can change when a restaurant-goer adds a tip at a restaurant, or when a cross-border payment happens involving multiple currencies. To prevent consumer confusion from seeing multiple charges for a single transaction, banks often delay posting the payment or updating the account balance until they have certainty about the final amount. To help issuers create a better banking experience for cardholders, Visa developed Smarter Posting, a service that uses AI to deliver a customized score for each transaction as part of the authorization process. The Smarter Posting model analyzes transaction details and historical data to predict the likelihood that a transaction amount will remain consistent through clearing. In testing, the model has achieved 98% accuracy1 in predicting whether the transaction amount will likely remain stable, giving financial institutions added intelligence to provide a more consistent end-to-end payment experience, for example, by provisionally updating the account balance that a cardholder sees. Visa Smarter Posting will be initially available in Europe in April 2021 and is slated to expand globally in the near future. Smarter Settlement Forecast uses predictive modeling to anticipate cash flow needs Every day during the settlement process, Visa enables the movement of billions of dollars across thousands of institutions in more than 200 countries and territories and 160 currencies. It’s the final step in the payment cycle, where transactions are aggregated, transfers are facilitated between acquirers and issuers, and merchant accounts are credited for the sales they’ve made. This process requires financial institutions to strategically allocate resources—so that there is enough liquidity to meet the day’s settlement volume, without over-allocating resources that could be leveraged elsewhere in their business. Today’s volatile environment has underscored the challenge treasury teams face in predicting daily volumes and making strategic decisions. Visa created Smarter Settlement Forecast to provide clients with customized 7-day forecasts of the settlement amount they may need on hand each day. The service uses information generated by historical settlement volumes, seasonal indicators, macro-trends, outlier events, such as those surrounding COVID-19, and real-time transaction data to provide high quality predictions of cash outflows and inflows. These forecasts can help issuers and acquirers optimize treasury and liquidity management processes, and assist financial institutions settling in multiple currencies with predictions for each currency. Smarter Settlement Forecast is slated to be made available to eligible clients through a subscription in the Visa Analytics Platform, thereby simplifying integration for clients. Visa is currently piloting the service with three clients ahead of its formal launch planned for later this year. Smarter STIP can improve payment experiences during outages Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP), the first of the VisaNet +AI capabilities announced in August 2020, has gained traction among leading financial institutions globally. Smarter STIP uses deep learning to help financial institutions increase transaction authorizations during outages. Smarter STIP generates an informed decision to approve or decline transactions on behalf of issuers to provide consumers with a frictionless Visa payment experience. Since its release, Smarter STIP has seen strong issuer interest across every Visa region. In just two months, clients around the world have added Smarter STIP to their suite of Visa solutions, including Caixa Econômica Federal, and Doha Bank. “In Visa we have a partner that is driving new innovations in AI for payments,” said Mr. Braik Ali H S Al – Marri, Chief Retail Banking Officer, Doha Bank, Qatar. “With VisaNet +AI we can harness those innovations and drive new value for our business and customers.” About Visa Inc.

First Boulevard will be first to pilot Visa’s new suite of crypto APIs, which will enable their customers to purchase, custody and trade digital assets held by Anchorage, a federally chartered digital asset bank. The pilot will serve as a key first step in supporting API capabilities that help additional Visa clients access and integrate crypto features into their product offering, and is anticipated to launch later this year. The development of Visa’s crypto APIs marks the next phase of Visa’s digital currency strategy—focused on expanding the company’s role as a network-of-networks. As part of this initial test and learn phase, Visa will explore ways in which financial institutions lacking their own digital currency infrastructure can harness Visa’s platform for tapping into the growing world of crypto assets and blockchain networks. “We set out to make Visa the bridge between digital currencies and our global network of 70 million merchants and today we are the leading network for crypto wallets with 35 crypto platforms choosing to issue with Visa,” said Jack Forestell, chief product officer, Visa. “With this pilot program, we want to extend the value of Visa to our neobank and financial institution clients by providing an easy bridge to crypto assets and blockchain networks.” Advancing Diversity in Products and Partnerships As a brand that stands for global acceptance, Visa is committed to embedding diversity and inclusion into its partnership and go-to-market strategies. By prioritizing partners like First Boulevard, Visa aims to level the playing field when it comes to access to new technologies. In addition to our pilot with First Boulevard, Visa today also announced a series of partnerships emphasizing the company’s commitment to closing the financial gap in the Black community. “The First Boulevard mission is to help Black America build wealth,” said Donald Hawkins, president and chief executive officer, First Boulevard. ""We are thrilled to partner with the leader in digital payments, Visa, and leverage their crypto APIs to provide another channel for the Black community to access crypto as a new asset class that can help build Black wealth.” First Boulevard will also launch a First Boulevard Visa Debit card, which offers digital-first features, including early access to wages with Early Direct Deposit, a Cash Back for Buying Black™ program, and financial education and budgeting tools to improve spending habits. First Boulevard plans to incorporate financial literacy education into their core platform with bite sized “playlists” that their consumers can listen to in order to learn key concepts about money and investing. Visa will work together with them to develop educational resources and materials on this platform to help make new asset classes and technologies like crypto more accessible to underserved communities. Crypto APIs Pilot Program As part of the initial pilot program, Visa plans to enable First Boulevard to connect to infrastructure provided by Visa’s partner, Anchorage, a federally chartered digital asset bank, to allow their customers to buy and sell Bitcoin. ""Visa’s crypto APIs pilot program is a significant step forward both for the proliferation of crypto as an asset class, and for accessibility and inclusion in payments and financial services.

(NYSE: V) kündigte heute VisaNet +AI an, eine Suite von KI-gestützten Services, die sich mit langjährigen Herausforderungen und Problemen von Banken, Händlern und Verbrauchern befassen – darunter Verzögerungen und Durcheinander bei der Verwaltung von Kontosalden und die Unvorhersehbarkeit der täglichen Abrechnung für Finanzinstitute. VisaNet +AI umfasst mehrere innovative Konzepte und neue Mehrwertdienste, darunter Visa Smarter Posting und Visa Smarter Settlement Forecast sowie Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP), eine Funktion die im August letzten Jahres angekündigt wurde. Diese Innovationen nutzen die leistungsstarke KI-Plattform von Visa, um Zahlungen berechenbarer, transparenter und schneller zu gestalten. „Unsere Kunden, Partner und Karteninhaber erwarten von uns umsetzbare, datengestützte Erkenntnisse, um ihre Geschäftstätigkeit und ihr Finanzleben besser zu steuern, insbesondere in diesen außergewöhnlichen Zeiten. Heute kündigen wir eine Reihe von Diensten an, die KI nutzen, um Verbrauchern die Kontoführung und Finanzinstituten die Geschäftsabwicklung zu erleichtern“, sagt Jack Forestell, Executive Vice President und Chief Product Officer bei Visa. „Mit unserer Investition in die KI-Infrastruktur erschließen wir neuartige Echtzeitlösungen für komplexe Probleme. Dies ist erst der Anfang dessen, was wir mit der Vorhersagekraft von KI erreichen können.“ Smarter Posting hilft Verbrauchern bei der Schaffung von mehr Transparenz Die digital-nativen Verbraucher von heute erwarten einen Echtzeit-Einblick in ihre Finanzen, da sie ihre Bankgeschäfte zunehmend über mobile und Online-Plattformen abwickeln. Das Zahlungserlebnis für Verbraucher ist jedoch oft uneinheitlich, da es bei manchen Einkäufen länger dauert, bis der Kontostand verbucht wird als bei anderen. Diese Verzögerung kann bei den Karteninhabern Verwirrung oder Besorgnis hervorrufen, was zu einem erhöhten Call-Center-Aufkommen oder potenziellen Überziehungen führt. Diese Verzögerung entsteht, weil der in Echtzeit an der Kasse autorisierte Betrag von dem Betrag abweichen kann, der schließlich vom Konto des Kunden abgebucht wird. Beispielsweise kann sich der Endbetrag ändern, wenn ein Restaurantbesucher ein Trinkgeld gibt oder wenn eine grenzüberschreitende Zahlung erfolgt, die mehrere Währungen umfasst. Um zu verhindern, dass die Verbraucher durch mehrere Gebühren für eine einzige Transaktion verwirrt werden, verzögern Banken oft die Buchung der Zahlung oder die Aktualisierung des Kontostands, bis sie Gewissheit über den endgültigen Betrag haben. Um Emittenten dabei zu helfen, ein besseres Bankerlebnis für Karteninhaber zu schaffen, hat Visa Smarter Posting entwickelt, einen Service, der KI nutzt, um für jede Transaktion als Teil des Autorisierungsprozesses eine individuelle Bewertung zu liefern. Das Smarter-Posting-Modell analysiert Transaktionsdetails und historische Daten, um die Wahrscheinlichkeit vorherzusagen, dass ein Transaktionsbetrag bis zum Clearing konsistent bleibt. In Tests hat das Modell eine Vorhersagegenauigkeit von 98 %1 erreicht und bietet Finanzinstituten damit zusätzliche Erkenntnisse, um ein konsistenteres End-to-End-Zahlungserlebnis zu bieten, zum Beispiel durch eine vorläufige Aktualisierung des dem Karteninhaber angezeigten Kontostands. Visa Smarter Posting wird zunächst im April 2021 in Europa verfügbar sein und soll in naher Zukunft weltweit eingeführt werden. Smarter Settlement Forecast nutzt Vorhersagemodelle, um den Cashflow-Bedarf vorauszusagen Im Rahmen des Abwicklungsprozesses ermöglicht Visa jeden Tag die Bewegung von Milliarden von US-Dollar über Tausende von Institutionen in mehr als 200 Ländern und Gebieten und 160 Währungen. Es ist der letzte Schritt im Zahlungszyklus, bei dem Transaktionen zusammengefasst, Überweisungen zwischen Käufern (Acquirern) und Emittenten (Issuern) ermöglicht und Händlerkonten die getätigten Umsätze gutgeschrieben werden. Dieser Prozess erfordert von den Finanzinstituten eine strategische Ressourcenallokation – damit genügend Liquidität vorhanden ist, um das tägliche Abwicklungsvolumen zu bewältigen, ohne dabei Ressourcen übermäßig zu binden, die an anderer Stelle im Unternehmen eingesetzt werden könnten. Das heutige volatile Umfeld hat die Herausforderung für Treasury-Teams verdeutlicht, das tägliche Volumen vorherzusagen und strategische Entscheidungen zu treffen. Visa hat Smarter Settlement Forecast entwickelt, um seinen Kunden maßgeschneiderte 7-Tage-Prognosen des täglich benötigten Abrechnungsvolumens zu liefern. Der Service nutzt Informationen, die aus historischen Abwicklungsvolumina, saisonalen Indikatoren, Makro-Trends, Ausnahmeereignissen, wie z. B. im Zusammenhang mit COVID-19, und Echtzeit-Transaktionsdaten generiert werden, um hochqualitative Vorhersagen über Mittelab- und -zuflüsse zu erstellen. Diese Prognosen können Emittenten und Käufer bei der Optimierung von Treasury- und Liquiditätsmanagement-Prozessen unterstützen und Finanzinstitute, die in mehreren Währungen abrechnen, mit Vorhersagen für die einzelnen Währungen unterstützen. Smarter Settlement Forecast soll berechtigten Kunden über ein Abonnement in der Visa Analytics Platform zur Verfügung gestellt werden und so die Integration für Kunden vereinfachen. Visa testet den Service derzeit mit drei Kunden, bevor die offizielle Einführung im Laufe des Jahres geplant ist. Smarter STIP kann das Zahlungserlebnis bei Ausfällen verbessern Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP), die erste der im August 2020 angekündigten „VisaNet +AI“-Funktionen, hat unter führenden Finanzinstituten weltweit an Zugkraft gewonnen. Smarter STIP nutzt Deep Learning, um Finanzinstituten zu helfen, die Transaktionsgenehmigungen während eines Ausfalls zu erhöhen. Smarter STIP erzeugt eine fundierte Entscheidung über die Genehmigung oder Ablehnung von Transaktionen im Namen der Emittenten, um den Kunden ein reibungsloses Visa-Zahlungserlebnis zu bieten. Seit der Einführung von Smarter STIP ist das Interesse der Emittenten in allen Visa-Regionen groß. In nur zwei Monaten haben Kunden auf der ganzen Welt Smarter STIP zu ihrer Suite von Visa-Lösungen hinzugefügt, darunter Caixa Econômica Federal und die Doha Bank. „Mit Visa haben wir einen Partner, der neue Innovationen im Bereich KI für den Zahlungsverkehr vorantreibt“, sagte Herr Braik Ali H S Al – Marri, Chief Retail Banking Officer bei der Doha Bank in Katar. „Mit VisaNet +AI können wir diese Innovationen nutzen und einen neuen Mehrwert für unser Unternehmen und unsere Kunden schaffen.“ Über Visa Inc.

V,2021-01-28,2021-01-21,2021-02-11,V,,2021-02-03 10:36:00,2021-02-03T10:36:00-05:00,2021-02-03,Visa lance plusieurs innovations alimentées par l’IA pour des paiements plus intelligents,"SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa Inc. (NYSE : V) a annoncé aujourd’hui VisaNet +AI, une suite de services alimentés par l’IA qui répondent aux défis et problèmes de longue date des banques, commerçants et consommateurs, comme la confusion et les délais liés à la gestion des soldes bancaires, ainsi que le caractère imprévisible des règlements quotidiens pour les établissements financiers. VisaNet +AI intègre plusieurs concepts innovants ainsi que de nouveaux services à valeur ajoutée, notamment Visa Smarter Posting et Visa Smarter Settlement Forecast, ainsi que Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP), une capacité annoncée au mois d’août l'an dernier. Ces innovations tirent parti de la plateforme d’IA à haute performance de Visa, afin de rendre les paiements plus prévisibles, plus transparents et plus rapides. « Nos clients, partenaires et titulaires de carte se tournent vers nous pour obtenir des renseignements exploitables basés sur les données, afin de mieux gérer leurs activités et leur vie financière, particulièrement en cette période inédite. Nous annonçons aujourd’hui un ensemble de services qui s’appuient sur l’IA afin d’aider les clients à gérer plus facilement leurs comptes, et d’aider les établissements financiers à gérer leurs activités », a déclaré Jack Forestell, vice-président exécutif et directeur des produits chez Visa. « Grâce à notre investissement dans des infrastructures d’IA, nous dévoilons des solutions novatrices en temps réel pour répondre à des problématiques complexes. Ce n’est que le début de ce que nous sommes capables de faire grâce à la puissance prédictive de l’IA. » Smarter Posting permet aux consommateurs de bénéficier d’une plus grande transparence Comme ils effectuent de plus en plus des transactions bancaires sur des plateformes mobiles et en ligne, les consommateurs adeptes du numérique d’aujourd’hui s’attendent à bénéficier d’une visibilité en temps réel sur leurs finances. Néanmoins, l’expérience de paiement des consommateurs peut se révéler incohérente, certains paiements nécessitant plus de temps pour apparaître sur leurs soldes que d’autres. Ce décalage peut créer une confusion ou une inquiétude pour les titulaires de carte, engendrant une augmentation des volumes au niveau des centres d’appels ou d’éventuels découverts bancaires. Ce délai intervient dans la mesure où le montant autorisé en temps réel à la caisse peut différer du montant finalement prélevé sur le compte du consommateur. Par exemple, le montant final peut changer lorsqu’un client de restaurant ajoute un pourboire, ou lorsqu’un paiement international est effectué et implique plusieurs devises. Afin d’éviter pour le consommateur la confusion consistant à voir apparaître de multiples débits pour une seule transaction, les banques diffèrent souvent la comptabilisation du paiement, ou mettent à jour le solde du compte lorsqu’elles ont la certitude du montant final. Afin d’aider les émetteurs à créer une meilleure expérience bancaire pour les titulaires de carte, Visa a conçu Smarter Posting, un service qui utilise l’IA afin de délivrer un score personnalisé pour chaque transaction dans le cadre du processus d’autorisation. Le modèle Smarter Posting analyse les détails de la transaction ainsi que les données historiques, afin de prédire la probabilité qu’un montant de transaction demeure constant via la compensation. Dans le cadre des tests, le modèle a atteint une précision de 98 %1 en termes de prédiction de la stabilité à terme du montant de la transaction, ce qui fournit aux établissements financiers des renseignements supplémentaires leur permettant de proposer une expérience de paiement de bout en bout plus cohérente, par exemple en mettant à jour provisoirement le solde du compte consultable par le titulaire de carte. Visa Smarter Posting sera disponible dans un premier temps en Europe dès le mois d’avril 2021, et devrait s’étendre à l’échelle internationale dans un avenir proche. Smarter Settlement Forecast utilise la modélisation prédictive pour anticiper les besoins en flux de trésorerie Tous les jours au cours du processus de règlement, Visa permet le mouvement de plusieurs milliards de dollars au sein de plusieurs milliers d’établissements dans plus de 200 pays et territoires, et dans 160 devises. Il s’agit de l’étape finale du cycle de paiement, au cours de laquelle les transactions sont agrégées, les transferts sont facilités entre les acquéreurs et les émetteurs, et les comptes des commerçants sont crédités concernant les ventes qu’ils ont effectuées. Ce processus nécessite que les établissements financiers allouent de manière stratégique des ressources, afin qu’il y ait suffisamment de liquidités pour satisfaire le volume de règlements quotidien, sans allouer de manière excédentaire des ressources qui pourraient être utilisées ailleurs dans leurs activités. L’environnement volatile d’aujourd’hui révèle le défi auquel les équipes de trésorerie sont confrontées dans le cadre de la prédiction des volumes quotidiens et de la prise de décisions stratégiques. Visa a créé Smarter Settlement Forecast afin de fournir à ses clients des prévisions personnalisées sur 7 jours du montant de règlement dont ils sont susceptibles d’avoir besoin sous la main quotidiennement. Ce service utilise des informations générées par les volumes de règlement historiques, des indicateurs saisonniers, des macro-tendances, des événements particuliers, tels que ceux entourant la COVID-19, ainsi que des données de transaction en temps réel, afin de fournir des prédictions de haute qualité des entrées et sorties de trésorerie. Ces prévisions aident les émetteurs et acquéreurs à optimiser les processus de gestion de la trésorerie et des liquidités, et aident les établissements financiers à effectuer des règlements dans de multiples devises avec des prédictions pour chaque devise. Smarter Settlement Forecast devrait être disponible pour les clients éligibles via un abonnement dans la Visa Analytics Platform, simplifiant ainsi l’intégration pour les clients. Visa procède actuellement à l’expérimentation du service auprès de trois clients, avant son lancement officiel prévu plus tard dans l’année. Smarter STIP améliore les expériences de paiement en cas de pannes Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP), la première des capacités de VisaNet +AI à avoir été annoncée en août 2020, gagne du terrain auprès des principaux établissements financiers à travers le monde. Smarter STIP utilise l’apprentissage machine pour aider les établissements financiers à accroître les autorisations de transaction en cas de pannes. Smarter STIP génère une décision éclairée afin d’approuver ou refuser les transactions au nom de l’émetteur, afin d’offrir aux consommateurs une expérience de paiement Visa fluide. Depuis sa sortie, Smarter STIP suscite un vif intérêt de la part des émetteurs dans toutes les régions desservies par Visa. En seulement deux mois, les clients du monde entier ont ajouté Smarter STIP à leur gamme de solutions Visa, notamment Caixa Econômica Federal et Doha Bank. « Avec Visa, nous bénéficions d’un partenaire qui crée de nouvelles innovations en matière d’IA pour les paiements », a déclaré M. Braik Ali H S Al-Marri, directeur de la banque de détail chez Doha Bank, au Qatar. « Grâce à VisaNet +AI, nous tirons parti de ces innovations et ajoutons une valeur nouvelle pour nos activités et nos clients. » À propos de Visa Inc.

(NYSE: V)今天推出了VisaNet +AI，这是一套人工智能(AI)技术支持的服务，旨在解决银行、商户和消费者长期以来面临的挑战和痛点，包括管理账户余额时面临的延迟和混乱，以及金融机构日常结算的不可预测性。VisaNet +AI包含多项创新概念和新的增值服务，其中包括Visa Smarter Posting和Visa Smarter Settlement Forecast，以及去年8月推出的Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP)功能。这些创新功能利用Visa的高性能人工智能平台，帮助提高支付的可预测性、透明度和速度。 Visa执行副总裁兼首席产品官Jack Forestell表示：“我们的客户、合作伙伴和持卡人期待我们提供可行的数据驱动见解，以便更好地管理他们的业务和金融生活，特别是在这个前所未有的时期。今天，我们推出了一系列利用AI技术的服务，让消费者更方便地管理自己的账户，让金融机构更方便地管理自己的业务。通过对AI基础设施的投资，我们正在开发新颖的实时解决方案来解决复杂的问题。这只是我们利用人工智能的预测能力来优化服务的开始。” Smarter Posting有助于为消费者提供更高的透明度 当今自幼就熟悉信息技术的消费者希望实时了解自己的财务状况，因为他们越来越多地在移动和在线平台上进行银行业务。然而，消费者的支付体验可能并不一致，与其他购物花费相比，有些购物需要更长的时间才能最终体现在其余额中。这种滞后可能会给持卡人带来困惑或担忧，导致呼叫中心工作量增加或造成潜在透支。 之所以会出现这种延迟，是因为收银台实时授权的金额可能与最终从消费者账户中结算的金额不同。例如，当用餐者在餐厅添加小费时，或当发生涉及多种货币的跨境支付时，最终金额可能会发生变化。为了避免消费者在一次交易中看到多项费用而产生困惑，银行通常会推迟登账或推迟更新账户余额，直到他们确定最终金额。 为了帮助发卡机构为持卡人营造更好的银行体验，Visa开发了Smarter Posting，该服务利用AI为每笔交易提供定制化评分，作为授权流程的一部分。Smarter Posting模型对交易细节和历史数据进行分析，以预测交易金额与结算结果保持一致的可能性。在测试中，该模型在预测交易金额是否会保持一致方面的准确率达到了98%1，为金融机构提供更多的情报，例如通过临时更新持卡人看到的账户余额等方式营造更加一致的端到端支付体验。 Visa Smarter Posting首先将于2021年4月在欧洲推出，并计划在不久的将来向全球推广。 Smarter Settlement Forecast使用预测模型来预测现金流需求 在每天的结算过程中，Visa推动数十亿美元在200多个国家和地区的数千家机构之间以160种货币流动。这是支付周期的最后一步，在整个过程中，交易被汇总，收单机构和发卡机构之间的转账得以完成，商户的销售额被记入账户。 这个过程要求金融机构战略性地分配资源，以便有足够的流动性来满足当天的结算量需求，而不至于过度分配资源，让这些资源可以用于他们的其他业务领域。当今动荡的环境凸显了财务团队在预测每日交易量和做出战略决策方面所面临的挑战。 Visa开发了Smarter Settlement Forecast，为客户提供定制化的7天预测，预测他们每天可能需要的结算金额。该服务利用历史结算量、季节性指标、宏观趋势、新冠疫情相关事件等异常事件和实时交易数据生成的信息，提供高质量的现金流出和流入预测。这些预测可以帮助发卡机构和收单机构优化财务和流动性管理流程，并协助金融机构对每种货币进行预测，以多种货币进行结算。 Smarter Settlement Forecast计划通过Visa分析平台(Visa Analytics Platform)上的订阅服务提供给符合条件的客户，从而帮助客户简化整合流程。Visa目前正在与三个客户进行此服务的试点，计划在今年晚些时候正式推出。 Smarter STIP可改善服务中断期间的支付体验 Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP)是于2020年8月推出的第一项VisaNet +AI功能，已经赢得了全球领先金融机构的青睐。Smarter STIP利用深度学习来帮助金融机构在服务中断期间提高交易授权，并可代表发卡机构生成批准或拒绝交易的明智决策，为消费者提供无障碍的Visa支付体验。 自发布以来，Smarter STIP在Visa开展业务的所有地区都引起了发卡机构的强烈兴趣。在短短两个月内，包括巴西联邦储蓄银行(Caixa Econômica Federal)和多哈银行(Doha Bank)在内的世界各地客户就已经将Smarter STIP添加到他们的Visa解决方案套件中。 卡塔尔多哈银行首席零售银行官Braik Ali H S Al – Marri先生表示：“作为我们的合作伙伴，Visa正在推动人工智能在支付领域的新创新。通过VisaNet +AI，我们可以利用这些创新，为我们的业务和客户带来新的价值。” 关于Visa Inc.

V,2021-01-28,2021-01-21,2021-02-11,V,,2021-02-04 21:21:00,2021-02-04T21:21:00-05:00,2021-02-04,ビザ、よりスマートな支払いのためにAI活用のイノベーションを導入,サンフランシスコ--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- ビザ（NYSE：V）は本日、AIを活用した一連のサービスであるVisaNet +AIを発表しました。これは、口座残高の管理にかかる遅れと混乱や、金融機関にとって日々の決済の予測が不可能であることなど、銀行、加盟店、消費者が抱える長年の課題と問題点に対処するものです。VisaNet +AIは、Visa Smarter PostingやVisa Smarter Settlement Forecast、昨年8月に発表された機能であるVisa Smarter Stand-In Processing（スマーターSTIP）といった、いくつかの革新的なコンセプトと新しい付加価値サービスで構成されています。これらのイノベーションはビザの高性能AIプラットフォームを活用し、支払いの予測可能性、透明性、速度の向上に寄与します。 ビザのエグゼクティブ・バイスプレジデント兼最高製品責任者のジャック・フォレステルは、次のように述べています。「当社のクライアント、パートナー、カード所有者は、特にこの前例がない時期に事業や生活の財政面の管理を改善するための実用的でデータに基づいた洞察を当社に期待しています。本日私たちは、消費者にとっては口座の管理を、金融機関にとってはビジネスの管理を今よりも容易にするAIを活用した一連のサービスを発表します。AIインフラストラクチャーへの投資によって、当社は複雑な問題に対する斬新なリアルタイムのソリューションを解き放ちます。これは、AIの予測力を使って私たちができることの始まりに過ぎません。」 Smarter Postingは消費者に提供される透明性の向上に寄与 今日のデジタル・ネイティブの消費者は、モバイルやオンラインのプラットフォームで銀行取引を利用することが増えており、自分たちの財政状況をリアルタイムで把握することを望んでいます。しかし、消費者にとって支払い体験は一貫性に欠けることがあり、購入が残高に反映されるまでの時間はさまざまです。この遅れによって、カード所有者に混乱や懸念が生じ、コールセンターの業務量の増加や、当座貸越につながる可能性があります。 この遅延は、店のレジでリアルタイムに承認される金額が最終的に消費者の口座から引き落とされる金額と異なる可能性があるために発生します。例えば、レストランによく行く人がレストランでチップを追加する時や、複数の通貨が関係する国境を越えた支払いが行われる時には、最終的な金額が変わります。消費者が1つの取引に複数の請求があるのを見て混乱するのを防ぐために、銀行が支払い記録の反映や口座残高の更新を、最終的な金額が確実になるまで遅らせることがよくあります。 イシュアーがカード所有者の銀行取引体験を向上させるサポートをするために、ビザは、承認プロセスの一環としてAIを使って各取引にカスタマイズされたスコアを出すサービスであるSmarter Postingを開発しました。Smarter Postingのモデルは、取引詳細と履歴データを分析し、清算を通じて取引金額が一定に保たれる可能性を予測します。テストでは、取引金額が安定しているかの予測において、モデルは98%の精度1を達成しています。これにより金融機関には追加の情報がもたらされ、例えばカード所有者が目にする口座残高を暫定的に更新することによって、一貫性の高いエンド・ツー・エンドの決済体験を提供することができます。 Visa Smarter Postingは、2021年4月からまずは欧州で利用可能となり、近い将来に世界に拡大されることが予定されています。 Smarter Settlement Forecastは予測モデリングを使ってキャッシュフローのニーズを予想 ビザは、日々の決済プロセスにおいて、200を超える国・地域で160種類の通貨で、数千もの機関を通じて数十億ドルの移動を可能にしています。これは支払いサイクルの最終段階であり、ここで取引が集約され、アクワイアラーとイシュアーの間で送金が進められて加盟店の口座に売り上げが入金されます。 このプロセスでは、金融機関がリソースを戦略的に割り当てて、事業の他の部分で活用できるリソースを過剰に割り当てることなくその日の決済高を満たすために十分な流動性を確保する必要があります。現在の不安定な環境の中で、財務チームが日々の決済高を予測して戦略的な決定を取る上で直面する課題が浮き彫りになっています。 ビザはクライアントに対し、各日に手元に必要となるであろう決済金額について、カスタマイズされた7日間の予測を提供するSmarter Settlement Forecastを開発しました。このサービスは、過去の決済高や季節の指標、マクロトレンド、COVID-19に関するもののような外れ値の事象、リアルタイムの取引データから生成された情報を使用し、資金流出と流入について質の高い予測を提供します。これらの予測はイシュアーとアクワイアラーが財務および流動性管理プロセスを最適化するために役立ち、金融機関に対しては各通貨の予測によって、複数の通貨での決済をサポートします。 Smarter Settlement Forecastは、ビザ・アナリティクス・プラットフォームでの加入を通じて適格なクライアントへの提供が予定されており、クライアントよる統合は簡単なものになります。ビザは今年後半に予定される正式な利用開始に先立って、現在クライアント3機関を対象に同サービスを試験的に実施しています。 スマーターSTIPは業務停止中の支払い体験の向上に貢献 Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing（スマーターSTIP）は、2020年8月にVisaNet +AIの中で最初に発表された機能であり、世界各地の主要金融機関に認められています。Smarter STIPは、ディープラーニングを用いて金融機関の業務停止中の取引承認を増加させるサポートをします。Smarter STIPは、情報に基づいてイシュアーの代わりに承認か拒否の決定を行い、消費者にスムーズなビザ支払い体験を提供します。 提供開始以降、Smarter STIPは全てのビザ地域を通じてイシュアーの強い関心を集めてきました。わずか2カ月間で、ブラジル連邦貯蓄銀行とドーハ銀行を含む世界中のクライアントが、自らの一連のビザ・ソリューションにSmarter STIPを加えています。 カタールのドーハ銀行のブライク・アリ・H・S・アール・マリ最高リテールバンキング責任者は、次のように述べています。「ビザは、支払いのためのAIの新イノベーションを推進するパートナーです。VisaNet +AIを通じて、私たちはこれらのイノベーションを活用し、事業と顧客のために新しい価値を推進することができます。」 ビザについて ビザ（NYSE：V）は、デジタル決済で世界をリードしています。その使命は、安全で信頼のおける革新的な決済ネットワークで世界を結び、消費者、企業、経済全体に利便性をもたらすことです。当社の高度な世界的処理ネットワークのVisaNetは、安全で信頼性の高い決済手段を世界で提供し、毎秒6万5000件を超える取引を処理する能力を備えています。当社の技術革新に対する献身は、端末を問わず誰でもどこででも利用できるデジタル・コマースの急速な成長を推進しています。世界規模でアナログからデジタルへの移行が進む今、ビザは当社のブランド、商品、人材、ネットワーク、スケールを活用して、商取引の新たな未来を切り開きます。詳細情報については、About Visa、visa.com/blog、@VisaNewsをご覧ください。 1承認と清算の金額がいつ一貫性を維持するかに関するモデル予測を比較した分析に基づくビザのデータ。分析は過去の1億5000万件の取引データ（2020年8月～9月）について実施。 本記者発表文の公式バージョンはオリジナル言語版です。翻訳言語版は、読者の便宜を図る目的で提供されたものであり、法的効力を持ちません。翻訳言語版を資料としてご利用になる際には、法的効力を有する唯一のバージョンであるオリジナル言語版と照らし合わせて頂くようお願い致します。,businesswire.com,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204006182/ja/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/ai-20210204.png
