SAN FRANCISCO & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V) and TransferWise today announced a global partnership and the first use of Visa Cloud Connect, a new way for fintechs and partners to securely connect Visa’s global processing network, VisaNet, through the cloud. Visa Cloud Connect underpins a new global agreement between Visa and TransferWise that will enable the expansion of TransferWise’s multi-currency debit cards in Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, U.K. and U.S. The TransferWise multi-currency account allows consumers and businesses to hold and convert 55 currencies at the real exchange rate. The multi-currency debit card lets customers spend and withdraw directly from any of the currency balances. Expanding the offering into new markets would have previously required significant investment in local data centers, telecommunications infrastructure and specialized payment hardware. With Visa Cloud Connect, TransferWise can quickly establish a secure connection to VisaNet through its cloud provider, eliminating the need for costly local connectivity and speeding up TransferWise’s roll out plans. “The TransferWise team came to us last year with a challenge: enable the global rollout of their debit card program, and do it entirely in the cloud,” said Jack Forestell, executive vice president and chief product officer, Visa. “It was an exciting opportunity for us to partner with TransferWise and show how we’re thinking and working differently to help today’s fintech innovators scale up quickly. With Visa Cloud Connect, we’ve created an approach that lets TransferWise tap into Visa’s global infrastructure—one of the most secure, reliable and resilient systems in the world—through a single integration. Through our work with TransferWise, we’ve created a blueprint for other fintechs to quickly and securely connect with Visa’s massive scale and reach.” “We’ve been working to remove borders in the world’s financial networks. Cards should work the same across borders too. In Visa, we found a partner who shares our ambitions to make money work seamlessly no matter where you are. We’re excited to see how the outcome of our collaboration impacts the next generation of multinational financial institutions across the globe,” said Kristo Käärmann, TransferWise co-founder and CEO. Connecting Visa’s state-of-the art infrastructure with the cloud Today, global card programs expanding into multiple countries require investment in local data centers using specialized hardware and telecommunications infrastructure as well as coordination with local partners to adhere to regional standards. This can slow down new rollouts and delay customer adoption. Visa’s new Visa Cloud Connect platform provides a secure cloud-based connection to VisaNet, including a unified certification and testing framework, Visa-hosted security services such as transaction encryption and PIN key management, and simplified settlement in local markets. This combination of technology and services simplifies global connectivity and testing, lowers IT costs through cloud integration, and speeds time to market for launching programs in new geographies. This is particularly beneficial for new types of clients like TransferWise who have been operating on cloud-based systems from their inception. Visa Cloud Connect is currently in pilot phase with TransferWise and is slated for global availability for other clients in August 2021. TransferWise Multi-currency Account TransferWise, now 4-years profitable, serving 10 million customers and moving $6 billion in cross-border transactions every month, will be the first company to integrate globally with Visa via a single integration. This will dramatically speed up TransferWise’s plans to rollout to customers the debit cards that accompany its multi-currency account in a host of new markets. Since launching the TransferWise multi-currency account in 2018, the company has issued more than 1 million debit cards through existing processors and partners. The account and card help people and businesses avoid high foreign transaction fees and costly exchange rates when travelling, managing their money in multiple currencies, or doing business across borders.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced VisaNet +AI, a suite of AI-powered services that address long-standing challenges and pain points for banks, merchants and consumers—including delays and confusion with managing account balances and the unpredictability of daily settlement for financial institutions. VisaNet +AI comprises several innovative concepts and new value-added services, including Visa Smarter Posting and Visa Smarter Settlement Forecast, as well as Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP), a capability announced in August of last year. These innovations harness Visa’s high-performance AI platform to help make payments more predictable, transparent, and speedy. “Our clients, partners and cardholders look to us for actionable data-driven insights to better manage their businesses and financial lives, especially during these unprecedented times. Today we’re announcing a set of services that use AI to make it easier for consumers to manage their accounts, and for financial institutions to manage their business,” said Jack Forestell, executive vice president and chief product officer, Visa. “With our investment in AI infrastructure, we’re unlocking novel, real-time solutions to complex problems. This is just the beginning of what we can do with the predictive power of AI.” Smarter Posting helps provide greater transparency for consumers Today’s digital-native consumers expect real-time visibility into their finances as they increasingly conduct banking on mobile and online platforms. However, the payment experience for consumers can be inconsistent, with some purchases taking longer to finalize on their balance than others. This lag can create confusion or concern for cardholders, resulting in increased call center volume or potential overdrafts. This delay occurs because the amount authorized in real-time at the checkout counter can differ from the amount eventually cleared from a consumer’s account. For example, the final amount can change when a restaurant-goer adds a tip at a restaurant, or when a cross-border payment happens involving multiple currencies. To prevent consumer confusion from seeing multiple charges for a single transaction, banks often delay posting the payment or updating the account balance until they have certainty about the final amount. To help issuers create a better banking experience for cardholders, Visa developed Smarter Posting, a service that uses AI to deliver a customized score for each transaction as part of the authorization process. The Smarter Posting model analyzes transaction details and historical data to predict the likelihood that a transaction amount will remain consistent through clearing. In testing, the model has achieved 98% accuracy1 in predicting whether the transaction amount will likely remain stable, giving financial institutions added intelligence to provide a more consistent end-to-end payment experience, for example, by provisionally updating the account balance that a cardholder sees. Visa Smarter Posting will be initially available in Europe in April 2021 and is slated to expand globally in the near future. Smarter Settlement Forecast uses predictive modeling to anticipate cash flow needs Every day during the settlement process, Visa enables the movement of billions of dollars across thousands of institutions in more than 200 countries and territories and 160 currencies. It’s the final step in the payment cycle, where transactions are aggregated, transfers are facilitated between acquirers and issuers, and merchant accounts are credited for the sales they’ve made. This process requires financial institutions to strategically allocate resources—so that there is enough liquidity to meet the day’s settlement volume, without over-allocating resources that could be leveraged elsewhere in their business. Today’s volatile environment has underscored the challenge treasury teams face in predicting daily volumes and making strategic decisions. Visa created Smarter Settlement Forecast to provide clients with customized 7-day forecasts of the settlement amount they may need on hand each day. The service uses information generated by historical settlement volumes, seasonal indicators, macro-trends, outlier events, such as those surrounding COVID-19, and real-time transaction data to provide high quality predictions of cash outflows and inflows. These forecasts can help issuers and acquirers optimize treasury and liquidity management processes, and assist financial institutions settling in multiple currencies with predictions for each currency. Smarter Settlement Forecast is slated to be made available to eligible clients through a subscription in the Visa Analytics Platform, thereby simplifying integration for clients. Visa is currently piloting the service with three clients ahead of its formal launch planned for later this year. Smarter STIP can improve payment experiences during outages Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP), the first of the VisaNet +AI capabilities announced in August 2020, has gained traction among leading financial institutions globally. Smarter STIP uses deep learning to help financial institutions increase transaction authorizations during outages. Smarter STIP generates an informed decision to approve or decline transactions on behalf of issuers to provide consumers with a frictionless Visa payment experience. Since its release, Smarter STIP has seen strong issuer interest across every Visa region. In just two months, clients around the world have added Smarter STIP to their suite of Visa solutions, including Caixa Econômica Federal, and Doha Bank. “In Visa we have a partner that is driving new innovations in AI for payments,” said Mr. Braik Ali H S Al – Marri, Chief Retail Banking Officer, Doha Bank, Qatar. “With VisaNet +AI we can harness those innovations and drive new value for our business and customers.” About Visa Inc.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE:V) today announced a partnership with First Boulevard, a digitally native neobank focused on building generational wealth for the Black community. First Boulevard will be first to pilot Visa’s new suite of crypto APIs, which will enable their customers to purchase, custody and trade digital assets held by Anchorage, a federally chartered digital asset bank. The pilot will serve as a key first step in supporting API capabilities that help additional Visa clients access and integrate crypto features into their product offering, and is anticipated to launch later this year. The development of Visa’s crypto APIs marks the next phase of Visa’s digital currency strategy—focused on expanding the company’s role as a network-of-networks. As part of this initial test and learn phase, Visa will explore ways in which financial institutions lacking their own digital currency infrastructure can harness Visa’s platform for tapping into the growing world of crypto assets and blockchain networks. “We set out to make Visa the bridge between digital currencies and our global network of 70 million merchants and today we are the leading network for crypto wallets with 35 crypto platforms choosing to issue with Visa,” said Jack Forestell, chief product officer, Visa. “With this pilot program, we want to extend the value of Visa to our neobank and financial institution clients by providing an easy bridge to crypto assets and blockchain networks.” Advancing Diversity in Products and Partnerships As a brand that stands for global acceptance, Visa is committed to embedding diversity and inclusion into its partnership and go-to-market strategies. By prioritizing partners like First Boulevard, Visa aims to level the playing field when it comes to access to new technologies. In addition to our pilot with First Boulevard, Visa today also announced a series of partnerships emphasizing the company’s commitment to closing the financial gap in the Black community. “The First Boulevard mission is to help Black America build wealth,” said Donald Hawkins, president and chief executive officer, First Boulevard. ""We are thrilled to partner with the leader in digital payments, Visa, and leverage their crypto APIs to provide another channel for the Black community to access crypto as a new asset class that can help build Black wealth.” First Boulevard will also launch a First Boulevard Visa Debit card, which offers digital-first features, including early access to wages with Early Direct Deposit, a Cash Back for Buying Black™ program, and financial education and budgeting tools to improve spending habits. First Boulevard plans to incorporate financial literacy education into their core platform with bite sized “playlists” that their consumers can listen to in order to learn key concepts about money and investing. Visa will work together with them to develop educational resources and materials on this platform to help make new asset classes and technologies like crypto more accessible to underserved communities. Crypto APIs Pilot Program As part of the initial pilot program, Visa plans to enable First Boulevard to connect to infrastructure provided by Visa’s partner, Anchorage, a federally chartered digital asset bank, to allow their customers to buy and sell Bitcoin. ""Visa’s crypto APIs pilot program is a significant step forward both for the proliferation of crypto as an asset class, and for accessibility and inclusion in payments and financial services. We are thrilled to be working alongside Visa and First Boulevard to build the infrastructure for a more secure and equitable financial future,” said Diogo Monica, president and co-founder, Anchorage.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) kündigte heute VisaNet +AI an, eine Suite von KI-gestützten Services, die sich mit langjährigen Herausforderungen und Problemen von Banken, Händlern und Verbrauchern befassen – darunter Verzögerungen und Durcheinander bei der Verwaltung von Kontosalden und die Unvorhersehbarkeit der täglichen Abrechnung für Finanzinstitute. VisaNet +AI umfasst mehrere innovative Konzepte und neue Mehrwertdienste, darunter Visa Smarter Posting und Visa Smarter Settlement Forecast sowie Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP), eine Funktion die im August letzten Jahres angekündigt wurde. Diese Innovationen nutzen die leistungsstarke KI-Plattform von Visa, um Zahlungen berechenbarer, transparenter und schneller zu gestalten. „Unsere Kunden, Partner und Karteninhaber erwarten von uns umsetzbare, datengestützte Erkenntnisse, um ihre Geschäftstätigkeit und ihr Finanzleben besser zu steuern, insbesondere in diesen außergewöhnlichen Zeiten. Heute kündigen wir eine Reihe von Diensten an, die KI nutzen, um Verbrauchern die Kontoführung und Finanzinstituten die Geschäftsabwicklung zu erleichtern“, sagt Jack Forestell, Executive Vice President und Chief Product Officer bei Visa. „Mit unserer Investition in die KI-Infrastruktur erschließen wir neuartige Echtzeitlösungen für komplexe Probleme. Dies ist erst der Anfang dessen, was wir mit der Vorhersagekraft von KI erreichen können.“ Smarter Posting hilft Verbrauchern bei der Schaffung von mehr Transparenz Die digital-nativen Verbraucher von heute erwarten einen Echtzeit-Einblick in ihre Finanzen, da sie ihre Bankgeschäfte zunehmend über mobile und Online-Plattformen abwickeln. Das Zahlungserlebnis für Verbraucher ist jedoch oft uneinheitlich, da es bei manchen Einkäufen länger dauert, bis der Kontostand verbucht wird als bei anderen. Diese Verzögerung kann bei den Karteninhabern Verwirrung oder Besorgnis hervorrufen, was zu einem erhöhten Call-Center-Aufkommen oder potenziellen Überziehungen führt. Diese Verzögerung entsteht, weil der in Echtzeit an der Kasse autorisierte Betrag von dem Betrag abweichen kann, der schließlich vom Konto des Kunden abgebucht wird. Beispielsweise kann sich der Endbetrag ändern, wenn ein Restaurantbesucher ein Trinkgeld gibt oder wenn eine grenzüberschreitende Zahlung erfolgt, die mehrere Währungen umfasst. Um zu verhindern, dass die Verbraucher durch mehrere Gebühren für eine einzige Transaktion verwirrt werden, verzögern Banken oft die Buchung der Zahlung oder die Aktualisierung des Kontostands, bis sie Gewissheit über den endgültigen Betrag haben. Um Emittenten dabei zu helfen, ein besseres Bankerlebnis für Karteninhaber zu schaffen, hat Visa Smarter Posting entwickelt, einen Service, der KI nutzt, um für jede Transaktion als Teil des Autorisierungsprozesses eine individuelle Bewertung zu liefern. Das Smarter-Posting-Modell analysiert Transaktionsdetails und historische Daten, um die Wahrscheinlichkeit vorherzusagen, dass ein Transaktionsbetrag bis zum Clearing konsistent bleibt. In Tests hat das Modell eine Vorhersagegenauigkeit von 98 %1 erreicht und bietet Finanzinstituten damit zusätzliche Erkenntnisse, um ein konsistenteres End-to-End-Zahlungserlebnis zu bieten, zum Beispiel durch eine vorläufige Aktualisierung des dem Karteninhaber angezeigten Kontostands. Visa Smarter Posting wird zunächst im April 2021 in Europa verfügbar sein und soll in naher Zukunft weltweit eingeführt werden. Smarter Settlement Forecast nutzt Vorhersagemodelle, um den Cashflow-Bedarf vorauszusagen Im Rahmen des Abwicklungsprozesses ermöglicht Visa jeden Tag die Bewegung von Milliarden von US-Dollar über Tausende von Institutionen in mehr als 200 Ländern und Gebieten und 160 Währungen. Es ist der letzte Schritt im Zahlungszyklus, bei dem Transaktionen zusammengefasst, Überweisungen zwischen Käufern (Acquirern) und Emittenten (Issuern) ermöglicht und Händlerkonten die getätigten Umsätze gutgeschrieben werden. Dieser Prozess erfordert von den Finanzinstituten eine strategische Ressourcenallokation – damit genügend Liquidität vorhanden ist, um das tägliche Abwicklungsvolumen zu bewältigen, ohne dabei Ressourcen übermäßig zu binden, die an anderer Stelle im Unternehmen eingesetzt werden könnten. Das heutige volatile Umfeld hat die Herausforderung für Treasury-Teams verdeutlicht, das tägliche Volumen vorherzusagen und strategische Entscheidungen zu treffen. Visa hat Smarter Settlement Forecast entwickelt, um seinen Kunden maßgeschneiderte 7-Tage-Prognosen des täglich benötigten Abrechnungsvolumens zu liefern. Der Service nutzt Informationen, die aus historischen Abwicklungsvolumina, saisonalen Indikatoren, Makro-Trends, Ausnahmeereignissen, wie z. B. im Zusammenhang mit COVID-19, und Echtzeit-Transaktionsdaten generiert werden, um hochqualitative Vorhersagen über Mittelab- und -zuflüsse zu erstellen. Diese Prognosen können Emittenten und Käufer bei der Optimierung von Treasury- und Liquiditätsmanagement-Prozessen unterstützen und Finanzinstitute, die in mehreren Währungen abrechnen, mit Vorhersagen für die einzelnen Währungen unterstützen. Smarter Settlement Forecast soll berechtigten Kunden über ein Abonnement in der Visa Analytics Platform zur Verfügung gestellt werden und so die Integration für Kunden vereinfachen. Visa testet den Service derzeit mit drei Kunden, bevor die offizielle Einführung im Laufe des Jahres geplant ist. Smarter STIP kann das Zahlungserlebnis bei Ausfällen verbessern Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP), die erste der im August 2020 angekündigten „VisaNet +AI“-Funktionen, hat unter führenden Finanzinstituten weltweit an Zugkraft gewonnen. Smarter STIP nutzt Deep Learning, um Finanzinstituten zu helfen, die Transaktionsgenehmigungen während eines Ausfalls zu erhöhen. Smarter STIP erzeugt eine fundierte Entscheidung über die Genehmigung oder Ablehnung von Transaktionen im Namen der Emittenten, um den Kunden ein reibungsloses Visa-Zahlungserlebnis zu bieten. Seit der Einführung von Smarter STIP ist das Interesse der Emittenten in allen Visa-Regionen groß. In nur zwei Monaten haben Kunden auf der ganzen Welt Smarter STIP zu ihrer Suite von Visa-Lösungen hinzugefügt, darunter Caixa Econômica Federal und die Doha Bank. „Mit Visa haben wir einen Partner, der neue Innovationen im Bereich KI für den Zahlungsverkehr vorantreibt“, sagte Herr Braik Ali H S Al – Marri, Chief Retail Banking Officer bei der Doha Bank in Katar. „Mit VisaNet +AI können wir diese Innovationen nutzen und einen neuen Mehrwert für unser Unternehmen und unsere Kunden schaffen.“ Über Visa Inc. Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) ist der weltweite Marktführer im digitalen Zahlungsverkehr. Unser Ziel ist, die Welt durch das innovativste, zuverlässigste und sicherste Zahlungsnetzwerk zu verbinden und so Einzelpersonen, Unternehmen und Volkswirtschaften zum Erfolg zu verhelfen.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa Inc. (NYSE : V) a annoncé aujourd’hui VisaNet +AI, une suite de services alimentés par l’IA qui répondent aux défis et problèmes de longue date des banques, commerçants et consommateurs, comme la confusion et les délais liés à la gestion des soldes bancaires, ainsi que le caractère imprévisible des règlements quotidiens pour les établissements financiers. VisaNet +AI intègre plusieurs concepts innovants ainsi que de nouveaux services à valeur ajoutée, notamment Visa Smarter Posting et Visa Smarter Settlement Forecast, ainsi que Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP), une capacité annoncée au mois d’août l'an dernier. Ces innovations tirent parti de la plateforme d’IA à haute performance de Visa, afin de rendre les paiements plus prévisibles, plus transparents et plus rapides. « Nos clients, partenaires et titulaires de carte se tournent vers nous pour obtenir des renseignements exploitables basés sur les données, afin de mieux gérer leurs activités et leur vie financière, particulièrement en cette période inédite. Nous annonçons aujourd’hui un ensemble de services qui s’appuient sur l’IA afin d’aider les clients à gérer plus facilement leurs comptes, et d’aider les établissements financiers à gérer leurs activités », a déclaré Jack Forestell, vice-président exécutif et directeur des produits chez Visa. « Grâce à notre investissement dans des infrastructures d’IA, nous dévoilons des solutions novatrices en temps réel pour répondre à des problématiques complexes. Ce n’est que le début de ce que nous sommes capables de faire grâce à la puissance prédictive de l’IA. » Smarter Posting permet aux consommateurs de bénéficier d’une plus grande transparence Comme ils effectuent de plus en plus des transactions bancaires sur des plateformes mobiles et en ligne, les consommateurs adeptes du numérique d’aujourd’hui s’attendent à bénéficier d’une visibilité en temps réel sur leurs finances. Néanmoins, l’expérience de paiement des consommateurs peut se révéler incohérente, certains paiements nécessitant plus de temps pour apparaître sur leurs soldes que d’autres. Ce décalage peut créer une confusion ou une inquiétude pour les titulaires de carte, engendrant une augmentation des volumes au niveau des centres d’appels ou d’éventuels découverts bancaires. Ce délai intervient dans la mesure où le montant autorisé en temps réel à la caisse peut différer du montant finalement prélevé sur le compte du consommateur. Par exemple, le montant final peut changer lorsqu’un client de restaurant ajoute un pourboire, ou lorsqu’un paiement international est effectué et implique plusieurs devises. Afin d’éviter pour le consommateur la confusion consistant à voir apparaître de multiples débits pour une seule transaction, les banques diffèrent souvent la comptabilisation du paiement, ou mettent à jour le solde du compte lorsqu’elles ont la certitude du montant final. Afin d’aider les émetteurs à créer une meilleure expérience bancaire pour les titulaires de carte, Visa a conçu Smarter Posting, un service qui utilise l’IA afin de délivrer un score personnalisé pour chaque transaction dans le cadre du processus d’autorisation. Le modèle Smarter Posting analyse les détails de la transaction ainsi que les données historiques, afin de prédire la probabilité qu’un montant de transaction demeure constant via la compensation. Dans le cadre des tests, le modèle a atteint une précision de 98 %1 en termes de prédiction de la stabilité à terme du montant de la transaction, ce qui fournit aux établissements financiers des renseignements supplémentaires leur permettant de proposer une expérience de paiement de bout en bout plus cohérente, par exemple en mettant à jour provisoirement le solde du compte consultable par le titulaire de carte. Visa Smarter Posting sera disponible dans un premier temps en Europe dès le mois d’avril 2021, et devrait s’étendre à l’échelle internationale dans un avenir proche. Smarter Settlement Forecast utilise la modélisation prédictive pour anticiper les besoins en flux de trésorerie Tous les jours au cours du processus de règlement, Visa permet le mouvement de plusieurs milliards de dollars au sein de plusieurs milliers d’établissements dans plus de 200 pays et territoires, et dans 160 devises. Il s’agit de l’étape finale du cycle de paiement, au cours de laquelle les transactions sont agrégées, les transferts sont facilités entre les acquéreurs et les émetteurs, et les comptes des commerçants sont crédités concernant les ventes qu’ils ont effectuées. Ce processus nécessite que les établissements financiers allouent de manière stratégique des ressources, afin qu’il y ait suffisamment de liquidités pour satisfaire le volume de règlements quotidien, sans allouer de manière excédentaire des ressources qui pourraient être utilisées ailleurs dans leurs activités. L’environnement volatile d’aujourd’hui révèle le défi auquel les équipes de trésorerie sont confrontées dans le cadre de la prédiction des volumes quotidiens et de la prise de décisions stratégiques. Visa a créé Smarter Settlement Forecast afin de fournir à ses clients des prévisions personnalisées sur 7 jours du montant de règlement dont ils sont susceptibles d’avoir besoin sous la main quotidiennement. Ce service utilise des informations générées par les volumes de règlement historiques, des indicateurs saisonniers, des macro-tendances, des événements particuliers, tels que ceux entourant la COVID-19, ainsi que des données de transaction en temps réel, afin de fournir des prédictions de haute qualité des entrées et sorties de trésorerie. Ces prévisions aident les émetteurs et acquéreurs à optimiser les processus de gestion de la trésorerie et des liquidités, et aident les établissements financiers à effectuer des règlements dans de multiples devises avec des prédictions pour chaque devise. Smarter Settlement Forecast devrait être disponible pour les clients éligibles via un abonnement dans la Visa Analytics Platform, simplifiant ainsi l’intégration pour les clients. Visa procède actuellement à l’expérimentation du service auprès de trois clients, avant son lancement officiel prévu plus tard dans l’année. Smarter STIP améliore les expériences de paiement en cas de pannes Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP), la première des capacités de VisaNet +AI à avoir été annoncée en août 2020, gagne du terrain auprès des principaux établissements financiers à travers le monde. Smarter STIP utilise l’apprentissage machine pour aider les établissements financiers à accroître les autorisations de transaction en cas de pannes. Smarter STIP génère une décision éclairée afin d’approuver ou refuser les transactions au nom de l’émetteur, afin d’offrir aux consommateurs une expérience de paiement Visa fluide. Depuis sa sortie, Smarter STIP suscite un vif intérêt de la part des émetteurs dans toutes les régions desservies par Visa. En seulement deux mois, les clients du monde entier ont ajouté Smarter STIP à leur gamme de solutions Visa, notamment Caixa Econômica Federal et Doha Bank. « Avec Visa, nous bénéficions d’un partenaire qui crée de nouvelles innovations en matière d’IA pour les paiements », a déclaré M. Braik Ali H S Al-Marri, directeur de la banque de détail chez Doha Bank, au Qatar. « Grâce à VisaNet +AI, nous tirons parti de ces innovations et ajoutons une valeur nouvelle pour nos activités et nos clients. » À propos de Visa Inc.

旧金山--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美国商业资讯)--Visa Inc. (NYSE: V)今天推出了VisaNet +AI，这是一套人工智能(AI)技术支持的服务，旨在解决银行、商户和消费者长期以来面临的挑战和痛点，包括管理账户余额时面临的延迟和混乱，以及金融机构日常结算的不可预测性。VisaNet +AI包含多项创新概念和新的增值服务，其中包括Visa Smarter Posting和Visa Smarter Settlement Forecast，以及去年8月推出的Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP)功能。这些创新功能利用Visa的高性能人工智能平台，帮助提高支付的可预测性、透明度和速度。 Visa执行副总裁兼首席产品官Jack Forestell表示：“我们的客户、合作伙伴和持卡人期待我们提供可行的数据驱动见解，以便更好地管理他们的业务和金融生活，特别是在这个前所未有的时期。今天，我们推出了一系列利用AI技术的服务，让消费者更方便地管理自己的账户，让金融机构更方便地管理自己的业务。通过对AI基础设施的投资，我们正在开发新颖的实时解决方案来解决复杂的问题。这只是我们利用人工智能的预测能力来优化服务的开始。” Smarter Posting有助于为消费者提供更高的透明度 当今自幼就熟悉信息技术的消费者希望实时了解自己的财务状况，因为他们越来越多地在移动和在线平台上进行银行业务。然而，消费者的支付体验可能并不一致，与其他购物花费相比，有些购物需要更长的时间才能最终体现在其余额中。这种滞后可能会给持卡人带来困惑或担忧，导致呼叫中心工作量增加或造成潜在透支。 之所以会出现这种延迟，是因为收银台实时授权的金额可能与最终从消费者账户中结算的金额不同。例如，当用餐者在餐厅添加小费时，或当发生涉及多种货币的跨境支付时，最终金额可能会发生变化。为了避免消费者在一次交易中看到多项费用而产生困惑，银行通常会推迟登账或推迟更新账户余额，直到他们确定最终金额。 为了帮助发卡机构为持卡人营造更好的银行体验，Visa开发了Smarter Posting，该服务利用AI为每笔交易提供定制化评分，作为授权流程的一部分。Smarter Posting模型对交易细节和历史数据进行分析，以预测交易金额与结算结果保持一致的可能性。在测试中，该模型在预测交易金额是否会保持一致方面的准确率达到了98%1，为金融机构提供更多的情报，例如通过临时更新持卡人看到的账户余额等方式营造更加一致的端到端支付体验。 Visa Smarter Posting首先将于2021年4月在欧洲推出，并计划在不久的将来向全球推广。 Smarter Settlement Forecast使用预测模型来预测现金流需求 在每天的结算过程中，Visa推动数十亿美元在200多个国家和地区的数千家机构之间以160种货币流动。这是支付周期的最后一步，在整个过程中，交易被汇总，收单机构和发卡机构之间的转账得以完成，商户的销售额被记入账户。 这个过程要求金融机构战略性地分配资源，以便有足够的流动性来满足当天的结算量需求，而不至于过度分配资源，让这些资源可以用于他们的其他业务领域。当今动荡的环境凸显了财务团队在预测每日交易量和做出战略决策方面所面临的挑战。 Visa开发了Smarter Settlement Forecast，为客户提供定制化的7天预测，预测他们每天可能需要的结算金额。该服务利用历史结算量、季节性指标、宏观趋势、新冠疫情相关事件等异常事件和实时交易数据生成的信息，提供高质量的现金流出和流入预测。这些预测可以帮助发卡机构和收单机构优化财务和流动性管理流程，并协助金融机构对每种货币进行预测，以多种货币进行结算。 Smarter Settlement Forecast计划通过Visa分析平台(Visa Analytics Platform)上的订阅服务提供给符合条件的客户，从而帮助客户简化整合流程。Visa目前正在与三个客户进行此服务的试点，计划在今年晚些时候正式推出。 Smarter STIP可改善服务中断期间的支付体验 Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP)是于2020年8月推出的第一项VisaNet +AI功能，已经赢得了全球领先金融机构的青睐。Smarter STIP利用深度学习来帮助金融机构在服务中断期间提高交易授权，并可代表发卡机构生成批准或拒绝交易的明智决策，为消费者提供无障碍的Visa支付体验。 自发布以来，Smarter STIP在Visa开展业务的所有地区都引起了发卡机构的强烈兴趣。在短短两个月内，包括巴西联邦储蓄银行(Caixa Econômica Federal)和多哈银行(Doha Bank)在内的世界各地客户就已经将Smarter STIP添加到他们的Visa解决方案套件中。 卡塔尔多哈银行首席零售银行官Braik Ali H S Al – Marri先生表示：“作为我们的合作伙伴，Visa正在推动人工智能在支付领域的新创新。通过VisaNet +AI，我们可以利用这些创新，为我们的业务和客户带来新的价值。” 关于Visa Inc.

舊金山--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美國商業資訊)--Visa Inc. (NYSE: V)今天推出了VisaNet +AI，這是一套人工智慧(AI)技術支援的服務，旨在解決銀行、商店和消費者長期以來面臨的挑戰和痛點，包括管理帳戶餘額時面臨的延遲和混亂，以及金融機構日常結算的不可預測性。VisaNet +AI包含多項創新概念和新的加值服務，其中包括Visa Smarter Posting和Visa Smarter Settlement Forecast，以及去年8月推出的Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP)功能。這些創新功能利用Visa的高效能人工智慧平臺，幫助提高支付的可預測性、透明度和速度。 Visa執行副總裁兼產品長Jack Forestell表示：「我們的客戶、合作夥伴和持卡人期待我們提供可行的資料驅動見解，以便更好地管理他們的業務和金融生活，特別是在這個前所未有的時期。今天，我們推出了一系列利用AI技術的服務，讓消費者更方便地管理自己的帳戶，讓金融機構更方便地管理自己的業務。透過對AI基礎建設的投資，我們正在開發新穎的即時解決方案來解決複雜的問題。這只是我們利用人工智慧的預測能力來最佳化服務的開始。」 Smarter Posting有助於為消費者提供更高的透明度 當今自幼就熟悉資訊技術的消費者希望即時瞭解自己的財務狀況，因為他們越來越多地在行動和線上平臺上進行銀行業務。然而，消費者的支付體驗可能並不一致，與其他購物花費相比，有些購物需要更長的時間才能最終呈現在其餘額中。這種延遲可能會給持卡人帶來困惑或擔憂，導致客服中心工作量增加或造成潛在透支。 之所以會出現這種延遲，是因為收銀台即時授權的金額可能與最終從消費者帳戶中結算的金額不同。例如，當用餐者在餐廳添加小費時，或當發生涉及多種貨幣的跨境支付時，最終金額可能會發生變化。為了避免消費者在一次交易中看到多項費用而產生困惑，銀行通常會延遲登賬或延遲更新帳戶餘額，直到他們確定最終金額。 為了幫助發卡機構為持卡人營造更好的銀行體驗，Visa開發了Smarter Posting，該服務利用AI為每筆交易提供客製化評分，作為授權流程的一部分。Smarter Posting模型對交易細節和歷史資料進行分析，以預測交易金額與結算結果保持一致的可能性。在測試中，該模型在預測交易金額是否會保持一致方面的準確率達到了98%1，為金融機構提供更多的情報，例如透過臨時更新持卡人看到的帳戶餘額等方式營造更加一致的端對端支付體驗。 Visa Smarter Posting首先將於2021年4月在歐洲推出，並計畫在不久的將來向全球推廣。 Smarter Settlement Forecast使用預測模型來預測現金流需求 在每天的結算過程中，Visa推動數十億美元在200多個國家和地區的數千家機構之間以160種貨幣流動。這是支付週期的最後一步，在整個過程中，交易被匯總，收單機構和發卡機構之間的轉帳得以完成，商店的銷售額被記入帳戶。 這個過程要求金融機構策略性地分配資源，以便有足夠的流動性來滿足當天的結算量需求，而不至於過度分配資源，讓這些資源可以用於他們的其他業務領域。當今動盪的環境凸顯了財務團隊在預測每日交易量和做出策略決策方面所面臨的挑戰。 Visa開發了Smarter Settlement Forecast，為客戶提供客製化的7天預測，預測他們每天可能需要的結算金額。該服務利用歷史結算量、季節性指標、總體趨勢、新冠疫情相關事件等異常事件和即時交易資料產生的資訊，提供高品質的現金流出和流入預測。這些預測可以幫助發卡機構和收單機構最佳化財務和流動性管理流程，並協助金融機構對每種貨幣進行預測，以多種貨幣進行結算。 Smarter Settlement Forecast計畫透過Visa分析平臺(Visa Analytics Platform)上的訂閱服務提供給符合條件的客戶，從而幫助客戶簡化整合流程。Visa目前正在與三個客戶進行此服務的試點，計畫在今年稍晚正式推出。 Smarter STIP可改善服務中斷期間的支付體驗 Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing (Smarter STIP)是於2020年8月推出的第一項VisaNet +AI功能，已經贏得了全球領先金融機構的青睞。Smarter STIP利用深度學習來幫助金融機構在服務中斷期間提高交易授權，並可代表發卡機構產生核准或拒絕交易的明智決策，為消費者提供無障礙的Visa支付體驗。 自發布以來，Smarter STIP在Visa推展業務的所有地區都引起了發卡機構的強烈興趣。在短短兩個月內，包括巴西聯邦儲蓄銀行(Caixa Econômica Federal)和杜哈銀行(Doha Bank)在內的世界各地客戶就已經將Smarter STIP加入到他們的Visa解決方案套件中。 卡達杜哈銀行零售銀行長Braik Ali H S Al – Marri先生表示：「作為我們的合作夥伴，Visa正在推動人工智慧在支付領域的新創新。透過VisaNet +AI，我們可以利用這些創新，為我們的業務和客戶帶來新的價值。」 關於Visa Inc.

サンフランシスコ--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- ビザ（NYSE：V）は本日、AIを活用した一連のサービスであるVisaNet +AIを発表しました。これは、口座残高の管理にかかる遅れと混乱や、金融機関にとって日々の決済の予測が不可能であることなど、銀行、加盟店、消費者が抱える長年の課題と問題点に対処するものです。VisaNet +AIは、Visa Smarter PostingやVisa Smarter Settlement Forecast、昨年8月に発表された機能であるVisa Smarter Stand-In Processing（スマーターSTIP）といった、いくつかの革新的なコンセプトと新しい付加価値サービスで構成されています。これらのイノベーションはビザの高性能AIプラットフォームを活用し、支払いの予測可能性、透明性、速度の向上に寄与します。 ビザのエグゼクティブ・バイスプレジデント兼最高製品責任者のジャック・フォレステルは、次のように述べています。「当社のクライアント、パートナー、カード所有者は、特にこの前例がない時期に事業や生活の財政面の管理を改善するための実用的でデータに基づいた洞察を当社に期待しています。本日私たちは、消費者にとっては口座の管理を、金融機関にとってはビジネスの管理を今よりも容易にするAIを活用した一連のサービスを発表します。AIインフラストラクチャーへの投資によって、当社は複雑な問題に対する斬新なリアルタイムのソリューションを解き放ちます。これは、AIの予測力を使って私たちができることの始まりに過ぎません。」 Smarter Postingは消費者に提供される透明性の向上に寄与 今日のデジタル・ネイティブの消費者は、モバイルやオンラインのプラットフォームで銀行取引を利用することが増えており、自分たちの財政状況をリアルタイムで把握することを望んでいます。しかし、消費者にとって支払い体験は一貫性に欠けることがあり、購入が残高に反映されるまでの時間はさまざまです。この遅れによって、カード所有者に混乱や懸念が生じ、コールセンターの業務量の増加や、当座貸越につながる可能性があります。 この遅延は、店のレジでリアルタイムに承認される金額が最終的に消費者の口座から引き落とされる金額と異なる可能性があるために発生します。例えば、レストランによく行く人がレストランでチップを追加する時や、複数の通貨が関係する国境を越えた支払いが行われる時には、最終的な金額が変わります。消費者が1つの取引に複数の請求があるのを見て混乱するのを防ぐために、銀行が支払い記録の反映や口座残高の更新を、最終的な金額が確実になるまで遅らせることがよくあります。 イシュアーがカード所有者の銀行取引体験を向上させるサポートをするために、ビザは、承認プロセスの一環としてAIを使って各取引にカスタマイズされたスコアを出すサービスであるSmarter Postingを開発しました。Smarter Postingのモデルは、取引詳細と履歴データを分析し、清算を通じて取引金額が一定に保たれる可能性を予測します。テストでは、取引金額が安定しているかの予測において、モデルは98%の精度1を達成しています。これにより金融機関には追加の情報がもたらされ、例えばカード所有者が目にする口座残高を暫定的に更新することによって、一貫性の高いエンド・ツー・エンドの決済体験を提供することができます。 Visa Smarter Postingは、2021年4月からまずは欧州で利用可能となり、近い将来に世界に拡大されることが予定されています。 Smarter Settlement Forecastは予測モデリングを使ってキャッシュフローのニーズを予想 ビザは、日々の決済プロセスにおいて、200を超える国・地域で160種類の通貨で、数千もの機関を通じて数十億ドルの移動を可能にしています。これは支払いサイクルの最終段階であり、ここで取引が集約され、アクワイアラーとイシュアーの間で送金が進められて加盟店の口座に売り上げが入金されます。 このプロセスでは、金融機関がリソースを戦略的に割り当てて、事業の他の部分で活用できるリソースを過剰に割り当てることなくその日の決済高を満たすために十分な流動性を確保する必要があります。現在の不安定な環境の中で、財務チームが日々の決済高を予測して戦略的な決定を取る上で直面する課題が浮き彫りになっています。 ビザはクライアントに対し、各日に手元に必要となるであろう決済金額について、カスタマイズされた7日間の予測を提供するSmarter Settlement Forecastを開発しました。このサービスは、過去の決済高や季節の指標、マクロトレンド、COVID-19に関するもののような外れ値の事象、リアルタイムの取引データから生成された情報を使用し、資金流出と流入について質の高い予測を提供します。これらの予測はイシュアーとアクワイアラーが財務および流動性管理プロセスを最適化するために役立ち、金融機関に対しては各通貨の予測によって、複数の通貨での決済をサポートします。 Smarter Settlement Forecastは、ビザ・アナリティクス・プラットフォームでの加入を通じて適格なクライアントへの提供が予定されており、クライアントよる統合は簡単なものになります。ビザは今年後半に予定される正式な利用開始に先立って、現在クライアント3機関を対象に同サービスを試験的に実施しています。 スマーターSTIPは業務停止中の支払い体験の向上に貢献 Visa Smarter Stand-In Processing（スマーターSTIP）は、2020年8月にVisaNet +AIの中で最初に発表された機能であり、世界各地の主要金融機関に認められています。Smarter STIPは、ディープラーニングを用いて金融機関の業務停止中の取引承認を増加させるサポートをします。Smarter STIPは、情報に基づいてイシュアーの代わりに承認か拒否の決定を行い、消費者にスムーズなビザ支払い体験を提供します。 提供開始以降、Smarter STIPは全てのビザ地域を通じてイシュアーの強い関心を集めてきました。わずか2カ月間で、ブラジル連邦貯蓄銀行とドーハ銀行を含む世界中のクライアントが、自らの一連のビザ・ソリューションにSmarter STIPを加えています。 カタールのドーハ銀行のブライク・アリ・H・S・アール・マリ最高リテールバンキング責任者は、次のように述べています。「ビザは、支払いのためのAIの新イノベーションを推進するパートナーです。VisaNet +AIを通じて、私たちはこれらのイノベーションを活用し、事業と顧客のために新しい価値を推進することができます。」 ビザについて ビザ（NYSE：V）は、デジタル決済で世界をリードしています。その使命は、安全で信頼のおける革新的な決済ネットワークで世界を結び、消費者、企業、経済全体に利便性をもたらすことです。当社の高度な世界的処理ネットワークのVisaNetは、安全で信頼性の高い決済手段を世界で提供し、毎秒6万5000件を超える取引を処理する能力を備えています。当社の技術革新に対する献身は、端末を問わず誰でもどこででも利用できるデジタル・コマースの急速な成長を推進しています。世界規模でアナログからデジタルへの移行が進む今、ビザは当社のブランド、商品、人材、ネットワーク、スケールを活用して、商取引の新たな未来を切り開きます。詳細情報については、About Visa、visa.com/blog、@VisaNewsをご覧ください。 1承認と清算の金額がいつ一貫性を維持するかに関するモデル予測を比較した分析に基づくビザのデータ。分析は過去の1億5000万件の取引データ（2020年8月～9月）について実施。 本記者発表文の公式バージョンはオリジナル言語版です。翻訳言語版は、読者の便宜を図る目的で提供されたものであり、法的効力を持ちません。翻訳言語版を資料としてご利用になる際には、法的効力を有する唯一のバージョンであるオリジナル言語版と照らし合わせて頂くようお願い致します。"

Le présent communiqué de presse contient des déclarations prévisionnelles au sens de la loi américaine « Private Securities Litigation Reform Act » de 1995. Ces déclarations prévisionnelles sont généralement identifiées par l’usage du futur ou du conditionnel, ainsi que par des expressions telles que « prévoit de », « s’attendre à », et autres expressions similaires. Parmi les exemples de déclarations prévisionnelles figurent, sans toutefois s’y limiter, les déclarations que nous formulons concernant le calendrier et la probabilité de prendre des mesures liées à notre stratégie, nos projets et nos initiatives et objectifs climatiques futurs, ainsi que l’impact potentiel de nos actions. Par nature, les déclarations prévisionnelles : (i) n’ont de valeur qu’à la date où elles sont formulées, (ii) ne sont ni des énoncés de faits historiques, ni des garanties de performance future et (iii) sont assujetties à des risques, incertitudes, hypothèses et changements de circonstances qui sont difficiles à prévoir ou à quantifier. C'est pourquoi, les résultats réels pourraient différer sensiblement et défavorablement des déclarations prévisionnelles de Visa en raison d'une variété de facteurs, notamment ceux qui figurent dans notre Rapport annuel sur formulaire 10-K pour l'exercice financier clos le 30 septembre 2020 et nos autres rapports déposés auprès de la Securities and Exchange Commission des États-Unis. Le lecteur est donc prié de ne pas se fier outre mesure aux dites déclarations prévisionnelles.

Ciudad de México--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) anunció hoy que Visa B2B Connect ya entró en operación en México con CIBanco. Visa B2B Connect es una red abierta, innovadora e interoperable que les permite a los bancos y a sus clientes comerciales enviar y recibir pagos corporativos internacionales de empresa a empresa (B2B) de manera rápida, segura y con un bajo costo operativo. La red única basada en pagos sin tarjeta simplifica considerablemente los pagos corporativos internacionales al facilitar las transacciones del banco de origen directamente al banco beneficiario, habilitando una experiencia de extremo a extremo mejorada y fluida. Visa B2B Connect mejora los sistemas existentes de transferencias de fondos bilaterales. Por ejemplo, acelera de manera significativa la velocidad de liquidación de fondos, ya que en vez de tomar varios días, o hasta semanas, ahora con esta solución se pueden llevar a cabo en tan solo uno o dos días dependiendo del uso horario en la plaza de destino. La plataforma también aumenta drásticamente la visibilidad y previsibilidad del flujo de transacciones, permitiendo rastrear el estatus de los pagos desde el banco de origen hasta el banco de destino en tiempo casi real, mejorando así la precisión de las transacciones y permitiendo una conciliación más fácil. “El lanzamiento de Visa B2B Connect en México –el primer proyecto puesto en marcha para Visa en América Latina y el Caribe– marca un hito importante que nos ayudará a revolucionar la forma en que los pagos internacionales se efectúan en la región, habilitando el acceso a pagos internacionales de empresa a empresa más simples, transparentes y sin fricción”, dijo Juan Pablo Cuevas, jefe de Soluciones Comerciales de Visa América Latina y el Caribe. La seguridad y la protección mejoradas contra fraude son también características clave incorporadas en esta plataforma única, gracias a la función de identidad digital de Visa B2B Connect que tokeniza la información comercial confidencial de las corporaciones, como detalles bancarios y números de cuenta, con un identificador único para facilitar las transacciones en un ecosistema global, reduciendo así las oportunidades de fraude. Visa B2B Connect también supera las limitaciones de los sistemas de circuito cerrado, ya que la red puede trabajar (y es compatible) con otros rieles y redes de pago existentes. “Nos entusiasma ser el primer socio de negocios de Visa en la región que habilita este nuevo servicio de pagos revolucionario, que proporciona a nuestros clientes corporativos transacciones de negocio internacionales más rápidas, oportunas, seguras y controladas”, indicó Mario Maciel, CEO de CIBanco. “Con Visa B2B Connect estamos fortaleciendo nuestro enfoque innovador para cumplir con los altos estándares de un ambiente internacional que es cada vez más abierto, dinámico e interconectado”. El objetivo de Visa es ampliar la red a más bancos emisores en México y a lo largo de otros mercados en la región. Visa B2B Connect está disponible para implementación en 84 mercados alrededor del mundo, incluyendo América Latina y el Caribe. “Visa B2B Connect puede impulsar un valor sustancial y mayores eficiencias para nuestros bancos y sus clientes corporativos”, explicó Edward Domínguez, jefe de Visa B2B Connect en América Latina y el Caribe. “Ya hemos empezado a procesar transacciones en vivo en la nueva red realizadas para clientes comerciales de CIBanco.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, in collaboration with Visa, Caltrans, Cybersource, Littlepay, and SC Soft, Monterey-Salinas Transit (MST) became the first transit agency in California to offer bus riders a contactless payment option. As cities begin to reopen, public transportation will play a critical role in recovery, and contactless payments can help provide a safe and easy experience for riders and transit operators seeking limited physical touchpoints and interactions. MST riders can now simply tap their contactless credit, debit, prepaid card or payment-enabled device on readers in MST buses for an easy and secure way to travel, without needing to purchase or load a separate transit card or handle cash while boarding. Visa research shows that enabling tap to pay on transit systems like these can be good for economic recovery, bringing more than a 15% lift in transactions from merchants in surrounding neighborhoods1. MST is the fifth transit agency in the U.S. to accept tap to pay for fares, following Chicago, Miami, New York and Portland, OR. MST is also the first public transit system in the country that is located outside of a large urban area to introduce tap to pay fares – demonstrating contactless payments as a good fit for any size agency looking to enhance the customer experience. “Visa recognizes the importance of expanding eligibility and access to fare payment options that meet the needs of a diverse set of transit riders,” said Brian Cole, SVP and head of North America product, Visa. “This effort with MST and Caltrans illustrates how open, contactless payments can support innovative and equitable fare policies to benefit riders and transit operators across the state.” MST riders who tap will benefit from “fare capping” ensuring riders won’t pay more than $10.00 per day—as long as they pay with the same card or mobile wallet throughout the day. The tap to pay option on MST’s entire bus fleet is the first contactless payment demonstration of the California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP), a Caltrans-led initiative to make travel simpler and more cost-effective for the 40 million California residents, served by 300-plus transit agencies, who collectively take approximately 1.3 billion2 passenger trips annually. “We are committed to serving all of our riders and delivering new methods of ease and convenience,” said Carl Sedoryk, general manager and CEO, Monterey-Salinas Transit. “The availability of a contactless fare payment system means increased flexibility, and we are thrilled to be collaborating with Visa and Caltrans to bring the enhanced convenience and safety benefits of tap to pay to our community.” Bringing the MST Demonstration to Life Cybersource, a Visa solution, Littlepay, a transit-focused payments platform, and SC Soft, a transit ticketing and Automated Fare Collection specialist, have been critical in bringing the MST demonstration to life. Cybersource’s platform is powering the fast-to-market deployment of contactless solutions in the mass transit space, providing a full suite of payment and fraud management tools and an extensive network of partners and acquirers. Cybersource offers brand agnostic transit compliant processing solutions and enables easier implementation of digital payments for operators, while helping protect against fraud. Littlepay provides mass transit transaction processing, including the ability to cap fares and guarantee the best-value fare for frequent riders. SC Soft is a system integrator specializing in ticketing & Automated Fare Collection solutions for transit agencies around the world. “Cybersource looks forward to supporting Cal-ITP partners to improve transit access within communities throughout the state,” said Fernando Souza, Vice President, Cybersource. “There is a great sense of urgency among transit operators to adopt these solutions and we are committed to powering secure, seamless contactless solutions in a world where no contact, touchless experiences are here to stay.” “Removing barriers to transit ridership underscores what Cal-ITP is all about, and the launch of this contactless payment demonstration represents a significant step toward a simpler and more equitable public transit system throughout California,” said Caltrans Director Toks Omishakin. Adoption of contactless payments continues to grow in the U.S. as more consumers realize they can pay for the things they need with a simple and secure tap. In the US, one in 10 face to face Visa transactions are now done with a tap, more than a 2x increase since the beginning of the pandemic, showcasing increased consumer preference for fast, touch-free payment experiences.

Monterey-Salinas Transit bietet Fahrgästen als erster Dienst in Kalifornien die Option für Visa-Zahlungen mit Antippen
SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Seit heute ist Monterey-Salinas Transit (MST) in Zusammenarbeit mit Visa, Caltrans, Cybersource, Littlepay und SC Soft die erste Transitagentur in Kalifornien, die Busfahrgästen eine Option zum kontaktlosen Bezahlen anbietet. Die Städte öffnen sich wieder, und der öffentliche Nahverkehr wird eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Wiederherstellung der Normalität spielen. Kontaktloses Bezahlen kann zur Schaffung eines sicheren, einfachen Erlebnisses für Fahrgäste und Fahrer im Nahverkehr beitragen, die gerne wenige Flächen berühren und wenig physisch interagieren möchten. Die Fahrgäste von MST können jetzt einfach ihre kontaktlose Kredit-, Debit- oder Prepaid-Karte oder ihr zahlungsfähiges Gerät auf Lesegeräte in MST-Bussen tippen. So können sie auf einfache, sichere Weise reisen, ohne eine Extra-Fahrkarte zu kaufen oder zu laden oder während der Fahrt Bargeld zu benutzen. Studien von Visa zeigen, dass die Freischaltung von Zahlungen per Antippen in Nahverkehrssystemen wie diesem gut für die Erholung der Wirtschaft sein kann und eine Steigerung der Transaktionen um mehr als 15 % bei Händlern in den umliegenden Vierteln mit sich bringen kann1. MST ist nach Chicago, Miami, New York und Portland, Oregon die fünfte Transit-Agentur in den USA, die das Bezahlen von Fahrkarten per Antippen akzeptiert. MST ist zudem das erste öffentliche Nahverkehrssystem des Landes, das sich außerhalb eines städtischen Großraums befindet und das Bezahlen von Fahrkarten per Antippen einführt. Dies zeigt, dass sich kontaktloses Bezahlen gut für Agenturen jeder Größe eignet, die das Kundenerlebnis verbessern möchten. „Visa erkennt, wie wichtig es ist, die Möglichkeiten und den Zugang zu Zahlungsoptionen für Fahrkarten zu erweitern, die dem Bedarf verschiedenster Fahrgäste im Nahverkehr gerecht werden“, sagte Brian Cole, SVP und Leiter Produkte in Nordamerika bei Visa. „Dieses Projekt zusammen mit MST und Caltrans zeigt, wie offene, kontaktlose Zahlungen förderlich für innovative, gerechte Tarifstrategien sein können, die den Fahrgästen und Betreibern im Nahverkehr im gesamten Bundesstaat zugute kommen.“ MST-Fahrgäste, die das Antippen nutzen, werden von einem „Fahrpreisdeckel“ profitieren, der dafür sorgt, dass niemand mehr als 10,00 USD pro Tag bezahlt – wenn sie an dem Tag mit der gleichen Karte oder der gleichen mobilen Geldbörse zahlen. Die Option zum Bezahlen per Antippen in der gesamten Busflotte von MST ist die erste Demonstration von kontaktlosem Bezahlen im California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP), einer Initiative von Caltrans, mit der das Reisen für die 40 Millionen Einwohner Kaliforniens einfacher und kosteneffektiver werden soll. Über 300 Transitagenturen, die zusammen jährlich etwa 1,3 Milliarden2 Personenfahrten übernehmen, tragen dazu bei. „Wir fühlen uns verpflichtet, alle unsere Fahrgäste zu bedienen und neue Methoden für Komfort und bequeme Abläufe bereitzustellen“, sagte Carl Sedoryk, General Manager und CEO bei Monterey-Salinas Transit. „Die Verfügbarkeit eines Systems für das kontaktlose Bezahlen von Fahrkarten bringt mehr Flexibilität mit sich, und wir freuen uns sehr, dass wir mit Visa und Caltrans zusammenarbeiten und unserer Community die Vorteile von erhöhtem Komfort und mehr Sicherheit durch das Zahlen per Antippen eröffnen können.“ Die MST-Demonstration wird zum Leben erweckt Cybersource, eine Visa-Lösung, Littlepay, eine auf den Nahverkehr spezialisierte Zahlungsplattform, und SC Soft, ein Spezialist für Fahrkarten im Nahverkehr und den automatischen Einzug von Fahrpreisen, haben eine wesentliche Rolle dabei gespielt, dass die MST-Demonstration zum Leben erweckt wurde. Die Plattform von Cybersource unterstützt die schnelle Markteinführung kontaktloser Lösungen im Bereich Massenverkehrsmittel. Sie bietet eine vollständige Suite von Werkzeugen für Zahlungs- und Betrugsmanagement und unterhält ein umfassendes Netzwerk aus Partnern und Acquirern. Cybersource bietet markenunabhängige, nahverkehrskonforme Lösungen für die Abwicklung an, ermöglicht die einfachere Implementierung digitaler Zahlungen für die Betreiber und trägt gleichzeitig zum Schutz vor Betrug bei. Littlepay übernimmt die Abwicklung von Transaktionen für Massenverkehrsmittel, einschließlich der Möglichkeit, Fahrpreise zu deckeln und einen wertoptimierten Fahrpreis für Vielfahrer zu garantieren. SC Soft ist ein Systemintegrator, der auf Lösungen für Fahrkartenverkauf und den automatischen Einzug von Fahrpreisen für Transitagenturen auf der ganzen Welt spezialisiert ist. „Cybersource freut sich darauf, die Partner von Cal-ITP bei der Verbesserung des Zugangs zum Nahverkehr in Communitys im gesamten Bundesstaat zu unterstützen“, sagte Fernando Souza, Vice President von Cybersource. „Unter den Betreibern des öffentlichen Nahverkehrs besteht großer Handlungsdruck, diese Lösungen einzuführen, und wir fühlen uns dazu verpflichtet, sichere, nahtlose kontaktlose Lösungen in einer Welt zu unterstützen, in der kontakt- und berührungslose Optionen dauerhaft verfügbar sein werden.“ „Mit der Beseitigung von Hindernissen bei der Nutzung des Nahverkehrs wird unterstrichen, worum es Cal-ITP geht. Der Beginn dieser Demonstration kontaktloser Zahlungen bedeutet einen signifikanten Schritt hin zu einem einfacheren, gerechteren System des öffentlichen Nahverkehrs in ganz Kalifornien“, sagte Toks Omishakin, Director von Caltrans. Die Einführung kontaktloser Zahlungen geht in den USA voran, da immer mehr Verbraucher feststellen, dass sie für ihren Bedarf mit einem einfachen, sicheren Antippen bezahlen können. In den USA erfolgt bereits eine von zehn persönlichen Visa-Transaktionen per Antippen. Das ist eine Steigerung um mehr als das Doppelte seit Beginn der Pandemie und zeigt eine gestiegene Präferenz der Verbraucher für schnelle, berührungsfreie Zahlungsoptionen. Über Visa Inc. Visa Inc.

Monterey-Salinas Transit devient la 1ère régie de Californie à offrir aux passagers la possibilité du paiement sans contact avec Visa
SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aujourd'hui, en collaboration avec Visa, Caltrans, Cybersource, Littlepay, et SC Soft, Monterey-Salinas Transit (MST) est devenue la première régie de transports en Californie à proposer aux passagers des bus la possibilité du paiement sans contact. À l'heure où les villes débutent leur réouverture, les transports publics sont voués à jouer un rôle essentiel dans la reprise, et les paiements sans contact peuvent contribuer à une expérience sûre et facile pour les passagers et les opérateurs de transports souhaitant réduire les interactions et les contacts physiques. Les passagers de MST peuvent désormais tout simplement appliquer leur carte de crédit, carte de débit, carte prépayée ou appareil de paiement sans contact sur les lecteurs installés dans les bus MST pour bénéficier d'une expérience de transport facile et sûre, sans avoir à acheter ou à recharger une carte de transports distincte, ni à manipuler d'argent liquide au moment de monter à bord. Les recherches de Visa démontrent que la possibilité du paiement sans contact dans les transports publics tels que le bus peut se révéler bénéfique pour la reprise économique, en générant une augmentation de 15 % des transactions pour les commerçants des quartiers environnants1. MST est la cinquième régie de transports aux États-Unis à accepter le paiement sans contact pour les tickets de bus, après Chicago, New York et Portland, dans l'Oregon. MST est également la première régie publique de transports du pays à permettre le paiement sans contact des tickets de bus, parmi les régies de transports situées en dehors des grandes zones urbaines – ce qui démontre que le paiement sans contact est adapté aux agences de toutes tailles désireuses d'améliorer l'expérience client. « Visa comprend l'importance d'un élargissement de l'admissibilité et de l'accès aux options de paiement des tickets de bus, afin de répondre aux besoins d'un ensemble divers de passagers des transports en commun », a déclaré Brian Cole, vice-président principal et directeur produit Amérique du Nord chez Visa. « Cet effort aux côtés de MST et Caltrans illustre combien les paiements ouverts sans contact peuvent soutenir les politiques innovantes et équitables concernant les tickets de bus, bénéficiant ainsi aux passagers des transports en commun et aux opérateurs de régies de transports dans l'ensemble de l'état. » Les passagers de MST utilisant le paiement sans contact bénéficieront d'un plafonnement du prix des tickets de bus, de sorte qu'ils ne paieront jamais plus de 10,00 USD par jour – à condition de payer avec la même carte ou le même portefeuille mobile au cours de la journée. L'option du paiement sans contact sur l'ensemble de la régie de bus MST constitue la première expérimentation de paiement sans contact de l'initiative California Integrated Travel Project (Cal-ITP), menée par Caltrans pour veiller à ce que les déplacements soient plus simples et plus rentables pour les 40 millions d'habitants de la Californie, servis par plus de 300 régies de transports, qui assurent chaque année environ 1,3 milliard2 de trajets pour les passagers. « Nous avons pour vocation de servir tous nos passagers, ainsi que de proposer de nouvelles méthodes simples et pratiques », a déclaré Carl Sedoryk, président-directeur général de Monterey-Salinas Transit. « La possibilité du paiement sans contact pour les tickets de bus est synonyme de plus grande souplesse, et nous sommes heureux de collaborer avec Visa et Caltrans pour apporter ces avantages de commodité et de sécurité à notre communauté grâce au paiement sans contact. » Donner vie à l'expérimentation de MST Cybersource, une solution Visa, Littlepay, une plateforme de paiement axée sur les transports en commun, et SC Soft, un spécialiste de la collecte des tickets de transports et de la perception automatisée des droits de transport, ont joué un rôle essentiel pour donner vie à l'expérimentation de MST. La plateforme de Cybersource propulse le déploiement rapide sur le marché de solutions sans contact dans le domaine des transports en commun, en proposant une gamme complète d'outils de gestion des paiements et de la fraude, ainsi qu'un vaste réseau de partenaires et d'acquéreurs. Cybersource offre des solutions de traitement des transports en commun neutres vis à vis de marques, et permet une mise en place plus facile des paiements numériques pour les opérateurs, tout en contribuant à lutter contre la fraude. Littlepay assure le traitement des transactions liées aux transports en commun, notamment la capacité de plafonner le coût des tickets de bus et de garantir des prix attractifs pour les passagers fréquents. SC Soft est un intégrateur de systèmes spécialisé dans les solutions de billetterie et de perception automatisée des droits de transport pour les régies de transports du monde entier. « Cybersource est impatiente de soutenir les partenaires de l'initiative Cal-ITP, afin d'améliorer l'accès aux transports en commun au sein des communautés de l'état », a déclaré Fernando Souza, vice-président de Cybersource. « Le sentiment d'urgence est palpable parmi les opérateurs de régies de transports concernant l'adoption de ces solutions, et nous avons pour vocation de fournir des solutions sans contact sécurisées et fluides dans un monde où les expériences sans contact sont vouées à perdurer. » « La suppression des barrières aux transports en commun souligne toute la signification de l'initiative Cal-ITP, et le lancement de cette expérimentation de paiement sans contact constitue une étape majeure en direction d'un système de transports publics plus simple et plus équitable partout en Californie », a déclaré Toks Omishakin, directeur de Caltrans. L'adoption du paiement sans contact ne cesse de se développer aux États-Unis, de plus en plus de clients réalisant qu'il leur suffit d'un geste sans contact simple et sécurisé pour payer ce dont ils ont besoin. Aux États-Unis, une transaction Visa physique sur 10 est aujourd'hui effectuée sans contact, soit une multiplication par plus de 2 depuis le début de la pandémie, ce qui démontre la préférence croissante des consommateurs pour des expériences de paiement rapides et sans contact. À propos de Visa Inc. Visa Inc. (NYSE : V) est le leader mondial des paiements numériques. Notre mission consiste à relier le monde grâce au réseau de paiement le plus innovant, le plus fiable et le plus sûr, et ainsi à permettre aux personnes, aux entreprises et aux économies de prospérer.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V) today launched the Visa U.S. Spending Momentum Index (SMI), an economic indicator designed to be a timely gauge of the health of consumer spending. The Visa SMI delivers insight into what drives upturns and downturns in spending by measuring the breadth of the momentum supporting these trends. “This past year underscores the importance of looking not only at how much is being spent, but also how many consumers are spending,” said Wayne Best, Visa’s Chief Economist. “What made the most recent downturn and now recovery so different than any previous business cycle was how the pandemic impacted the ability as much as the willingness of consumers to spend. Understanding how many consumers are feeling sufficiently confident and financially secure to spend more is at the heart of what the Visa SMI does.” In April 2021, the Visa SMI hit 136.0, confirming that the U.S. economic recovery remains on firm ground. At its current level, the Visa SMI implies that 65 percent of consumers are now spending more than they did a year ago, while only 35 percent are spending the same or less. Even compared to April 2019, which was not affected by the pandemic and lockdowns, 51 percent of consumers are spending more. The SMI reached its lowest level in April 2020 at 70.5 and did not pass 100 again until October, indicating that many people were still unable to participate in the recovery for much of 2020. While the downturn this time was deeper, the recovery has been six months faster than the recession of 2008-2009. “The SMI’s latest strong reading provides evidence that consumer confidence is building as the pace of vaccinations increase and restrictions are eased across the country,” added Wayne Best. “Signs of economic recovery, additional stimulus payments and optimism that the pandemic is waning are contributing to stronger spending compared to last year and even within recent months."" The gains in spending momentum, however, remain uneven. The SMI for cities that experienced the greatest job losses in April 2020 has been on average 1.5 points lower over the last year than cities where job losses were more limited, indicating that fewer consumers were able to join the recovery where joblessness was higher. The SMI for Chicago, one of the hardest hit cities in terms of job losses, has averaged 100.5 over the last 12 months, compared to a city with fewer job losses such as Atlanta, where the SMI was 104.0 over the same time frame. The gap between the two has narrowed within the last three months, helped in part by Chicago’s progress in vaccinating a greater share of its residents. Previously only available to Visa clients, Visa is now publishing components of the SMI on a monthly basis for the general public, in part to help track economic recovery progress. The SMI builds on Visa’s commitment to powering commerce by providing tools and insights to uplift people, businesses and economies everywhere. About the Visa SMI The Visa SMI is based on a sample of aggregated, depersonalized VisaNet data. Visa adjusts this data through proprietary methods to exclude factors that do not reflect spending momentum. The resulting sample data is then aggregated using a diffusion index framework where index values are scored from 0 to 200. When the Visa SMI rises above 100, the consumer spending momentum is strengthening and when it falls below 100, the spending momentum is weakening as fewer consumers are spending more relative to the previous year. The index is adjusted for day of week, month, holidays, and broad annual trends, and these seasonal adjustments are subject to revision each year. The Visa SMI does not take into account the volume of payments nor does it rely on all Visa-branded credentials, and therefore does not reflect Visa operational or financial performance. It is intended for informational purposes only and is offered on an “as is” basis without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. Each SMI report is as of the publication date. Eligible Visa clients in the U.S may access more detailed and customized insights at the national, regional and local spending level, including spending on the main categories of goods and services.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Inviting the world to ‘Meet Visa,‘ the global payments technology company today unveiled the initial phase of its brand evolution spotlighting the diverse capabilities of its network and commitment to enabling global economic inclusion. Aligned closely with the company’s business strategy, this phase includes the debut of a dynamic global marketing campaign and a preview of a modernized look for Visa’s iconic brand. More than 60 years ago, when Visa was founded, few could imagine a world beyond cash and checks. Visa’s founding vision to introduce a more secure, reliable and convenient currency in digital form began with a simple question: what if money became fully electronic? Today, Visa continues to anticipate the future of digital commerce, providing access through its secure global network working for everyone, everywhere. “People think they ‘know’ Visa. Consumers and businesses trust the power of those four letters and see it when they open their wallet, pay a vendor, walk into a store or check out online. What they don’t see is how those four letters operate the most dynamic network of people, partnerships and products,” said Lynne Biggar, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Marketing Officer, Visa. “We are on a mission to ensure that Visa is seen as more than a credit card company and understood as a trusted network that drives commerce forward.” While Visa continues to shape the physical and digital credit or debit card transaction, it also increasingly sits at the center of enabling money movement. A company built on access to economic inclusion, the Visa network connects 3.6 billion credentials, over 70 million merchant locations, tens of thousands of partners and powers more than $11 trillion in total volume annually. Over the last five years alone, Visa has invested $9 billion in technology to shape the future of commerce, delivering a differentiated set of products, services and benefits.1 Visa’s network helps enable a gig-worker with the flexibility to get paid in real time, facilitates person to person payments that can send and receive money between billions of cards and accounts worldwide, and large corporate payments to be made more effortlessly across borders, as just a few examples. Illustrating the scope of Visa’s capabilities, initial elements of Visa’s brand evolution include: ‘Meet Visa’ films spotlight the power of the network. Developed by Visa’s global creative agency of record, award-winning Wieden+Kennedy, Visa is unveiling a short film directed by Malik Hassan Sayeed that invites the world to ‘Meet Visa,’ a network working for everyone. Complementing this introductory film is a series of shorter digital films and photography that showcase the breadth of the Visa network working to provide access and advancing commerce for real people in real places around the world. Brought to life by some of the best and most diverse creative talent including Sayeed, Visa also worked with photographer Camilla Falquez and Argentinian directing team Pantera & Co. – Brian Kazez, Pato Martinez and Francisco Canton – to vividly capture moments such as: Finding flexibility in how to get paid Connecting local merchants to global sellers Working on a future where crypto can buy cool things Helping turn side jobs into global sensations New Visa brand identity symbolizes change. Visa has long stood for trust, security, acceptance and inclusion. These core values, in addition to the goal of enabling access for everyone to participate in the global economy, will be expressed through a modernized, dynamic visual brand identity, built in partnership with leading global brand design firm Mucho. The ‘Meet Visa’ campaign shares an initial glimpse into the evolved visual brand identity launching later this year, featuring refreshed colors for digital impact, a custom font created for optimal digital experiences and an updated brand symbol designed to express the purpose behind the organization. Over the course of 2021, Visa’s new brand identity will become visible in all 200+ countries and territories Visa operates in, cutting across the company’s primary business strategy encompassing: Consumer payments, focusing on expanding access and moving the $17 trillion spent in cash and checks globally to digital payments. New payment flows including cross-border person-to-person payments and a range of value-added services that help businesses of all sizes navigate today’s landscape; identify new growth opportunities; and maintain our mission of making Visa the most secure, resilient and reliable network. A diversity of offerings and solutions through burgeoning partnerships with fintechs and established brands, relationships with governments around the world and innovative technology built for the future. “We are capturing the bold ambition of Visa with this brand evolution as a way to express what we stand for and what we strive for,” continued Biggar. “With the world reopening and with money increasingly moving in new ways, there’s no better time to showcase the work we do and the impact a purpose-driven brand with Visa’s scale can have to enable individuals, businesses and economies to thrive.” For more information on “Meet Visa,” visit https://usa.visa.com/our-purpose/leading-by-example.html.

LONDON & SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V) today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Currencycloud, a global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments. The acquisition builds on an existing strategic partnership between the two companies and values Currencycloud at £700 million, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. The financial consideration will be reduced by the outstanding equity of Currencycloud that Visa already owns. Currencycloud’s cloud-based platform offers a broad set of APIs enabling banks and financial services providers to offer currency exchange services, including real-time notifications on foreign exchange transactions, multi-currency wallets, and virtual account management. The Currencycloud platform supports nearly 500 banking and technology clients with reach in over 180 countries.

Currencycloud will accelerate the time-to-market and improve payment transparency for clients looking to offer flexible, digital-first, international payment services that provide better visibility and control to consumers and businesses around the world. Cross-border payments have seen significant growth due to rising demand from businesses of all sizes to engage in international trade. A recent study revealed that 43% of all small businesses conducted international trade in 2020.1 The addition of Currencycloud’s capabilities to Visa’s network will widen access to innovative international payment products that help businesses meet their cross-border needs. “The acquisition of Currencycloud is another example of Visa executing on our network of networks strategy to facilitate global money movement,” said Colleen Ostrowski, Visa’s Global Treasurer. “Consumers and businesses increasingly expect transparency, speed and simplicity when making or receiving international payments. With our acquisition of Currencycloud, we can support our clients and partners to further reduce the pain points of cross-border payments and develop great user experiences for their customers.” “At Currencycloud, we’ve always strived to deliver a better tomorrow for all, from the smallest start-up to the global multi-nationals. Re-imagining how money flows around the global economy just got more exciting as we join Visa,” said Mike Laven, Chief Executive Officer, Currencycloud. “The combination of Currencycloud’s fintech expertise and Visa’s network will enable us to deliver greater customer value to the businesses moving money across borders.” Currencycloud will continue their operations from their headquarters in London and will retain their current management team.

Déclarations prévisionnelles Le présent communiqué de presse contient des déclarations prévisionnelles au sens de la loi américaine « Private Securities Litigation Reform Act » de 1995. Ces déclarations prévisionnelles sont généralement identifiées par l’usage du futur, ainsi que par des expressions, telles que « s’attendre à » et autres expressions similaires. Parmi les exemples de déclarations prévisionnelles, il convient de citer, sans que cette liste soit limitative, les déclarations que nous faisons concernant le calendrier et la probabilité de la clôture, le succès futur de Currencycloud, l’impact de l’acquisition sur la croissance de Visa, ainsi que les autres avantages attendus pour Visa, les institutions financières et les consommateurs. Par nature, les déclarations prévisionnelles : (i) n’ont de valeur qu’à la date où elles sont formulées, (ii) ne sont ni des énoncés de faits historiques, ni des garanties de performance future et (iii) sont assujetties à des risques, incertitudes, hypothèses et changements de circonstances qui sont difficiles à prévoir ou à quantifier. Par conséquent, les résultats réels pourraient différer de façon significative et défavorable par rapport aux déclarations prévisionnelles de Visa, et ce en raison de divers facteurs, notamment : le calendrier et le résultat du processus d’approbation réglementaire, les changements au sein du paysage réglementaire et concurrentiel, les incidents de cybersécurité, la vitesse et le succès de l’intégration, ainsi que divers autres facteurs, y compris ceux mentionnés dans notre rapport annuel sur formulaire 10-K pour l’exercice clos le 30 septembre 2020 et dans nos autres dépôts auprès de la Securities and Exchange Commission des États-Unis. Le lecteur est donc prié de ne pas se fier outre mesure aux dites déclarations prévisionnelles. Sauf dans les cas où la loi l’exigerait, Visa Inc. ne prévoit nullement de mettre à jour ou de réviser ses déclarations prévisionnelles quelles qu’elles soient, en réponse à de nouvelles informations, à des événements futurs ou pour d’autres raisons. Le texte du communiqué issu d’une traduction ne doit d’aucune manière être considéré comme officiel. La seule version du communiqué qui fasse foi est celle du communiqué dans sa langue d’origine. La traduction devra toujours être confrontée au texte source, qui fera jurisprudence."

MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today Visa announced a new milestone for its digital solutions in Latin America and the Caribbean, as of June 2021, the company reached 25% contactless adoption in the region, which means one out of every four face-to-face transactions is now contactless. There are also five countries above the 50% adoption threshold: Chile, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, and Bermuda – and markets like Peru and Colombia follow suit with more than 40% contactless penetration. Consumer preference is clearly a result of contactless payments enabling a fast, convenient, safe and secure experience without the need for consumers to touch the checkout terminal. “We embarked on this contactless transformation journey back in 2018, because we truly believed migrating to contactless and its underlying technology had the power to be a catalyst for the next generation of payments in our region,” said Ricardo Tafur, Vice President of Consumer Products for Visa Latin America and the Caribbean. “The pandemic certainly resulted in an acceleration of our efforts that were already underway, and from June 2019 to June 2021, we moved from 4% to 25% face-to-face contactless penetration in our region – all of us at Visa feel great about this accomplishment.” Across the Latin America and Caribbean region, consumers and businesses alike have embraced contactless payments because of their speed and convenience. But convenience is not the only factor for the popularity; contactless cards are also secure and provide strong protection against fraud. Using the same secure technology as EMV® Chip, contactless cards are extremely effective in preventing counterfeit fraud by using a one-time use code that prevents compromised data from being re-used for fraud. In fact, contactless cards experience among the lowest fraud rates of any type of payment—significantly lower than magnetic stripe cards and comparable to conventional chip cards. As the world experienced an unprecedented shift toward digital commerce over the last year, tokenization is becoming one of the most effective ways to avoid fraud and allow for more secure and easy digital payment experiences. This invisible technology replaces sensitive card account details with a digital identifier, or ""tokens” that are more protected against fraudsters. So, whether a consumer is paying with a contactless card, digital wallet or wearable, Visa’s security layers are protecting the underlying transaction every step of the way. Visa will continue to work closely with bank, merchant, government and fintech partners in the region to build on this momentum and continue to drive adoption of contactless payments in the region, especially in new and niche sectors like urban mobility for instance. As a company Visa remains committed to its core mission to connect the world to enable individuals, businesses, and economies to thrive. About Visa Inc. Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) is the world’s leader in digital payments. Our mission is to connect the world through the most innovative, reliable and secure payment network - enabling individuals, businesses and economies to thrive.

MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hoy Visa anunció un nuevo hito para sus soluciones digitales en América Latina y el Caribe: desde junio del 2021 la compañía ha alcanzado el 25% de adopción de la tecnología sin contacto en la región, lo que significa que una de cada cuatro transacciones presenciales ya se realiza con la tecnología de pagos sin contacto. También hay cinco países que superan el umbral de adopción del 50%: Chile, Costa Rica, Panamá, Guatemala y Bermudas. Mercados como Perú y Colombia les siguen con más del 40% de penetración de la tecnología sin contacto. La preferencia de los consumidores se debe claramente al hecho de que los pagos sin contacto facilitan una experiencia rápida, conveniente y segura, sin necesidad de que los consumidores toquen la terminal de pago. “Nos embarcamos en este proceso de transformación hacia los pagos sin contacto hace unos años en el 2018, porque realmente creíamos que la migración a los pagos sin contacto y su tecnología subyacente tenía el poder de ser un catalizador para la próxima generación de pagos en nuestra región”, dijo Ricardo Tafur, vicepresidente de Productos de Consumo de Visa América Latina y el Caribe. “La pandemia ciertamente provocó una aceleración de nuestros esfuerzos, que ya estaban en marcha, y de junio del 2019 a junio del 2021 pasamos del 4% al 25% de penetración de pagos sin contacto en el total de pagos realizados en persona en nuestra región; todos en Visa nos sentimos orgullosos de este logro”. En toda la región de América Latina y el Caribe tanto los consumidores como los comercios han adoptado los pagos sin contacto por su rapidez y conveniencia. Pero la conveniencia no es el único factor que lleva a su adopción: las tarjetas sin contacto también son seguras y proporcionan una fuerte protección contra el fraude. Usando la misma tecnología segura que el Chip EMV®, las tarjetas sin contacto son sumamente eficaces en prevenir el fraude por falsificación al utilizar un código de un solo uso que evita que si hubiera datos comprometidos puedan ser usados de nuevo para cometer fraude. De hecho, entre los diversos tipos de pago, las tarjetas sin contacto tienen algunos de los índices de fraude más bajos, significativamente más bajos que el índice de las tarjetas de banda magnética y comparables al índice de las tarjetas convencionales con chip. A medida que el mundo experimentó un cambio sin precedentes hacia el comercio digital en el último año, la tokenización se está convirtiendo en una de las formas más eficaces de evitar el fraude y permitir experiencias de pago digital más seguras y fáciles. Esta tecnología invisible sustituye los datos sensibles de la cuenta de una tarjeta por un identificador digital, o “token”, ya que los tokens ofrecen más protección contra los estafadores. Así pues, tanto si un consumidor paga con una tarjeta sin contacto, una billetera digital o un wearable, las capas de seguridad de Visa protegen la transacción subyacente en todo momento. Visa continuará trabajando con sus socios en América Latina y el Caribe –bancos, comercios, gobiernos y empresas Fintech– para aprovechar este impulso y seguir promoviendo la adopción de los pagos sin contacto en la región, especialmente en sectores nuevos y de nicho como la movilidad urbana, por ejemplo. Como compañía, mantenemos el compromiso con la misión central de conectar al mundo para ayudar a que personas, comercios y economías puedan prosperar. Acerca de Visa Inc. Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) es la compañía líder mundial en pagos digitales. Nuestra misión es conectar al mundo con la red de pagos más innovadora, confiable y segura, para ayudar a que individuos, comercios y economías puedan prosperar.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V) today announced that the U.S. Spending Momentum Index (SMI) was 108.5 in September (seasonally adjusted), down 1.1 points from August. With the SMI reading still above 100, this signals that more consumers are still spending more than they did a year ago. By category, the SMI for discretionary purchases fell 0.8 points from the previous month to 105.0. The SMI for non-discretionary purchases fell 0.5 points to 99.6, marking a contraction in spending momentum. The SMI slowed the most in the Northeast, falling 2.7 points. The Midwest and South also slowed for the month, with both declining 0.3 points from August’s levels. Spending momentum rose a slight 0.1 points in the West, to 111.3, the strongest reading among the four regions. “This month’s SMI reading reinforces our view that consumer spending was impacted by the Delta variant,” said Wayne Best, Visa’s Chief Economist. “We still expect spending to rebound in the fourth quarter as virus concerns begin to ease and consumers turn their attention towards holiday spending.” About the Visa SMI The Visa SMI is an economic indicator of the health of consumer spending. The SMI provides insight into what drives upturns and downturns in spending by measuring the breadth of the momentum supporting these trends. The Visa SMI is based on a sample of aggregated, depersonalized VisaNet data. Visa adjusts this data through proprietary methods to exclude factors that do not reflect spending momentum. The resulting sample data is then aggregated using a diffusion index framework where index values are scored from 0 to 200. When the Visa SMI rises above 100, the consumer spending momentum is strengthening and when it falls below 100, the spending momentum is weakening as fewer consumers are spending more relative to the previous year. The index is adjusted for day of week, month, holidays, and broad annual trends, and these seasonal adjustments are subject to revision each year. The Visa SMI does not take into account the volume of payments; nor does it rely on all Visa-branded credentials, and therefore does not reflect Visa operational or financial performance. It is intended for informational purposes only and is offered on an “as is” basis without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. Each SMI report is as of the publication date. Eligible Visa clients in the U.S. may access more detailed and customized insights at the national, regional and local spending level, including spending on the main categories of goods and services.

悉尼--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美国商业资讯)--全球数字支付领域领军企业Visa (NYSE: V)今日宣布，公司携手澳大利亚超大型金融机构澳新银行(ANZ)及商户支付服务提供商Quest，在澳大利亚拓展Visa Installments服务。Visa解决方案能够让澳大利亚购物者通过其现有的ANZ信用卡，在结账时无需额外的步骤便可享用备受欢迎的“先买后付”(BNPL)消费金融服务。 早在2017年，Visa的金融科技计划便开始助力全球分期还款业务的增长。借助Visa Installments Solution，Visa如今将为已经存在于合格消费者的钱包和手机中的卡片带来BNPL消费金融服务的灵活性，以便他们在店内或在线结账时使用。 Visa Installments Solution为Visa网络内的发卡机构和收单机构提供基础技术，以向其客户提供BNPL功能。这意味着金融机构可利用信用卡持卡人已经获批的信用额度，以任何适用于其客户的方式，为他们添加BNPL这项特色服务。同样，Visa网络内的收单机构亦可以激活这一功能，支持所有接受Visa支付的零售商进行分期还款。这一解决方案最初于2019年试运行，目前已经拓展至美国、加拿大、马来西亚、俄罗斯以及现在的澳大利亚。 当符合条件的购物者在店内终端或线上参与商户店面购物使用其ANZ Visa信用卡时，他们可于购物过程中在屏幕上选择还款条款。领先的商户支付科技提供商Quest将与Visa合作，让商家能够快速、无缝地接受Visa Installments——拥有整合了Quest POS机软件的商户无需更改任何软件便可启用这一解决方案。 借助Visa Installments Solution，参与这一服务的出借人可提供更加灵活的偿还计划——从3个月到24个月不等，在某些情况下没有利息，而客户可以在其现有的银行应用中直接查看其分期还款的购物清单、余额和偿还信息。 该解决方案势将受到澳大利亚消费者的欢迎，最近的Visa调查发现，90%的参与者表示很有可能使用其发卡行提供的分期还款方案，85%的受访者称分期还款将改善自己与其发卡服务商之间的关系1。 Visa澳大利亚、新西兰和南太平洋集团地区经理Julian Potter表示：“在澳大利亚，通过消费者现有可信的金融机构提供BNPL消费金融服务存在着大量的需求。我们十分自豪能够就Visa Installment的首次推出，与我们的长期合作伙伴ANZ携手合作。Visa Installments完全是在网络层从零开始打造，将被部署于实体店面以及各大电子商务渠道，而且消费者或企业无需任何新措施。如今，澳大利亚信用卡也可以享受‘先买后付’服务了。” ANZ银行卡与个人贷款业务负责人Mike Shurlin表示：“我们始终在寻找能给我们的客户带来真正价值的产品和服务，能够进行分期还款是众多客户想要的一项重要功能。Visa Installments满足有关该服务的灵活性、安全性和便利性的所有要求，能够让我们为信用卡客户提供更多可选择性，并打造更好的体验。” Shurlin先生还表示：“在过去，我们已经与Visa就多个客户解决方案进行了合作，包括广泛系列的移动支付和忠诚度解决方案，而且我们拥有共同的专注点：为我们的客户提供简单、灵活和安全的支付服务。我们期待与Visa合作，为客户奉上这一令人振奋的新支付方案。” Quest中小企业与替代支付服务负责人Luke Fuller表示：“Quest十分高兴与Visa合作，通过我们值得信赖的支付终端系列，提供分期还款服务，而这些终端已经得到了众多澳大利亚知名零售品牌的采用。在我们的全渠道支付门户解决方案采用这一服务之后，各大零售商将能够在线上和实体店为其客户提供分期还款选项。” 关于Visa Inc.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As consumer demand for 'Buy Now, Pay Later' (BNPL) solutions continues to grow, Visa (NYSE: V) today announced a growing list of issuers, acquirers and fintechs that are leveraging Visa’s technology — both its network-based Visa Installments Solution and its longstanding fintech solutions — to bring ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ options to their customers. A recent Visa study found that nearly half of all global consumers (42%) expressed interest in installment financing that is offered on their existing credit card or one they could apply for.1 To help partners meet this demand, Visa Installments Solution is being deployed globally to make issuer-offered BNPL options available in-store and across ecommerce channels. With the network-based solution, financial institutions can add BNPL as a customized feature for credit card holders, on their already approved credit lines. And likewise, acquirers on the network can activate the ability to enable installments for any of their retailers that accept Visa. First launched as a pilot in 2019, the solution has expanded to Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Russia and the U.S. In North America, Visa is collaborating with Canada’s Moneris, and working with CIBC, Commerce Bank, Desjardins Group (Desjardins), Equinox Payments, i2c, ScotiaBank and Versapay. In Asia Pacific, following the recent launch with HSBC, Visa is rolling out installment programs with ANZ, GHL Systems Malaysia and Quest Payment Systems. And in Russia, Visa has partnered with Home Credit Bank and Russian Standard Bank. Visa is also working with Cybersource, FIS, Global Payments and TSYS, a Global Payments company, in several markets across the globe to enable the Visa Installments Solution. The global rollout of Visa Installments Solution complements Visa’s existing support of today’s leading BNPL fintechs, including: Afterpay, ChargeAfter, Klarna, Paidy, Sezzle, SplitIt and Zip. Since 2017, Visa’s fintech solutions have helped fintechs grow by: issuing digital credentials or virtual cards, so consumers can seamlessly use installments at checkout; leveraging Visa’s acceptance and reach with sellers; and taking advantage of the security and risk offerings Visa provides. Additionally, this week Visa announced that Klarna has signed a global brand deal with Visa to accelerate its expansion and scale in several markets. “For years, Visa has been enthusiastically embracing BNPL for the same reason we pioneered revolving credit, debit and prepaid decades ago: because it expands choice and convenience for buyers and sellers alike,” said Mary Kay Bowman, SVP and global head of payment and platform products, Visa. “If shoppers prefer a BNPL fintech solution, we are here and enabling it; if they want an option from their banks, we’re helping offer those too.” Visa’s recent survey showed that future interest in installment plans is high and outpaces current adoption in all countries tested, underscoring the strong opportunity for BNPL usage looking ahead.2 Research shows that when BNPL options are available at checkout, retailers also benefit from an increase in spend and see more shoppers completing their purchases. “At HSBC we strive to bring new and innovative solutions to our customers. We are excited to partner with Visa and be the first bank outside North America to launch the Visa Installments Solution, starting in Malaysia; announcing our entrance in the digital Buy Now, Pay Later space,” said Madhu Kejriwal, Group Head, Unsecured Lending & Partnerships, HSBC Wealth & Personal Banking. “This feature facilitates point of sale purchases for HSBC Visa credit card customers when they shop with partner merchants, by allowing them to split payments into monthly instalments at no additional cost and no credit application. We look forward to continuing to innovate with Visa, including delivering on our global BNPL strategy.” “BNPL solutions have emerged as a must-have capability for both card issuers and merchants across the globe. We are thrilled to partner with Visa and to add Visa Installments to our existing BNPL product offering for our issuers and their cardholders,"" said Ava Kelly, Global Head of Products of Silicon Valley-based i2c, a global Visa Ready and Fast Track member. “We’re happy to be working with a trusted brand like Visa on providing a Buy Now, Pay Later option to Canadians,” said Patrick Diab, Chief Product and Partnership Officer, Moneris. “Bringing flexible payment methods like Buy Now, Pay Later to our merchants helps them offer their customers more options when it comes time to pay.” “We are very pleased to partner with Visa on BNPL,” said Craig O’Neill, CEO of Versapay. “As a payment facilitator, we were able to seamlessly onboard merchants into the Visa program, and as the BNPL market matures, we see this becoming an attractive offering for business to business commerce, an area Versapay intimately knows and serves well.” For more information on Visa Installments, visit: https://usa.visa.com/partner-with-us/payment-technology/installments.html About Visa Visa Inc.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Da die Nachfrage der Verbraucher nach Lösungen für „Sofort kaufen und später bezahlen“ (Buy Now, Pay Later; BNPL) weiter steigt, gab Visa (NYSE: V) heute eine bereits immer größer werdende Liste von Kartenausstellern, Übernehmern und Fintechs bekannt, die Visa-Technologie – sowohl die netzwerkbasierte Visa-Ratenzahlungslösung als auch die bewährten Fintech-Lösungen – nutzen, um ihren Kunden die Option „Buy Now, Pay Later“ anzubieten. Eine aktuelle Studie von Visa hat gezeigt, dass weltweit fast die Hälfte der Verbraucher (42 %) Interesse an einer Ratenfinanzierung bekundet, die für ihre bestehende Kreditkarte angeboten wird oder die sie beantragen könnten.1 Um den Partnern zu helfen, diese Nachfrage zu befriedigen, wird die Visa-Ratenzahlungslösung weltweit eingesetzt, um die von den Kartenausstellern angebotenen BNPL-Optionen in Geschäften und über E-Commerce-Kanäle verfügbar zu machen. Mit der netzwerkbasierten Lösung können Finanzinstitute BNPL als individuelle Zusatzoption für Kreditkarteninhaber zu deren bereits genehmigten Kreditlinien hinzufügen. Ebenso können Akzeptanzstellen im Netzwerk die Ratenzahlungsoption für alle ihre Einzelhändler, die Visa akzeptieren, aktivieren. Die Lösung wurde im Jahr 2019 zunächst als Pilotprojekt eingeführt und ist inzwischen in Australien, Kanada, Malaysia, Russland und den USA verfügbar. In Nordamerika stellt Visa die Lösung gemeinsam mit dem kanadischen Unternehmen Monerisden Unternehmen CIBC, Commerce Bank, Desjardins Group (Desjardins), Equinox Payments, i2c, ScotiaBank und Versapay zur Verfügung. Im asiatisch-pazifischen Raum bietet Visa nach der kürzlich gemeinsam mit HSBC erfolgten Einführung nun Ratenzahlungsprogramme bei ANZ, GHL Systems Malaysia und Quest Payment Systems an. Und in Russland hat sich Visa mit den Partnern Home Credit Bank und Russian Standard Bank zusammengeschlossen. Weltweit arbeitet Visa mit Cybersource, FIS, Global Payments und TSYS, einem Unternehmen von Global Payments, zusammen, um die Visa-Ratenzahlungslösung in weiteren Märkten zu ermöglichen. Die globale Einführung der Visa-Ratenzahlungslösung ergänzt das bereits bestehende Angebotsportfolio von Visa für die führenden BNPL-Fintechs, wie zum Beispiel: Afterpay, ChargeAfter, Klarna, Paidy, Sezzle, SplitIt und Zip. Bereits seit dem Jahr 2017 unterstützen Fintech-Lösungen von Visa das Wachstum der Branche, indem sie digitale Legitimationen oder virtuelle Einwegkarten bereitstellen, mit denen Verbraucher nahtlos Ratenzahlungen an der Kasse tätigen können, während die Verkäufer gleichzeitig die Akzeptanz und Reichweite sowie die Sicherheits- und Risikofunktionen von Visa nutzen können. Darüber hinaus gab Visa diese Woche den Abschluss eines globalen Markenvertrags mit Klarna bekannt, um die Expansion und Skalierung in einer Reihe von Märkten zu beschleunigen. „Visa sieht bereits seit Jahren großartige Potenziale bei BNPL, und zwar aus demselben Grund, aus dem wir vor Jahrzehnten Pionierarbeit für revolvierende Kreditlinien, Debit- und Prepaid-Karten geleistet haben: Weil sich dadurch die Auswahlmöglichkeiten und der Komfort für Käufer und Verkäufer gleichermaßen erhöhen“, erklärte Mary Kay Bowman, SVP und Global Head of Payment and Platform Products bei Visa. „Wenn Kunden eine BNPL-Fintech-Lösung möchten, sind wir zur Stelle und ermöglichen sie. Wenn sie eine Option über ihre Bank bevorzugen, helfen wir auch hier, diese bereitzustellen.“ Die jüngste Studie von Visa hat gezeigt, dass sich das Interesse an Ratenzahlungsoptionen in Zukunft vergrößern und in allen untersuchten Ländern die derzeitige Akzeptanz bei weitem übersteigen wird, sodass die großen Chancen von BNPL für die Zukunft deutlich zutage treten.2 Untersuchungen zeigen, dass Einzelhändler, die an der Kasse BNPL-Optionen anbieten, von der höheren Kaufkraft ihrer Kunden profitieren können, da mehr Kunden größere Einkäufe tätigen. „Wir bei HSBC sehen es als unsere Aufgabe an, unseren Kunden neue und innovative Lösungen zu bieten. Wir freuen uns, mit Visa zusammenzuarbeiten und die erste Bank außerhalb Nordamerikas zu sein, die die Visa-Ratenzahlungslösung auf den Markt bringt – beginnend in Malaysia. Dies bedeutet den ersten Schritt unseres Einstiegs in den Buy Now, Pay Later-Sektor“, erklärte Madhu Kejriwal, Group Head, Unsecured Lending & Partnerships, HSBC Wealth & Personal Banking. „Die Funktion erleichtert Besitzern der HSBC-Visa-Kreditkarte den Einkauf am Point of Sale, wenn sie bei Partnerhändlern einkaufen, da sie die Bezahlung in mehrere monatliche Raten aufteilen können – ohne zusätzliche Kosten und ohne Kreditantrag. Wir freuen uns darauf, gemeinsam mit Visa in Zukunft weitere Innovationen zu schaffen und unsere globale BNPL-Strategie erfolgreich umzusetzen.“ „BNPL-Lösungen sind inzwischen für die Kartenaussteller als auch für Händler auf der ganzen Welt zu einem Muss geworden. Wir sind davon begeistert, mit Visa zusammenzuarbeiten, um unser bestehendes BNPL-Produktangebot für unsere Kartenaussteller und deren Karteninhaber um Visa-Ratenzahlungen zu erweitern“, erklärte Ava Kelly, Global Head of Products von i2c, einem weltweiten Visa Ready- und Fast Track-Mitglied mit Sitz im Silicon Valley. „Sehr gerne arbeiten wir mit einer so vertrauenswürdigen Marke wie Visa zusammen, um den Kanadiern die Option Buy Now, Pay Later anzubieten“, betonte Patrick Diab, Chief Product and Partnership Officer, Moneris. „Mit flexiblen Zahlungsmethoden wie Buy Now, Pay Later können unsere Händler ihren Kunden nun mehr Optionen für das Bezahlen anbieten.“ „Wir arbeiten sehr gerne mit Visa bei BNPL zusammen“, erklärte Craig O'Neill, CEO von Versapay. „Für uns als Zahlungsvermittler war es kein Problem, Händler nahtlos in das Visa-Programm einzubinden, und da der BNPL-Markt zu florieren beginnt, sind wir sicher, dass sich diese neue Option auch für den Business-to-Business-Bereich zu einem attraktiven Angebot entwickeln wird – ein Bereich, den Versapay sehr gut kennt und bedient.“ Weitere Informationen über Visa-Ratenzahlungslösungen finden Sie unter: https://usa.visa.com/partner-with-us/payment-technology/installments.html Über Visa Visa Inc.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Comme la demande des consommateurs de solutions « Achetez maintenant, payez plus tard (Buy Now, Pay Later, BNPL) » ne cesse de croître, Visa (NYSE : V) a annoncé aujourd’hui une liste croissante d’émetteurs, d’acquéreurs et de sociétés de technologies financières (« fintechs ») qui exploitent la technologie de Visa, qu’il s’agisse de sa solution Visa Installments Solution basée sur le réseau ou de ses solutions de longues dates pour les entreprises des fintechs, pour introduire l’option « Achetez maintenant, payez plus tard » auprès de leurs clients. Une récente étude de Visa a découvert que près de la moitié (42 %) de tous les consommateurs mondiaux avaient exprimé un intérêt dans la solution de financement échelonné qui est proposée sur leur carte de crédit existante ou une carte qu’ils pourraient demander.1 Pour aider ses partenaires à répondre à cette demande, Visa Installments Solution est déployée dans le monde entier afin de rendre disponible les options de BNPL proposées par l’émetteur en magasin et sur l’ensemble des canaux de commerce électronique. Avec la solution basée sur le réseau, les institutions financières peuvent ainsi ajouter l’option BNPL comme une fonctionnalité personnalisée pour les titulaires d’une carte de crédit, sur leur ligne de crédit déjà approuvée. De même, les acquéreurs sur le réseau peuvent activer la possibilité de permettre les paiements échelonnés, pour n’importe lesquels de leurs détaillants qui acceptent Visa. Lancée pour la première fois en 2019 en tant que projet pilote, la solution s’est étendue à l’Australie, au Canada, à la Malaisie, à la Russie et aux États-Unis.

En Asie-Pacifique, suite au lancement récent avec HSBC, Visa déploie des programmes de paiement échelonné avec ANZ, GHL Systems Malaysia et Quest Payment Systems. Et en Russie, Visa s’est associée avec Home Credit Bank et Russian Standard Bank. Visa travaille également avec Cybersource, FIS, Global Payments et TSYS, une société de paiements mondiaux, sur plusieurs marchés dans le monde entier pour permettre le déploiement de Visa Installments Solution. Le déploiement mondial de Visa Installments Solution complète l’assistance existante que fournit Visa aux sociétés financières BNPL de premier plan, parmi lesquelles : Afterpay, ChargeAfter, Klarna, Paidy, Sezzle, SplitIt et Zip. Depuis 2017, les solutions fintech de Visa ont permis aux entreprises du secteur de se développer : en émettant des identifiants numériques ou des cartes virtuelles, afin que les consommateurs puissent utiliser de façon transparente les solutions de paiements échelonnés à la caisse ; en exploitant l’acceptation et la portée de Visa auprès des vendeurs ; et en profitant de la sécurité et des offres contre les risques offerts par Visa. Par ailleurs, Visa a annoncé cette semaine que Klarna avait signé un contrat de marque mondial avec Visa afin d’accélérer son expansion et sa mise à échelle sur plusieurs marchés. « Depuis des années, Visa a adopté l'option BNPL avec enthousiasme pour la même raison que nous avons été pionniers dans le crédit renouvelable, la carte de débit et les cartes prépayées il y a des décennies de cela : parce que cela étend le choix et la commodité pour les acheteurs comme pour les vendeurs, » a déclaré Mary Kay Bowman, VPS et directrice mondiale des produits de paiement et de plateforme, chez Visa. « Si les acheteurs préfèrent la solution fintech BNPL, nous sommes là pour le permettre ; s’ils préfèrent une option provenant de leurs banques, nous aidons ces dernières à la proposer également. » L’enquête récente de Visa a révélé que l’intérêt futur pour les plans de paiement échelonné va grandissant et dépasse son adoption actuelle dans tous les pays testés, soulignant ainsi la forte opportunité pour l’utilisation de BNPL à l’avenir.2 L’étude montre que lorsque les options BNPL sont disponibles à la caisse, les détaillants bénéficient également d’un augmentation des dépenses et voient plus d’acheteurs réaliser leurs achats. « Chez HSBC, nous nous efforçons d’introduire de nouvelles solutions innovantes auprès de nos clients. Nous avons hâte de nous associer avec Visa pour être la première banque hors de l’Amérique du Nord à lancer Visa Installments Solution, en commençant par la Malaisie ; annonçant ainsi notre entrée dans l’espace du Achetez maintenant, Payez plus tard numérique, » a déclaré Madhu Kejriwal, directeur du groupe, prêts en blanc et partenariats, chez HSBC Wealth & Personal Banking. « Cette fonctionnalité simplifie les achats sur le point de vente pour les clients de carte de crédit HSBC Visa lorsqu’ils achètent chez des commerçants partenaires, en leur permettant de diviser les paiements en versements mensuels sans frais supplémentaires ni demande de crédit. Nous avons hâte de continuer d’innover avec Visa, y compris en réalisant notre stratégie BNPL mondiale. » « Les solutions BNPL ont émergé comme une capacité incontournable pour les émetteurs de carte et les commerçants dans le monde entier. Nous sommes ravis de nous associer à Visa et d’ajouter Visa Installments Solution à notre offre de produits BNPL existante pour nos émetteurs et leurs titulaires de cartes, » a déclaré Ava Kelly, directrice mondiale des produits de la société i2c basée dans la Silicon Valley, un membre mondial Visa Ready et Fast Track. « Nous sommes heureux de travailler avec une marque de confiance comme Visa pour proposer une option Achetez maintenant, Payez plus tard aux Canadiens, » a déclaré Patrick Diab, directeur des produits et des partenariats chez Moneris. « Proposer à nos commerçants des méthodes de paiement flexibles comme Achetez maintenant, Payez plus tard, leur permet d'offrir à leurs clients davantage d’options de payements. » « Nous sommes très heureux de nous associer avec Visa sur la solution BNPL, » a déclaré Craig O’Neill, PDG de Versapay. « En tant que facilitateur de paiement, nous avons pu, en toute transparence, inscrire les commerçants dans le programme Visa, et tandis que le marché BNPL atteint sa maturité, nous le voyons devenir une offre attractive pour le commerce interentreprises (B2B), un secteur que Versapay connaît étroitement et dessert très bien. » Pour plus de renseignements sur la solution Visa Installments, consultez la page : https://usa.visa.com/partner-with-us/payment-technology/installments.html À propos de Visa Visa Inc.

サンフランシスコ--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- 「先買い・後払い」（BNPL）ソリューションに対する消費者の需要が高まる中、ビザ（NYSE: V）は本日、「先買い・後払い」オプションを顧客に提供するために、ビザの技術（ネットワークベースのビザ・インストールメント・ソリューション（Visa Installments Solution）と長年のフィンテックソリューションの両方）を活用しているイシュアー、アクワイアラー、フィンテック企業の数が増えていると発表しました。 最近のビザの調査によると、全世界の消費者の半数近く（42%）が、既存のクレジットカードまたは申し込み可能なクレジットカードにて提供される分割払いファイナンスに興味を示していることが分かっています1。提携先がこの需要に応えられるよう支援するため、ビザ・インストールメント・ソリューションを世界規模で提供し、イシュアーが提供するBNPLオプションを店頭や電子商取引チャネルで利用できるようにしています。このネットワークベースのソリューションにより、金融機関は既に承認されているクレジットラインに、クレジットカード保有者向けのカスタマイズ機能としてBNPLを追加することができます。同様に、ネットワーク上のアクワイアラーは、ビザを受け入れているすべての小売店に対して、分割払いを実現する機能を有効にすることができます。2019年にパイロット版を初投入した本ソリューションは、オーストラリア、カナダ、マレーシア、ロシア、米国に拡大しています。 ビザは北米において、カナダのモネリスと連携し、CIBC、コマース・バンク、デジャルダン・グループ（デジャルダン）、イクイノックス・ペイメンツ、i2c、スコシアバンク、バーサペイと協力しています。ビザはアジア太平洋地域において、先のHSBCとのプログラム開始に続き、ANZ、GHL Systems Malaysia、クエスト・ペイメント・システムズと分割払いプログラムを本格展開しています。またビザはロシアにおいて、ホーム・クレジット・バンクおよびロシア・スタンダード・バンクと提携しています。さらにビザは、世界の幾つかの市場で、サイバーソース、FIS、グローバル・ペイメンツ、TSYS（グローバル・ペイメンツ傘下）と協力して、ビザ・インストールメント・ソリューションを実現しています。 ビザは今日の有力なBNPLフィンテック企業（アフターペイ、チャージアフター、クラーナ、ペイディ、セズル、スプリティット、ジップを含む）を既に支援していますが、ビザ・インストールメント・ソリューションの世界規模での展開はこうした支援を補完するものです。2017年以降、ビザのフィンテックソリューションは、デジタルクレデンシャルやバーチャルカードを発行することで、消費者がチェックアウト時にシームレスに分割払いを利用できるようにしたり、ビザの受け入れや販売者へのリーチを活用したり、ビザが提供するセキュリティー／リスクサービスを活用したりすることで、フィンテックの成長を支援してきました。さらに、ビザは今週、クラーナがビザとグローバルブランド契約を締結し、幾つかの市場で拡張と規模拡大を加速することを発表しました。 ビザの決済・プラットフォーム製品担当シニアバイスプレジデント兼グローバルヘッドを務めるメアリー・ケイ・ボウマンは、次のように述べています。「数十年前にリボ払い、デビット払い、プリペイド払いを先駆的に導入したのと同じ理由で、ビザは何年も前からBNPLを精力的に採用してきました。購入者がBNPLフィンテックソリューションを好むなら、当社の出番であり、それを実現しています。もし購入者が銀行からのオプションを望むなら、当社はその提供も支援しています。」 ビザの最近の調査によると、調査したすべての国において、分割払いプランへの将来的な関心が高く、現在の採用率を上回っており、今後に向けてBNPL利用の大きなチャンスがあることを浮き彫りにしています2。 HSBCウェルス＆パーソナル・バンキング事業の無担保融資＆パートナーシップ担当グループヘッドのMadhu Kejriwal氏は、次のように述べています。「HSBCでは、お客さまに革新的な新ソリューションを提供すべく奮闘しています。当社はビザと提携し、北米以外の銀行としては初めて、マレーシアを皮切りに、ビザ・インストールメント・ソリューションを開始して、デジタルBNPL分野への参入を発表できることを大変うれしく思います。この機能は、HSBCVisaクレジットカードのお客さまが提携先の加盟店で買い物をする際に、追加費用や与信申請なしで支払いを月々の分割払いにできるようにすることで、店頭での購入を容易にします。HSBCは、世界規模のBNPL戦略の実現を含め、ビザと共に革新を続けていきたいと思います。」 シリコンバレーを拠点とするi2c（Visa Ready and Fast Trackのグローバルメンバー）の製品担当グローバルヘッドを務めるアヴァ・ケリー氏は、次のように述べています。「BNPLソリューションは、世界中のカード発行会社と加盟店の双方にとって必携の機能として登場しました。ビザと提携し、カード発行会社とそのカード会員に提供している既存のBNPL製品にビザ分割払いの機能を加えることができ、感激しています。」 モネリスの最高製品・提携責任者（CPPO）であるパトリック・ディアブ氏は、次のように述べています。｢ビザのような信頼できるブランドと協力して、カナダの人々にBNPLオプションを提供できることをうれしく思います。BNPLのように柔軟な支払い方法を当社の加盟店に提供することで、加盟店がそのお客さまに支払い時の選択肢を増やせるようにできます。」 バーサペイのクレイグ・オニール最高経営責任者（CEO）は、次のように述べています。「BNPLでビザと提携できることを大変うれしく思います。当社は支払いを促進する企業として、このビザプログラムに対する加盟店のオンボーディングをスムーズに行うことができました。そしてBNPL市場の成熟に伴い、このプログラムはバーサペイが熟知し、大きく貢献している分野である企業間取引にとって魅力的なサービスになりつつあることが分かります。」 ビザ分割払い機能に関する詳細情報については、https://usa.visa.com/partner-with-us/payment-technology/installments.htmlをご覧ください。 ビザについて ビザ・インク（NYSE：V）は、デジタル決済で世界をリードしています。その使命は、安全で信頼のおける革新的な決済ネットワークで世界を結び、消費者、企業、経済全体に利便性をもたらすことです。当社の高度な世界的処理ネットワークのVisaNetは、安全で信頼性の高い決済手段を世界で提供し、毎秒6万5000件を超える取引を処理する能力を備えています。当社の技術革新に対する献身は、あらゆる人にとって、あらゆる場所において、端末を問わず利用できるデジタルコマースの急速な成長を推進しています。世界規模でアナログからデジタルへの移行が進む今、ビザは当社のブランド、商品、人材、ネットワーク、スケールを活用して、商取引の新たな未来を切り開きます。詳細については、About Visa、visa.com/blog、@VisaNewsをご覧ください。 1 Visa & Growth from Knowledge Survey、2021年9月（オーストラリア、カナダ、香港、ロシア、米国、英国の7市場で実施した世界的調査の結果） 2 Visa & Growth from Knowledge Survey、2021年9月（オーストラリア、カナダ、香港、ロシア、米国、英国の7市場で実施した世界的調査の結果） 本記者発表文の公式バージョンはオリジナル言語版です。翻訳言語版は、読者の便宜を図る目的で提供されたものであり、法的効力を持ちません。翻訳言語版を資料としてご利用になる際には、法的効力を有する唯一のバージョンであるオリジナル言語版と照らし合わせて頂くようお願い致します。"

舊金山--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美國商業資訊)--隨著消費者對「先買後付」(BNPL)解決方案的需求不斷成長，Visa (NYSE: V)今天宣佈，越來越多的發卡機構、收單機構和金融科技公司正在利用Visa的技術——包括其以網路為基礎的Visa分期付款解決方案(Visa Installments Solution)和長期金融科技解決方案——為客戶提供「先買後付」選項。 Visa最近的一項研究發現，全球近一半(42%)的消費者表示對現有信用卡或可申請信用卡所提供的分期付款融資感興趣1。為幫助合作夥伴迎合這一需求，Visa分期付款解決方案正在全球部署，使發卡機構提供的BNPL選項能夠應用到實體店和電商通路。利用這一網路型解決方案，金融機構可以根據信用卡持卡人已獲批准的信貸額度，為其增加BNPL客製化功能。同樣，這一網路中的收單機構也可以啟動此項功能，為任何接受Visa的零售商提供分期付款服務。該解決方案於2019年推出試行，目前已擴展到澳洲、加拿大、馬來西亞、俄羅斯和美國。 在北美，Visa正與加拿大的Moneris、加拿大帝國商業銀行(CIBC)、Commerce Bank、Desjardins Group (Desjardins)、Equinox Payments、i2c、ScotiaBank和Versapay合作。在亞太地區，繼最近與滙豐銀行的合作後，Visa正與澳新銀行(ANZ)、GHL Systems Malaysia和Quest Payment Systems合作推出分期付款方案。在俄羅斯，Visa已與捷信銀行(Home Credit Bank)和俄羅斯標準銀行(Russian Standard Bank)達成合作。Visa還在全球多個市場與Cybersource、FIS、Global Payments及全球支付公司TSYS合作，以實施Visa分期付款解決方案。 Visa分期付款解決方案的全球推廣增進了Visa對當今一流的BNPL金融科技公司的支持，這些公司包括：Afterpay、ChargeAfter、Klarna、Paidy、Sezzle、SplitIt和Zip。自2017年以來，Visa的金融科技解決方案已經由以下方式協助金融科技公司成長：發放數位憑證或虛擬卡，讓消費者能夠在結帳時無礙使用分期付款；利用Visa的接受度和接觸賣家的能力；以及利用Visa提供的安全和風險產品。此外，本週Visa還宣佈Klarna已與Visa簽署全球品牌協定，以在多個市場加速擴張並擴大規模。 Visa資深副總裁兼支付和平臺產品全球負責人Mary Kay Bowman表示：「多年來，Visa一直積極支援BNPL解決方案，個中原因和我們數十年前率先推出循環信貸、轉帳卡和儲值卡如出一轍：因為它能夠為買家和賣家等提供更多的選擇和便利。如果消費者偏好BNPL金融科技解決方案，我們可以提供；如果他們希望銀行提供某種方案，我們也可以幫助提供這些選擇。」 Visa最近的調查顯示，在所有接受測試的國家中，人們對未來分期付款計畫的興趣很高，並且超過目前的普及率，這凸顯出BNPL選項在未來擁有巨大機會2。研究顯示，若結帳時能提供BNPL選項，消費會有所增加，更多的買家會完成購買，從而使零售商受惠。 滙豐財富管理及個人銀行部無擔保和合作小組負責人Madhu Kejriwal表示：「滙豐努力為客戶提供新的創新型解決方案。我們很高興能與Visa合作，成為北美以外第一家推出Visa分期付款解決方案（從馬來西亞開始）的銀行，宣告我們進入數位式『先買後付』領域。這項功能為滙豐Visa信用卡客戶在合作商家處的銷售終端購物提供了便利，讓他們能夠在無額外付費和不申請信貸的情況下每月分期付款。我們期待繼續與Visa合作創新，包括施行我們的全球BNPL策略。」 全球Visa Ready和Fast Track成員、總部位於矽谷的i2c全球產品負責人Ava Kelly表示：「BNPL解決方案已成為全球發卡機構和商家的必備功能。 我們很高興能與Visa 合作，把Visa分期付款添加到我們為發卡機構及其持卡人提供的現有BNPL產品中。」 Moneris產品與合作夥伴長Patrick Diab表示：「我們很高興能與Visa這樣值得信賴的品牌合作，為加拿大民眾提供『先買後付』選項。為我們的商家配備『先買後付』之類的靈活支付方式，有助於他們為客戶提供更多的付款選項。」 Versapay執行長Craig O’Neill表示：「我們非常高興能與Visa就BNPL展開合作。身為支付協調者，我們能夠讓商家順暢無礙地加入 Visa 計畫，而且隨著BNPL市場日益成熟，我們認為對B2B商務而言，這將成為具有吸引力的產品，而Versapay對這一領域非常瞭解，並能夠提供優良的服務。」 如欲詳細瞭解Visa分期付款解決方案，請造訪：https://usa.visa.com/partner-with-us/payment-technology/installments.html 關於Visa Visa Inc.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V), a leading global payments technology company, announced today the launch of Visa Eco Benefits, a new package of sustainability-focused benefits for account issuers designed to enable and encourage their cardholders to engage in sustainable consumption behaviors. The Visa Eco Benefits bundle will be available first in Europe and then rolled out globally during the next year to Visa’s clients. With this new offering, Visa continues to play a leading role in driving sustainable commerce and climate action in the payments industry, supporting its clients’ objectives to meet increasing demand from cardholders to enable sustainable consumption and living. The Visa Eco Benefits bundle will allow Visa issuers to add sustainability-focused benefits to existing Visa cardholder credit/debit products, enabling cardholders to understand the impact of their spending on the environment, as well as encourage sustainable consumption and behaviors. Available features at launch or over time are expected to include: Carbon footprint calculator: insights offered by ecolytiq for cardholders into the estimated carbon footprint of their spend, including a new temperature score, which helps cardholders understand the climate impact of their personal spending behavior and how their consumption choices contribute to the 1.5°C Paris Climate Change Agreement goal Carbon offsets: ability for cardholders to offset their greenhouse gas emissions impacts Personalized education for customers on how to encourage more sustainable consumption Sustainable card materials, including a collaboration with CPI Card Group and digital receipts Donations to environmental organizations when Visa cards are used, including One Tree Planted, a global reforestation non-profit organization Expanded rewards for cardholders for sustainable behaviors “At Visa, we recognize the urgency of climate change and are committed to a new era of sustainable and inclusive economic growth,” said Charlotte Hogg, executive vice president and chief executive officer, Europe, Visa. “As an engine of global commerce, we have the opportunity to work with clients and partners around the world to help embed sustainability into the payments ecosystem and support cardholder and business choices through the transition.” According to a recent GlobeScan study of 31,000 people across 31 markets, consumers continue to have high ambitions for sustainable living. According to Visa cardholder research, these high aspirations for sustainable living carry through to banking and payments. For example, a majority of U.S. cardholders surveyed agreed that sustainability is important to them, with 62% very likely or somewhat likely to apply for a sustainability-focused payment card and trends skewing higher in the millennial generation. In Europe, cardholders ranked sustainability-focused features most important after traditional card benefits like fraud protection and acceptance in choosing their next payment card. The Visa Eco Benefits bundle is a continuation of Visa’s global aspiration to be a climate positive company, using its products, services, data, network and brand to drive sustainable commerce and support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Earlier this year, Visa announced a pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2040, ten years ahead of the Paris Climate Agreement goal. “Sustainability is the challenge of our time, but also one of the greatest opportunities for the finance industry,” said Ulrich Pietsch, co-founder and chief executive officer, ecolytiq. “Equipped with the right tools like the Visa Eco Benefits bundle, the finance industry becomes the driving force for change by educating millions of consumers about their impact and by empowering them to take effective climate action to build the sustainable future we all deserve.” Visa’s Eco Benefits bundle is the latest milestone in Visa’s sustainability leadership. The company’s recognition includes inclusion on the following: Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index, America’s Most Responsible Companies, and 100 Most Just Companies.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE : V), l’une des principales sociétés mondiales de technologies de paiement, a annoncé aujourd’hui le lancement de Visa Eco Benefits, une nouvelle offre d’avantages axée sur la durabilité, destinée aux émetteurs de comptes, créée pour encourager et permettre à leurs titulaires de cartes d’adopter des comportements de consommation durables. L’offre Visa Eco Benefits sera dans un premier temps disponible en Europe, puis déployée à travers le monde pour les clients de Visa au cours de l’année prochaine. À travers cette nouvelle offre, Visa continue de jouer un rôle de premier plan dans la promotion du commerce durable et de l’action climatique au sein du secteur des paiements, en soutenant les objectifs de ses clients consistant à répondre à une demande croissante de la part des titulaires de cartes autour d’une consommation et d’un mode de vie durables. L’offre Visa Eco Benefits permettra aux émetteurs Visa d’ajouter à leurs produits de crédit/débit existants pour titulaires de cartes Visa plusieurs avantages axés sur la durabilité, aux titulaires de cartes de mieux comprendre l’impact de leurs dépenses sur l’environnement, et encouragera une consommation et des comportements durables. Les fonctionnalités disponibles lors du lancement ou par la suite devraient inclure : Calculateur d’empreinte carbone : informations fournies par ecolytiq aux titulaires de cartes concernant leur empreinte carbone estimée en fonction de leurs dépenses, notamment un nouveau score de température, qui permet aux titulaires de cartes de comprendre l’impact climatique de leur comportement personnel de dépenses, ainsi que la manière dont leurs choix de consommation contribuent à l’accomplissement de l’objectif de 1,5°C fixé par l’Accord de Paris sur le changement climatique Compensations carbone : possibilité pour les titulaires de cartes de compenser leur impact en termes d’émissions de gaz à effet de serre Formation sur mesure pour les clients concernant la manière d’encourager une consommation plus durable Matériaux de cartes durables, notamment grâce à une collaboration avec CPI Card Group ainsi qu’à des reçus numériques Dons à des organisations environnementales lorsque des cartes Visa sont utilisées, notamment en faveur de One Tree Planted, une organisation mondiale à but non lucratif axée sur la reforestation Avantages plus nombreux en faveur des titulaires de cartes, pour des comportements durables « Chez Visa, nous sommes conscients de l’urgence du changement climatique, et déterminés à promouvoir une nouvelle ère de croissance économique durable et inclusive », a déclaré Charlotte Hogg, vice-présidente exécutive et présidente-directrice générale pour la région Europe, Visa. « En tant que moteur du commerce mondial, nous avons l’opportunité de travailler avec les clients et partenaires du monde entier pour contribuer à intégrer la durabilité dans l’écosystème des paiements, ainsi que pour soutenir les choix des titulaires de cartes et des entreprises dans le cadre de la transition. » Selon une récente étude GlobeScan visant 31 000 personnes sur 31 marchés, les aspirations de mode de vie durable des consommateurs demeurent élevées.

Le présent communiqué de presse contient des déclarations prévisionnelles au sens de la loi américaine « Private Securities Litigation Reform Act » de 1995. Ces déclarations prévisionnelles sont généralement identifiées par l’usage du futur ou du conditionnel, ainsi que par des expressions telles que « prévoit de », « s’attendre à », et autres expressions similaires. Parmi les exemples de déclarations prévisionnelles figurent, sans toutefois s’y limiter, les déclarations que nous formulons concernant le calendrier et la probabilité de prendre des mesures liées à notre stratégie, nos projets et nos initiatives et objectifs climatiques futurs, ainsi que l’impact potentiel de nos actions. Par nature, les déclarations prévisionnelles : (i) n’ont de valeur qu’à la date où elles sont formulées, (ii) ne sont ni des énoncés de faits historiques, ni des garanties de performance future et (iii) sont assujetties à des risques, incertitudes, hypothèses et changements de circonstances qui sont difficiles à prévoir ou à quantifier. C'est pourquoi, les résultats réels pourraient différer sensiblement et défavorablement des déclarations prévisionnelles de Visa en raison d'une variété de facteurs, notamment ceux qui figurent dans notre Rapport annuel sur formulaire 10-K pour l'exercice financier clos le 30 septembre 2020 et nos autres rapports déposés auprès de la Securities and Exchange Commission des États-Unis.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today Visa (NYSE: V) announced a new platform, Visa Acceptance Cloud (VAC), set to revolutionize the way businesses accept payments from their customers. Following the success of the company’s popular “Tap to Phone” solution, VAC will let acquirers, payment service providers, point of sale (POS) manufacturers, and Internet of Things (IoT) players move payment processing software from being embedded in each hardware device to being universally accessible in the cloud. Already live across six geographies, VAC will help innovators transform almost any device into a cloud-connected payment terminal, while providing seamless, cloud-based software updates, robust analytics, and network services from Visa. Since VAC runs on Visa’s data centers, it also offers leading data security capabilities. “Cloud acceptance is the future of payments,” said Mary Kay Bowman, senior vice president and global head of payment and platform products, Visa. “Cloud-connected POS lets sellers accept payments across a range of devices quickly, simply, and safely, whether at an unattended kiosk in a hotel, a mirror in a high-end retail store or virtual in-home gym, or a smart phone in the hands of a small seller with a roadside newsstand.” In January 2020, Visa first showcased the power of “Tap to Phone,” an industry-first solution that transforms current generation Android smartphones and tablets into contactless point of sale terminals. Tap to Phone was Visa’s first offering that let sellers accept payments on the devices they already own, just by downloading an app. As of December 2021, there were more than 300,000 devices across 54 countries using Tap to Phone. Expanding beyond phones, Visa Acceptance Cloud enables any POS or connected device to seamlessly accept payments and to incorporate a range of added services, including buy now, pay later, fraud management, Rapid Seller Onboarding, and advanced data analytics. The ongoing pilots in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia cater to a variety of use cases, including retailers and restaurants in Australia through Visa’s work with U.S.-based fintech, Bleu, NOBAL Technologies’ smart mirror and public trains in Brazil. “Bleu is working with Visa to bring seamless payments to businesses across Australia for the very first time,” said Sesie Bonsi, President & CEO, Bleu. “While the average business owner can spend as much as $1,000 on POS devices, plus countless hours and more money on time consuming certification processes, moving to Visa Acceptance Cloud removes the barriers of traditional hardware and burdens of device-bound kernel certifications, making it easier for the independent business that we serve to deliver touchless payment options to their customers through any connected device.” “Retailers are looking to enhance their in-store customer experience to meet the speed and convenience of the online and in-store checkout experiences,” says Bill Roberts, CEO, NOBAL Technologies. “NOBAL‘s intelligent mirror in partnership with VAC from Visa provides payment experiences on our mirror without the expense and expertise required for embedded hardware modules, helping us push the future of retail in new ways.” “VAC is a universal platform that helps open up acceptance for all – by freeing our leading technology partners to innovate. On one end of the spectrum, cloud acceptance helps drive inclusion for more small sellers who want to offer digital payments. On the other end, Visa Acceptance Cloud enables advanced shopping and buying experiences that will be central to the future of retail for businesses of all shapes and sizes,” continued Bowman. “Moving acceptance to the cloud opens up the possibility of so much innovation from the entire payments ecosystem. This is only the beginning.” To learn more about VAC, please visit our website or contact visaacceptancecloud@visa.com.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V) today announced that the U.S. Spending Momentum Index (SMI) was 108.4 in December (seasonally adjusted), its strongest reading for the month since the start of the index. For the last three months of the year, the SMI was 110.3, also a high for the fourth quarter of the year. The Visa SMI is an economic indicator of the health of consumer spending. When the Visa SMI rises above 100, the consumer spending momentum is strengthening and when it falls below 100, the spending momentum is weakening as fewer consumers are spending more relative to the previous year. By category, the SMI for discretionary purchases fell 4.9 points from the previous month to 103. The SMI for non-discretionary purchases rose 0.1 points to 99.9. On a regional basis, the SMI fell the most in the Midwest and South, with both declining 4 points for the month. The Northeast reading fell 2.5 points and the West slid 1.8 points. The West was the strongest performing region in December with an SMI reading of 110.1. “The SMI’s strong readings from October through December suggests that consumer spending ended 2021 on a strong note,” said Wayne Best, Visa’s Chief Economist. “However this month’s SMI reading additionally shows that there were adverse impacts to consumer spending in December, likely related to both the virus spread and severe weather across much of the country.” About the Visa SMI The Visa SMI is an economic indicator of the health of consumer spending. The SMI provides insight into what drives upturns and downturns in spending by measuring the breadth of the momentum supporting these trends. The Visa SMI is based on a sample of aggregated, depersonalized VisaNet data. Visa adjusts this data through proprietary methods to exclude factors that do not reflect spending momentum. The resulting sample data is then aggregated using a diffusion index framework where index values are scored from 0 to 200. When the Visa SMI rises above 100, the consumer spending momentum is strengthening and when it falls below 100, the spending momentum is weakening as fewer consumers are spending more relative to the previous year. The index is adjusted for day of week, month, holidays, and broad annual trends, and these seasonal adjustments are subject to revision each year. The Visa SMI does not take into account the volume of payments; nor does it rely on all Visa-branded credentials, and therefore does not reflect Visa operational or financial performance. It is intended for informational purposes only and is offered on an “as is” basis without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. Each SMI report is as of the publication date. Eligible Visa clients in the U.S. may access more detailed and customized insights at the national, regional and local spending level, including spending on the main categories of goods and services.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V) kündigte heute eine neue Plattform an, die Visa Acceptance Cloud (VAC). Sie wird die Art und Weise, wie Unternehmen Zahlungen von ihren Kunden annehmen, revolutionieren. Nach dem Erfolg der beliebten „Tap to Phone“-Lösung des Unternehmens wird VAC es Akzeptanzstellen, Zahlungsdienstleistern, POS-Herstellern und „Internet of Things“-Anbietern („IoT“) ermöglichen, die Software für die Zahlungsabwicklung nicht mehr in die einzelnen Hardware-Geräte einzubetten, sondern universell in der Cloud zugänglich zu machen. VAC ist bereits in sechs Ländern im Einsatz und wird Innovationsträgern dabei helfen, nahezu jedes Gerät in ein mit der Cloud verbundenes Zahlungsterminal zu verwandeln. Gleichzeitig bietet VAC nahtlose, cloudbasierte Software-Updates, zuverlässige Analysefunktionen und Netzwerkdienste von Visa. Da VAC in den Rechenzentren von Visa läuft, verfügt es auch über hervorragende Datensicherheitsfunktionen. „Die Cloud-Akzeptanz ist die Zukunft des Zahlungsverkehrs“, sagt Mary Kay Bowman, Senior Vice President und Global Head of Payment and Platform Products bei Visa. „Mit Cloud-vernetzten POS-Systemen können Verkäufer schnell, einfach und sicher Zahlungen über eine Vielzahl von Geräten entgegennehmen, ob an einem unbesetzten Kiosk in einem Hotel, einem Spiegel in einem gehobenen Einzelhandelsgeschäft, einem virtuellen Fitnessstudio zu Hause oder einem Smartphone in den Händen eines Kleinhändlers mit einem Kiosk am Straßenrand.“ Im Januar 2020 präsentierte Visa erstmals die Möglichkeiten von „Tap to Phone“, einer branchenweit einmaligen Lösung, die Android-Smartphones und -Tablets der aktuellen Generation in kontaktlose Kassenterminals verwandelt. Tap to Phone war das erste Angebot von Visa, das es Verkäufern ermöglicht, Zahlungen auf den Geräten entgegenzunehmen, die sie bereits besitzen, indem sie einfach eine App herunterladen. Im Dezember 2021 wurde Tap to Phone bereits auf mehr als 300.000 Geräten in 54 Ländern genutzt. Die Visa Acceptance Cloud erweitert das Angebot über Mobiltelefone hinaus und ermöglicht es jedem POS- oder angeschlossenen Gerät, nahtlos Zahlungen zu akzeptieren und eine Reihe zusätzlicher Dienste zu integrieren, darunter buy now, pay later, Betrugsmanagement, Rapid Seller Onboarding und erweiterte Datenanalysen. Die laufenden Pilotprojekte in Nordamerika, Südamerika, Europa, Afrika, Asien und Australien decken eine Vielzahl von Anwendungsfällen ab, darunter Einzelhändler und Restaurants in Australien im Rahmen der Zusammenarbeit von Visa mit dem US-amerikanischen Fintech-Unternehmen Bleu, der intelligente Spiegel von NOBAL Technologies und öffentliche Züge in Brasilien. „Bleu kooperiert mit Visa, um Unternehmen in ganz Australien zum ersten Mal nahtlose Zahlungen zu ermöglichen“, sagte Sesie Bonsi, President & CEO von Bleu. „Während der durchschnittliche Geschäftsinhaber bis zu 1.000 Dollar für POS-Geräte ausgibt und darüber hinaus unzählige Stunden und noch mehr Geld für zeitraubende Zertifizierungsprozesse aufwenden muss, beseitigt der Wechsel zur Visa Acceptance Cloud die Barrieren traditioneller Hardware und die lästigen gerätegebundenen Kernzertifizierungen und macht es den unabhängigen Unternehmen, die wir bedienen, leichter, ihren Kunden über jedes angeschlossene Gerät berührungslose Zahlungsoptionen anzubieten.“ „Einzelhändler wollen das Kundenerlebnis in ihren Geschäften verbessern, um der Geschwindigkeit und dem Komfort der Bezahlvorgänge online und in den Geschäften zu entsprechen“, sagt Bill Roberts, CEO von NOBAL Technologies. „Der intelligente Spiegel von NOBAL in Zusammenarbeit mit VAC von Visa ermöglicht Zahlungserlebnisse auf unserem Spiegel ohne die Kosten und das Fachwissen, die für eingebettete Hardwaremodule erforderlich sind, und hilft uns, die Zukunft des Einzelhandels auf neue Weise voranzutreiben.“ „VAC ist eine universelle Plattform, die dazu beiträgt, die Zahlungsabwicklung für alle zu ermöglichen - und zwar indem sie unseren führenden Technologiepartnern die Möglichkeit gibt, Innovationen zu entwickeln. Am einen Ende des Spektrums trägt die Cloud-Akzeptanz dazu bei, dass mehr kleine Händler, die digitale Zahlungen anbieten wollen, eingebunden werden. Am anderen Ende ermöglicht die Visa Acceptance Cloud fortschrittliche Einkaufs- und Kauferlebnisse, die für die Zukunft des Einzelhandels für Unternehmen aller Formen und Größen von zentraler Bedeutung sein werden“, so Bowman weiter. „Die Verlagerung der Annahme in die Cloud eröffnet die Möglichkeit für so viele Innovationen aus dem gesamten Zahlungsökosystem. Dies ist erst der Anfang.“ Um mehr über die VAC zu erfahren, besuchen Sie bitte unsere Website oder kontaktieren Sie visaacceptancecloud@visa.com. Über Visa Visa (NYSE: V) ist ein weltweit führender Akteur im Bereich digitale Zahlungen. Das Unternehmen ermöglicht jedes Jahr mehr als 215 Milliarden Zahlungstransaktionen zwischen Verbrauchern, Händlern, Finanzinstituten und Regierungsstellen in mehr als 200 Ländern und Territorien. Unser Auftrag ist es, die Welt durch das innovativste, komfortabelste, zuverlässigste und sicherste Zahlungsnetzwerk zu vernetzen und so Einzelpersonen, Unternehmen und Volkswirtschaften zum Erfolg zu verhelfen.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE : V) a annoncé aujourd’hui une nouvelle plateforme, Visa Acceptance Cloud (VAC), qui s’apprête à révolutionner la manière dont les entreprises acceptent les paiements de leurs clients. Suite au succès de la solution populaire « Tap to Phone » de la Société, VAC permettra aux acquéreurs, fournisseurs de services de paiement, fabricants de systèmes de points de vente (Point Of Sale, POS), et acteurs de l’Internet des Objets (IdO) de migrer leurs logiciels de traitement des paiements actuellement intégrés dans chaque périphérique matériel, vers une accessibilité universelle dans le cloud. D’ores et déjà opérationnelle dans six régions géographiques, VAC permettra aux innovateurs de transformer la quasi-totalité des appareils en terminaux de paiement connectés au cloud, tout en offrant des mises à jour logicielles fluides basées dans le cloud, des analyses rigoureuses, et des services réseau fournis par Visa. Dans la mesure où la plateforme VAC fonctionne sur les centres de données de Visa, elle offre des capacités de premier plan en termes de sécurité des données. « L’acceptation cloud constitue l’avenir des paiements », a déclaré Mary Kay Bowman, vice-présidente principale et directrice mondiale des Produits de paiement et plateforme, chez Visa. « Les points de vente connectés au cloud permettent aux vendeurs d’accepter des paiements sur tout un éventail d’appareils, de manière rapide, simple et sécurisée, qu’il s’agisse d’un guichet en libre-service dans un hôtel, d’un miroir dans une boutique de vente au détail, haut de gamme, d’un gymnase virtuel à domicile, ou d’un smartphone entre les mains d’un petit commerçant qui possède un kiosque à journaux en bord de route. » En janvier 2020, Visa avait présenté pour la première fois la puissance de « Tap to Phone », solution inédite dans le secteur, qui transforme la génération actuelle de smartphones et tablettes Android en terminaux de point de vente sans contact. Tap to Phone était la première offre de Visa permettant aux vendeurs d’accepter des paiements sur des appareils qu’ils possèdent déjà, en téléchargeant simplement une application. En décembre 2021, plus de 300 000 appareils répartis dans 54 pays utilisaient la solution Tap to Phone. Développant les capacités au-delà des téléphones, la plateforme Visa Acceptance Cloud permet à n’importe quel point de vente ou appareil connecté d’accepter facilement des paiements, tout en intégrant plusieurs services ajoutés, notamment le paiement différé, la gestion des fraudes, l’intégration rapide des vendeurs, et des analyses de données sophistiquées. Les projets pilotes actuellement en cours en Amérique du Nord, en Amérique du Sud, en Europe, en Afrique, en Asie, et en Australie répondent à divers cas d’utilisation, qu’il s’agisse de détaillants et de restaurants en Australie via la collaboration de Visa avec la fintech américaine Bleu, du miroir intelligent de NOBAL Technologies, ou des trains publics au Brésil. « Bleu travaille aux côtés de Visa afin de proposer des paiements fluides aux entreprises d’Australie pour la toute première fois », a commenté Sesie Bonsi, PDG de Bleu. « Tandis qu’un chef d’entreprise dépense en moyenne jusqu’à 1 000 dollars pour ses appareils de points de vente, auxquels s’ajoutent d’innombrables heures de travail et encore plus de dépenses pour gérer des processus de certification chronophages, l’adoption de Visa Acceptance Cloud élimine les obstacles liés au matériel informatique traditionnel, et les contraintes imposées par les certifications de noyau liées aux appareils, permettant ainsi aux entreprises indépendantes que nous desservons, de mettre facilement à disposition de leurs clients des options de paiement sans contact, via n’importe quel appareil connecté. » « Les détaillants souhaitent améliorer l’expérience de leur clientèle en boutique, en proposant la vitesse et la souplesse qu’offrent les expériences de paiement en ligne et en boutique », a indiqué Bill Roberts, PDG de NOBAL Technologies. « En partenariat avec VAC de Visa, le miroir intelligent de NOBAL fournit des expériences de paiement sur notre miroir, sans nécessiter le savoir-faire et les dépenses requises par les modules matériels intégrés ; nous disposons ainsi d’une nouvelle approche pour promouvoir l’avenir de la vente au détail. » « VAC est une plateforme universelle qui contribue à l’ouverture généralisée de l’acceptation cloud, et libère nos principaux partenaires technologiques afin qu’ils puissent innover. D’une part, l’acceptation cloud permet de favoriser l’inclusion d’un plus grand nombre de petits commerçants qui souhaitent proposer des paiements numériques. D’autre part, Visa Acceptance Cloud offre des expériences de shopping et d’achat, avancées qui s’inscriront au cœur de l’avenir de la vente au détail, pour les entreprises de toutes formes et de toutes tailles », a poursuivi Mme Bowman. « La migration de l’acceptation, vers le cloud, ouvre la possibilité d’une formidable innovation pour l’ensemble de l’écosystème des paiements. Ce n’est qu’un début. » Pour en savoir plus sur VAC, rendez-vous sur notre site Web, ou contactez visaacceptancecloud@visa.com.

旧金山--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美国商业资讯)--Visa (NYSE: V)今天宣布推出一个新平台——Visa Acceptance Cloud (VAC)，将彻底改变企业接受客户支付的方式。继该公司广受欢迎的“Tap to Phone”解决方案大获成功之后，VAC将为收单行、支付服务提供商、POS制造商和物联网厂商提供支持，将支付处理软件从各个硬件设备中转移至可普遍访问的云端。 VAC已经在六个地区运营，将帮助创新者将几乎任何设备转变为云连接的支付终端，同时提供基于云的无缝软件更新、强大的分析能力以及来自Visa的网络服务。VAC运行于Visa的数据中心，因此也具备领先的数据安全能力。 Visa高级副总裁兼支付和平台产品全球主管Mary Kay Bowman表示：“云承兑是支付的未来。通过云连接的POS，卖家能够快速、简单、安全地接受来自众多设备的付款——无论是无人值守的酒店自助入住机，高端零售商店的智能镜，还是虚拟家庭健身房，或者路边小报摊卖家手中的智能手机。” 2020年1月，Visa首次展示了“Tap to Phone”的威力，这是一款业界领先的解决方案，可将当前的安卓智能手机和平板电脑转变为非接触式POS终端。Tap to Phone是Visa推出的首款此类产品，卖家只需下载一个App，就可以在他们的现有设备上接受付款。截至2021年12月，已经有54个国家的30多万部设备在使用Tap to Phone。 除手机外，Visa Acceptance Cloud支持任何POS或联网设备无缝地接受支付，并整合了一系列附加服务，如先买后付、欺诈管理、卖家快速上手，以及高级数据分析等。目前，Visa正在北美、南美、欧洲、非洲、亚洲和澳大利亚进行试点，以满足各种不同的使用场景，包括澳大利亚的零售商和餐馆（通过与美国金融科技公司Bleu合作）、NOBAL Technologies的智能镜，以及巴西的民用列车。 Bleu总裁兼首席执行官Sesie Bonsi表示：“Bleu正在与Visa合作，为澳大利亚各地的企业提供前所未有的无缝支付体验。在此之前，一般的企业所有者可能在POS设备上花费高达1,000美元，还需要在耗时的认证流程中花费大量时间和费用。Visa Acceptance Cloud可以消除传统硬件面临的障碍，以及与设备绑定的内核认证负担，让享受我们服务的独立企业能够更轻松地通过任何互联设备向客户提供非接触付款选项。” NOBAL Technologies首席执行官Bill Roberts表示：“零售商正寻求提升他们的店内顾客体验，以满足人们对在线和店内结账体验的速度和便利性需求。NOBAL的智能镜与Visa的VAC合作，在我们的智能镜上提供支付体验。因为无需嵌入硬件模块，因此没有相关费用，也不需要专业知识。此举可以帮助我们以新方式推动零售业迈向未来。” Bowman继续表示：“VAC是一个通用平台，通过释放我们领先技术合作伙伴的创新能力，支持通过各种设备接受支付。在另一端，云承兑能帮助推动包容性，将更多希望提供数字支付选项的小卖家纳入进来。同时，Visa Acceptance Cloud可帮助实现高级购物和购买体验，此类体验将成为未来各种形式和各种规模企业零售服务的核心。将承兑转移至云端可以为整个支付生态系统带来众多的创新可能性。而这仅仅只是一个开始。” 如需了解有关VAC的更多信息，请访问我们的网站或联系visaacceptancecloud@visa.com。 关于Visa Visa (NYSE: V)是数字支付领域的全球领导者，每年为200多个国家和地区的消费者、商家、金融机构和政府机构之间逾2150亿笔支付交易提供便利。我们的使命是通过创新、便捷、可靠和安全的支付网络连接世界，促进个人、企业和经济的蓬勃发展。我们相信经济与每个人息息相关并能改善每个人的生活，并认为连通性是未来货币流动的基础。如需了解更多信息，请访问Visa.com。 免责声明：本公告之原文版本乃官方授权版本。译文仅供方便了解之用，烦请参照原文，原文版本乃唯一具法律效力之版本。"

舊金山--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美國商業資訊)--Visa (NYSE: V)今天宣布推出一個新平臺——Visa Acceptance Cloud (VAC)，將徹底改變企業接受客戶支付的方式。繼該公司廣受歡迎的Tap to Phone解決方案大獲成功之後，VAC將為收單行、支付服務提供者、POS製造商和物聯網廠商提供支援，將支付處理軟體從各個硬體設備中轉移至可普遍存取的雲端。 VAC已經在六個地區營運，將幫助創新者將幾乎任何設備轉變為雲端連接的支付終端，同時提供採用雲端架構的順暢軟體更新、強大的分析能力以及來自Visa的網路服務。VAC執行於Visa的資料中心，因此也具備領先的資料安全能力。 Visa資深副總裁兼支付和平臺產品全球主管Mary Kay Bowman表示：「雲端承兌是支付的未來。透過雲端連接的POS，賣家能夠快速、簡單、安全地接受來自眾多設備的付款——無論是無人值守的飯店自助入住機，高端零售商店的智慧鏡，還是虛擬家庭健身房，或者路邊小報攤賣家手中的智慧手機。」 2020年1月，Visa首次展示了Tap to Phone的威力，這是一款業界領先的解決方案，可將當前的Android智慧手機和平板電腦轉變為非接觸式POS終端裝置。Tap to Phone是Visa推出的首款此類產品，賣家只需下載一個App，就可以在他們的現有設備上接受付款。截至2021年12月，已經有54個國家的30多萬部設備在使用Tap to Phone。 除手機外，Visa Acceptance Cloud支援任何POS或聯網設備順暢地接受支付，並整合了一系列附加服務，如先買後付、詐騙管理、賣家快速上手，以及進階資料分析等。目前，Visa正在北美、南美、歐洲、非洲、亞洲和澳洲進行試點，以滿足各種不同的使用場景，包括澳洲的零售商和餐館（透過與美國金融科技公司Bleu合作）、NOBAL Technologies的智慧鏡，以及巴西的民用列車。 Bleu總裁兼執行長Sesie Bonsi表示：「Bleu正在與Visa合作，為澳洲各地的企業提供前所未有的順暢支付體驗。在此之前，一般的企業主可能在POS設備上花費高達1,000美元，還需要在耗時的認證流程中花費大量時間和費用。Visa Acceptance Cloud可以消除傳統硬體面臨的障礙，以及與設備綁定的核心認證負擔，讓享受我們服務的獨立企業能夠更輕鬆地透過任何聯網裝置向客戶提供非接觸付款選項。」 NOBAL Technologies執行長Bill Roberts表示：「零售商正尋求提升他們的店內顧客體驗，以滿足人們對線上和店內結帳體驗的速度和便利性需求。NOBAL的智慧鏡與Visa的VAC合作，在我們的智慧鏡上提供支付體驗。因為無需嵌入硬體模組，因此沒有相關費用，也不需要專業知識。此舉可以幫助我們以新方式推動零售業邁向未來。」 Bowman繼續表示：「VAC是一個通用平臺，透過釋放我們領先技術合作夥伴的創新能力，支援透過各種設備接受支付。在另一端，雲端承兌能幫助推動包容性，將更多希望提供數位支付選項的小賣家納入進來。同時，Visa Acceptance Cloud可幫助實現進階購物和購買體驗，此類體驗將成為未來各種形式和各種規模企業零售服務的核心。將承兌轉移至雲端可以為整個支付生態系統帶來眾多的創新可能性。而這僅僅只是一個開始。」 如需瞭解有關VAC的更多資訊，請造訪我們的網站或聯絡visaacceptancecloud@visa.com。 關於Visa Visa (NYSE: V)是數位支付領域的全球領導者，每年為200多個國家和地區的消費者、商家、金融機構和政府機構之間逾2150億筆支付交易提供便利。我們的使命是透過創新、便捷、可靠和安全的支付網路連接世界，促進個人、企業和經濟的蓬勃發展。我們相信經濟與每個人息息相關並能改善每個人的生活，並認為連通性是未來貨幣流動的基礎。如需瞭解更多資訊，請造訪Visa.com。 免責聲明：本公告之原文版本乃官方授權版本。譯文僅供方便瞭解之用，煩請參照原文，原文版本乃唯一具法律效力之版本。"

サンフランシスコ--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- 本日、ビザ（NYSE: V）は、新プラットフォームのビザ・アクセプタンス・クラウド（VAC）を発表しました。これは、企業が顧客からの支払いを受け付ける方法を大きく変革するものです。よく知られたビザの「Tap to Phone」ソリューションの成功に続き、VACにより、アクワイアラー、決済サービス会社、販売時点システム（POS）メーカー、モノのインターネット（IoT）事業者は、決済処理ソフトウエアを、個々のハードウエア・デバイスに組み込むものからクラウド上で広くアクセスできるものに移すことができます。 VACはすでに6つの地域で稼働しており、イノベーターは、ほぼすべてのデバイスをクラウド接続された決済端末に変えることができ、ビザのシームレスなクラウドベースのソフトウエア・アップデート、安定した分析機能、ネットワーク・サービスを利用できます。VACはビザのデータセンターで稼働しているため、先進的なデータ・セキュリティー能力も備えています。 ビザの決済・プラットフォーム製品担当シニア・バイスプレジデント兼グローバル責任者のメアリー・ケイ・ボウマンは、次のように述べています。「クラウドでの決済受け付けは、決済の未来を担うものです。POSをクラウド接続することで、販売店は、さまざまなデバイスで素早く簡単に安全に支払いに応じることができます。これは、ホテルの無人端末、高級小売店のミラーやバーチャル自宅ジム、道端で新聞売店を運営する小規模販売業者が手に持つスマートフォンなど、どのデバイスでも可能です。」 2020年1月、ビザは「Tap to Phone」の力を初めて披露しました。これは、現行世代のアンドロイド・スマートフォンやタブレットを非接触型POS端末に変える業界初のソリューションです。Tap to Phoneは、販売店がアプリをダウンロードするだけで、すでに所有しているデバイスで支払いに応じることができるビザの最初のサービスでした。2021年12月現在、54カ国で30万台以上のデバイスでTap to Phoneが利用されています。 携帯電話だけでなく、ビザ・アクセプタンス・クラウドにより、あらゆるPOSや接続デバイスでシームレスに支払いに応じ、後払い決済、不正管理、迅速販売店登録、高度なデータ分析などのさまざまな付加サービスを組み込むことができます。現在、北米、南米、欧州、アフリカ、アジア、オーストラリアで試験運用が行われており、米国のフィンテック企業Bleuとの連携によるオーストラリアの小売店やレストラン、NOBALテクノロジーズのスマートミラー、ブラジルの公共交通機関など、さまざまな使用事例に対応しています。 Bleuのセシエ・ボンシ社長兼CEOは、次のように述べています。「Bleuはビザと協力して、オーストラリアの企業に初めてシームレスな決済を提供します。平均的な事業主は、POSデバイスに1000ドルも費やし、さらに時間のかかる認証プロセスに非常に多くの時間とお金を費やしています。しかし、ビザ・アクセプタンス・クラウドに移行することで、従来のハードウエアの障壁とデバイスに縛られたカーネル認証の負担が無くなり、当社がサービスを提供する独立事業者は、接続されたあらゆるデバイスを通してお客さまに非接触型の支払い手段を簡単に提供することができます。」 NOBALテクノロジーズのビル・ロバーツCEOは、次のように述べています。「小売店は、オンラインおよび店舗での精算体験のスピードと利便性に対応するために、店舗での顧客体験を高めたいと考えています。NOBALのインテリジェント・ミラーは、ビザのVACと提携することで、組み込み型ハードウエア・モジュールに必要な費用と専門知識なしで当社のミラー上で決済体験を提供し、小売業の未来を新たな方法で後押しします。」 ボウマンはさらに次のように述べています。「VACは、すべての人に決済の受け付けを可能にするユニバーサルなプラットフォームであり、主要なテクノロジー・パートナーは自由に革新を起こすことができます。クラウド受け付けは、デジタル決済を提供したいと考える多くの小規模販売店の参加を促します。一方、ビザ・アクセプタンス・クラウドは、あらゆる形態と規模の企業にとって小売業の未来の中心となる先進的なショッピングと購買の体験を実現します。決済受け付けをクラウドに移行することで、決済エコシステム全体から多くのイノベーションが生まれる可能性が広がります。これは始まりに過ぎません。」 VACの詳細については、当社のウェブサイトをご覧いただくか、visaacceptancecloud@visa.comまでお問い合わせください。 ビザ・インクについて ビザ（NYSE：V）は、デジタル決済の世界的リーダーとして、200を超える国と地域の消費者、マーチャント、金融機関、政府機関の間で2150億件以上の決済取引を促進しています。その使命は、安全で信頼のおける革新的な決済ネットワークで世界を結び、消費者、企業、経済全体に利便性をもたらすことです。私たちは、あらゆる場所のあらゆる人を含む経済が、あらゆる場所のあらゆる人に力を与えると信じており、アクセスは未来のお金の移動の基礎となると考えています。詳細については、Visa.comをご覧ください。 本記者発表文の公式バージョンはオリジナル言語版です。翻訳言語版は、読者の便宜を図る目的で提供されたものであり、法的効力を持ちません。翻訳言語版を資料としてご利用になる際には、法的効力を有する唯一のバージョンであるオリジナル言語版と照らし合わせて頂くようお願い致します。"

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V) today announced that the U.S. Spending Momentum Index (SMI) was 102.4 in January (seasonally adjusted), down from a revised 109.4 in December. The Visa SMI is an economic indicator of the health of consumer spending. When the Visa SMI rises above 100, the consumer spending momentum is strengthening and when it falls below 100, the spending momentum is weakening as fewer consumers are spending more relative to the previous year. The SMI’s decline from December was due in large part to the rise in new COVID-19 cases with the spread of the Omicron variant. This current wave’s impact on spending was less than prior outbreaks, and for the most part has not derailed the recovery as more households continue to spend more than they did last year. Recent research from Visa Business and Economic Insights has further found that while consumer demand is less impacted by each successive wave, business disruptions have increased, contributing in part to rising inflation. “The SMI readings continue to reflect that there is a clear indication of spending growth moderation in January,” said Wayne Best, Visa’s Chief Economist. “That said, we expect more robust spending in the months ahead as virus concerns slowly subside.” By category, the SMI for discretionary purchases fell 3.9 points from the previous month to 100.6. The SMI for non-discretionary purchases fell 2.4 points to 97.4. On a regional basis, the SMI fell for all four regions of the country relative to last month but continued to signal positive spending momentum on a YoY basis. SMI readings in the South (101.5) and Midwest (101.8) were among the softest followed by the Northeast (102.0). The downshift in spending momentum in these three regions suggests that severe winter weather may have played a role in holding back consumer momentum for the month. The West continued to have the strongest SMI reading among the regions at 106.1. Please note, the changes noted above are relative to restated values for December. With this release, the seasonally adjusted SMI series for 2021 has been restated with the latest annual update to the seasonal adjustment factors. The revised series, the unadjusted series and seasonal adjustment factors can be found on our website. About the Visa SMI The Visa SMI is an economic indicator of the health of consumer spending. The SMI provides insight into what drives upturns and downturns in spending by measuring the breadth of the momentum supporting these trends. The Visa SMI is based on a sample of aggregated, depersonalized VisaNet data. Visa adjusts this data through proprietary methods to exclude factors that do not reflect spending momentum. The resulting sample data is then aggregated using a diffusion index framework where index values are scored from 0 to 200. When the Visa SMI rises above 100, the consumer spending momentum is strengthening and when it falls below 100, the spending momentum is weakening as fewer consumers are spending more relative to the previous year. The index is adjusted for day of week, month, holidays, and broad annual trends, and these seasonal adjustments are subject to revision each year. The Visa SMI does not take into account the volume of payments; nor does it rely on all Visa-branded credentials, and therefore does not reflect Visa operational or financial performance. It is intended for informational purposes only and is offered on an “as is” basis without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. Each SMI report is as of the publication date. Eligible Visa clients in the U.S. may access more detailed and customized insights at the national, regional and local spending level, including spending on the main categories of goods and services.

サンフランシスコ--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(ビジネスワイヤ) -- デジタル決済で世界をリードするビザ（NYSE：V）は本日、パンデミックの最盛期以来、不正行為がどのように進化してきたかについて最新の見解を発表しました。この中では、日常生活が対面型取引と電子商取引が融合した体験に戻る中で、犯罪者はオンラインとオフラインの脆弱性を同時に狙っていると指摘しています。 ビザの最高リスク管理責任者（CRO）であるポール・D・ファバラは、次のように述べています。「対面での商取引が大流行前のレベルに戻るにつれ、詐欺師は店舗の物理的な脆弱性ポイントを突く手法に戻る一方で、マルウエア、ランサムウエア、フィッシング攻撃などを通じた電子商取引の悪用を継続しています。実際、高いスキミング発生率が続いていて、2021年冬の既に上昇していたレベルを超えて伸びており、詐欺師は対面活動の高まりに乗じています。」 2つの新しい調査研究、すなわち ビザの脅威報告書（年2回発行）の最新版と、ビザと共同で本日発表されたマサチューセッツ工科大学（MIT）テクノロジー・レビュー・インサイトによる調査研究「Moving Money in a Digital World」（デジタル世界で動くお金）は、ポストパンデミック経済における新たな脅威と戻ってきた脅威を浮き彫りにしています。 COVID-19の流行初期において、不正はオンライン詐欺に集中していましたが、犯罪者は再び物理的な標的を捕らえるために範囲を広げており、現在では対面攻撃が増加傾向にあります。昨年は、ATMやPOS（販売時点情報管理）端末での物理的なスキミングなど、カード提示時の脅威が増加しましたが、この傾向は今後も続くと思われます。例えば、2021年6月から11月までの期間において、物理的スキミング装置が前12カ月間に比べて176%増加したことをビザが確認しています1。 革新的な詐欺師たちの格好の標的となっているのは、デジタル商取引と暗号の利用者 パンデミックによって大きく加速したデジタル商取引環境は依然として、サイバー犯罪者にとって最も都合のいい標的となっています。 ビザのグローバルリスクチームが調査した詐欺やデータ漏えい事件の4分の3近くは、電子商取引事業者が関与したもので、その多くはソーシャルエンジニアリングやランサムウエアによる攻撃でした。電子商取引プラットフォームやサードパーティーのコード統合を狙ったデジタルスキミング攻撃が多発しています。 これらの攻撃は、加盟店のウェブサイトやチェックアウトページにおける厳格なセキュリティー管理の必要性に光を当てるもので、機密性が求められるカード保有者環境で外部コードが有効化されないようにする必要があることを示しています。実際、MITテクノロジー・レビュー・インサイトによる報告書では、回答者の42%がセキュリティー対策は顧客にとって重要であると述べています。59%は、サイバーセキュリティーの脅威が拡大するデジタル決済における最大の課題であることを認めています。多くの回答者が、デジタルトークン（32%）、人工知能と強化認証（43%）のような高度なセキュリティー機能を優先しています。 脅威主体は、従来の通貨に対する攻撃だけでなく、暗号通貨ユーザー向けのブラウザー拡張ウオレットを狙う新種のマルウエアや、フィッシングやソーシャルエンジニアリングのスキームの革新など、暗号通貨ユーザーを詐取する新しい手口を採用しています。また、暗号ブリッジサービスも標的となっています。2022年1月から2月にかけて、さまざまなブリッジサービスの脆弱性を悪用したかなり大規模な盗難事件3件が発生し、サイバー窃盗団は4億ドル以上を手に入れました2。 ビザが約束するのは保護 サイバー犯罪が後を絶たない中、ビザは不正行為を軽減するための取り組みを拡大しています。過去5年間で、ビザはネットワークセキュリティーに90億ドル以上を投資しました。ビザは1000人以上の専任専門家を雇用し、マルウエア、ゼロデイ攻撃、インサイダー脅威からビザのネットワークを24時間365日体制で保護しています。また、ビザはAI対応機能と常勤の専門家を配備して当社のエコシステムを保護し、何十億ドルもの詐欺未遂を先見的に検知・防止しています。実際、ビザのAIによるリアルタイム監視は、過去12カ月間で42億ドルを超える不正決済額をブロックし、多くの人が不正取引の可能性という危険にさらされていることを知らずに済むようにしました。 決済詐欺対策報告書の詳細については、年2回発行の脅威報告書（visa.com）をご覧ください。MITテクノロジー・レビュー・インサイトによる報告書「Moving Money in a Digital World」の全文は、MITテクノロジー・レビューの「Moving Money in a Digital World」をご覧ください。 ビザについて ビザ（NYSE：V）は、デジタル決済の世界的リーダーとして、200を超える国と地域の消費者、マーチャント、金融機関、政府機関の間の取引を促進しています。その使命は、安全で信頼のおける革新的な決済ネットワークで世界を結び、消費者、企業、経済全体に利便性をもたらすことです。私たちは、あらゆる場所のあらゆる人を含む経済が、あらゆる場所のあらゆる人に力を与えると信じており、アクセスは未来のお金の移動の基礎となると考えています。詳細については、Visa.comをご覧ください。 ____________________________________________________ 1 ビザグローバルリスク調査、2021年6月～11月 2 ビザ決済詐欺対策報告書（年2回発行） 本記者発表文の公式バージョンはオリジナル言語版です。翻訳言語版は、読者の便宜を図る目的で提供されたものであり、法的効力を持ちません。翻訳言語版を資料としてご利用になる際には、法的効力を有する唯一のバージョンであるオリジナル言語版と照らし合わせて頂くようお願い致します。"

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Creators are driving a revolution in digital commerce and culture – producing content that entertains, engages, and educates online communities in powerful new ways. To serve this growing category of small business, Visa (NYSE: V) today announced the launch of the Visa Ready Creator Commerce program. The global initiative will help creator-centric platforms, such as social-commerce and video gaming companies, embed financial tools – like faster and more flexible payouts through Visa Direct and tipping and donations. “Creators are reshaping and expanding the small business ecosystem,” said Vanessa Colella, SVP and Global Head of Innovation and Digital Partnerships at Visa. “We want to harness the scale and reach of our network to help this community thrive. With the Visa Ready Creator Commerce program, we’re building a connective layer – bringing platforms and technology enablers together to deliver modern financial tools for the creator economy.” Helping Creators get Paid Faster The creator economy is one of the fastest-growing categories of small business, with more than 50 million artists, musicians and creators publishing content as a full- or part-time source of income.1 Social commerce, which includes creator-driven work, is expected to reach $1.2 trillion by 2025.2 For many small businesses, cash flow is a persistent challenge. Creators need to move capital quickly to build momentum and gain a following. In fact, 69% of creators surveyed by Visa say that waiting for payouts slows their momentum and 88% would engage more with a platform that offers instant payouts.3 Immediate access to earnings can help creators capitalize on viral moments, opening further opportunities for advertising and brand and partnerships. Through the Visa Ready Creator Commerce program, creator platforms can get connected to Visa Direct, enabling creators to access their funds in near real time.4 The ability to receive gifts, tips, and donations from fans and followers is another vital tool for creators in monetizing their work and growing their business. Through the Visa Ready program, qualifying platforms can enable tipping and subscriptions, and unlock new income streams for creators globally. Working with Industry Leaders To help bring these solutions and partnerships to the forefront, Visa is planning creator commerce solutions with companies such as Linktree, Marqeta, Rutter and SamCart. “Providing creators with new tools, resources and avenues to make money from their work online is more important than ever,” said Alex Zaccaria, CEO and Co-Founder, Linktree. “Linktree is proud to join forces with Visa to help creators unlock greater potential and opportunity and to empower all creators to curate, grow and monetize their world.” “The world is shifting, and for many, the traditional two-week pay cycle is becoming increasingly outdated – especially with the rise of the creator economy and social commerce,” said Simon Khalaf, Chief Product Officer, Marqeta. “Being able to access faster payouts has the potential to make a significant difference for creative businesses, and we’re proud to support Visa on the Visa Ready Creator Commerce program. Through Marqeta’s modern card issuing platform, we’re enabling instant issuance and digital payments that we believe sets up the creator economy for continued growth and success.” ""With the proliferation of e-commerce channels and tools, creators have to make sure their technology stack is integrated,"" said Peter Zhou, CEO, Rutter. “Rutter is quickly becoming the connective tissue across all tools, making it easier for creators to get started and leverage the tools they need. Turning on capabilities through Visa Ready Creator Commerce helps Rutter connect these tools for creators."" “Visa’s creator payouts solutions with SamCart will help creators get paid faster, which gives them the ability to reinvest in their business to fuel their growth. SamCart is a leading eCommerce platform built for creators, by creators. Our 40,000+ creators have collectively earned more than $2.8B with us,” said Brian Moran, Co-founder & Chief Strategy Officer of SamCart. “With this new Visa program, we will be able to help creators get access to those funds within minutes by simply using their Visa debit cards.” Continuing our Commitment to Creators The Visa Ready Creator Commerce program expands on Visa’s commitment to educating, empowering and enabling the entrepreneurs within the creator ecosystem. Earlier this year, Visa launched The Visa Creator Program, a one-year immersion experience to help creators navigate the technology behind NFTs and better understand how they can monetize their creativity using these new technologies.

SAN FRANCISCO, Kalifornien, USA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kreative treiben eine Revolution im digitalen Handel und in der Kultur voran: Sie produzieren Inhalte, die Online-Communitys auf eine innovative neue Art unterhalten, einbinden und weiterbilden. Mit Blick auf diese wachsende Kategorie von Kleinunternehmen hat Visa (NYSE: V) heute den Start des Visa Ready Creator Commerce-Programms bekannt gegeben. Die globale Initiative wird Plattformen mit Fokus auf Kreativunternehmen wie Social Commerce-Agenturen und Videospiel-Entwickler dabei unterstützen, Finanztools zu integrieren, um so von schnelleren und flexibleren Auszahlungen über Visa Direct sowie Trinkgeldern und Spenden zu profitieren. „Kreative transformieren und erweitern das Ökosystem für kleine Unternehmen“, berichtet Vanessa Colella, SVP und Global Head of Innovation and Digital Partnerships bei Visa. „Wir wollen das Potenzial und die Reichweite unseres Netzwerks nutzen, um dieser Community zum Erfolg zu verhelfen. Mit Visa Ready Creator Commerce schaffen wir eine verbindende Ebene – wir bringen Plattformen und Technologieanbieter zusammen, um moderne Finanztools für die Kreativwirtschaft bereitzustellen.“ Schnellere Auszahlungen an Kreative Die Kreativwirtschaft gehört zu den am schnellsten wachsenden Kategorien von Kleinunternehmen, mit mehr als 50 Millionen Künstlern, Musikern und Kreativen, die Inhalte als Einkommensquelle einer Voll- oder Teilzeittätigkeit veröffentlichen.1 Es wird erwartet, dass der Social Commerce-Sektor, der die Arbeit von Kreativen einschließt, bis 2025 etwa einen Umsatz von 1,2 Billionen US-Dollar erreichen wird.2 Viele Kleinunternehmen haben kontinuierlich mit Cashflow-Problemen zu kämpfen. Kreative müssen zügig Kapital bewegen, um Dynamik aufzubauen und ihre Anhängerschaft zu vergrößern. Tatsächlich berichten 69 % der von Visa befragten Kreativen, dass sie durch lange Wartezeiten auf Auszahlungen ausgebremst werden, und 88 % würden eine Plattform bevorzugen, die sofortige Auszahlungen bietet.3 Der sofortige Zugriff auf die Einnahmen kann Kreativen helfen, virale Erfolge zu nutzen, um weitere Potenziale durch Werbung, Marken und Partnerschaften zu erschließen. Über das Programm Visa Ready Creator Commerce können sich die Plattformen der Kreativbranche mit Visa Direct verbinden, sodass Kreative nahezu in Echtzeit über ihr Geld verfügen können.4 Die Möglichkeit, Geschenke, Trinkgelder und Spenden von Fans und Followern zu erhalten, ist ein weiteres wichtiges Tool, das Kreativen dabei hilft, ihre Arbeit zu monetarisieren und ihr Geschäft auszubauen. Durch das Visa Ready-Programm können qualifizierte Plattformen Trinkgelder und Abonnements ermöglichen und auf diese Weise neue Ertragsquellen für Kreative weltweit aktivieren. Kooperation mit Branchenführern Um diese Lösungen und Partnerschaften in den Mittelpunkt zu stellen, plant Visa das Angebot von Commerce-Lösungen für Kreative in Zusammenarbeit mit Unternehmen wie Linktree, Marqeta, Rutter und SamCart. „Es ist wichtiger denn je, Kreativen neue Tools, Ressourcen und Wege anzubieten, um online mit ihrer Arbeit Geld zu verdienen“, so Alex Zaccaria, CEO und Mitbegründer von Linktree. „Linktree ist stolz auf seine gemeinsamen Anstrengungen mit Visa, um Kreative dabei zu unterstützen, ein größeres Potenzial und mehr Gelegenheiten zu nutzen und neue Wege zu eröffnen, ihre Welt zu kuratieren, zu vergrößern und zu monetarisieren.“ „Die Welt ist in Bewegung, und für viele ist der bisherige zweiwöchige Zahlungszyklus überholt. Dies gilt besonders seit dem Aufstieg der Kreativwirtschaft und des Social Commerce“, kommentiert Simon Khalaf, Chief Product Officer bei Marqeta. „Schnellere Auszahlungen besitzen das Potenzial, einen bedeutenden Nutzen für kreative Unternehmen zu schaffen, und wir freuen uns darauf, Visa beim Visa Ready Creator Commerce-Programm zu unterstützen. Über die moderne Plattform von Marqeta ermöglichen wir die sofortige Ausstellung von Zahlungskarten und Ausführung digitaler Zahlungen, was unserer Überzeugung nach der Kreativbranche zu weiterem Wachstum und Erfolg verhelfen wird.“ „Angesichts der immer zahlreicheren E-Commerce-Kanäle und -Tools müssen Kreative darauf achten, dass ihr Technologie-Stack integriert ist“, erläutert Peter Zhou, CEO bei Rutter. „Rutter ist schnell zum Bindeglied all dieser Tools geworden und hat Kreativen den Einstieg erleichtert und Zugang zu den erforderlichen Tools verschafft. Die Aktivierung von Funktionen durch Visa Ready Creator Commerce hilft Rutter, diese Tools für Kreative miteinander zu verbinden.“ „Die Auszahlungslösungen, die Visa zusammen mit SamCart für Kreativunternehmen bereitstellt, werden Kreativen helfen, schneller Zahlungen zu erhalten, die sie in ihr Geschäft reinvestieren können, um ihr Wachstum zu fördern. SamCart ist eine führende E-Commerce-Plattform, die von Machern für Macher entwickelt wurde. Unsere mehr als 40.000 Kreativen haben zusammen mehr als 2,8 Milliarden US-Dollar mit uns verdient“, so Brian Moran, Mitbegründer und Chief Strategy Officer bei SamCart. „Mit diesem neuen Visa-Programm können wir Kreativen helfen, innerhalb von Minuten Zugriff auf diese Beträge zu erhalten, indem sie einfach ihre Visa-Debitkarte einsetzen.“ Verstärkung unserer Anstrengungen für Kreative Das Visa Ready Creator Commerce-Programm erweitert den Einsatz von Visa für die Ausbildung, Unterstützung und Befähigung von Unternehmerinnen und Unternehmern innerhalb des Ökosystems der Kreativbranche. Anfang dieses Jahres hat Visa das Visa Creator Program gestartet – ein einjähriges Programm, das Kreativen die Nutzung der NFT-Technologien erleichtert und Wege aufzeigt, wie sie ihre Kreativität mithilfe dieser neuen Möglichkeiten monetisieren können. Weitere Informationen über das Visa Ready Creator Commerce-Programm und die Anmeldung finden Sie auf unserer Website. Über Visa Ready Visa Ready ist ein langjähriges Partnerprogramm, das mehr als 11 Produktvertikalen abdeckt und Unternehmen bei der Entwicklung und Einführung von Zahlungslösungen unterstützt, die den globalen Sicherheits- und Funktionsstandards von Visa entsprechen.

Pour satisfaire les besoins de cette catégorie grandissante de petites entreprises, Visa (NYSE : V) vient d'annoncer le lancement du programme « Visa Ready Creator Commerce ».

Les créateurs doivent pouvoir mobiliser rapidement leurs capitaux pour impulser une dynamique et engranger des adeptes. 69 % des créateurs interrogés par Visa déclarent qu'attendre les paiements casse leur dynamique et 88 % d'entre eux s'impliqueraient davantage avec une plateforme offrant des paiements instantanés.3 Grâce à un accès immédiat à leurs recettes, les créateurs pourront capitaliser sur les moments viraux et ainsi saisir de nouvelles opportunités en termes de publicité, de marque et de partenariats. Par le biais du programme « Visa Ready Creator Commerce », les plateformes de créateurs pourront se connecter à Visa Direct et les créateurs accéder à leurs fonds quasiment en temps réel.4 La possibilité de recevoir des cadeaux, des pourboires et des dons de la part des fans/followers est une autre fonctionnalité très utile aux créateurs pour monnayer leur travail et développer leur activité. Avec le programme « Visa Ready », les plateformes éligibles pourront autoriser les pourboires et les abonnements et débloquer de nouvelles sources de revenus pour les créateurs du monde entier.

La plateforme moderne d'émission de cartes de Marqeta permet une émission instantanée et des paiements numériques qui préparent l'économie des créateurs à une croissance et un succès continus ». « Avec la démultiplication des canaux et outils de commerce électronique, les créateurs doivent veiller à ce que leur pile technologique soit intégrée » a déclaré Peter Zhou, PDG de Rutter. « Rutter s'impose rapidement comme le tissu conjonctif couvrant l'ensemble des outils et permettant aux créateurs de démarrer leur activité plus facilement et d'employer les outils dont ils ont besoin. Les fonctionnalités offertes par le programme « Visa Ready Creator Commerce » aident Rutter à connecter ces outils au profit des créateurs ». « Les solutions de paiement des créateurs de Visa avec SamCart accélèreront les paiements aux créateurs, lesquels pourront réinvestir les capitaux dans leur activité en vue d'alimenter sa croissance. SamCart est une plateforme d'e-commerce de premier plan élaborée par des créateurs pour les créateurs. Nos plus de 40 000 créateurs ont engrangé collectivement plus de 2,8 milliards de dollars par notre entremise » a déclaré Brian Moran, cofondateur et directeur stratégique de SamCart. « Grâce au nouveau programme Visa, nous pourrons aider les créateurs à accéder à ces fonds en quelques minutes en utilisant simplement leur carte de débit Visa ».

舊金山--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美國商業資訊)--創作者正在推動數位商業和文化領域的變革——以強大的新方式製作出能夠娛樂、吸引和教育線上社群的內容。為服務這一不斷成長的小型業務類別，Visa (NYSE: V)今天宣佈推出Visa Ready Creator Commerce計畫。這一全球性計畫將協助社群商務和電玩遊戲公司等以創作者為中心的平臺嵌入金融工具，如透過Visa Direct更快、更靈活地獲得收益，以及打賞和捐贈功能。 Visa資深副總裁兼創新與數位夥伴關係全球負責人Vanessa Colella表示：「創作者正在重塑和擴大小型業務生態系統。我們希望利用Visa網路的規模和影響力來協助這個社群蓬勃發展。透過Visa Ready Creator Commerce計畫，我們正在建構一個連接層，將平臺和科技推動者聚集在一起，為創作者經濟提供現代金融工具。」 幫助創作者更快獲得報酬 創作者經濟是成長最快的小型業務類別之一，超過5,000萬名藝術家、音樂家和創作者將發佈內容作為專職或兼職收入來源。1包括創作者驅動工作在內的社群商務預計到2025年將達到1.2兆美元。2 對於許多小企業來說，現金流是持續的挑戰。創作者需要快速調動資金，從而建立動力並獲得追隨者。事實上，在接受Visa調查的創作者中，69%的人表示等待付款會減緩他們的發展動力，88%的人更願意與提供即時付款的平臺互動。3立即獲得收益可以協助創作者利用爆紅時刻，為廣告、品牌和合作關係開闢更多機會。透過Visa Ready Creator Commerce計畫，創作者平臺可以連接到Visa Direct，從而幫助創作者近乎即時地獲取資金。4 接收粉絲和追隨者的禮物、打賞和捐贈功能是創作者用作品賺取收入和促進業務成長的另一個重要工具。透過Visa Ready計畫，符合條件的平臺可以提供打賞和訂閱功能，為全球創作者開啟新的收入來源。 與業界領導者合作 為了將這些解決方案和合作關係推向最前線，Visa正在與Linktree、Marqeta、Rutter和SamCart等公司規劃創作者商務解決方案。 Linktree共同創辦人兼執行長Alex Zaccaria表示：「為創作者提供新的工具、資源和途徑，協助他們利用自己的作品在網上賺錢，比以往更加重要。Linktree很榮幸能與Visa合作，幫助創作者釋出更大的潛力和機會，並支援所有創作者規劃、發展他們的世界，並從中賺取收入。」 Marqeta產品長Simon Khalaf表示：「世界正在改變，特別是隨著創作者經濟和社群商務的興起，對許多人來說，傳統的兩週支付週期正變得越來越過時。能夠快速獲得收益有可能為創意企業帶來重大影響，我們很自豪能夠就Visa Ready Creator Commerce計畫為Visa提供支援。透過Marqeta的現代發卡平臺，我們能夠提供即時發卡和數位支付。我們相信，這將為創作者經濟的持續成長和成功奠定基礎。」 Rutter執行長Peter Zhou表示：「隨著電子商務通路和工具的激增，創作者必須確保他們的技術堆疊得到整合。Rutter正在迅速成為所有工具的連接組織，協助創作者更容易開始並利用他們需要的工具。透過Visa Ready Creator Commerce開啟功能有助於Rutter為創作者連接這些工具。」 SamCart共同創辦人兼策略長 Brian Moran 表示：「Visa與SamCart打造的創作者支付解決方案將幫助創作者更快地獲得報酬，使他們有能力再投資於自身業務以促進成長。SamCart是由創作者專為創作者打造的一流電子商務平臺。我們有4萬多名創作者，集體賺得的收入超過28億美元。借助新的Visa計畫，我們將能夠幫助創作者運用Visa金融卡在幾分鐘內獲得這些資金。」 延續我們對創作者的承諾 Visa Ready Creator Commerce計畫擴大了Visa在創作者生態系統中培養、賦能和支援創業者的承諾。今年稍早，Visa推出了Visa Creator Program，這是為期一年的沉浸式體驗，旨在幫助創作者掌握非同質化代幣(NFT)背後的技術，更加理解如何利用這些新科技為自己的創意創造收入。 如欲瞭解關於Visa Ready Creator Commerce計畫的更多資訊（包括如何加入的詳情），請瀏覽我們的網頁。 關於Visa Ready Visa Ready是歷史悠久的合作夥伴計畫，擁有超過11個產品垂直領域，旨在協助企業建立和推出符合Visa全球安全和功能標準的支付解決方案。Visa Ready擁有超過500個合作夥伴和160個解決方案，支付創新者可以借助Visa Ready提供的平臺，向市場推廣他們的解決方案（客戶也可以透過這個平臺，找到符合他們支付需求的合作夥伴解決方案）。請點選此處瞭解關於這項計畫的更多資訊。 關於Visa Visa (NYSE: V)是數位支付領域的全球領導者，為200多個國家和地區的消費者、商家、金融機構和政府機構之間的支付交易提供便利。我們的使命是透過創新、便捷、可靠和安全的支付網路連接世界，促進個人、企業和經濟的蓬勃發展。我們相信經濟與每個人息息相關並能改善每個人的生活，並認為連通性是未來貨幣流動的基礎。如欲瞭解更多資訊，請造訪Visa.com。 ____________________ 1 SignalFire，「創作者經濟市場地圖」。 (Creator Economy Market Map.) 2 埃森哲，「購物和社群商務的未來」。 (The future of shopping and social commerce.) 3 市場調查（2020年3月）。受Visa委託，由Raconteur對750個市場賣家進行調查，其中224個賣家為數位創作者。 4 實際資金可用性因接收資金的金融機構、收款帳戶類型、地區以及交易是否跨境而不同。 免責聲明：本公告之原文版本乃官方授權版本。譯文僅供方便瞭解之用，煩請參照原文，原文版本乃唯一具法律效力之版本。"

サンフランシスコ--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- クリエイターは、デジタルコマースと文化に革命を起こし、オンライン・コミュニティーを楽しませ、参加させ、知識を与えるコンテンツを強力な新たな方法で制作しています。ビザ（NYSE：V）は本日、この成長するスモールビジネス分野に対応するため、Visa Readyクリエイター・コマース・プログラムを開始したことを発表しました。このグローバルなイニシアチブは、ソーシャルコマースやビデオゲーム会社などのクリエイター中心のプラットフォームが金融ツールを組み込めるよう支援するものです。例えば、ビザ・ダイレクトを介してより迅速かつ柔軟に支払を行い、チップや寄付を送金します。 ビザのシニア・バイスプレジデント兼イノベーション・デジタル・パートナーシップ担当グローバル責任者のバネッサ・コレラは、次のように述べています。「クリエイターは、スモールビジネスのエコシステムを再構築し拡大させています。当社は、自社ネットワークの規模と範囲を活かして、このコミュニティーの発展を支援したいと考えています。Visa Readyクリエイター・コマース・プログラムにより、接続層を構築して、プラットフォームとテクノロジー実現要因を一つにし、クリエイター・エコノミー向けの最新の金融ツールを提供します。」 クリエイターが迅速に支払を受けられるよう支援 クリエイター・エコノミーは、最も急成長するスモールビジネス分野の1つであり、5000万人以上のアーティスト、ミュージシャン、クリエイターがフルタイムまたはパートタイムの収入源としてコンテンツを公開しています1。クリエイター主導の活動を含むソーシャルコマースは、2025年には1兆2千億ドルに達すると予想されています2。 多くのスモールビジネスにとっては、キャッシュフローが常に課題となります。クリエイターは迅速に資金を移動させて、勢いを付け、ファンを獲得する必要があります。実際、ビザが調査したクリエイターの69%は、支払が遅いと勢いが落ちると答えており、88%は即時支払を提供するプラットフォームともっと関わりたいと考えています3。即座に収益を得ることで、クリエイターは口コミで広がる瞬間を生かし、広告やブランドとパートナーシップの機会をさらに広げることができます。Visa Readyクリエイター・コマース・プログラムにより、クリエイターのプラットフォームはビザ・ダイレクトに接続され、これにより、クリエイターはほぼリアルタイムに自分の資金を利用できるようになります4。 ファンやフォロワーからギフト、チップ、寄付を受け取ることができる機能は、クリエイターが作品を収益化してビジネスを成長させる上で欠かせないもう1つのツールです。Visa Readyプログラムを利用することで、条件を満たしたプラットフォームは、チップ支払いや定期購入を実現し、世界全体でクリエイターに新たな収入源の道を開くことができます。 業界リーダーとの協働 これらのソリューションとパートナーシップを最前線に押し出すため、ビザはリンクツリー、マルケタ、ラター、サムカートといった企業と共同でクリエイター・コマース・ソリューションを計画しています。 リンクツリーの最高経営責任者（CEO）で共同創業者のアレックス・ザッカリア氏は、次のように述べています。「クリエイターに、オンライン上の作品から収益を上げるための新たなツール、リソース、手段を提供することはこれまで以上に重要になっています。リンクツリーは、ビザと協力し、クリエイターがより大きな可能性と機会を引き出し、すべてのクリエイターが自分の世界をキュレートし、成長させ、収益化できるよう支援することを誇りに思っています。」 マルケタのサイモン・カーラフ最高製品責任者は、次のように述べています。「世界は変化しており、多くの人にとって、従来の2週間の支払サイクルはますます時代遅れになっています。特にクリエイター・エコノミーとソーシャルコマースの台頭により、その傾向は強まっています。より迅速な支払を受けることは、クリエイティブなビジネスにとって大きな変化をもたらす可能性があります。Visa Readyクリエイター・コマース・プログラムでビザを支援できることを誇りに思います。マルケタは、自社の最新のカード発行プラットフォームを介して、即時発行とデジタル決済を実現しています。これは、継続的な成長と成功に向けてクリエイター・エコノミーを構築するものだと考えています。」 ラターのピーター・ツォウCEOは、次のように述べています。「eコマースのチャネルとツールの急増により、クリエイターは自らのテクノロジー・スタックを確実に統合しなければなりません。ラターは、あらゆるツールをつなぐ組織に急速になりつつあり、クリエイターがビジネスを開始し、必要なツールを利用できるようにしています。Visa Readyクリエイター・コマースの機能を活用することで、ラターはクリエイターのためにこれらのツールをつなぐことができます。」 サムカート共同創業者で最高戦略責任者のブライアン・モラン氏は、次のように述べています。「ビザのクリエイター支払ソリューションとサムカートが連携することで、クリエイターはより迅速に支払を受けることができます。その結果、自らのビジネスに再投資して成長を促進することができます。サムカートは、クリエイターのためにクリエイターによって構築された先進的eコマース・プラットフォームです。サムカートの4万人を超えるクリエイターは、合計でこれまでに28億ドル以上の収益をあげています。この新しいビザのプログラムにより、クリエイターがビザのデビットカードを使うだけで数分以内にその資金を手に入れられるよう支援することができます。」 クリエイターへの取り組みを継続 Visa Readyクリエイター・コマース・プログラムは、クリエイター・エコシステムの起業家を教育し、力を与え、可能性を与えるというビザの取り組みを発展させたものです。ビザは今年初め、ビザ・クリエイター・プログラムを開始しました。これは、クリエイターがNFTの背後にある技術を活用してこの新技術を使用して自らの創造性を収益化する方法をより適切に理解できるよう支援する1年間の没入型体験です。 Visa Readyクリエイター・コマース・プログラムと、その参加方法の詳細情報については、当社ウェブサイトをご覧ください。 Visa Readyについて Visa Readyは、11以上の製品分野にわたる以前からのパートナー・プログラムです。企業がビザのグローバルなセキュリティーと機能性基準を満たす決済ソリューションを構築して始動できるよう支援しています。Visa Readyは、500社以上のパートナーと160以上のソリューションを擁しており、これらの決済イノベーターが市場に自社のソリューションを販促するためのプラットフォーム（また、クライアントが自社の決済ニーズに適合したパートナー・ソリューションを特定できるプラットフォーム）です。このプログラムの詳細はこちらをご覧ください。 ビザについて ビザ（NYSE：V）は、デジタル決済の世界的リーダーとして、200を超える国と地域の消費者、マーチャント、金融機関、政府機関の間の取引を促進しています。その使命は、安全で信頼のおける革新的な決済ネットワークで世界を結び、消費者、企業、経済全体に利便性をもたらすことです。私たちは、あらゆる場所のあらゆる人を含む経済が、あらゆる場所のあらゆる人に力を与えると信じており、アクセスは未来のお金の移動の基礎となると考えています。詳細については、Visa.comをご覧ください。 ____________________ 1 SignalFire, “Creator Economy Market Map.” 2 Accenture, “The future of shopping and social commerce.” 3 マーケットプレイス調査（2020年3月）。ビザの依頼を受け、Raconteurがマーケットプレイスの販売者750人（うち224人がデジタルクリエイター）を対象に実施。 4 実際の資金の反映は、受取金融機関、受取口座の種類、地域、国内取引かクロスボーダー取引かによって異なります。 本記者発表文の公式バージョンはオリジナル言語版です。翻訳言語版は、読者の便宜を図る目的で提供されたものであり、法的効力を持ちません。翻訳言語版を資料としてご利用になる際には、法的効力を有する唯一のバージョンであるオリジナル言語版と照らし合わせて頂くようお願い致します。"

旧金山--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美国商业资讯)--创作者正在推动数字商业和文化领域的变革——以强大的新方式制作出能够娱乐、吸引和教育在线社区的内容。为服务这一不断增长的小型业务类别，Visa (NYSE: V)今天宣布推出Visa Ready Creator Commerce计划。这一全球性计划将帮助社交商务和视频游戏公司等以创作者为中心的平台嵌入金融工具，如通过Visa Direct更快、更灵活地获得收益，以及打赏和捐赠功能。 Visa高级副总裁兼创新与数字伙伴关系全球负责人Vanessa Colella表示：“创作者正在重塑和拓展小型业务生态系统。我们希望利用Visa网络的规模和影响力来帮助这个社区蓬勃发展。通过Visa Ready Creator Commerce计划，我们正在构建一个连接层，将平台和技术推动者聚集在一起，为创作者经济提供现代金融工具。” 帮助创作者更快获得报酬 创作者经济是增长最快的小型业务类别之一，超过5,000万名艺术家、音乐家和创作者将发布内容作为全职或兼职收入来源。1包括创作者驱动工作在内的社交商务预计到2025年将达到1.2万亿美元。2 对于许多小企业来说，现金流是一个持续的挑战。创作者需要快速调动资金，从而建立势头并获得追随者。事实上，在接受Visa调查的创作者中，69%的人表示等待付款会减缓他们的发展势头，88%的人更愿意与提供即时付款的平台进行互动。3立即获得收益可以帮助创作者利用病毒式传播时刻为广告、品牌和合作关系开辟更多机会。借助Visa Ready Creator Commerce计划，创作者平台可以连接到Visa Direct，从而帮助创作者近乎实时地获取资金。4 接收粉丝和追随者礼物、打赏和捐赠的功能是创作者将作品变现和发展业务的另一个重要工具。通过Visa Ready计划，符合条件的平台可以提供打赏和订阅功能，为全球创作者解锁新的收入来源。 与行业领导者合作 为将这些解决方案和合作关系推向前沿，Visa正在与Linktree、Marqeta、Rutter和SamCart等公司规划创作者商务解决方案。 Linktree联合创始人兼首席执行官Alex Zaccaria表示：“为创作者提供新的工具、资源和途径，帮助他们利用自己的作品在网上赚钱，是一件比以往任何时候都重要的事情。Linktree很荣幸与Visa联手，帮助创作者释放更大的潜力和机会，并支持所有创作者规划、发展他们的世界，并从中变现。” Marqeta首席产品官Simon Khalaf表示：“世界正在发生变化，特别是随着创作者经济和社交商务的兴起，对许多人来说，传统的两周支付周期正变得越来越过时。能够快速获得收益有可能为创意企业带来巨大的变化，我们很自豪能够在Visa Ready Creator Commerce计划中为Visa提供支持。Marqeta通过现代发卡平台提供即时发卡和数字支付。我们相信，这将为创作者经济的持续增长和成功奠定基础。” Rutter首席执行官Peter Zhou表示：“随着电子商务渠道和工具的激增，创作者必须确保他们的技术堆栈得到整合。Rutter正在迅速成为所有工具的连接组织，帮助创作者更容易开始并利用他们需要的工具。通过Visa Ready Creator Commerce开启功能有助于Rutter为创作者连接这些工具。” SamCart联合创始人兼首席战略官 Brian Moran 表示：“Visa与SamCart打造的创作者支付解决方案将帮助创作者更快地获得报酬，帮助他们实现业务再投资和增长的循环。SamCart是由创作者专为创作者打造的领先电子商务平台。我们的4万多名创作者与我们一起获得了超过28亿美元的收入。借助新的Visa计划，我们将能够帮助创作者通过Visa借记卡在几分钟内获得这些资金。” 延续我们对创作者的承诺 Visa Ready Creator Commerce计划扩展了Visa在创作者生态系统中培养、赋能和支持创业者的承诺。今年早些时候，Visa推出了Visa Creator Program，这是一个为期一年的沉浸式体验，旨在帮助创作者掌握非同质化代币(NFT)背后的技术，更好地理解如何利用这些新技术将自己的创意变现。 如需了解关于Visa Ready Creator Commerce计划的更多信息（包括有关如何加入的详情），请访问我们的网页。 关于Visa Ready Visa Ready是一个历史悠久的合作伙伴计划，拥有超过11个产品垂直领域，旨在帮助企业建立和推出符合Visa全球安全和功能标准的支付解决方案。Visa Ready拥有超过500个合作伙伴和160个解决方案，支付创新者可以借助Visa Ready提供的平台向市场推广他们的解决方案（客户也可以通过这个平台找到符合他们支付需求的合作伙伴解决方案）。点击此处了解更多关于这个计划的信息。 关于Visa Visa (NYSE: V)是数字支付领域的全球领导者，为200多个国家和地区的消费者、商家、金融机构和政府机构之间的支付交易提供便利。我们的使命是通过创新、便捷、可靠和安全的支付网络连接世界，促进个人、企业和经济的蓬勃发展。我们相信经济与每个人息息相关并能改善每个人的生活，并认为连通性是未来货币流动的基础。如需了解更多信息，请访问Visa.com。 ____________________ 1 SignalFire，“创作者经济市场地图。”(Creator Economy Market Map.) 2 埃森哲，“购物和社交商务的未来。” (The future of shopping and social commerce.) 3 市场调查（2020年3月）。受Visa委托，由Raconteur对750个市场卖家展开调查，其中224个卖家为数字创作者。 4 实际资金可用性因接收资金的金融机构、收款账户类型、地区以及交易是否跨境而不同。 免责声明：本公告之原文版本乃官方授权版本。译文仅供方便了解之用，烦请参照原文，原文版本乃唯一具法律效力之版本。"

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V) is partnering with Thunes to help individuals and small businesses move money internationally to 78 digital wallet providers, reaching 1.5 billion digital wallets across 44 countries and territories. This partnership will now expand Visa Direct’s reach to nearly 7 billion endpoints, including more than 3 billion cards, over 2 billion accounts and 1.5 billion digital wallets. For the unbanked individuals in emerging markets, digital wallets are gaining traction as an empowering first entry point to the financial system. Consumers are not required to have a card or account to load or receive funds directly to their digital wallet, opening the potential for greater financial inclusion and enabling underserved populations opportunities to access financial products that meaningfully impact how they live and work. “From an agricultural worker in Bangladesh to a young professional in London who is looking to send money to family overseas, Visa strives to create more ways for individuals and SMBs to participate in the global economy,” said Ruben Salazar Genovez, Global Head of Visa Direct. “We are thrilled to collaborate with Thunes and help enable quick and simple access to the financial system to more customers around the world who may use digital wallets as their primary financial instrument.” Through this collaboration, Thunes’ B2B payments platform will connect to Visa Direct, adding a cross-border send-to-wallet capability to 78 digital wallet providers that are already integrated with Thunes. Through a simple integration of Visa Direct, financial institutions, governments, neobanks and money transfer operators will be able to utilize the new functionality to enable consumers and small businesses to send funds to markets across Africa, Asia, and Latin America where wallets may be the go-to payment method. “We are thrilled that of all the payment companies, Visa, a global leader in payments, is working with Thunes on this launch,” said Peter De Caluwe, CEO of Thunes. “Through the combined power of Visa’s scale and Thunes’ payment infrastructure, this collaboration has the potential to help develop a new global era for inclusive and accessible global payments.” With the addition of 1.5 billion digital wallets to its reach, Visa Direct now helps provide access to nearly 7 billion cards, accounts and digital wallets combined, across more than 190 geographies, supporting 160 currencies, connecting to 16 card-based networks, 66 domestic Automated Clearing House (ACH) schemes, 11 Real-Time Payment (RTP) networks and five payment gateways. About Visa Inc. Visa (NYSE: V) is a world leader in digital payments, facilitating payments transactions between consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities across more than 200 countries and territories. Our mission is to connect the world through the most innovative, convenient, reliable and secure payments network, enabling individuals, businesses and economies to thrive.

Visa will grant all auction proceeds to Street Child United, a charitable organization incorporated and operating in the United Kingdom, whose mission is to tackle the widespread stigma that street-connected children face globally. “The FIFA World Cup™ is one of the most anticipated sporting events in the world, and we are incredibly excited to give fans a new way to engage with this epic event,” said Steven Kalifowitz, Chief Marketing Officer at Crypto.com. “We are thrilled to partner with Visa in bringing Visa Masters of Movement to life and offering fans the opportunity to create and collect the most unique collectibles at FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ that will live forever on the blockchain.” Fans Become Artists at FIFA Fan Festival™ At the center of the FIFA Fan Festival™ in Doha (November 19-December 18), Visa invites thousands of fans to create their own legendary moves in the free-standing Visa Masters of Movement space.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Following a successful first year, Visa (NYSE: V) announced the second class of its Visa Black Scholars and Jobs Program, awarding 75 incoming first-year college students with scholarship assistance for up to four years, ongoing learning opportunities and one-on-one mentorship with Visa team members throughout their college experience. Visa Black Scholars also will participate in a Black Scholars Summit and be offered opportunities for paid internships, and those who meet program requirements will be invited to join Visa full-time after graduation. Since its August 2021 launch, the Visa Black Scholars and Jobs Program has supported 126 students as part of the company’s five-year $10 million investment in line with Visa’s inclusion and diversity efforts to drive lasting positive change. “It has been inspiring to see the positive effects that the Visa Black Scholars and Jobs Program has had on our scholars and company,” said Michelle Gethers, Visa’s Chief Diversity Officer and Head of Corporate Responsibility. “In addition to scholarship assistance, scholars are offered opportunities to strengthen their educational and professional development. The Visa Black Scholars and Jobs Program is one of Visa’s many commitments to build our inclusive culture and purpose-driven change for generations to come.” Through the program, Visa Black Scholars are given access to C-suite executives, industry leaders and the greater Visa community to expand their networks and professional growth. In June 2022, Visa welcomed the inaugural class to the first-ever Black Scholars Summit for a week of inspiring sessions, workshops and collaboration. Jonathan Whyte, scholar recipient from Winter Springs, FL, said that the opportunity “to hear the speaker’s insights into what they believe are the keys to their own success was really useful and will help me a lot in the future.” “At Visa, we foster a people-centric culture of continuous growth, learning and development,” said Kelly Mahon Tullier, Vice Chair, Chief People and Corporate Affairs Officer. “As someone who is passionate about mentoring, enabling and inspiring others in their careers, it has been rewarding to see our scholars grow through the opportunities provided by this important program. Equally important are the lessons they have taught us along the way. The Visa Black Scholars and Jobs Program is a perfect example of how Visa is actively living our purpose to uplift everyone, everywhere.” This summer, 32 scholars from the inaugural class will intern in Visa offices across the U.S., supporting all areas of the business, from software engineering and product development, to marketing, finance, and people teams. Due to the U.S. program’s success, Visa has expanded to develop similar programs for diverse students in the United Kingdom, Spain, Brazil and South Africa. The Visa Scholarship Programme UK, Visa Scholarship Programme Spain, Visa Brazil Black Scholarship program and the Learnership Program in South Africa increase access to the necessary tools, knowledge, training and network opportunities for the next generation of diverse leaders.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Visa announced it is partnering with PayPal and Venmo to pilot Visa+, an innovative service that aims to help individuals move money quickly and securely between different person-to-person (P2P) digital payment apps. Later this year, Venmo and PayPal users in the US will be able to start moving money seamlessly between the two platforms. Visa+ will not require users to have a Visa card; instead, by setting up a personalized payment address linked to their Venmo or PayPal account, individuals using either app will be able to receive and send payments quickly and securely between the platforms. As part of a joint effort to build interoperability across payment platforms, Visa partners DailyPay, i2c, TabaPay and Western Union, will also integrate Visa+ within their platforms. Through this collaboration, Visa+ will expand its reach and enable more use cases, including gig, creator and marketplace payouts. Participating digital wallets, neo-banks and other payment apps, reaching millions of US users, will be able to enable interoperability through Visa+. “Consumers continue to seek simple and seamless ways to digitally move money between friends and family, including the ability to send money between different payment platforms,” said Chris Newkirk, Global Head of New Payment Flows at Visa. “We are thrilled to partner with like-minded innovators to broaden the reach of P2P payments across platforms. Through this collaboration, Visa+ can help break down barriers for payment app users as they connect, engage and move money.” According to industry group U.S. Faster Payments Council, interoperability is considered one of the most important topics in the payments industry.1 Visa+ serves as a bridge that helps bring a new level of convenience, simplicity and reach to the world of person-to-person payments. “We are honored to partner with Visa on our mission to make Earned Wage Access available to everyone, everywhere,"" said Kevin Coop, CEO, DailyPay. “By empowering workers with choice and control over their earned pay, we enable them to pay bills on time, spend, save, or invest on their own schedule. And through participating wallets, their earned wages could be available the moment they earn it using DailyPay and Visa+.” “We’re excited to be a part of this forward-thinking initiative and to continue to be an innovation partner to Visa,” said Ava Kelly, chief product officer for i2c Inc., adding, “We continuously strive to help banks, credit unions and fintechs remove friction from the customer experience and make the ‘how’ of moving money an afterthought.” “We started TabaPay with a goal to make instant payments simple, reliable and universal. Visa+ is significant progress towards achieving that goal,” said Tim Astanov, Head of Commercialization at TabaPay. “As one of the largest processors for Visa Direct, we are excited to expand our relationship with Visa. This new and innovative solution for the fintech community will remove friction and make instant money movement easier for our clients and their customers.” “Western Union’s mission is to deliver accessible financial services around the world,” said Thomas Mazzaferro, Chief Data and Innovation Officer at Western Union. “We are delighted to partner with Visa on its new product launch of Visa+ to deliver upon that mission and offer new innovative payment options for our customers.” Visa+ is expected to launch for US consumers with select partners in late 2023. General availability is planned for mid-2024. For more information, visit our webpage and learn more about how Visa+ works: visa.com/visa+.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V), the Exclusive Payment Service Partner of the FIFA Women’s World Cup Australia & New Zealand 2023™, joined 100 days to go celebrations today to unveil the 33 women football players it is supporting through its Team Visa program. This new group of Team Visa athletes – from 27 markets – represents the largest number of women footballers in Team Visa’s history. The program extends Visa’s commitment to connecting the world through sport and championing women athletes at a time when women’s football continues to reach new heights. “We’ve witnessed historic shifts for equity and equality in football in recent years, and Visa is committed to providing these resilient women with the tools and resources necessary to continue working for a level playing field,” said Andrea Fairchild, senior vice president and head of sponsorships, Visa. “We are proud to welcome this incredible group of athletes into our Team Visa family. We look forward to seeing them unlock their greatest potential.” Athlete Spotlights from Around the World The footballers on Team Visa are helping change the game on and off the pitch. On the pitch, players such as Ellie Carpenter (Australia), Debinha (Brazil), Christine Sinclair (Canada), and Ghizlane Chebbak (Morocco) have each made historic strides for the game, earning various awards, ""firsts” and international records. Off the pitch, Team Visa athletes are blazing their own trails: Miriam Mayorga (Argentina) does double duty as a doctor; Sam Mewis’ (U.S.A.) leadership led to securing equal pay for her team; Huynh Nhu (Vietnam) broke down barriers as the first Vietnamese footballer to play abroad; and Didem Karagenc (Turkey) is a physical education teacher starting a grassroots football camp for local girls. “Joining Team Visa with this incredible group makes this experience even more surreal,” said Catarina Macario, U.S. Women’s National Team midfielder. “While we might go head-to-head on the pitch, we are all working together on the goal of a better future for women’s football and Visa is supporting us every step of the way.” Team Visa: A Platform to Inspire Since 2000, Team Visa has lent crucial support to more than 500 athletes around the globe providing them with a platform to tell their inspiring stories. To help athletes thrive personally and professionally, the program provides financial support, assistance with philanthropic endeavors, financial literacy tools, and mental health and wellness resources. Team Visa athletes are selected for the program based on their personal journeys, athletic achievements, community involvement, and alignment with Visa’s core values of equality, access, and inclusion. Supporting Women Footballers Year-Round For more than 15 years, Visa’s investment in women’s football has focused on increasing visibility for the sport at all levels, driving acceptance, and future-proofing the game. Visa is the first FIFA Women’s Football Partner, the first standalone sponsor of UEFA Women’s Football, and sponsor of national teams including the U.S. Soccer Federation and Mexican Football Federation. Off the pitch, The Second Half is a career development program to support European women footballers as they consider careers beyond football. As attention turns toward Australia and New Zealand this July, Visa will cheer on its Team Visa athletes participating in the tournament, present the fan-voted Visa Player of the Match trophy at each match, and implement innovative payment experiences throughout official venues.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V), a world leader in digital payments, was one of nine finalists tasked with exploring innovative blockchain-based use cases for the Real Digital (Brazil’s central bank-issued digital currency, or CBDC) as part of the most recent LIFT Challenge. The company partnered with Agrotoken, Microsoft, and Sinqia to develop its submission. After months of collaborative work between each company’s world-class researchers and engineers, Visa and its team are excited to share the results of their LIFT Challenge participation — a programmable finance platform for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), particularly farmers, that is designed to enable greater access to global capital markets, facilitate interoperability between currencies, improve operational processes, and uncover new growth opportunities. Small Businesses Drive Global Economies SMEs are often beholden to localized market structure in negotiating favorable contracts. For example, factoring is a well-known financing method today where a farmer can sell their future receivable at a discount to receive money today to purchase supplies and pay wages. This process routinely leads to a sizable percentage loss of the farmer’s receivable to the entity providing financing. Visa’s prototype is designed to provide local farmers with more timely and greater access to a global pool of investors for financing, allowing the SMEs to get the best price discovery for their goods. By empowering SMEs with additional options to finance their businesses in a secure and frictionless way, Visa’s prototype platform aims to improve existing money movement operations and alleviate pain points caused by inaccessibility to traditional services. “Small businesses are essential contributors to our local economies, such as in Brazil where they employ over half the population and contribute to nearly a third of the country’s GDP. At Visa, we are committed to help them grow, exploring new technologies that will empower them to more easily maintain and expand their business operations,” said Catherine Gu, Global Head of CBDC for Visa. “Brazil is one of the world’s leading markets for innovation,” she continues. “By contributing our expertise, scale, network, and cutting-edge technologies in this market, we are able to help advance real-world applications of digital currencies — in this case making it possible for a soybean farmer to create and globally auction a tokenized contract on a permissioned version of the Ethereum blockchain, while utilizing different forms of money and interoperating between them.” How Visa can Enable Programmable Finance in CBDCs With many of the world’s central banks exploring the value of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), Visa and its partners have demonstrated how CBDCs can enable new cross-border payments programmatically, as well as provide international investment resources to SMEs. The programmable aspects of digital currencies, which allow delivery and payment of assets and currencies to be automatically settled only when certain conditions are met, open the door for more efficient capital usage and reduced counterparty risks, while leveraging the security, stability, and safety of a central bank liability via CBDC as a reliable settlement currency. The prototype platform brings existing financial processes and assets on-chain, allowing farmers to tokenize traditional financing contracts. To achieve this, Agrotoken brought its agriculture-based tokenization expertise from their existing solutions in Brazil and Latin America and Visa delivered a tokenization process for turning existing Brazilian legal documents into an on-chain tradeable NFT. “Agrotoken has a mission to democratize agribusiness by making transactions with soy and corn more accessible. To achieve this, we have chosen solid partners, such as Visa, to join us in our journey towards this goal,"" said Anderson Nacaxe, Director of Agrotoken in Brazil. Combined with tokenization, Visa implemented a new onchain sealed-bid auction mechanism through smart contracts to enable a global pool of investors on the blockchain to participate in the financing process, achieving competitive price discovery. Additionally, the platform leverages a Visa technology called Universal Payments Channel (UPC), which can interconnect between the Real Digital (CBDC) and other CBDCs, stablecoins or tokenized deposits, to help ensure future interoperability between digital currencies across different markets and networks. This year’s LIFT Challenge Real Digital sought innovative tech research projects within the financial sector to assess use cases for the Digital Brazilian Real. Visa developed this Proof of Concept as part of the company’s ongoing efforts to work with industry partners, lead exploratory work and apply emerging technologies to creatively solve for well-known real world problems. Visa works with Central Banks around the world and other players of the payment ecosystem to identify compelling CBDC opportunities that can be scaled and executed through secure, innovative, convenient, and reliable technologies, with the goal of developing innovative digital payment solutions that can help individuals, businesses and governments participate in the digital economy and ultimately thrive.

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Visa (NYSE: V), ein im Bereich digitales Bezahlen weltweit führendes Unternehmen, war einer der neun Finalisten, die mit der Erforschung innovativer blockchainbasierter Anwendungsfälle für den Real Digital (die von der brasilianischen Zentralbank ausgegebene digitale Währung, CBDC) im Rahmen der jüngsten LIFT Challenge beauftragt wurden. Das Unternehmen kooperierte mit Agrotoken, Microsoft und Sinqia, um seinen Beitrag zu erarbeiten. Nach monatelanger enger Zusammenarbeit der erstklassigen Forscher und Ingenieure beider Unternehmen freuen sich Visa und sein Team, die Ergebnisse ihrer Teilnahme an der LIFT Challenge bekannt zu geben - eine programmierbare Finanzplattform für kleine und mittlere Unternehmen (KMU), insbesondere Landwirte, die darauf ausgerichtet ist, einen besseren Zugang zu den weltweiten Kapitalmärkten zu ermöglichen, die Interoperabilität zwischen Währungen zu erleichtern, betriebliche Prozesse zu verbessern und neue Wachstumschancen zu erschließen. Kleine Unternehmen stärken die Weltwirtschaft KMU sind mit Blick auf die Aushandlung günstiger Verträge häufig an die lokale Marktstruktur gebunden. So ist beispielsweise Factoring inzwischen eine bekannte Finanzierungsmethode, bei der ein Landwirt seine Forderung vor Fälligkeit mit einem Abschlag verkaufen kann, um unmittelbar Geld für den Kauf von Vorräten und die Zahlung von Löhnen zu erhalten. Dieses Verfahren führt in der Regel zu einem beträchtlichen prozentualen Verlust der Forderungen des Landwirts an das finanzierende Institut. Der Prototyp von Visa wurde entwickelt, um lokalen Landwirten einen schnelleren und besseren Zugang zu einem weltweiten Investorenpool für Finanzierungen zu verschaffen, sodass für KMU der beste Preis für ihre Waren ermittelt werden kann. Indem KMU mit weiteren Optionen für die sichere und reibungslose Finanzierung ihrer Unternehmen gestärkt werden, zielt die Prototypplattform von Visa darauf ab, die bestehenden Geldbewegungen zu verbessern und Probleme zu lindern, die durch den gehinderten Zugang zu herkömmlichen Dienstleistungen entstehen. „Kleine Unternehmen sind wesentliche Leistungsträger in unseren lokalen Volkswirtschaften wie zum beispielsweise Brasilien, wo sie mehr als die Hälfte der Bevölkerung beschäftigen und fast ein Drittel zum BIP des Landes beitragen. Wir bei Visa engagieren uns dafür, ihnen beim Wachstum zu helfen, indem wir neue Technologien erforschen, die sie dabei stärken, ihre Geschäftstätigkeiten leichter aufrechtzuerhalten und auszuweiten“, sagte Catherine Gu, Global Head of CBDC bei Visa. „Brasilien ist einer der weltweit führenden Märkte für Innovationen“, ergänzte sie. „Indem wir mit unserer Expertise, Größe, unserem Netzwerk und unseren Spitzentechnologien einen Beitrag für diesen Markt leisten, können wir bei der Weiterentwicklung von Anwendungen digitaler Währungen in der Praxis helfen - indem wir es in diesem Fall einem Sojabohnenbauern ermöglichen, einen tokenisierten Vertrag auf einer genehmigten Version der Ethereum-Blockchain zu erstellen und weltweit zu versteigern und dabei verschiedene Formen des Geldes zu nutzen und zwischen ihnen zu interagieren.“ Wie Visa programmierbare Finanzen in CBDCs ermöglichen kann Da viele Zentralbanken der Welt den Wert einer digitalen Zentralbankwährung (Central Bank Digital Currency, CBDC) erkunden, haben Visa und seine Partner demonstriert, wie CBDCs neue grenzüberschreitende Zahlungen programmatisch ermöglichen und KMUs internationale Investitionsmittel zur Verfügung stellen können. Die programmierbaren Aspekte digitaler Währungen, mit denen es möglich ist, dass Lieferung und Zahlung von Kapitalien und Währungen nur dann automatisch erfüllt werden, wenn bestimmte Bedingungen erfüllt sind, eröffnen die Möglichkeit einer effizienteren Kapitalnutzung und geringerer Gegenparteirisiken sowie die Nutzung der Sicherheit, Stabilität und des Schutzes einer Zentralbankhaftung über CBDC als zuverlässige Abrechnungswährung. Die Prototyp-Plattform bringt die aktuellen Finanzprozesse und Vermögenswerte in die Chain und ermöglicht es Landwirten, traditionelle Finanzierungsverträge zu tokenisieren. Zu diesem Zweck hat Agrotoken seine auf Landwirtschaft beruhende Tokenisierungs-Expertise aus seinen bestehenden Lösungen in Brasilien und Lateinamerika eingebracht und Visa lieferte einen Tokenisierungsprozess, um die vorhandenen brasilianischer Rechtsdokumente in ein über die Chain handelbares NFT zu verwandeln. „Die Mission von Agrotoken ist es, das Agrobusiness zu demokratisieren, indem Transaktionen mit Soja und Mais zugänglicher gemacht werden. Wir haben zu diesem Zweck solide Partner wie Visa gewählt, die uns bei der Verwirklichung dieses Ziels begleiten sollen“, so Anderson Nacaxe, Direktor von Agrotoken in Brasilien. In Kombination mit der Tokenisierung implementierte Visa einen neuen Sealed-Bid-Versteigerungsmechanismus durch Smart Contracts in der Chain, um es einem weltweiten Investorenpool auf der Blockchain zu ermöglichen, am Finanzierungsprozess teilzunehmen und einen wettbewerbsfähigen Preis zu ermitteln. Darüber hinaus nutzt die Plattform eine Technologie von Visa mit der Bezeichnung Universal Payments Channel (UPC), die den Real Digital (CBDC) und andere CBDCs, Stablecoins oder tokenisierte Einlagen untereinander verbinden kann, um künftig die Interoperabilität zwischen digitalen Währungen über verschiedene Märkte und Netzwerke hinweg zu gewährleisten. Das Ziel der diesjährigen LIFT Challenge Real Digital war es, dass innovative technische Forschungsprojekte im Finanzsektor Anwendungsfälle für den digitalen brasilianischen Real bewerten. Visa entwickelte diesen Proof-of-Concept im Zuge der kontinuierlichen Bestrebungen des Unternehmens, mit Branchenpartnern zusammenzuarbeiten, Forschungsarbeiten anzuführen und neue Technologien anzuwenden, um aus der Praxis bekannte Probleme auf kreative Weise zu lösen. Visa arbeitet mit Zentralbanken auf der ganzen Welt und anderen Akteuren des Zahlungsökosystems zusammen, um überzeugende CBDC-Möglichkeiten zu finden, die durch sichere, innovative, bequeme und zuverlässige Technologien skaliert und ausgeführt werden können. Das Ziel ist die Entwicklung innovativer digitaler Zahlungslösungen, die Privatpersonen, Unternehmen und Regierungen dabei helfen können, an der digitalen Wirtschaft teilzuhaben und letztendlich erfolgreich zu sein. Um mehr über die Arbeit von Visa mit CBDC zu erfahren, besuchen Sie unseren Digital Currency Innovation Hub. Wir haben überdies gemeinsam mit der brasilianischen Zentralbank einen detaillierten Schlussbericht auf der LIFT-Plattform veröffentlicht, der hier abrufbar ist. Über Visa Inc. Visa (NYSE: V) ist ein weltweit führendes Unternehmen im digitalen Zahlungsverkehr, das Zahlungstransaktionen zwischen Verbrauchern, Händlern, Finanzinstituten und staatlichen Rechtsträgern in mehr als 200 Ländern und Gebieten ermöglicht. Unser Ziel ist es, die Welt über das innovativste, bequemste, zuverlässigste und sicherste Zahlungsnetzwerk zu verbinden, damit Einzelpersonen, Unternehmen und Volkswirtschaften gedeihen können.

舊金山--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美國商業資訊)--Visa (NYSE: V) 是數位支付領域的全球領導者，並在近期旨在探索 Real Digital (巴西中央銀行發行的數位貨幣，簡稱 CBDC) 基於區塊鏈之創新使用案例的 LIFT 挑戰賽上，成為九個入圍團隊之一。其參賽專案與 Agrotoken、Microsoft 和 Sinqia 合作開發完成。 經過了各公司出色的研究人員和工程師幾個月以來的密切合作，Visa 及其團隊很高興與大家分享其 LIFT 挑戰賽參賽專案：面向中小型企業 (SME) 打造的程式化金融平臺，尤其適合農場主，旨在幫助使用者更深入地進入全球資本市場，促進貨幣之間的互通性，並發現新的增長機會。 小型企業推動全球經濟發展 中小企業在談判有利可圖的合約時往往受當地語系化市場結構的約束。例如，應收帳款融資是目前十分常見的一種融資方式，農場主能夠以折扣價出售他們未來的應收帳款，以便現在獲得資金來購買物資和支付工資。這個過程通常會導致農場主應收帳款的很大一部分損失給提供融資的實體。 Visa 的原型平臺旨在為當地農場主提供更及時、更多的全球投資者融資管道，幫助中小企業以最佳價格出售他們的產品。透過 Visa 的原型平臺，中小企業可以獲得更多選擇，以安全和順暢的方式為其業務融資，從而改善現有的資金流動管理，緩解因無法獲享傳統服務而造成的痛點。 Visa CBDC 全球負責人 Catherine Gu 表示：「小型企業是我們當地經濟的重要貢獻者，例如在巴西，小型企業雇用了一半以上的人口，貢獻了該國近三分之一的 GDP。在 Visa，我們致力於助其成長，探索新技術，幫助他們更輕鬆地維護和擴大業務營運。」 她繼續說道：「巴西是世界領先的創新市場之一。我們在這個市場上貢獻專業知識、規模、網路和尖端技術，以推進數位貨幣的實際應用，具體而言，我們能夠幫助大豆種植者基於乙太坊區塊鏈的許可版本創建一份代幣化合約並在全球進行拍賣，同時利用不同形式的貨幣，並在這些貨幣之間進行交互操作。」 Visa 如何在 CBDC 中實現程式化金融 隨著全世界許多央行紛紛開始探索央行數位貨幣 (CBDC) 的價值，Visa 及其合作夥伴展示了 CBDC 如何透過程式設計實現新的跨境支付，並為中小企業提供國際投資資源。由於數位貨幣具有程式化特徵，只有在滿足特定條件時，才能自動結算資產和貨幣的交付和支付，這為更高效地使用資本和降低交易對手風險創造了條件，同時透過將 CBDC 作為可靠的結算貨幣，得以發揮中央銀行負債在安全、穩定和保障方面的優勢。 該原型平臺將現有的金融流程和資產帶入鏈中，幫助農場主讓傳統融資合約實現代幣化。為此，Agrotoken 發揮其在巴西和拉丁美洲的現有解決方案中的農業代幣化專長，同時 Visa 提供代幣化流程，將現有的巴西法律文件轉變為可在鏈上交易的 NFT。 巴西 Agrotoken 總監 Anderson Nacaxe 說：「Agrotoken 的使命是推動大豆和玉米交易，讓這些交易更容易達成，並實現農業綜合企業的大眾化。為實現這一目標，我們選擇了 Visa 這樣可靠的合作夥伴攜手並進。」 Visa 結合代幣化，透過智慧合約實施了新的鏈上密封競價拍賣機制，使區塊鏈上的全球投資者池能夠參與融資過程，獲享有競爭力的價格。此外，該平臺還應用了一項名為通用支付通道 (UPC) 的 Visa 技術，可以在 Real Digital (CBDC) 和其他 CBDC、穩定幣或代幣化存款之間進行互連，以幫助確保數位貨幣未來在不同市場和網路中的互通性。 今年的 LIFT Challenge Real Digital 旨在尋求金融領域的創新技術研究專案，以評估巴西雷亞爾數位貨幣的使用案例。Visa 開發的這一概念驗證體現了該公司在與行業夥伴合作、領導探索性工作以及應用新興技術來創造性地解決普遍存在的現實問題上的不懈努力。 Visa 與世界各地的中央銀行和支付生態系統中的其他參與者合作，發掘能夠透過安全、創新、便捷又可靠的技術進行擴展和執行的富有吸引力的 CBDC 機會，以開發創新的數位支付解決方案，幫助個人、企業和政府參與數位經濟並實現蓬勃發展。 若要詳細瞭解 Visa 與 CBDC 的合作，請造訪我們的數位貨幣創新中心。此外，我們還與巴西中央銀行共同發佈了一份關於LIFT平臺的深度最終報告，您可以按一下此處獲取。 關於 Visa Inc.

旧金山--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美国商业资讯)--Visa（NYSE：V）是数字支付领域的全球领导者，并在近期旨在探索Real Digital（巴西中央银行发行的数字货币，简称CBDC）基于区块链的创新用例的LIFT挑战赛上，成为九个入围团队之一。其参赛项目与Agrotoken、Microsoft和Sinqia合作开发完成。 经过了各公司出色的研究人员和工程师几个月以来的密切合作，Visa及其团队很高兴向大家展示其LIFT挑战赛参赛项目，即一个专为中小型企业（SME）打造的可编程金融平台，尤其适合农场主，该平台旨在让他们能够更深入地进入全球资本市场，促进货币之间的互操作性，并发现新的增长机会。 小型企业推动全球经济发展 中小企业在为己方争取有利条件的合同谈判中往往受制于本地化的市场结构。例如，保理是目前十分常见的一种融资方式，农场主可以以折扣价出售其未来的应收账款，以便现在获得资金来购买物资和支付工资。这个过程通常会导致农场主应收账款的很大一部分损失给提供融资的实体。 Visa的原型旨在为当地农场主提供更及时、更广阔的全球投资者融资渠道，使中小企业能够以最佳价格销售其产品。通过Visa的原型平台，中小企业可以获得更多选择，以安全和顺畅的方式为其业务融资，从而改善现有的资金流动管理，缓解因无法获得传统服务而造成的痛点。 Visa CBDC全球负责人Catherine Gu表示：“小型企业是我们当地经济的重要贡献者，例如在巴西，小型企业雇用了一半以上的人口，贡献了该国近三分之一的GDP。在Visa，我们致力于助其成长，探索新技术，使他们能够更轻松地维护并扩大业务运营。” 她继续说道：“巴西是世界领先的创新市场之一，我们将专业知识、网络和尖端技术大规模地投入到该市场，旨在帮助推进数字货币的实际应用，具体到这里，就是使大豆种植者能够在以太坊区块链的许可版本基础上，创建代币化合同并在全球进行拍卖，同时利用不同形式的货币，并在这些货币之间进行互操作。” Visa如何在CBDC中实现可编程金融 随着全世界多家央行纷纷开始探索央行数字货币（CBDC）的价值，Visa及其合作伙伴展示了CBDC如何通过编程实现新的跨境支付，并为中小企业提供国际投资资源。由于数字货币的可编程性，只有在满足特定条件时，才能自动结算资产和货币的交付与支付，这为更高效地使用资本和降低交易对手风险提供了机会，同时通过将CBDC作为可靠的结算货币，得以发挥中央银行负债在安全、稳定和保障方面的优势。 该原型平台将现有的金融流程和资产带入链中，让农场主能够将传统融资合同代币化。为此，Agrotoken发挥其在巴西和拉丁美洲的现有解决方案中的农业代币化专长，同时Visa提供代币化流程，将现有的巴西法律文件转变为可在链上交易的NFT。 巴西的Agrotoken总监Anderson Nacaxe表示：“Agrotoken致力于通过简化大豆和玉米的交易过程，实现农业综合企业的大众化。为达成这一目标，我们选择了像Visa这样可靠的合作伙伴携手并进。” Visa结合代币化，通过智能合约实施了新的链上密封竞价拍卖机制，使区块链上的全球投资者池能够参与融资过程，获得有竞争力的价格。此外，该平台还应用了一项名为通用支付通道（UPC）的Visa技术，该技术可以在Real Digital（CBDC）和其他CBDC、稳定币或代币化存款之间进行互连，以帮助确保数字货币未来在不同市场和网络中的互操作性。 今年的LIFT Challenge Real Digital旨在寻求金融领域的创新技术研究项目，以评估巴西雷亚尔数字货币的用例。Visa所开发的概念验证体现了该公司在与行业伙伴合作、领导探索性工作以及应用新兴技术来创造性地解决普遍现实问题上的不懈努力。 Visa与世界各地的中央银行以及支付生态系统中的其他参与者合作，发掘能够通过安全、创新、便捷又可靠的技术进行扩展和执行的富有吸引力的CBDC机会，以开发创新的数字支付解决方案，帮助个人、企业和政府参与数字经济并实现蓬勃发展。 欲了解Visa与CBDC的合作详情，请访问我们的数字货币创新中心。此外，我们还与巴西中央银行共同发布了一份关于LIFT平台的深度最终报告，可在此处获取。 关于Visa Inc.

米カリフォルニア州サンフランシスコ--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- デジタル決済ビジネスの世界的リーダーであるビザ（NYSE:V）は、ブロックチェーンを基盤とする、「レアル・デジタル」（ブラジル中銀発行のデジタル通貨、略称「CBDC」）の革新的ユースケースの提案を競う最終候補9社に残りました。CBDCはブラジル政府が主催する「リフト・チャレンジ」の最新プロジェクトです。ビザは提案を練り上げるうえで、Agrotoken、Microsoft、Sinqiaと協力関係にあります。 各社の世界的研究者とエンジニアが数か月にわたり共同で提案策定に取り組んだ結果、ビザはリフト・チャレンジの成果として、農家を中心とする中小事業者（SME）向けのプログラム可能な資金繰りプラットフォームの発表にこぎ着けました。このプラットフォームは、世界資本市場へのアクセス促進、各種通貨間の相互運用性向上、運営プロセス改善、新たな成長機会の発掘といったメリットを中小事業者にもたらします。 中小事業者が世界経済を牽引 中小事業者は、契約交渉を有利に進めるうえで地元の市場構造の枠に留まることがよくあります。例えば、ファクタリングは、農家が将来の売上債権を割引価格で売却し、その収入を当座の資材の購入や賃金の支払いに充てる現在よく知られる資金繰り手段ですが、当該債権は資金の提供企業から大幅に割り引いた価格で買い取られるため、農家にとって不利な取引となるのが通例です。 ビザの試作プラットフォームは、地元農家などの中小事業者が、世界の広範な投資家層からよりタイムリーに資金を調達する手段となり、作物・商品を最適な価格で販売する可能性を広げます。中小事業者向けの安全かつスムーズな資金繰り手段が加わることで、既存の資金移動プロセスの改善と閉鎖的な旧式サービスの弱点の軽減が図れます。 ビザでCBDCのグローバルヘッドを務めるキャサリン・グーは次のように説明します。「中小事業者は地域経済の重要な担い手です。例えば、ブラジルで人口の半分以上の雇用先であり、GDPへの寄与度は3分の1近くに達しています。ビザでは中小事業者の成長支援に力を入れており、事業活動の維持・拡大を促進する新技術の開発に取り組んでいます」 「ブラジルは革新分野における世界先端市場の1つです。ビザは社内の専門知識、規模、ネットワーク、市場最先端技術で貢献することにより、デジタル通貨の実用化促進を支援することができます。今回のケースでは、大豆農家は認定版イーサリアム・ブロックチェーンでトークン化されたコントラクトを作成して世界的に入札することも、複数の貨幣形態を利用して相互に運用することも可能になります」（キャサリン・グー）。 CBDC建てのプログラム可能資金繰りを実現したビザの手法 世界中銀の多くが中銀デジタル通貨（CBDC）の利用価値を模索するなか、ビザと提携企業はCBDCを利用してプログラム的に国際的な資金決済を実行する新しい方法と中小事業者に国際投資リソースを提供する方法を実演しました。デジタル通貨にはプログラム可能という側面があり、特定の条件が満たされたときのみ資産と通貨の送信と支払いが自動的に決済できるという特徴があります。この特徴を利用すれば、資本利用を効率化し、カウンターパーティリスクを軽減する道が開けます。しかも信頼性の高い決済通貨としてCBDCという形態で中央銀行がセキュリティ、安定性、安全性に責任を負う構造も活用できます。 試作プラットフォームでは、従来の金融プロセスと資産がブロックチェーンに移行するため、農家は伝統的な資金調達契約のトークン化が可能になります。この可能性を実現するために、Agrotokenは現在ブラジルと中南米で展開しているソリューションで培った農業ベースのトークン化ノウハウを提供しました。また、ビザは既存のブラジル用法務文書をブロックチェーンで取引可能なNFT（非代替性トークン）向けにアレンジするトークン化プロセスを提供しました。 「Agrotokenは大豆取引やトウモロコシ取引の門戸を拡大することで、農業ビジネスを民主化するという使命を担っています。この使命を達成するために、当社はビザをはじめとする堅実なパートナーを選び、目標に向けて共に歩んでいます」とブラジルのAgrotokenディレクターAnderson Nacaxe氏は語ります。 ビザではトークン化と共に、スマートコントラクトを通じたオンチェーンの封印入札方式を導入し、ブロックチェーン上の世界中の投資家が資金調達プロセスに参加し、競争を通じて価格が決定される工夫をしています。さらに、試作プラットフォームで活用されるビザの「ユニバーサル・ペイメント・チャネル（UPC）」技術により、レアル・デジタル （CBDC）と他のCBCD、法定通貨、トークン化預金の相互接続を可能にして、将来、異なる市場やネットワーク間でのデジタル通貨の相互運用を実現するための盤石な体制を築いています。 今年の 「リフト・チャレンジ：レアル・デジタル」 では、デジタル版ブラジル・レアルのユースケースを評価するために、金融セクターの革新的技術研究プロジェクトが比較・検討の対象となりました。ビザは業界パートナーと協力して、試験的な取り組みを統率し、新興技術を利用して周知の現実的な問題を創造的な方法で解決する努力を継続的に行っています。今回の概念事象となる試作プラットフォームはその一環として策定されました。 ビザは安全、便利で信頼性の高い革新的な技術を通じて大規模に実行可能なCBDCの魅力的な商機を見出すために、世界各国の中銀や決済エコシステムに属する他企業と連携活動を行っています。この活動の目標である「革新的なデジタル決済ソリューションの開発」が実現すれば、デジタル経済に参加する個人、企業、政府の役に立ち、最終的に繁栄をもたらすことになります。 CBDCに関するビザの取り組みの詳細は、Digital Currency Innovation Hub（デジタル通貨革新ハブ）をご覧ください。さらに、ブラジル中央銀行と共同出版した、リフト・プラットフォームに関する詳細な最終報告書も こちらからご覧いただけます。 ビザ・インクについて ビザ（NYSE: V）はデジタル決済の世界的リーダーであり、200以上の国・領域で、消費者、加盟店、金融機関、政府機関の間の決済トランザクションを円滑化しています。 革新性、利便性、信頼性、安全性に優れた決済ネットワークを通じて世界を結び、個人、企業、経済に繁栄をもたらすことを使命としています。ビザでは、世界各国で誰もが受け入れられる経済は、世界中の人々の生活を向上させると確信しています。そして、資金移動の未来へのアクセスがその基盤であると考えています。詳細情報は、 http://visa.com/をご覧ください 本記者発表文の公式バージョンはオリジナル言語版です。翻訳言語版は、読者の便宜を図る目的で提供されたものであり、法的効力を持ちません。翻訳言語版を資料としてご利用になる際には、法的効力を有する唯一のバージョンであるオリジナル言語版と照らし合わせて頂くようお願い致します。"

Visa is a high-quality, long-term buy despite a forward P/E of nearly 30x, with potential for solid upside over the next 12–24 months. Economic uncertainty and potential tariffs may limit near-term upside, but Visa's strong consumer spending and robust financials support long-term growth. Recent acquisitions of Featurespace and Pismo expected to minimally impact upcoming earnings; Q2 EPS forecasted between $2.70-$2.78 and revenue above $9.6 billion."

Key Points MSTY, QQQI, and JEPQ offer monthly cash distributions and exposure to top tech names. Meanwhile, SPYI and DIVO can help monthly payout seekers diversify beyond the tech sector. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) It wasn&#8217;t very long ago that passive income investors had to wait three full months before an exchange traded fund (ETF) would finally pay a dividend. Recently, however, an explosion in the number of ETFs has enabled more frequent cash distributions and powerful wealth-compounding possibilities. Five funds in particular are changing the ETF game with eye-catching yields and monthly cash payouts. Ambitious dividend harvesters can try out some of these funds or even, if they dare, buy all five of the following passive income ETF all-stars. MSTY, QQQI, and JEPQ for Tech Exposure All five of the ETFs featured today provide cash dividends/distributions each and every month. Yet, there are crucial differences between these funds, especially when it comes to their annual yields and risk profiles. To start off, I&#8217;ll direct your attention to an ETF that&#8217;s on the hotter end of the risk spectrum. I&#8217;m referring to the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSTY), which generates some income from U.S. Treasury bonds but mainly relies on option-trading strategies. More specifically, the MSTY ETF uses synthetic covered call strategies (or possibly synthetic covered call spread strategies) to indirectly derive income from Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock. As you may be aware, Microstrategy is a technology firm that aggressively invests in Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC). Since Microstrategy stock can be quite volatile and option-trading strategies can be risky, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF isn&#8217;t for the faint of heart. On the other hand, high risks can come with huge rewards as the MSTY ETF currently advertises a gigantic 72.93% annual distribution rate. While MSTY pays you every month and has an enormous annual yield, it&#8217;s not everybody&#8217;s cup of tea. Maybe you still want exposure to interesting technology companies but aren&#8217;t prepared to accept high risk. If so, then I&#8217;ve got two monthly-paying funds that emphasize the tech sector but aren&#8217;t overly volatile. The first one is the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI), which is centered around the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 stock index. This fund uses options-trading strategies to squeeze income from a basket of approximately 100 stocks, including NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). The NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF is reshaping portfolios by eliminating the need to pick individual tech stocks while also providing monthly income. In addition, QQQI&#8217;s 14.65% annual distribution rate will undoubtedly make it attractive to yield hunters. In a similar vein to QQQI, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) focuses on stocks in the NASDAQ 100. This fund collects income from 108 stocks that are mainly in the technology sector, and like MSTY and QQQI, the JEPQ ETF utilizes options-trading strategies. Thus, it shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising that the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF enables portfolio exposure to technology titans like NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon, Broadcom, and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). With a 12-month rolling dividend yield of 11.52%, the JEPQ ETF should impress any passive income enthusiast yearning for monthly wealth-building opportunities. SPYI and DIVO for Multi-Sector Diversification There&#8217;s no denying that audacious ETFs like MSTY, QQQI, and JEPQ are taking passive income investing to the next level. But then, you might prefer funds that venture beyond the technology sector while still paying out distributions each month. On that topic, I&#8217;ve got a pair of potent funds offering instant multi-sector diversification. One of them is the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). Instead of sticking to the NASDAQ 100, the SPYI ETF concentrates on the S&amp;P 500 and has around 500 stocks in its holdings. This fund can quickly diversify your portfolio across a wide variety of stocks and sectors. Within the SPYI ETF, you&#8217;ll see large-cap standouts like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Like the other funds on this list, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF relies on options-trading strategies to produce income. After you discover that SPYI features monthly cash payouts and a 12.15% annual distribution rate, you may find it hard to resist taking a share position. Rounding out this five-pack of passive income boundary breakers is the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO), which derives income from dividends and options-trading strategies based on 24 stocks. Those 24 stocks aren&#8217;t all tech stocks, mind you. Sure, you&#8217;ll find Microsoft stock in the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF&#8217;s holdings. However, you&#8217;ll also find non-tech-focused firms like Home Depot, Visa (NYSE:V), RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Maybe DIVO&#8217;s 4.73% annual distribution rate isn&#8217;t as mind-blowing as the other funds I&#8217;m highlighting today. Nevertheless, the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF&#8217;s diversified basket features some rock-solid companies and the fund&#8217;s monthly payouts will add up over the long run. As you can see, there are similarities but also important distinctions between MSTY, QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, and DIVO. All five of these ETFs are altering the landscape of passive income investing so, if you&#8217;re ready, feel free to try them out today.The post These 5 ETFs (MSTY, QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, DIVO) Are Reshaping Passive Income Portfolios appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Key Points The QDVO ETF offers a high annual yield and exposure to famous large-cap stocks. Meanwhile, the RSPA ETF is widely diversified but also pays big dividends. It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. If you&#8217;ve managed to save up $500,000 to invest in stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs), pat yourself on the back. You&#8217;re in a great position to earn tens of thousands of dollars in worry-free income each and every year. Two passive income powerhouses are particularly well-suited for investors seeking relatively safe dividends/distributions. With these two high-yield funds, you could generate $40,000 per year from a half-a-million-dollar account. So, let&#8217;s look at a pair of ETFs that could help you grow your fortune while you sleep soundly at night. QDVO: Tech Exposure, Decent Diversification It might sound risky to take $500,000 and equally divide it among just two funds. However, this plan can make sense if the two funds provide good diversification across well-known stocks. The first ETF that fits this description is the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF (NYSEARCA:QDVO). This ETF generates income from dividends and premium payments from writing/selling call options. Since the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF includes 42 stocks in its holdings, you&#8217;ll achieve diversification with just this one fund. Plus, you&#8217;ll get portfolio exposure to highly established technology giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). While the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF emphasizes large-cap technology stocks, it also includes non-tech names such as Visa (NYSE:V), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), and RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX). Consequently, your $500,000 portfolio won&#8217;t be too tech-heavy with the QDVO ETF. An added bonus of the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF is that it pays out its dividends/distributions on a monthly basis. Hence, there&#8217;s no need to wait three full months to start seeing the cash show up in your account. Getting down to the nitty-gritty, the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF offers an annual distribution rate of 9.87%, but also deducts 0.55% worth of operating expenses. This means that QDVO&#8217;s expected annualized net yield for investors would be 9.87% &#8211; 0.55%, or 9.32%. RSPA: High Yield, Hundreds of Famous Names Even though the the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF has plenty of benefits, you don&#8217;t have to pour an entire $500,000 account into one fund. Instead, you could allocate $250,000 toward QDVO and the remaining $250,000 into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF (NYSEARCA:RSPA). Generally based on the S&amp;P 500 index, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF has 524 stocks in its holdings. Moreover, it&#8217;s not too heavily allocated toward technology or any other sector, as the RSPA ETF places roughly equal weighting on each stock. Within the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF you&#8217;ll find technology luminaries like Microsoft, Apple, and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). Yet, you&#8217;ll also discover non-technology-focused firms such as PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Hence, you can massively diversify your portfolio with the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF and sleep all night long worry-free. Furthermore, there&#8217;s an added benefit with this fund because, like QDVO, RSPA pays out its distributions every month. The annual distribution rate for the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF is 9.13%, which is quite impressive. When we subtract the operating fees of 0.29% per year, the RSPA ETF should provide an expected net annual yield of 9.13% &#8211; 0.29%, or 8.84%. Getting $40,000 Each Year From Two ETFs Now, let&#8217;s do the math with these two terrific funds. For extra-wide diversification, you could put $250,000 into the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF and another $250,000 into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF. Then, your average expected net annual yield would be (9.32% + 8.84%) / 2, or 9.08%. Actually, your yield could be even higher if you reinvest the cash distributions every month, but let&#8217;s keep it simple and assume a 9.08% yield for now. After one year, assuming the two funds don&#8217;t reduce their distribution rates, you could expect to receive cash distributions totaling $500,000 x 9.08%, or $45,400. This allows some room for error, as it easily beats your goal of earning $40,000 in dividends/distributions. Of course, you should monitor the share prices of the two ETFs and not only the distribution rates. After all, you&#8217;ll want to see some share-price appreciation to further build your $500,000 nest egg. There&#8217;s no need to lose sleep over this issue, though, since the QDVO and RSPA ETFs should gain value over the long run. These two funds hold a variety of blue-chip stocks so you can rest easy while collecting $40,000 in cash every 12 months.The post How to Turn $500K into $40,000 in Annual Passive Income Without Losing Sleep appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Here’s the Smartest Way to Turn It Into Monthly Passive Income","Inherited $400,000? Here’s the Smartest Way to Turn It Into Monthly Passive Income
Key Points The SPHD and DIVO ETFs are ideal vehicles for volatility mitigation and reliable income. Furthermore, you can enhance your monthly income potential with single-stock ETFs. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) If you&#8217;re fortunate enough to inherit $400,000, it may be tempting to spend that money on cars and vacations. However, the smart-money move is to invest the funds wisely and plan for your financial future. One approach is to invest that $400,000 in exchange traded funds (ETFs) that provide passive income every month. That way, you can reinvest the cash distributions and take advantage of the compounding effect. So now, it&#8217;s time to reveal four funds that unlock monthly income opportunities so you can turn your inheritance into a cash-producing machine. SPHD: A Reliable Pick for Low Volatility $400,000 is a whole lot of money to inherit and invest. Therefore, your first priority shouldn&#8217;t be maximizing your monthly dividends. Instead, it should be mitigating your risk so you don&#8217;t lose all of that money. When safety and reliability are your top priorities, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA:SPHD) is a solid pick. This fund has 52 stocks in its holdings, all carefully selected from the S&amp;P 500 large-cap stock index. The SPHD ETF specifically chooses stocks &#8220;that historically have provided high dividend yields and low volatility.&#8221; Examples include Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Realty Income Corp. (NYSE:O), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Altria Group (NYSE:MO). These companies are known for providing consistent dividend payments, and their stocks typically aren&#8217;t volatile. Furthermore, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF features a 12-month distribution rate (i.e., a forward annual dividend yield) of 3.44%. Plus, the SPHD ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. With all of that in mind, you could take $150,000 of your inherited $400,000, put it into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF, and sleep soundly at night. Stay in the Safe Lane With DIVO With $400,000 to invest, you&#8217;ll have a large account and there&#8217;s no need to drive in the fast lane. Instead, you can stay in the &#8220;safe lane&#8221; but still get a passive income stream with the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO). Much like the SPHD ETF, the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF seeks to reduce share-price volatility while providing exposure to high-quality dividend-paying companies. Moreover, like the other funds mentioned today, DIVO puts cash distributions into your account on a monthly basis. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF has 24 stocks in its holdings, and you&#8217;ll see plenty of large-cap sector leaders in there. Among the top holdings in the DIVO ETF are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Visa (NYSE:V), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Again, we&#8217;re choosing safety first and then aiming for good yield. Since the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF invests in great companies and features an impressive 4.73% annual distribution rate, it checks all the right boxes. Thus, it would make sense to allocate $150,000 of a $400,000 inheritance toward the DIVO ETF. Accelerate Your Yield With Single-Stock ETFs It&#8217;s wise to dedicate $300,000 of your $400,000 inheritance toward diversified low-volatility funds like SPHD and DIVO. If you do that, then you can invest the remaining $100,000 in ETFs with greater risk but also higher yields. To that end, YieldMax offers a wide variety of ETFs that each focus on a single stock instead of a diversified basket of stocks. Typically, these YieldMax ETFs derive monthly income from U.S. Treasury bonds and sophisticated options-trading strategies. One way to reduce the risk is to stick to YieldMax ETFs that focus on established large-cap companies. For example, the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:APLY) indirectly derives income from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. Currently, the APLY ETF advertises an annual distribution rate of 26.99%. This fund shouldn&#8217;t be excessively risky as Apple is a reliable blue-chip business with staying power. So, you could invest $25,000 of your $400,000 inheritance in the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF. A reasonable plan would be to pick four single-stock ETFs with a focus on high-confidence companies. Then, you could allocate $25,000 toward each of the four funds you picked. A Mixed-Risk Approach APLY is just one example of many monthly-paying single-stock ETFs you can choose from. Here&#8217;s a summary of other funds in this category, and while you explore them, you might think about picking your four favorites: The YieldMax AMZN Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMZY); based on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock; 47.82% annual distribution rate The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY); based on NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock; 74.99% annual distribution rate The YieldMax GOOGL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:GOOY); based on the stock of Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL); 32.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax MSFT Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSFO); based on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock; 34.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax JPM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:JPMO); based on JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock; 39% annual distribution rate The YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMDY); based on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock; 68.07% annual distribution rate The YieldMax DIS Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:DISO); based on Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock; 38.55% annual distribution rate The YieldMax XOM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:XOMO); based on Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock; 38.04% annual distribution rate Just to provide an idea of what your overall plan might look like, you could invest $150,000 in SPHD, $150,000 in DIVO, and $25,000 each in APLY, MSFO, DISO, and XOMO. All in all, you can mix low-risk ETFs with a handful of higher-risk ETFs to turn your inherited $400,000 into a fairly reliable monthly income-producing machine.The post Inherited $400,000?

Key Points The RSPA ETF will immediately turn the bulk of your $25,000 account into a diversified income machine. Smaller allocations into SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV will help you build a low-fee passive income foundation. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) How far can $25,000 get you? If you have a well-considered plan in place, you can actually turn your small account into a passive income factory. This can be done with a carefully selected group of high-yield, low-fee exchange traded funds (ETFs). With just $25,000, you can build a super-low-cost portfolio that consistently pays you cash dividends/distributions. Plus, you can de-risk your portfolio through multi-sector diversification and investment in famous large-cap companies. So, let&#8217;s start right now with a smart-money plan to extract sizable cash payouts from a small but growing account. Start With RSPA for Extra Diversification Out of a $25,000 account, you can confidently put $10,000 into just one ETF. That&#8217;s because the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF (NYSEARCA:RSPA) checks all of the right boxes for a small-sized high-growth portfolio. To populate a small-sized portfolio, I would want to use funds that invest in successful, blue-chip business. I would also insist that the ETFs should be diversified and need to have annual operating expenses below 0.5%. With a focus on companies in the prestigious S&amp;P 500 index, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF has 525 stocks in its holdings. Suffice it to say, then, that the RSPA ETF is widely diversified. When you examine the fund&#8217;s holdings list, you&#8217;ll find established large-cap leaders across multiple economic sectors. Some examples are Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED). An interesting feature of the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF is that each of the holdings has a small, roughly equal weighing to the other stocks in the fund. That way, you won&#8217;t over-invest in any single stock. In addition, the RSPA ETF is low-cost as it only deducts annualized operating fees of 0.29%. And for all of you yield hunters out there, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF currently features a 12-month distribution rate of 9.42%. All in all, this ultra-diversified fund is ideal for a $25,000 account and I would feel comfortable dedicating $10,000 toward RSPA. Expand Your Portfolio With SCHD and JEPQ Even though the RSPA ETF would already expose you to 500+ stocks, you still probably wouldn&#8217;t want to toss your entire $25,000 into just one fund. Consequently, we will now explore three more ETFs and, after conducting your own due diligence, you could invest $5,000 in each one of them. The first of these three intriguing funds is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and has a portfolio comprising 103 stocks. Again, we&#8217;re looking for famous large-cap names and multi-sector diversification. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF meets these expectations with recognizable stocks like Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Merck (NYSE:MRK), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF serves up a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.87% but only deducts 0.06% worth of annual operating expenses. Therefore, investors should have no objections to allocating $5,000 toward the SCHD ETF. Next up is the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ), which is centered around the technology-focused NASDAQ 100 index. This fund includes 107 stocks so you can participate in the growth of tech&#8217;s heavy hitters, such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Committing $5,000 of your $25,000 portfolio to the JEPQ ETF will unlock extra share-price appreciation potential from a variety of top tech firms. You&#8217;ll also get access to substantial cash distributions as the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF features an impressive 11.52% annual yield. We&#8217;re still sticking to the low-cost theme here since JEPQ only deducts operating fees of 0.35% per year. So, why not add some technology-fueled firepower to your small portfolio with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF? Round It Out With FDVV To round out your $25,000 passive-income plan, you could assign $5,000 toward the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:FDVV). Instead of concentrating on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, or NASDAQ 100, the FVDD ETF corresponds to the Fidelity High Dividend Index. Among the holdings list of the Fidelity High Dividend ETF, you&#8217;ll find large-cap superstars like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Visa (NYSE:V), Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Overall, you&#8217;ll get exposure to plenty of consistent dividend deliverers with FDVV. The other need-to-know stats are that the Fidelity High Dividend ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.07% but only deducts 0.16% in annualized operating expenses. With all of those benefits in mind, you can proudly add $5,000 worth of FDVV shares to your $25,000 account. Now, you&#8217;ve got a four-pack of funds with RSPA as your anchor as well as SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV for extra diversification. That&#8217;s a savvy plan to keep the fees to a minimum while turning your $25,000 account into a low-risk regular income producer.The post How to Build a Super Low Cost Passive Income Fund for Only $25,000 appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Credit card companies offer various perks to attract and retain customers. You may get a good welcome bonus if you spend enough money within a few months, and you will also likely receive points or cash back on every purchase. However, a Fat FIRE advocate recently expressed dissatisfaction with Amex Platinum. This individual no longer feels valued by the company despite spending $50,000 each month. Other Redditors jumped into the comments to share their thoughts about this trend and recommend some ways to maximize credit card benefits. Key Points Some credit card companies don&#8217;t have the same reward structures that made them so popular. A Redditor who spends more than $50,000 per month is looking for alternatives after AMEX fell below their expectations. It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. Use Bank Of America The top commenter suggested putting $100,000 into a Merrill Lynch or Bank of America account and then using the company&#8217;s Visa card for maximum benefits. This setup will net you 3.5% cashback on travel and dining, plus 2.625% cashback on everything else. The recommendation came from someone who was fed up with using different credit cards for different categories and opening a bunch of cards just for their bonuses. This route can save you a lot of time while allowing you to secure top-tier rewards. Bank of America also doesn&#8217;t have an annual membership fee that is tied to those benefits. To top it all off, there are a lot of expenses that count as travel and dining, even if it&#8217;s not obvious. &#8220;They are *extremely* generous about how they code for travel and dining. For example, I pay monthly maintenance expenses on several rental properties with the card. Magically, that&#8217;s counted as lodging, so I get 3.5% back,&#8221; the top commenter stated. Fees Add Up The original poster isn&#8217;t the only one who&#8217;s fed up with Amex cards. One Redditor commented that the Amex Centurion card isn&#8217;t as good as it used to be, despite paying roughly $5,000 in fees. The Redditor got plenty of upvotes from that comment. You can choose from many credit cards that do not have annual fees. If you don&#8217;t have to contend with an annual fee, all of your rewards are pure profit as long as you pay off your credit card balance at the end of each month. Plenty of credit cards offer unlimited 2% cashback on every purchase, and that may be enough to edge out some of the credit cards with annual fees. While big spenders may be able to justify the high annual fee, it isn&#8217;t worth it for everyone. Travelers Benefit The Most From High-End Credit Cards Another Redditor mentioned that most of the top-tier credit cards only serve people who travel often. While this setup benefits regular travelers, it&#8217;s important to keep this distinction in mind if you do not travel. It&#8217;s important to view each credit card while considering how you spend your money and what you want out of life. Some people enjoy traveling, but opting for a simple cashback credit card may be the better choice for others. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re getting the deal of a lifetime if you enjoy boarding airplanes and going to new destinations. Some Redditors criticized the travel portals of various credit cards. They said that hotel and car prices include travel agent markups and are not competitive. It&#8217;s always good to review the numbers before opening a card or making any big travel purchases to ensure you are getting the best deal. The post Credit card companies no longer value a $50k monthly spend appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."
