(VRSK Quick QuoteVRSK - Free Report) have risen 5.3% year to date, outperforming the 0.5% growth of the industry it belongs to.The company has an expected long-term (three to five years) EPS growth rate of 12.56%. Its earnings for 2024 and 2025 are anticipated to rise 14.4% and 11.5%, respectively, year over year.Verisk Analytics, Inc. Price Verisk Analytics, Inc. price | Verisk Analytics, Inc. Quote Factors That Bode WellVRSK drives growth through a robust strategy focused on organic expansion, product development and strategic acquisitions, achieving a 1% CAGR in revenues over the past five years. The company continues to invest in its workforce, data sets, analytic solutions, technology and complementary businesses to stay aligned with evolving market demands.Verisk focuses on deepening solution penetration with customers, developing new proprietary databases and predictive analytics and expanding into new customer sectors.Acquisitions drive Verisk's growth strategy. The February 2023 acquisition of Mavera expanded its presence in Europe and supported global insurance growth. The acquisition of Krug in April 2023 extended its European claims and casualty services.Moreover, the March 2022 purchase of Opta boosted its presence in Canada. Meanwhile, acquiring Automated Insurance Solutions enhanced claims processing automation and geographic reach. The 2022 acquisition of Infutor Data Solutions strengthened Verisk's marketing solutions across diverse industries, including insurance.Verisk's current ratio (a measure of liquidity)at the end of the first quarter of 2024 was 1.09, higher than the preceding quarter's 1.05 and the year-ago quarter’s 0.89. A current ratio of more than 1 often indicates that the company will be easily paying off its short-term obligations.Verisk consistently rewards its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company paid $196.8 million, $195.2 million and $188.2 million as dividends and repurchased shares worth $2.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $475 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These actions demonstrate Verisk's commitment to shareholder value and confidence in its business.Some RisksVRSK's heavy reliance on data exposes it to operational risks, such as security breaches and contractual disputes with external suppliers. Moreover, the company's recent divestment from non-insurance segments sharpens its focus but raises concerns about overreliance on a single service offering, underscoring the importance of diversification for risk mitigation.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderVRSK currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Business Services sector are Aptiv (APTV Quick QuoteAPTV - Free Report) and Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH Quick QuoteBAH - Free Report) ).Aptiv currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). APTV has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 16.40%. The company has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. The average beat is 12.18%. Shares of APTV have surged 17.1% in the past month.Booz Allen Hamilton carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. BAH has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 12.60%.The company delivered an earnings surprise of 12.66%, on average, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missing once. Shares of BAH have risen 6.5% in the past month. Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double"" From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all. It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap.

The expansion initiative, formally known as the Future Growth Project – Wellhead Pressure Management Project, is aimed at augmenting the total daily production from the Tengiz reservoir. However, unforeseen challenges have arisen, leading to a projected additional cost increase of $1.5 billion. This escalation could potentially elevate the total project cost to approximately $48.5 billion, marking a substantial deviation from the initial budget.Project Budget and Progress UpdateIn October 2023, Chevron disclosed in its third-quarter earnings report that the Tengiz project budget was undergoing a revision due to slower-than-anticipated progress toward start-up. Initially budgeted at $45.2 billion, the project had already factored in a contingency of $1.9 billion in July 2021, acknowledging the potential disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the recent announcement indicates a further spending escalation, highlighting the complex challenges inherent in large-scale energy projects. Chevron, despite acknowledging the budgetary adjustments, has emphasized that its guidance for the total cost of the Tengiz expansion project remains unchanged from the ranges provided in previous earnings calls. This assertion, which cites a cost increase of 3-5%, highlights the company's commitment to managing costs amid evolving circumstances.Project History and Ownership StructureThe Tengiz expansion project has experienced several delays, with the completion date being postponed twice from the initial mid-2022 target. The project is a joint venture, with CVX holding a 50% stake in Tengizchevroil, the entity responsible for operating the Tengiz Field. Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM Quick QuoteXOM - Free Report) and KazMunayGas, the state-owned national oil and gas company of Kazakhstan, hold a 25% and 20% stake in the venture, respectively. This collaborative ownership structure reflects the project's multinational nature as well as the strategic alliances to facilitate its implementation.Implications and Future OutlookThe projected cost increase of $1.5 billion for the Tengiz oil field project highlights the inherent complexities and uncertainties associated with large-scale energy initiatives. While CVX remains committed to completing the project within the specified parameters, the additional costs necessitate a thorough reassessment of financial projections and risk management strategies.In the broader context, the challenges facing the Tengiz project serve as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the energy sector and the importance of adaptive management practices. As the global energy landscape continues to evolve, companies must navigate a myriad of geopolitical, economic and operational factors to ensure the successful execution of strategic initiatives.ConclusionChevron's Tengiz oil field project in Kazakhstan is facing a significant cost increase of $1.5 billion, potentially pushing the total project cost to approximately $48.5 billion. Despite the challenges posed by slower-than-anticipated progress and escalating costs, Chevron remains committed to completing the project within the stipulated parameters. The collaborative ownership structure and strategic partnerships underpinning the project highlight its significance within the broader energy landscape. As the project progresses, careful monitoring and adaptive management will be essential to mitigate risks and ensure successful outcomes in line with stakeholders' expectations.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, CVX and XOM carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.Investors interested in the energy sector might look at some better-ranked stocks like Archrock, Inc.

The dismissal, prompted by disagreements over dividend policies, underscores ongoing tensions between the state-controlled oil giant and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s administration. This development marks the fifth change in Petrobras' leadership within three years, highlighting persistent political interfWhat Happened?The ousting of Prates, who served less than 18 months, reflects President Lula’s push to reduce investor payouts and boost investments in areas such as renewable energy and refineries. Prates’ tenure was marred by disagreements with government-appointed board members over the decision to pay extraordinary dividends to shareholders. Critics argue that the government's influence threatens to prioritize political goals over shareholder interests, echoing concerns from Petrobras' past scandals and mismanagement.Magda Chambriard, a former head of the Brazilian oil and gas regulator ANP, has been appointed as Prates' successor. Chambriard, who aligns closely with Lula’s views, advocates lower dividends and increased capital spending on domestic projects, such as refining capacity and shipbuilding. Market ReactionFollowing the announcement, Petrobras' shares slipped by 6%, making it the biggest loser on Brazil’s benchmark stock index on Wednesday. The company’s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) in New York also dropped 6% in after-hours trading. Analysts expressed concerns over the abrupt leadership change, which they fear signals increased governmental intervention in the company’s operations. The change is also perceived to increase uncertainties surrounding PBR’s investment strategy, particularly regarding capital allocation.Finncial PerformanceAmid the leadership turmoil, Petrobras recently reported its first-quarter results, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The underperformance can be blamed on rising pre-salt lifting costs that resulted in weak upstream profitability, plus higher refining outlay. This was partly offset by strong production.Recurring net income, which strips one-time items, came in at $4,816 million compared with $7,392 million a year earlier. Petrobras’ adjusted EBITDA fell to $12,127 million from $13,956 million a year ago.Final WordsPetrobras' dividend strategy has been a contentious issue. While Lula’s administration favors reinvesting profits into national projects to stimulate economic growth, this approach conflicts with the preferences of international investors who seek higher returns. The market’s reaction to the leadership change has been negative, reflecting fears of increased political intervention and its potential impact on the company's financial stability and strategic direction. With the appointment of Magda Chambriard, Petrobras is likely to see a shift toward policies that prioritize national economic interests over shareholder returns, further complicating its investment landscape.3 Energy Stocks to BuyPetrobras carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

These tenders aim to contract up to 26 newbuild offshore support vessels, marking a significant effort to rejuvenate Brazil's shipbuilding industry. This initiative is expected to generate substantial investments, potentially reaching $2.5 billion. The announcement was made just hours before Jean Paul Prates resigned as CEO, signaling a key moment for Petrobras and the Brazilian maritime sector.Revitalizing Brazil's Shipbuilding IndustryEconomic Impact of New Vessels: The plan to commission 26 newbuild vessels is a strategy to restore the Brazilian shipbuilding industry's former glory. By introducing 10 oil spill response vessels (OSRVs) and 16 remotely operated vehicle support vessels (RSVs), Petrobras aims to create a ripple effect in the economy. These new buildings are anticipated to spur significant investments, amounting to $2.5 billion. This influx of capital is expected to enhance job creation, boost local economies and position Brazil as a key player in the global shipbuilding arena. Technological Advancements and Innovation: The introduction of advanced OSRVs and RSVs signifies a leap in technological capabilities for Brazil. These vessels are equipped with cutting-edge technology designed to meet the stringent demands of offshore drilling and environmental protection.The focus on oil spill response highlights Petrobras's commitment to environmental stewardship, while the RSVs will enhance the efficiency and safety of offshore operations. This dual approach not only strengthens Petrobras's operational capacity but also aligns with global trends toward more sustainable and technologically advanced maritime solutions.Strategic Importance for PetrobrasSupporting Offshore Drilling Operations: Petrobras's decision to launch these tenders is closely linked to its long-term offshore drilling operations and field development plans in the second half of this decade. The new vessels will be integral in supporting these operations, ensuring efficient and safe extraction of offshore resources. The OSRVs will provide crucial oil spill response capabilities, mitigating environmental risks associated with offshore drilling. Meanwhile, the RSVs will support remotely operated underwater vehicles, essential for maintaining and monitoring offshore infrastructure.Long-term Contracts and Operational Stability: By securing long-term contracts for these vessels, Petrobras aims to ensure operational stability and predictability. Long-term charters will provide a steady stream of income for the shipyards and operators, fostering a stable economic environment. This stability is crucial for planning and executing extensive offshore projects, contributing to Petrobras's overarching goal of sustainable growth and development in the energy sector.Boosting Local Economies: The tenders for 26 newbuild vessels present a significant opportunity for local shipyards and associated industries. The construction and maintenance of these vessels will create numerous jobs from skilled labor to administrative positions. The economic benefits will extend beyond the shipyards, impacting local suppliers, subcontractors and service providers. This holistic economic boost will invigorate local communities and contribute to regional development.ConclusionPetrobras' initiative to revitalize Brazil's shipbuilding industry should lead to significant economic benefits, attract substantial investments and position the country as a leader in the global maritime sector. By focusing on technological innovation and environmental sustainability, PBR is setting a new standard for the industry. As Petrobras moves forward with these ambitious tenders, the potential for economic growth and industry advancement is immense, heralding a new era for Brazil's maritime industry.

(CPS Quick QuoteCPS - Free Report) , assigning a “Neutral” recommendation to the stock. This designation reflects our balanced view of the company's prospects, given its stable financial performance, financial flexibility and strategic market expansion, alongside prevailing industry challenges and market competition.Headquartered in Northville, MI, Cooper-Standard has demonstrated remarkable operational efficiency in the first quarter of 2024, achieving a 300-basis-point year-over-year improvement in the gross margin through successful lean initiatives and cost-saving programs. These measures have generated $19 million in savings, significantly enhancing the company’s profitability.The extension of credit terms from 2025 to 2029 has bolstered CPS’s financial flexibility, with a total liquidity of around $282 million as of Mar 31, 2024. This strategic move, coupled with reductions in interest rate margins and commitment fees, highlights the company’s proactive financial management, aiming to reduce financial risk and enhance credit profiles. Capitalizing on the burgeoning electric vehicle and hybrid markets, Cooper-Standard secured $66 million in business awards in the first quarter of 2024. This strategic alignment not only diversifies revenue streams but also positions the company to benefit from the automotive industry’s shift toward sustainable and advanced technology vehicles.The research report highlights several key factors that could drive Cooper-Standard’s growth. The transition to a product line management structure is expected to streamline operations and improve profitability. This restructuring is anticipated to save $20-$25 million in 2024 and $40-$45 million annually from 2025, driving the EBITDA margin to double digits by the end of 2025.Cooper-Standard’s partnership with NIKE for the use of the Fortrex technology exemplifies its strategic diversification beyond the automotive sector into consumer goods. This move mitigates risks associated with the cyclical nature of the automotive industry and opens revenue streams, reflecting a prudent long-term strategy.However, potential investors should consider certain challenges outlined in the report. Cooper-Standard’s operational cash flow has shown a concerning trend, with a significant decrease from the previous year. Additionally, a high debt level of $1.1 billion and a net leverage ratio of 5.4 times the trailing 12 months’ adjusted EBITDA pose risks to its financial stability.Operating globally, CPS is susceptible to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which have negatively impacted the company’s profitability. The first quarter of 2024 saw a $9-million negative impact on the adjusted EBITDA due to foreign exchange volatility. The automotive industry’s susceptibility to economic downturns and shifts in consumer demand, coupled with broader macroeconomic uncertainties, could negatively impact CPS’s performance and stock price.The stock has experienced a mixed performance, with a notable 18.6% decline over the past six months but a 43.2% increase over the trailing 12 months. CPS is currently trading at a discount compared with its peers, with a trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio of 0.42X.For a comprehensive analysis of Cooper-Standard’s financial health, strategic initiatives and market positioning, you are encouraged to view the full Zacks research report.

This upside is likely to have driven the demand for high-end photomasks in the to-be-reported quarter. In the FPD segment, the increasing usage of AMOLED displays for mobile applications is expected to have aided top-line growth. The demand for display masks is expected to have remained high as panel makers introduced new advancements to attract customers for premium smartphones. The memory market is also experiencing a recovery in demand, particularly from Tier 2 providers involved in high-value applications. This recovery is expected to have boosted Photronics memory photomask business in the second quarter.Gross margin is expected to have benefited from strong demand for both high-end IC and FPD products. For the second quarter, gross margin is expected to be around 38%, up from 36.6% in the first quarter.What Our Model IndicatesPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

(SRDX Quick QuoteSRDX - Free Report) is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its solid prospects in the thrombectomy business over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid second-quarter performance and consistent efforts to boost research and development (R&D) are expected to contribute further. Yet, concerns regarding regulatory headwinds and reliance on third parties persist.So far this year, this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has declined 4.8% against the industry’s 4.2% rise and the S&P 500’s 11.6% growth.The renowned medical device and in-vitro diagnostics technology provider has a market capitalization of $493.68 million. Surmodics projects 97.2% growth for fiscal 2025 and expects to maintain its strong performance. SRDX’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 165.93%. Image Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Consistent Efforts to Boost R&D: Surmodics’ solid efforts to improve its R&D stature have been a key growth driver, which raises our optimism. The company’s pipeline of vascular intervention medical device products under development and recently commercialized include primary platforms like DCBs, Mechanical thrombectomy devices and Radial access devices. In addition to these primary platforms, Surmodics’ device manufacturing operations include Specialty catheters.In the second quarter, Surmodics’ R&D expenses were 27.6% of total revenues. Medical Device R&D and other revenues increased 1.4% in the fiscal second quarter compared with the prior-year quarter, driven by increased volume of performance coating services.Thrombectomy Prospects Bright: Surmodics’ aim to leverage its proprietary Pounce thrombectomy platform technology to develop products raises our optimism. The company announced the completion of limited market evaluation and commercial launch of two new mechanical thrombectomy systems for the peripheral venous and arterial vasculatures, the Pounce Venous Thrombectomy System and the Pounce LP (Low Profile) Thrombectomy System during the fiscal second quarter.In January, Surmodics announced the successful early clinical use of the Pounce LP Thrombectomy System. Strong Q2 Results: Surmodics registered a solid uptick in the overall top and bottom lines in the second quarter. Product sales growth in the Medical Device segment was driven primarily by the fulfillment of the initial stocking order for the SurVeil DCB from Abbott and continued sales growth from the Pounce thrombectomy device platform.DownsidesRegulatory Headwinds: Surmodics’ facilities and procedures are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the latter’s requirements. On account of non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the FDA could ban such medical devices. Any adverse regulatory action can potentially hurt Surmodics' business practices and operations.Reliance on Third Parties: A principal element of Surmodics’ business strategy is to enter into licensing arrangements with medical devices and other companies that manufacture products incorporating its technologies. The company’s revenues from such arrangements depend upon its ability or its licensees’ ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for manufacture (if applicable), and market and sell products incorporating Surmodics’ technologies. Any failure to meet these requirements could have an adverse effect on its business.Estimate TrendSurmodics is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has narrowed from 90 cents to 72 cents.The consensus estimate for the company’s third-quarter fiscal revenues is pegged at $30.3 million, suggesting a 42.2% decline from the year-ago reported number. Loss for the period is estimated to widen 157.7% year over year to 30 cents per share.Surmodics, Inc. Price Surmodics, Inc. price | Surmodics, Inc.

NVDA,2024-05-22,2024-05-08,2024-06-05,NVDA,,2024-05-20 00:00:00,2024-05-20T00:00:00-04:00,2024-05-20,Are You Looking for a High-Growth Dividend Stock?,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Avient in FocusAvient (AVNT Quick QuoteAVNT - Free Report) is headquartered in Avon Lake, and is in the Basic Materials sector. The stock has seen a price change of 10.8% since the start of the year. The maker of resins used in plastic pipe and other products is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.26 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.24%. This compares to the Chemical - Diversified industry's yield of 1.93% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.57%. In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.03 is up 3% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Avient has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 6.65%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Avient's payout ratio is 42%, which means it paid out 42% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.AVNT is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $2.61 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 10.59%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, AVNT is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

Here's an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock You Can Buy Right Now.,"Shoulda, woulda, coulda. That could be the refrain for some investors who didn't own shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in recent years. No company has been at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom as much as Nvidia. The demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) has exploded, causing Nvidia's share price to skyrocket. Missed out on Nvidia's ginormous gains? Don't worry. Here's an AI stock you can buy right now. It's possible that Nvidia could keep its momentum going at the frenetic pace we've seen over the last couple of years. However, I'd argue it's not probable for one simple reason: size. With Nvidia's market cap now hovering around $2.3 trillion, delivering a 3x or greater return is much more difficult. Investors seeking huge growth should think smaller, in my opinion. I think UiPath (NYSE: PATH) is exactly the kind of AI stock that anyone who missed out on Nvidia's meteoric rise should consider. The company sells enterprise automation and AI software. UiPath appears to be in a sweet spot with a market cap of roughly $11.6 billion. Of course, a smaller size doesn't necessarily mean that UiPath will be a big winner in the coming years. But I think it will. For many of the most successful companies today, achieving profitability was an inflection point in their growth trajectory. UiPath recently recorded its first profitable quarter as a public company. Business is booming. UiPath's revenue in its quarter ending Jan. 31, 2024, soared 31% year over year to $405 million -- an all-time high. The company boasts a dollar-based net retention rate (a measure of recurring revenue from existing customers) of 119%. Its gross margin is nearly 90%. If AI merely provides entertaining chats and creates interesting images, it won't be a game changer. The real opportunity for AI (as with any new technology) is increasing productivity. UiPath's primary focus is putting AI to work. The company's Test Suite product for application testing stands out as a great example of how UiPath uses AI to boost productivity. A recent study revealed that Test Suite customers realized average annualized benefits of over $4 million with a return on investment of 529% over three years and a payback on investment of only six months. Ark Invest predicts the AI software market could grow to $14 trillion by 2030 with a compound annual growth rate of 42%, fueled by huge productivity gains. I believe UiPath is in a strong position to capitalize on this tremendous opportunity. Most importantly, UiPath has shown it can deliver the innovation required to stay atop the AI automation market. The company also has an impressive partner network, including Accenture, Deloitte, EY, pwc, and SAP. CEO Robert Enslin noted in the latest quarterly conference call that over 70% of UiPath's deals involve its partners. Is UiPath better than Nvidia? It depends on your perspective. Nvidia is unquestionably the stronger company. The GPU maker dominates the AI chip market and will likely do so for a long time to come. However, I think investors who didn't profit from Nvidia's huge gains have a great opportunity to jump aboard another AI leader that's still in its early stages of growth with UiPath.

Specifically, Schiff has challenged the narrative of increased salaries causing inflation, arguing that, instead, inflation can lead to higher nominal salaries, whereas pointing the finger at, in his view, the real culprit – the US government and the Fed, according to his X post on May 20. Indeed, Schiff has been warning about inflation for some time now, including last month, when he referred to this threat as “gravely understated” by those who are trying to curb inflation fears, stressing that the current situation was “just the tip of an inflation iceberg. At the same time, the prominent economist declared that a full-blow inflationary depression or ‘stagflation’ was coming that would shadow previous financial crises and make them look tame by comparison, calling it a recession “on steroids,” as Finbold reported on April 30. Moreover, recent data indicates that auto loan serious delinquency rates have surged to 2.8% in the first quarter of 2024, the highest level in nearly 15 years, or since 2010 – in the aftermath of the financial crisis, as US households continue to miss loan payments, reminiscent of past recessions. Meanwhile, Paul Dietrich, a veteran Wall Street analyst who accurately predicted the 2008 recession, has long warned about a potential downturn, pointing at several red flags, including unexpectedly high inflation in the first quarter of 2024 and increased market volatility. As he said: “The economy and the stock market have never seen anything like this in history. (…) Everything reminds me of the Dot-com bubble in 2001-2002. (…) Since the current deficit spending is unsustainable, it will end at some point. When it does, the effect will be brutal for jobs, the economy, and the global stock markets.” Interestingly, Schiff, a well-known Bitcoin (BTC) skeptic, has earlier acknowledged that Bitcoin holders are “right about the Fed and inflation,” arguing that other investors were largely unaware of the current financial crisis and the “far greater currency and sovereign debt crisis it will ultimately become.” In the meantime, Bitcoin and tech stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are among the market participants that have beaten inflation in the last 10 years.

Following a rise in memory contract prices, companies have boosted their capital investments, with capacity expansion focusing on the second half of this year. It is expected that wafer input for 1alpha nm and above processes will account for approximately 40% of total DRAM wafer input by the end of the year. HBM production will be prioritized due to its profitability and increasing demand. However, limited yields of around 50–60% and a wafer area 60% larger than DRAM products mean a higher proportion of wafer input is required. Based on the TSV capacity of each company, HBM is expected to account for 35% of advanced process wafer input by the end of this year, with the remaining wafer capacity used for LPDDR5(X) and DDR5 products. Regarding the latest developments in HBM, TrendForce indicates that HBM3e will become the market mainstream this year, with shipments concentrated in the second half of the year. Currently, SK hynix remains the primary supplier, along with Micron, both utilizing 1beta nm processes and already shipping to NVIDIA. Samsung, using a 1alpha nm process, is expected to complete qualification in the second quarter and begin deliveries mid-year. Growing demand for DDR5 and LPDDF5(X) to consume more advanced process capacity In addition to the increasing proportion of HBM demand, the growing content per unit in PCs, servers, and smartphones is driving up the consumption of advanced process capacity each quarter. Servers, in particular, are seeing the highest capacity increase—primarily driven by AI servers with content of 1.75 TB per unit. With the mass production of new platforms like Intel’s Sapphire Rapids and AMD’s Genoa, which require DDR5 memory, DDR5 penetration is expected to exceed 50% by the end of the year. Meanwhile, as HBM3e shipments are expected to be concentrated in the second half of the year—coinciding with the peak season for memory demand—market demand for DDR5 and LPDDR5(X) is also expected to increase. However, due to financial losses experienced in 2023, manufacturers are being cautious with their capacity expansion plans. Overall, with a higher proportion of wafer input allocated to HBM production, the output of advanced processes will be limited. Consequently, capacity allocation in the second half of the year will be crucial in determining whether supply can meet demand. Potential DRAM supply shortage due to HBM capacity prioritization The increased focus on HBM production could lead to a DRAM supply shortage if there isn’t sufficient expansion of advanced process capacities. Currently, new factory plans are as follows: Samsung expects existing facilities to be fully utilized by the end of 2024. The new P4L plant is slated for completion in 2025, and the Line 15 facility will undergo a process transition from 1Y nm to 1beta nm and above. The capacity of SK hynix’s M16 plant is expected to expand next year, while the M15X plant is also planned for completion in 2025, with mass production starting at the end of next year. Micron’s facility in Taiwan will return to full capacity next year, with future expansions focused on the US. The Boise facility is expected to be completed in 2025, with equipment installations following and mass production planned for 2026. TrendForce notes that while new factories are scheduled for completion in 2025, the exact timelines for mass production are still uncertain and depend on the profitability of 2024. This reliance on future profits to fund further equipment purchases reinforces the manufacturers’ commitment to maintaining memory price increases this year. Additionally, NVIDIA’s GB200, set to ramp up production in 2025, will feature HBM3e 192/384 GB, potentially doubling HBM output. With HBM4 development on the horizon, if there isn’t significant investment in expanding capacity, the prioritization of HBM could lead to insufficient DRAM supply due to capacity constraints.

While the broader market is hitting record highs, Ark’s actively managed funds are lagging far behind, raising concerns about their future viability. One investment advisor has sounded a stark warning, suggesting Ark’s funds could even go under. What Happened: Ram Ahluwalia of Lumida Wealth pointed to Ark’s flagship ETF, Ark Innovation ETF ARKK, which is currently trading over 70% below its all-time high, a stark contrast to the S&P 500’s recent record highs. ARKK had its heydays amid the recent pandemic as a significant share of its holdings were COVID-19 plays, which capitalized on lockdown restrictions and the work-from-home environment that prevailed at that time. The ETF peaked at $159.70 in mid-February 2021. Source: Benzinga Here are the year-to-performances of Ark’s key ETFs vs the broader market: See Also: Best ETFs To Buy Right Now What Ails Ark Funds? Ahluwalia attributed Ark’s woes to a combination of missed bets and an over-reliance on “vision” over fundamentals. He criticized Ark for selling Nvidia Corp. NVDA stock early in the AI boom and pouring resources into companies like Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings, Inc. DNA and SoFi Technologies, Inc. SOFI. “They sold Nvidia, bought Tesla (We did the opposite). They bought Ginko Biosciences (Never touched it),” he wrote. “They bought $SOFI (We shorted it).” He argued that Ark prioritizes chasing “future ideas” without proper evaluation of traction, valuation, and management credibility. This focus on disruptive innovation, a cornerstone of Ark’s strategy, seems to be backfiring in the current market. While Wood emphasizes long-term growth potential in areas like AI and robotics, many of Ark’s top holdings, including Tesla, Inc. TSLA, haven’t delivered the returns the firm anticipated. “The consistency & statistical significance of how consistently ARKK under-performs is truly incredible,” Ahluwalia said. “If someone asked me to design a product with that kind of performance profile, I don’t think I could do it.” “Literally throwing random darts at tickers would out-perform ARKK,” he added. “How do they do it!?” “Investing the assets of others is a special duty. The lives of others and their family goals are directly impacted,” Ahluwalia said. “Institutions that are chronic destroyers of wealth should absolutely be called out. Most people lack the skill to discern good from bad investing.” Different View: Morningstar strategist Robby Greengold offered another perspective on Ark’s struggles. He suggested the firm lacks the forecasting talent needed for its focus on unproven companies and criticizes the high portfolio correlation due to its thematic investment approach. He argued Ark’s portfolio essentially resembles a tech-heavy fund, despite its focus on disruptive innovation. Why It Matters: Wood’s Ark Invest reigned supreme in early 2021, managing a hefty $59 billion across its ETFs. Today, however, that figure has shrunk by 80% to a mere $11.1 billion, likely a consequence of rising interest rates dampening investor enthusiasm for Wood’s long-term tech bets. In Monday’s premarket session on Monday, ARKK rose 0.33% to $45.60, according to Benzinga Pro data.",http://feeds.benzinga.com,https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/05/38915172/investment-advisor-says-throwing-random-darts-at-tickers-would-beat-arkk-as-cathie-,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/investment-advisor-says-throwing-random-darts-at-tickers-would-20240520.jpeg

Nvidia stock soared above a buy point Wednesday, while Modine is trying to clear a cup base after several months of outperformance. For Nvidia stock to move to new highs from here, it'll most likely need another big earnings and revenue beat, along with a significantly raised forecast from the company. Same goes for Modine. With Nvidia, HSBC upped the artificial intelligence leader's price target earlier in the week to 1,350, saying that the company's earnings power hasn't fully been valued into the stock. It's no secret what's been fueling Nvidia's price strength in recent months — torrid earnings and revenue growth for three quarters in a row. When Nvidia reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Feb. 21, shares gapped up sharply the next day. Nvidia said adjusted profit soared 486% year over year to $5.16 a share. Revenue jumped 265% to $22.1 billion, with data center sales up 409% to $18.4 billion, helped by strong demand for its graphics processors used to run AI applications. The company's gaming business, which includes graphics cards for laptops and PCs, rose 56% to $2.87 billion. ""Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,"" Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in the earnings release. ""Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations."" Huang also said that while demand remains strong from large cloud-service providers, the company is also seeing robust demand from enterprise software and consumer internet firms. Nvidia raised its revenue outlook for the April-ended quarter to $24 billion. At the time, analysts had predicted $22.17 billion in sales. Results for the quarter are due Wednesday after the close. Nvidia stock analysts polled by FactSet predict adjusted profit of $5.22 a share, up 474% year over year, with revenue up 241% to $24.5 billion. Modine has been on a tear in recent months, helped by strong earnings growth in recent quarters, although estimates are for a much slower pace. Revenue growth is expected to pick up in the second half of the year. Artificial Intelligence News And AI Stocks To Watch Modine stock was volatile when the company's earnings report in late January showed adjusted profit up 54% year over year to 74 cents a share. Revenue was flat at $561.4 million. Shares fell 10% intraday, but Modine reversed higher for a gain of 3.5% in strong volume, helped by an upwardly-revised full-year earnings outlook for the third straight quarter. Still, revenue at Modine's climate solutions segment fell slightly to $242.5 million. The decrease came on lower sales of heat transfer products. That was partly offset by higher sales of data center cooling products, along with heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems as well as refrigeration products. ""We are experiencing rapid sales growth to the data center market, supported by robust demand from both hyperscale and colocation customers,"" said Modine CEO Neil Brinker. Modine stock tripled in price last year and was up another 83% this year through Wednesday. Modine is currently trying to clear a cup base with a 106.01 entry. Results for the March-ended quarter will be out Tuesday after the close. A basic options trading strategy around earnings — using call options — allows you to buy a stock at a predetermined price without taking a lot of risk. Here's how the option trading strategy works, and what a call-option trade recently looked like for Nvidia stock. First, identify top-rated stocks with a bullish chart. Some might be setting up in sound early-stage bases. Further, others already might have broken out and are getting support at their 10-week moving averages for the first time. And a few might be trading tightly near highs and refusing to give up much ground. Avoid extended stocks that are too far past proper entry points. Join IBD experts as they analyze leading stocks in the current stock market rally on IBD Live A call option is a bullish bet on a stock. Put options are bearish bets. One call option contract gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares of a stock at a specified price, known as the strike price. Once you've identified a bullish setup in the earnings calendar, check strike prices with your online trading platform, or at cboe.com. Also, make sure the option is liquid, with a relatively tight spread between the bid and ask. Look for a strike price just above the underlying stock price — that's out of the money — and check the premium. Ideally, the premium should not exceed 4% of the underlying stock price at the time. In some cases, an in-the-money strike price is OK as long as the premium isn't too expensive. Choose an expiration date that fits your risk objective. But keep in mind that time is money in the options market. Near-term expiration dates will have cheaper premiums than those further out. Buying time in the options market comes at a higher cost. When Nvidia stock traded around 946.25, a slightly out-of-the-money weekly call option with a 950 strike price and a May 24 expiration came with a premium of around $44 per contract. That was 4.6% of the underlying stock price at the time. One contract gave the holder the right to buy 100 shares of Nvidia at 950 per share. The most that could be lost was $4,400 — the amount paid for the 100-share contract. To break even, Nvidia would need to rise to 994, factoring in the premium paid. Keep in mind that this is not a trade for a smaller portfolio. The reason is that taking delivery of 100 shares of Nvidia in the above scenario would cost $95,000. The expected move in the options market for Nvidia stock, based on the at-the-money strike price of 945, was about 91 points up or down. That's found by adding the at-the-money call premium and a put premium for the May 24 contract. Follow Ken Shreve on X/Twitter @IBD_KShreve for more stock market analysis and insight.

NVDA,2024-05-22,2024-05-08,2024-06-05,NVDA,,2024-05-20 08:36:00,2024-05-20T08:36:00-04:00,2024-05-20,Nvidia tipped by Barclays to outperform in first quarter,"NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA, ETR:NVD) is anticipated to report strong first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, with Barclays indicating potential upward revisions based on recent research. “All signs point to another revision higher,” said analysts, noting that Asia checks suggest a nearly 10% upside in graphics processing unit sales in the quarter (increasing to over 20% for the quarter ahead as capacity expands). “We believe the company can capture incremental revenue upside due to pricing on H200, which will start shipping in the July quarter,” said the bank. H200 is one of Nvidia’s cornerstone products, a GPU highly optimised for generative artificial intelligence applications. Barclays projects NVIDIA's data center segment revenue (which encompasses AI chip sales) to be around $23 billion in the first quarter, extending $24.5 billion in July, surpassing Street estimates of $21.1 billion and $22.8 billion, respectively. These projections include contributions from Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), which Nvidia bought for $6.9 billion in 2019. “While investor concerns through the quarter have largely centered on a potential air pocket in the middle of the year ahead of the Blackwell launch, we still do not see evidence of this occurring, with the tone from our checks remaining mostly unchanged,” said Barclays. Blackwell is Nvidia’s next generation of high-end GPUs. Barclays is overweight on Nvidia stock with a $1,100 price target against the current $946 share price. Nvidia Corp is set to dominate market discussions this week as it prepares to release its earnings report on Wednesday afternoon. The semiconductor giant, with a market cap of approximately $2.3 trillion, holds significant influence in the S&P 500. Its performance is expected to impact the technology sector and broader market indices. ""As Nvidia goes, so go most of the semiconductor stocks and AI plays,"" is how Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets (NASDAQ:FRHC), put it. He noted that the stock's average post-earnings move is plus 8.5%, making it a critical factor for market volatility. Analysts ratings, based on Bloomberg statistics, have the equivalent of 61 buys, 7 holds and 0 sells on the stock. The average analyst price target is $1018.45 which is less than a 10% upside from current levels. “While a disappointment could open the door for many potential downgrades, a beat should lead to a wave of price target upgrades,” said Woods. Beyond Nvidia, other major earnings include Lowe’s, Target, Toll Brothers, elf Beauty, and Macy’s. Zoom Video and Palo Alto Networks are also in focus, with their earnings reports potentially adding to market movements. Zoom Video, which has been struggling since its peak, needs to show sustained improvement while Palo Alto Networks aims to recover from recent declines despite a strong track record, according to Woods. On the macro front The week also features significant economic data releases. Existing Home Sales and FOMC minutes on Wednesday, Jobless Claims and New Home Sales on Thursday, and Durable Goods and Consumer Sentiment on Friday will provide insights into the economic landscape. The S&P 500 reached new highs last week, driven by a cooler-than-expected CPI number, which fueled optimism about potential Fed rate cuts. However, the 10-year yield remains stable above key technical levels, maintaining caution among traders. Freedom Capital Markets (NASDAQ:FRHC) notes the market's anticipation for the Fed minutes, which will reveal any divisions among committee members regarding future rate hikes or cuts. The consensus is no action in June, with possible rate cuts discussed for July or September.

Top movers among the tech-heavy index included the gamut of chipmaking firms, including Nvidia, Applied Materials, Marvell Technology, Micron and Qualcomm. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, on the other hand, was down 0.3% to 39,890, while the broader S&P 500 index was off intraday highs but remained 09.2% higher at 5,312. 12.09pm: Nasdaq hits new record The Nasdaq 100 was up 0.6% at midday on Monday, bringing the tech-heavy index to a new all-time high of 18,663. Stocks were up across the board, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading at 40,021 and the broader S&P 500 index up 0.35% to 5,321. Nvidia’s pending earnings (scheduled for Wednesday) sent semiconductor stocks into a frenzy, with Applied Materials, Microchip Technology, Qualcomm and Micron joining Nvidia as the top risers. 9.45am: DJIA retreats The Dow Jones has retreated from its record high achieved at the close last week but semiconductor names are driving the Nasdaq higher. The Dow is down 79 points or 0.20%, with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) down 1.4%, Home Depot and Honeywell International both down 1.1% to lead the blue-chip fallers. Meanwhile, the broader S&P 500 is up 0.19% and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.52%, with NVIDIA ahead of its results midweek and fellow chip group AMD both up 2.3% as two of the big drivers of the gains, while the seven largest companies in the index are all in green. A big faller in the tech-heavy exchange is China's Li Auto, after first-quarter vehicle sales missed forecasts as deliveries of its first pure electric car fell short of the company's targets. It reported vehicle sales totalling 24.25 billion yuan ($3.4 billion) for the first three months of the year, up 32% but short of the 26.71 billion yuan analysts expected. 7.51am: Wall Street to open higher US stocks are set to join European markets and open the week higher, following on from the highs reached at the end of last week. But after the Dow Jones last week saw the index break through the 40,000 barrier for the first time right at the close, Dow futures are roughly flat. Gains will be led by the tech-powered Nasdaq 100, with futures pointing to a 0.3% gain, ahead of a 0.2% increase for S&P 500 futures. Last week, in addition to the Dow 40k, the S&P took back 5300, while Nasdaq 17k ""remains elusive"" says Kenny Polcari at Kace Capital Advisors. The tech index, he says, ""needs to gain 1.8% to get us to that number – with many betting this will be the week – why? Think NVDA! [Earnings] are due out on Wednesday after the bell….and the sense is that they are going to crush it again…that they can’t make their chips fast enough and AI is the story."" There’s very little in the way of major economic data releases this week, notes market analyst David Morrison at Trade Nation, although there are a stack of speeches due from Fed speakers, starting today. Wednesday is a biggie, with minutes from the FOMC’s last meeting as well as Nvidia's earnings. There are still a few earnings from major retailers coming up, Morrison notes. ""Last week, Walmart released a strong set of results and the stock rallied sharply taking it to all-time highs and helping to lift the Dow above 40,000. But Home Depot was a disappointment. Retail sales were flat, so it will be useful to hear what the remaining retailers have to say about their outlook for the rest of the year."" The earnings season has proved broadly supportive, with FactSet data showing 93% of S&P 500 constituents have now reported and 78% have beaten expectations on earnings-per-share, while 60% have beaten on revenues. ""Current earnings growth is at its best levels since the second quarter of 2022, although P/E ratios suggest that stocks are expensive, running above both their 5 and 10-year averages,"" he adds. NanoViricides (NYSE-A:NNVC) has reported that its antiviral drug candidate NV-387 demonstrated significant efficacy against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in a lethal lung infection animal model. The study showed that animals treated with NV-387 orally had normal lung histology and survived the infection, suggesting NV-387 could potentially cure RSV. In a comparative study, animals were administered NV-387 and ribavirin, another antiviral drug, for 11 days. The NV-387 treated group exhibited no lung damage and complete survival beyond the 21-day study period. Conversely, the ribavirin-treated group showed progressive lung pathology and did not survive past 14 days. ""These results clearly demonstrate that NV-387 oral treatment would be of great clinical value for protecting infants and children from RSV,"" said Anil R. Diwan, the company's president and executive chairman. ""We are very pleased with these results and plan on advancing NV-387 for the treatment of RSV infection into clinical trials as soon as possible."" Currently, there is no approved treatment for RSV besides ribavirin, which is highly toxic. RSV causes morbidity and mortality among infants, children, and older adults, making the development of a safe and effective treatment an unmet medical need.",https://www.proactiveinvestors.com,https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/1047972/nasdaq-hits-record-as-nvidia-sets-chip-stocks-alight-1047972.html,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/nasdaq-hits-record-as-nvidia-sets-chip-stocks-alight-20240520.jpeg

In a new note, Bank of America notes that stock gains for Vertiv — which makes power and cooling equipment for data center — have outpaced Nvidia returns by a whopping 315 percentage points over the past year. They're starting the comparison on May 24, 2023, right after Nvidia's first blowout quarter, which set off the entire AI boom in stocks. To be exact, Vertiv has climbed 516% since the date, handily outpacing Nvidia's 211% gain. The benchmark S&P 500 has risen a comparatively paltry 29% over the same period. ""Vertiv is the real AI darling,"" BofA wrote in a client note. BofA says Vertiv's stellar performance is representative of the AI rally broadening out to include an increasing range of sectors. Much of that stems from the advanced chips that power AI on — such as the ones Nvidia produces — requiring significantly more electricity to operate. That offers upside to industrials, utilities, and commodities, according to the firm. ""GPUs need 2-2.5x more power than CPUs, and expected power usage for US data centers under construction is equivalent to more than 50% of the power currently used by US data centers,"" Bank of America wrote on Monday. ""Power used by AI applications is expected to grow at a 25-33% CAGR over the next few years."" Others, such as ""Big Short"" investor Steve Eisman, have pointed out that the boost to power usage also makes these GPUs considerably hotter, putting pressure on firms such as Vertiv to improve cooling systems in data centers. Eisman has long been a bull on US infrastructure. Aside from AI, he's betting that green policy will boost these sectors as well. As Nvidia gears up for its earnings season on Wednesday, expectations remain strong, Bank of America said. The company has also set its own bar high, judging from its last twelve months: it's added $1.5 trillion in market cap and trailing earnings per share have rocketed 617%. ""But it's not just about NVDA anymore,"" the note said, adding: ""Fundamentals are broadening out and so should the market: NVDA drove 37% of S&P earnings growth over the LTM (and 11% of return), but is expected to drive just 9% over the next 12 months."" Previously, Goldman Sachs had similarly outlined broadening AI investment, characterizing Nvidia as the first of four phases. Eventually, utility investments will take over, at which point firms that can best integrate AI software start winning out.",https://markets.businessinsider.com,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/vertiv-stock-price-outperforms-nvidia-since-earnings-ai-investing-rally-2024-5,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/the-real-ai-darling-this-datacenter-stock-has-beaten-20240520.jpeg

Equities continued surging forward thanks to resilient global economic data while bonds suffered from rising yields. Strong corporate earnings, positive sentiment around the potentially transformational impact of artificial intelligence, and expectations of eventual rate cuts also provided fuel to rocket equities higher. From a regional perspective, developed markets continued to outperform their emerging market peers mainly due to continued economic challenges in China. Technology focused businesses were some of the strongest performers in the first quarter, especially among those positioned to benefit from artificial intelligence and semiconductor demand. However, our lack of exposure to NVIDIA and Meta was a hindrance on relative performance this quarter as the market has continued to look at these companies favorably. While the advancements in artificial intelligence have helped propel many technology companies higher, not all companies have been winners from this development—businesses models that may be disrupted by this technology were some of our weaker performing holdings over the quarter including a provider of contact center software, Enghouse Systems (TSX:ENGH, Financial), and contact center operator, Teleperformance (XPAR:TEP, Financial). Elsewhere, momentum continued for some of our stronger performing holdings from 2023. Despite the divergence in the returns of equities and fixed income, balanced investors have benefited from another notable quarter of strong performance from equities. While some central banks have communicated the possibility of lower policy rates, the timing and extent remain uncertain as the economy, notably in the U.S., has remained resilient and inflation has been difficult to fully tame. This uncertainty has led to a tempering in expectations for the number of possible policy rate cuts to come this year. Ultimately, yields slightly increased and Canadian bonds finished the quarter in negative territory.We made a few adjustments to our target asset mix weights in the quarter. For clients in our Balanced and Tax Effective Balanced strategies, as equities have continued to climb, we trimmed back our weight in U.S. equity and added to Canadian bonds. We also reallocated a portion of our U.S. equity weight to our U.S. Mid Cap equity strategy as we believe this will improve the overall diversification of the portfolio. For clients in our Global Balanced strategy, we also trimmed back our equity weight and added to Canadian bonds.We remain mindful that the strong returns in many regional equity markets may be vulnerable to a deviation in the current path of policy rates or economic outlook—although it's also possible that current enthusiasm may prevail. The current bull market is a sign of confidence in the durability of the global economy, the continued robustness of corporate earnings, and that central banks' actions against inflation are having their intended effect. During the last several years, macro factors have had an outsized influence on equity markets: e.g., the initial demand destruction caused by COVID-19, the impact of the ensuing stimulus in propelling markets higher, and the duration effects of inflation and higher discount rates that whipsawed stock prices in 2022 and 2023. But in 2024, investors have been unfazed by the influence of central banks: equities have marched higher despite a pullback in expectations for rate cuts. While there may indeed be some hype associated with artificial intelligence and uncertain future demand, it does appear to be backed by genuine earnings growth (which will need to persist in order to justify valuations) and many businesses exposed seem to enjoy strong moats.With a higher cost of capital and an economy that seems to be coping reasonably well with that cost of capital, a greater discernment of fundamentals, genuine earnings potential, and ultimately long-term wealth creation is welcome. Big-picture risks to the outlook are always present, hence our focus on a well-balanced portfolio of businesses that can withstand shocks.We continue to balance the risks, managing exposure to sharp edges by constructing portfolios we believe to be resilient.",https://www.gurufocus.com,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2441888/mawer-canadas-1stquarter-commentary-a-look-back,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/mawer-canadas-1stquarter-commentary-a-look-back-20240520.jpg

The chip maker's earnings report could drive a big move in the stock market, both to the upside or downside, depending on how the results shake out. Current options pricing implies Nvidia will jump or fall 8.5% after its earnings results, which is markedly lower than prior Nvidia earnings releases when options traders were implying a move of of 14%-26%. That's because Nvidia and its successful lineup of AI-focused GPUs have had a massive impact on the earnings growth of the S&P 500. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia's earnings growth drove 37% of the S&P 500's earnings per share growth. But over the next 12 months, Nvidia's earnings growth is expected to drive just 9% of the S&P 500's earnings growth. This dynamic highlights the potential market-shaking impact Nvidia could have on the broader stock market this week, and Bank of America has a way to hedge against the risk. Instead of buying put or call options on the major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, Bank of America recommends investors buy call or put options on Nvidia itself. In other words, if an investor believes the stock market is going to fall this week on Nvidia's earnings results, instead of buying put options in the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100, they should buy put options in Nvidia, and vice versa with call options if they believe the stock market will rise. ""For those worried about the (positive or negative) impact of NVDA earnings on the broader market, NVDA options offer better value than hedging through indices like QQQ, SPY, SMH (Semis ETF),"" Bank of America said. The reason is that Nvidia options cost less than options on the broader indices, according to the bank, likely due to the strong liquidity and trading interest in the AI giant. ""Don't mess with proxies; hedge with NVDA options,"" Bank of America said.",https://markets.businessinsider.com,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/hedge-stock-market-risk-nvidia-q1-earnings-report-nvda-options-2024-5,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/bank-of-america-details-the-best-hedge-for-a-20240520.jpeg

Here are the earnings estimates, what analysts are saying and key items to watch. Earnings Estimates: Analysts expect Nvidia to report first-quarter revenue of $24.60 billion, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The company reported first-quarter revenue of $7.19 billion in the previous fiscal year. Nvidia has beaten analysts' revenue estimates in six straight quarters and nine of the last 10 quarters. Analysts expect Nvidia to report earnings per share of $5.58 in the first quarter, compared to earnings per share of $1.09 in last year's first quarter. The company has beaten analysts' earnings per share estimates in five straight quarters and eight of the last 10 quarters. Guidance from Nvidia calls for first quarter revenue to be $24.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. Related Link: Nvidia Is Still ‘Stepping On The AI Accelerator’: 7 Analysts Size Up Q4 Results, Supply And Demand Dynamics What Analysts Are Saying: While Nvidia is likely to report strong year-over-year growth, analysts see potential volatility ahead of the Blackwell transition. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya, who has a Buy rating and $1,100 price target, expects a beat and raise from Nvidia despite the volatility. The analyst said expectations for Nvidia are $26 billion based on speaking with investors ahead of the quarterly report. ""Even if NVDA were to potentially deliver on these bullish expectations, the stock could still react unfavorably,"" Arya said. The analyst said slowing demand, lower quarter-over-quarter growth and pricing pressure could be factors that bears are watching. ""On the other hand a favorable scenario could be perhaps NVDA reporting only modest FQ1 beat, but then guiding FQ2 up 10%+, while retaining favorable 76-77% GM (gross margins) as Blackwell ramp comes later in the year while Hopper cost structure remains favorable."" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy is expecting another strong quarter and outlook from Nvidia. The analyst, who has a Buy rating, raised the price target from $910 to $1,085. ""Once again, a beat/raise is widely anticipated with investor focus likely to remain on medium-term sustainability of accelerating AI infrastructure investment,"" Roy said. The analyst said supply chain checks indicate robust demand for existing Nvidia products ahead of the Blackwell launch. ""NVDA remains our top pick relative to the AI infrastructure investment theme."" The analyst said strength in the Data Center segment will drive ""significant year-over-year growth"" in coming quarters, leading to estimate increases. ""The scaling of recent large-scale models coupled with NVDA's Blackwell ramp in 2025 suggests to us that we are likely to see meaningful growth well into next year."" The analyst estimates Nvidia’s total addressable market to reach $100 billion by 2025, potentially growing to $1 trillion in the future. A beat and raise from Nvidia is also anticipated by Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann. The analyst, who has a Buy rating and $1,400 price target, said the beat and raise might be lower than the previous quarter due to supply shortages. ""We do not subscribe to the air-pocket theory in the Hopper to Blackwell transition for the July quarter guide as the transition to B100 is scheduled for later in 2024,"" Mosesmann said. The analyst said Nvidia could maintain or increase its market share due to its platform and software stack. ""We also anticipate that Blackwell will be completely sold out, at least for a year."" Mosesmann said shares of Nvidia could be volatile ahead of and after the first-quarter earnings report. ""We expect volatility into this week's print but are nonetheless positively biased on a story that is increasingly resonating with the best secular idea in all of technology."" Here are other analyst ratings and price targets for Nvidia in the month of May. Barclays: Overweight rating, raised price target from $850 to $1,100 Susquehanna: Positive rating, raised price target from $910 to $1,085 Baird: Outperform rating, raised price target from $1,050 to $1,200 Oppenheimer: Outperform rating, $1,100 price target Wedbush: Outperform rating, $1,000 price target Wells Fargo: Overweight rating, raised price target from $970 to $1,150 Jefferies: Buy rating, raised price target from $780 to $1,200 HSBC: Buy rating, raised price target from $1,050 to $1,350 Goldman Sachs: Buy rating, raised price target from $1,000 to $1,100 NVDA Price Action: Nvidia shares trade at $947.80 versus a 52-week trading range of $298.06 to $974.00.
