    "text": "After a rough few days, the major indices are in the green this morning. Nasdaq futures are up 36. Dow futures are up 124, with the S&amp;P 500 up about 12 points. All as markets wait to hear what Fed boss Jerome Powell has to say about interest rates moving forward. Last checked, there’s now a 75% chance of a quarter-point cut by September. “I think the Fed and what Powell is going to try to articulate and communicate is an explanation and a justification for the Fed to start a process of cutting interest rates starting in September,” Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s Jim Caron told CNBC. “And I think that should be supportive for markets.” Shares of Cracker Barrel Just Lost $200 Million of Value Shares of Cracker Barrel lost about $200 million of their value after releasing its new logo, which eliminates the drawing of an overalls-clad man leaning against a barrel. Now, the logo will just feature the chain’s name, which isn’t sitting well with diners or investors. Plus, according to the company’s site, “This year we even unveiled a brand-new logo! Rather than just showing one person, we wanted to feature lots of people. The idea was to celebrate the diversity of all our guests with a logo that represented our continued passion for pleasing people of all races, colors, and genders.” For some investors, the change is a “Bud Light” moment with heavy backlash. Still, keep an eye on the Cracker Barrel (CBRL) stock. Once the pullback over a brand logo change is over, we do expect it to regain lost ground – especially if earnings can remain as strong as they have been. The AI Party isn’t over, says Wedbush’s Dan Ives The AI party is far from over, despite fears of a bubble, according to Wedbush’s Dan Ives. “Ives said that, although some names in the AI sphere — such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — have warned of overexuberance from investors about the technology, in his view, ‘the AI party &#8230; started at 9 pm. It’s now 10 pm. That party goes to 4 am,” as quoted by CNBC. With that, Ives still believes tech heavyweights, such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta, will be some of the top standout winners.

    "text": "Shares of cloud-based storage solutions provider Snowflake Inc. (NYSE: SNOW) slipped 0.68% over the past month following a surge of 6.56% the month prior. Since hitting its year-to-date low on April 4, the stock is up more nearly 63%, bringing its year-to-date gain to 34.75%. When the company reported Q1 earnings on May 21 after the close, it announced a beat on EPS with revenue meeting expectations. Revenue guidance for June came in above expectations as well. But the big takeaway was that quarterly revenue topped $1 billion for the first time, coming in at $1.04 billion. The company plans to report Q2 earnings on Aug. 21. In late June, Morgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh assumed coverage of Snowflake with an overweight rating and a bullish $262 price target. Singh cites how SNOW — under the leadership of new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy — has become a &#8220;better executing and faster innovating company.&#8221; The firm sees AI &#8220;creating a long growth runway&#8221; in Snowflake&#8217;s core business while market expansion into data engineering and AI provide the path to 20% growth annually through 2030. Big Data is big business, and the companies that provide cloud storage solutions are at the forefront of an explosive industry. Snowflake is the quintessential example. Despite having to face cloud-based data warehousing competitors such as Google BigQuery, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), or Redshift, a business division of Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the $602.31 billion industry&#8217;s projected growth. According to Grand View Research, the global cloud computing market size is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.2% between 2024 and 2030, with the U.S. cloud computing market forecast to grow at a slightly lower — but still considerable — CAGR of 20.3% over the same time frame. In addition to its data management services, Snowflake provides clients with customized infrastructure solutions, a pay-as-you-go pricing model, scalability, low to no latency as well as analytics capabilities. In doing so, the Bozeman, Mont.-based company has amassed a $71.10 billion market cap. However, its stock has struggled since 2021 when it hit its all-time high of $392.15 per share, falling 45.51% since. With the industry ripe for expansion, 24/7 Wall Street has performed an analysis that suggests there is considerable upside potential for the tech company. Here is where prospective investors and current shareholders might expect the stock to be over the course of the next five years. Key Points Snowflake&#8217;s strong earnings record suggests the ability to continue to produce positive earnings while growing alongside the cloud data storage industry. Since the first quarter of 2021, the company has beat on earnings per share (EPS) in 15 out of 16 quarters. Snowflake has been experiencing explosive revenue growth that reflects the industry in which it operates. After posting total revenue of $264.75 million in 2020, the company saw revenue grow to $592.05 million in 2021, $1.22 billion in 2022, $2.07 billion in 2023, $2.81 billion in fiscal year 2024 — good for an enormous 961.38% increase between 2020 and 2024.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Snowflake&#8217;s Recent Stock Performance Shares of SNOW could be considered undervalued given the combination of its recent stock performance, its significantly growing revenue figures, and the overall industry&#8217;s projected CAGR through 2030. Snowflake&#8217;s stock surged after its IPO on Sept. 15, 2020. However, as previously mentioned, it has struggled since hitting its all-time high in November 2021. Year Share Price Revenue* Net Income* 2020 $281.40 $0.264 -$0.348 2021 $338.75 $0.592 -$0.539 2022 $143.54 $1.22 -$0.679 2023 $199.00 $2.07 -$0.796 2024 $195.64 $2.81 -$0.836 *Revenue and net income in $billions Despite the 45.51% drop from its all-time high, the stock has performed better than usual in the last two quarters of 2024. Despite a negative price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of -50.8, its total assets of $8.22 billion already outweigh its total liabilities of $3.03 billion while its free cash flow has grown from -$199.41 million in 2020 to $784.29 million in 2024, good for a jaw-dropping 493.31% increase. These metrics suggest that the company&#8217;s underlying fundamentals are strong and could set the table for a turnaround in share performance in the near future. Key Drivers of Snowflake&#8217;s Stock Performance 1. Collaboration With NVIDIA: Snowflake recently announced a partnership with NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA). Snowflake has implemented NVIDIA&#8217;s AI Enterprise software, which will allow it to help customers build customized AI data applications. This will allow the company to enjoy a twofold growing industry demand between its existing offerings for cloud-based data storage as well as a vast array of AI applications meeting the needs of its tech clientele. 2. A Loyal Customer Base: According to Yahoo! Finance, Snowflake is delivering solid growth while experiencing exceptional customer loyalty evidenced by revenue retention of 127%. Those customers run the games from mega-cap companies like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and small-cap companies like Petco Health and Wellness Company Inc. (NASDAQ: WOOF) to privately held yet popular enterprises such as Orangetheory Fitness and public entities such as the City of San Francisco and the Florida State University. 3. An Industry Primed for Growth: As previously discussed, the CAGR for the U.S. cloud computing market, which stood at $602.31 in 2023, is 20.3%. Grand View Research cites the rise of hybrid and milt-cloud solutions in driving the industry, as well as increased cloud adoption among both private and public (government) enterprises, both in the developed and developing world. Coupled with the rise of AI and machine learning, companies like Snowflake are uniquely positioned to serve as so-called hyper-scalers allowing them to use their flexibility to diversify service offerings that cater to the specific needs of a growing clientele that spans a broad range of industries and sectors. Snowflake (SNOW) Price Prediction in 2025 Of the 39 Wall Street analysts covering Snowflake, the stock has a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy,&#8221; with 34 analysts assigning it as a &#8220;Buy,&#8221; five assigning it as a &#8220;Hold&#8221; and zero assigning it as a &#8220;Sell.&#8221; The median one-year price target for SNOW is $232.81, which represents 9.68% upside potential from today&#8217;s share price. However, 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s forecast is bearish, with a median year-end price target for shares of SNOW of $193.70 by the end of its FY 2025, or 8.73% downside potential from today&#8217;s share price.

    "text": "The trade war with China was tough on Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors. In April, shares hit a year-to-date low below $87 apiece. Like its fellow Magnificent 7 members, Nvidia struggled due to economic uncertainties about the effects of tariffs, as well as due to Chinese AI innovations. Bears saw Nvidia stock falling further because of bearish pressure from the broader market. Yet, some investors remain optimistic for a sustained rebound, and that seems to have been the case. The stock returned to all-time highs as some tariff fears dissipated and macro data improved. --> --> 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock continues to recover from the year-to-date low. With the AI darling now trading near an all-time high, many are wondering where the stock could go next. This analysis looks at three scenarios and where Nvidia stock could be in 2030. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of “Next Nvidia Stocks” that could be even better. Click here to learn more. --> --> The bearish argument that prevailed on Wall Street early this year is not entirely gone, though. While the AI rally may continue, it remains speculative, whereas the reasons for Nvidia stock’s decline in the spring were genuine. Nvidia may still be at a crossroads right now. We do not know for sure where the stock will go next, but with the data on hand, we can speculate. That’s what we are doing here. Three Key Drivers of Nvidia Performance Through 2030 Will Nvidia continue to lead in AI? 1. AI Infrastructure Dominance: Nvidia controls an estimated 80% of the AI accelerator market through its H100/H200 GPUs and CUDA software ecosystem. It is tough for Nvidia customers to switch to another supplier. This has allowed the company to dominate the industry, with customers returning year after year. As such, it is well-positioned to capture growth from the $400 billion AI chip market projected for 2030. 2. Data Center Expansion: Its data center revenue has surged from $4.3 billion in Q1 2023 to over $35.6 billion in Q4 2024. Maintaining leadership here requires continuous innovation in GPU architecture and energy efficiency as AI workloads grow exponentially. So far, Nvidia has managed to do that. 3. Margin Preservation: One of the biggest arguments against Nvidia is that it may not be able to hold on to its massive margins as competitors catch up and become more attractive to Nvidia’s customers. This has not happened yet, and Nvidia has maintained its hold on the market quite well. In turn, this has allowed the company to have industry-leading gross margins at 73% in Q4 FY2025. Nvidia Stock Price Prediction in 2030: Bull, Bear, &amp; Baseline Will it reach new heights or tumble further? 24/7 Wall St. estimates that Nvidia’s stock price in 2030 will be $491 per share in our bull case, $241 in our base case, and $38 in our bear case. That would represent increases of 192.2% and 43.3%, and a decrease of 77.4%, respectively, from current levels. Each of these estimates comes from a specific scenario analysis of Nvidia’s business segments. The Bull Case for Nvidia’s Share Price Assumptions for our bull case are as follows: AI growth: Nvidia currently holds about 80% of the AI accelerator market. Analysts project this dominance could continue through Blackwell GPU adoption and CUDA’s software moat. This may allow data center revenue to grow at a 25% CAGR to $351 billion by 2030 vs. $115.2 billion in FY2025. Gross margins could remain above 70% due to limited competition in high-end AI training chips. Automotive and robotics: A 50% CAGR in automotive revenue to $25 billion by 2030 is achievable if Level 4 autonomy reaches even 15% to 20% penetration. Software: CUDA is already a big part of Nvidia’s moat, but this could get even better if the AI narrative succeeds in the long run. Nvidia could potentially shift this to a SaaS model once more developers become dependent on it. All things considered, $491 per share is possible, with around $240 billion in net income if all that revenue materializes and margins hold up. Investors will still have to pay a 50x TTM earnings multiple for the stock. The market cap would be $12 trillion. The likelihood of this happening is quite low, given the amount of ground Nvidia would have to cover. The Base Case for Nvidia’s Share Price Assumptions for our base case are as follows: AI growth: Data center revenue can grow at 15% CAGR to $230+ billion by 2030. If Nvidia retains a 60% to 65% market share here, it could reach that goal, especially if competitors keep falling behind. AI narrative success: The AI narrative would still have to succeed for Nvidia to reach our base case price of $241. Otherwise, there would be no growth, and investors would quickly slash the growth premium to a discount. Nvidia’s valuation for the base case would be $8.9 trillion. We strongly recommend reading this share price forecast for a more detailed analysis of our base case. The Bear Case for Nvidia’s Share Price You may have noticed the big gap between the base case and the bear case. This is mostly because the bear case assumes that the AI narrative would fail. If that happens, the result would be catastrophic for Nvidia and its stock. The only reason the shares trade at such a high valuation is that the company is directly linked to AI and its prospects. Without it, it will return to being known as a gaming GPU company with some links to crypto mining. However, that scenario is unlikely. AI demand is not going to disappear overnight. However, what can happen is that AI development could slow down. As a result, Nvidia would slow down too. It needs continuous orders from hyperscalers and AI startups to maintain its momentum and strong margins. If AI slows down and companies are no longer willing to run massive AI models at a loss, they’re also unlikely to upgrade their GPUs to whatever Nvidia has to offer. This would crush Nvidia’s margins and turn revenue growth red, and investors would no longer pay a growth premium for the stock. $38 for such a scenario is reasonable, if not a bit rich, considering that would still leave Nvidia with a $932 billion valuation. Regardless, our baseline remains at $241 for 2030. Is Nvidia a $50 Trillion Stock?

    "text": "Granny Shots seems to be a rather unusual name for an ETF, at least in my view. Undoubtedly, if you&#8217;re not a basketball fan, you probably have no idea what the name of the ETF entails. In basketball, a granny shot is just an underhand free throw. If you tune into any NBA game, you&#8217;ll probably never see it being performed — not because it isn&#8217;t effective, but because it simply does not look &#8220;sexy&#8221; compared to the overhead free throw. But in the world of investing, sexy isn&#8217;t always the answer. So let&#8217;s take a loot at two ETFs that are on opposite ends of that spectrum. --> --> Key Points The Granny Shots ETF could have a better shooting record than the QQQ. Fans of Tom Lee should check out what&#8217;s underneath the hood as they look for greater diversification and potentially less downside risk in an AI bubble burst. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) --> --> What Is the Granny Shots ETF? As the name suggests, you&#8217;ll look like a granny taking a free throw. And while it&#8217;s hard not to giggle when someone throws a granny shot, it is, surprisingly, very effective, if not better than the way just about everyone shoots free throws. NBA legend Rick Barry scored a 89% free-throw rate, thanks in part to his granny shots. These are profoundly impressive stats that I think should convince just about everyone throwing granny shots. Fundstrat&#8217;s head of research, Tom Lee, is a man who&#8217;s looking to follow the granny shot-style in the investment world. Indeed, his Fundstrat Granny Shots US Large Cap ETF (NYSEARCA:GRNY) looks to make the basket at all costs, regardless of how &#8220;unsexy&#8221; a shot (or stock pick) may seem on the surface. If you&#8217;ve tuned into CNBC, you&#8217;ve probably seen Tom Lee as a guest on a couple of occasions. He&#8217;s made several well-timed market calls over the years and his track record of calls, I think, warrants giving his Granny Shots ETF a closer look. Underneath the hood, you&#8217;ll see many intriguing large-cap tech stocks that have done a lot of heavy lifting for the market averages. And while Tom Lee&#8217;s thematic approach to stock selection could give the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 a good run for their money, I do think prospective investors should dig into the holdings first. Let&#8217;s do just that, and I&#8217;ll chime in on whether I think Granny Shots has what it takes to be a slam dunk for investors or if it&#8217;s just better to stick with the tech-heavy, growth-focused Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). Granny Shots US Large Cap ETF has a lot over the QQQ Granny Shots has been a slam dunk for Tom Lee thus far, bringing in more than $2 billion in its first nine months on the market. And while the methodology is intriguing, the ETF needs more than just a few months (or even years) to prove itself as a better bet than something like the QQQ. Indeed, I&#8217;m a big fan of Tom Lee, as are many investors out there who have witnessed the man make the right calls at the right time. But that alone isn&#8217;t enough to justify the 0.75% adjusted expense ratio, which is quite pricier than an indexing solution such as the QQQ. So, what goes in the Granny Shots ETF? First up, I have to remark on how well-diversified the ETF is, especially against the Nasdaq 100, which as you&#8217;re probably aware by now has too much weighting towards NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). With Granny Shots, no company has a weighting of more than 3% of the total portfolio, ensuring a good amount of diversification across the 40 or so hand-picked names. What&#8217;s in the GRNY ETF? Indeed, a big chunk (around 38%) of the portfolio is in tech stocks. Tom Lee, who&#8217;s a massive bull, has had big things to say about the AI revolution, after all. Additionally, there&#8217;s an 18% allocation in financials and industrials, providing far more sector diversification than even the S&amp;P 500. American Express (NYSE:AXP), which fits many themes that Lee and his team look for, is one of the larger holdings at the time of writing, as is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and a number of Magnificent Seven stocks. What you won&#8217;t find, however, is NVIDIA, which I think sets GRNY apart from the Nasdaq 100, especially if an AI bubble bursts. Though there is a lot of tech in the GRNY, it&#8217;s mature tech with modest valuations and limited semiconductor exposure. I expect that would prevent the fund from getting crushed in an AI-led correction. So, in short, I like what I see in GRNY and think it&#8217;s a better bet than the QQQ. Perhaps it&#8217;s better to shoot underhand with the ETF rather than indexing like so many investors are doing these days.

    "text": "One thing income investors have in common is that they&#8217;re on the hunt for steady passive income. One of the easiest ways to achieve this is to invest in dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They are easy to buy and sell, often have low expense ratios and can offer tremendous portfolio diversification. You can give investors access to a basket of stocks while also making dependable monthly or quarterly distributions. With hundreds of ETFs to choose from, you need to be picky — that&#8217;s particularly true if you&#8217;re in income investor. But balance is important, so a combination of the following three ETFs can offer broad-exposure, balanced safety and passive income. I’d recommend holding the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) for safety and loading up on the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI) and the Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM) for dividend income. Top firms manage these ETFs; they carry low expense ratios and offer regular payouts. --> --> Key Points These three ETFs could be your best bets for 2025. JEPI and VYM offer steady income and some diversification within U.S. equities, while VOO provides growth potential and broad exposure to large-cap U.S. stocks. Together, they can contribute to a diversified U.S. equity portfolio. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) --> --> JEPI: Income and Growth Managed by the experts at JPMorgan, JEPI was launched in 2020 and has become a top choice of income investors. It is actively managed and uses a covered call options trading strategy to generate an attractive yield of 8.62%. It holds 126 stocks, which include both top dividend companies and growth firms. No one stock in its portfolio has a weighting higher than 2%, which reduces volatility to some extent. The options strategy allows it to maintain a buffer in case of market downturns, while focusing on the top blue-chip companies ensures stability. With $41.35 billion in assets under management, JEPI is a top choice today. As a bonus, it pays its dividend monthly. From a portfolio construction standpoint, its highest allocation is in the technology sector (14.9%), followed by financials (14%). Some of the top companies in the fund include NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). JEPI is an ideal fund for retirement and could possibly outperform the S&amp;P 500 this year. It has generated cumulative returns of 34.15% in three years. The ETF has a low expense ratio of 0.35% considering that it&#8217;s actively managed. Its NAV is $56.65. While the fund isn’t as diversified as many other ETFs, such as the aforementioned VOO, it does own top-tier businesses and employs a top-tier strategy. Plus, it pays monthly dividends, allowing you to enhance your passive income over the long term. An investment of $10,000 in JEPI in May 2020 would be worth $17,920 today. VYM: An Under-appreciated Dividend Fund The VYM is another ETF that deserves your attention if you&#8217;re an income-oriented investor. One of the top ETFs today, VYM has an expense ratio of only 0.06%. The share price of VYM is up 9.4% year-to-date, 13.3% in 12 months and 66% over five years. It pays quarterly dividends and is a passively managed fund that tracks the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. The fund holds 580 stocks and has a dividend yield of 2.48%. VYM picks companies that have paid above-average dividends for the past 12 months. Its holdings include strong dividend-paying companies like Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). With over 500 stocks in the portfolio, you enjoy ultimate diversification at low risk. No stock has a weightage higher than 7%. The fund has the highest allocation in financials (21.60%), followed by industrials (13.60%) and technology (12.30%). Overall, it offers a strong yield and pairs well with JEPI for steady income and multi-sector diversification. A few holdings may overlap with JEPI, but you’ll get passive income from both the ETFs. VYM is a growth ETF and has delivered 116.27% over 10 years. Driven by its exposure to financials and industrials, I expect the fund to outperform the market in the coming years. VOO: Safety and Stability The VOO tracks the S&amp;P 500 index and offers diversified exposure to the top 500 U.S. companies across different sectors. VOO has an expense ratio of 0.03% and has soared in 2025 as the S&amp;P 500 hit a new all-time high. It is the largest ETF in the world by assets under management. There are several reasons to buy VOO for safety. First, it is a highly diversified fund that holds 504 companies, meaning you have broad exposure which, in turn, can reduce volatility. Second, it invests heavily in technology (34.10%), followed by financials (13.60%) and consumer discretionary (10.40%). The top 10 holdings include the Magnificent Seven, but it also has a few dividend stalwarts. With VOO, you’ll also find giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD).

    "text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) industry continues to evolve, but there are worries about a market correction that could significantly impact AI stocks. Investors are seeking fairly priced stocks that still have the potential to continue growing and AI is no longer limited to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Those who invested in NVDA at the right moment have already made big gains. But if you’re looking for AI stocks to invest now, you need to be picky. Top AI stocks are either priced at a premium or face high expectations, which offer both risk and opportunities. NVIDIA failed to impress Wall Street with its Q2 earnings. Its data center revenue was slightly below consensus, and it reported a modest quarter. While the stock is up 25% in 2025, it is suffering due to elevated expectations. NVIDIA will continue to dominate the AI industry, but there are three other AI stocks worth loading up on. Here are three leveraged to AI that you should consider instead. --> --> Key Points If you&#8217;re looking for AI stocks other than Nvidia, here are the top three stocks soaring higher this year. These stocks are up over 20% in 2025 and have the potential to move upwards. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

Don&#8217;t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) --> --> Oracle Up 36% in 2025, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) stock is exchanging hands for $226. The company has benefited from the increased spending on cloud computing infrastructure and has a partnership with OpenAI. Besides the outsized gains in recent years, Oracle has had an excellent 2025. The company has turned into a complete ecosystem and is no longer restricted to a software database business. It started to build its own cloud services and offers AI powered database services. It also offers software-as-a-service for marketing, automating workflows, financial reporting, and more. A strong player in the cloud business today, Oracle is spending aggressively to capture the market. It reported a revenue of $15.9 billion in its Q4 financial results announced in June. Cloud revenue jumped 27% to $6.7 billion for the quarter, while total revenue for 2025 was up 8% to $57.4 billion. The management is aiming to achieve a 70% revenue growth in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure segment, and it is aiming for the total revenue to increase 16% to $67 billion in FY 2026. Its remaining performance obligations increased 41% to $138 billion. It shows the total value of the company’s unfulfilled contracts at the end of a period. A 41% jump is nothing but impressive. The company is already a part of the massive $500 billion Stargate project. Announced by OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and MGX, Oracle is the funder and technology partner. Stargate AI aims to invest $500 billion towards new data centres and infrastructure over the next four years. There’s a lot of space for the stock to show its strength and soar higher. Broadcom Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) supplies custom AI chips to three of the biggest tech giants- Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and TikTok owner ByteDance. Up 28% year-to-date, the stock is exchanging hands for $297 and has soared 94% in 12 months. The company makes AI and networking chips that ensure efficient and quick movement of data from one server to another. Its fundamentals are strong, and the company has seen a significant improvement in its market cap to $1.36 trillion. In the recent quarter, the AI revenue jumped 46% year-over-year to $4.4 billion, accounting for 30% of the total sales. The company&#8217;s management is aiming to generate $5.1 billion in AI revenue this quarter. Its networking division also benefits from the AI infrastructure demand. As companies continue to set aside billions of dollars for AI, Broadcom’s infrastructure becomes an integral part of their business. The scope of expansion is massive, and Broadcom is making the most of this opportunity. It is sitting at the intersection of custom chips, networking equipment, and integrated systems. While the stock isn’t cheap, it could be worth betting on. The company is set to report results on September 4, and we could see the stock rally. Analysts are bullish on the stock. Oppenheimer analyst has a price target of $325 with an Outperform rating while UBS has a price target of $345 with a Buy rating. AVGO is one of the top tech giants to keep on your radar. CoreWeave A new AI cloud services provider, CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV), has been making news after the expiration of its IPO lockup period. Up 157% in 2025, CoreWeave stock is exchanging hands for $103 and has reported robust quarterly results. The company has a market cap of $47 billion, and it rents out NVIDIA GPU-equipped servers. A fairly new name in the AI space, the stock has impressed investors, and this could be a start to a solid journey. In 2022, the company spent about $100 million to install Nvidia’s H100 GPU’s in its data centers, and then it used those as collateral to secure funding to open more data centres. The strategy impressed tech giant Nvidia, which invested $100 million in the company in 2023 and another $250 million in the IPO this year. This is NVIDIA&#8217;s single biggest investment in the stock and has garnered attention from many. CoreWeave has 33 data centers in the U.S. and Europe, and top customers include Meta, OpenAI and IBM (NYSE: IBM). The growing expenses have led to wide losses, and analysts expect the company to continue reporting net losses this year. In the recent quarter, it posted a loss of 60 cents per share versus $1.62 per share loss reported a year earlier. CoreWeave saw a 206% jump in revenue to $1.21 billion, beating expectations. For the full year, it has raised guidance by $250 million to $5.25 billion. Unlike bigger AI companies, which offer a range of computing and storage services, CoreWeave only focuses on one service- providing cloud-based GPUs for processing AI tasks. It enjoys an early mover advantage, has an impressive client base, and the potential to grow at a rapid rate.

    "text": "The AI industry is expected to reach $4.8 trillion by 2023, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. This means AI companies will continue to benefit from the boom and harness the full power of its technology, thus benefiting shareholders. A few large companies have gained tremendous attention due to their massive spikes in value and soaring stock prices. And despite market volatility and tariffs, their valuations have remained elevated. While a rapid rise and stability cannot be predicted, there are a few companies that have remained top industry players for some time now. If you’re looking to build a portfolio of the best tech stocks, read on to learn more about the AI stocks currently carrying the market. --> --> Key Points These three AI stocks have contributed significantly to the market and have more upside ahead.

Don&#8217;t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) --> --> Palantir Technologies Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) has become the talk of the town in 2025. With a 106% year-to-date gain, the stock is exchanging hands for $154 at the time of writing. However, it is down 18% from its all-time high. The company is in an incredible place to benefit from AI demand and is the best performing stock of the S&amp;P 500 this year. PLTR stock is trading at a premium, and many investors have valuation concerns. But there’s a lot to be excited about. The company reported an impressive second quarter with a 48% year-over-year jump in the top line. It is aggressively expanding in the commercial sector and has seen a 93% jump in the U.S. commercial revenue. It closed 157 deals of at least $1 million and 42 deals of at least $10 million. The U.S. commercial remaining deal value was up 145% year-over-year to $2.79 billion. Driven by the success of its bespoke AI platforms, Palantir is one of the few companies that have demonstrated impressive growth and profitability. It continues to remain a favorite of the federal government and was recently awarded a $10 billion contract with the military. I must mention that Palantir shares have an astronomical valuation. However, it continues to drive the market right now and Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock with a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. NVIDIA Tech giant NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) needs no introduction. The biggest driver of AI growth across the country, NVIDIA has made the most of this thriving market. It has soared to new highs driven by its AI chips and has already delivered double digit gains in 2025. Up 23% year-to-date, the stock is exchanging hands for $170. Once known for setting the gold standard in graphics processing units for the gaming industry, NVIDIA quickly shifted gears and started building GPUs for AI. It is a dominant chip designer, and the numbers are impressive. In the second quarter results, the company reported a revenue of $46.7 billion, up 56% year-over-year, and the data center revenue was $41.1 billion. About 40% of the revenue comes from only two customers. While the company hasn&#8217;t named the customers, it mentioned that one customer represented 23% of the total revenue, while another represented 16% of the revenue. It could be one of the big tech companies heavily relying on Nvidia. For Q3, company management is aiming for revenue of $54 billion. While high concentration on a few customers can present a significant risk, the top tech giants have plenty of cash on hand to spend on AI. As companies increase their AI spending, NVIDIA will continue to benefit. NVIDIA presented at the Goldman Sachs Technology Conference on Sept. 8, and any announcements of new launches could boost the stock. NVIDIA has been carrying the market for a long time now and there’s no other company that can come close to it. It is an irreplaceable company you must add to your portfolio. Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is one stock to buy and hold forever. A major supplier for chip companies like NVIDIA and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), TSMC has also built strong relationships with Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). The company recently reported results and generated over $30 billion in sales for the quarter. There’s growing demand for its 5nm and 3nm chip nodes, which continue to drive sales. It is sitting at the forefront of chip technology and has recently launched the 2nm chip node. This could indicate higher growth for the company as there will be improvements in 2nm which is why companies are willing to adopt this technology. The company has cut ties to Chinese chipmaking tools and secured additional NVIDIA orders, playing a strategic role in the China-U.S. competition. The world’s largest contract chipmaker, TSMC has fast-tracked its U.S. manufacturing footprint. Production has already begun at its Japan lab, and the management has plans for American expansion this year. Fundamentally, TSMC is in a strong position. It saw a 38% jump in revenue and an improved gross margin. The revenue stood at $30.07 billion and the EPS was $2.50, up 61% year over year. Its market share reached 70%, driven by the growing demand for smartphones, AI accelerators and PCs. This was TMSC’s strongest quarter, and it has gained a position that is hard to beat. Tech giants are increasing their investment in AI, and TSMC will benefit from it. The company is well positioned to capitalize on the growing AI investment and could grab a larger market share in the coming years.

    "text": "--> --> Key Points Nebius Group (NBIS) is gaining attention as a potentially undervalued AI stock with significant growth potential, distinct from Nvidia’s chip-focused dominance. The company’s Q2 earnings project an ARR of up to $1.1 billion, signaling a dramatic revenue ramp-up. Its focus on AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters and cloud platforms, positions it as a critical player in the AI revolution. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of ‘Next Nvidia Stocks’ that could be even better. Click here to learn more. --> --> A Rising Star in AI Infrastructure In the fast-evolving artificial intelligence (AI) landscape, Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS) has emerged as a hidden gem, quietly positioning itself as a powerhouse in AI infrastructure. While Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates headlines with its AI chip supremacy, Nebius has been carving out a niche as a provider of full-stack AI solutions, including large-scale GPU clusters, cloud platforms, and developer tools. Once known as the Russian search engine giant Yandex, this Netherlands-based company has undergone a remarkable transformation, with its second-quarter earnings projecting an annualized revenue run rate (ARR) of up to $1.1 billion &#8212; a massive leap from its $117.5 million in 2024. This meteoric growth trajectory has fueled speculation that Nebius was, until recently, the most undervalued AI stock, offering explosive 10x growth potential. Investors who overlooked it may now wonder if they’ve missed a golden opportunity as its stock soars. A Game-Changing Partnership Nebius Group’s trajectory is taking a seismic leap forward after announcing a $17.4 agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) last night. This landmark deal positions Nebius as a key provider of AI infrastructure, specifically high-performance GPU clusters powered by Nvidia’s cutting-edge chips, to support Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform. The agreement is expected to significantly boost Nebius’ data center capacity, enabling it to meet the surging global demand for AI computing power. With Microsoft’s backing, Nebius is poised to become a linchpin in the AI data center market, offering scalable, high-performance solutions that cater to the needs of hyperscalers driving the AI revolution. This partnership not only validates Nebius’ technological prowess but also amplifies its visibility and credibility in a crowded market. Scaling New Heights with Hyperscaler Potential Adding to its momentum, Nebius is a key partner of Nvidia, building its AI cloud infrastructure using Nvidia’s advanced GPUs. This symbiotic relationship enhances Nebius’ standing, as it now has the support of two industry titans &#8212; Microsoft and Nvidia. By leveraging Nvidia’s GPUs within its cloud platforms and developer tools, Nebius creates a robust ecosystem that appeals to enterprises scaling their AI operations. This dual backing from major players not only strengthens Nebius’ business model but also positions it to capture a significant share of the AI infrastructure market, projected to grow exponentially as AI adoption accelerates across industries. The Microsoft deal is likely just the beginning. Nebius’ ability to deliver large-scale, GPU-driven infrastructure makes it an attractive partner for other hyperscalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet&#8216;s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). As these tech giants race to expand their AI capabilities, Nebius’ full-stack solutions could become a go-to choice, further driving its revenue and market presence. The company’s nearly $2.5 billion cash pile provides the financial flexibility to invest in capacity expansion, ensuring it can meet growing demand. This strategically positions Nebius on the cusp of becoming a cornerstone of the AI ecosystem. Key Takeaways With Nebius’ stock soaring 55% in premarket trading this morning &#8212; now at $99 per share &#8212; investors face a critical question: is it too late to jump in, or does the stock still offer value? The Microsoft deal and Nebius’ role as a supplier to Nvidia signal strong growth potential, with analysts projecting continued revenue expansion as more hyperscalers sign on. However, at $99, the stock’s valuation is less of a bargain than it was months ago. While the long-term outlook remains bullish &#8212; driven by its infrastructure expertise and hyperscaler partnerships &#8212; short-term volatility could offer a better entry point. Investors may benefit from waiting for a pullback to maximize returns, but those with a long-term horizon could still find Nebius a compelling buy given its trajectory.
