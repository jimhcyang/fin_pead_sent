AI spending as a percentage of GDP passed the telecom buildout in the late 1990s, but is still below prior trends like the GDP impact of the construction of railroads in the 1800s. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of ‘Next Nvidia Stocks’ that could be even better. Click here to learn more. Watch Our Segment on How AI Is Now the #1 Driver of the American Economy Here are two charts that will blow your mind. First, a look at GDP contibution from data centers (in green) versus personal spending (in blue): AI SPENDING IS EATING THE US ECONOMYPer @RenMacLLC’s Dutta:“So far this year, AI capex, which we define as information processing equipment plus software has added more to GDP growth than consumers’ spending”https://t.co/jCHmYVWWiW pic.twitter.com/ewNWu1Rvo0 — Luke Kawa (@LJKawa) July 30, 2025 As you can see, in the most recent quarters, spending on AI data centers is now driving around 1% GDP growth, which is higher than consumer spending. That&#8217;s an incredible stat. America&#8217;s economy has long been driven by consumer spending &#8211; which at times drives more than 2% of all GDP growth. And here&#8217;s another stat that should astound: This is insane. AI capex might account for a larger share of GDP than basically any technology since the railroad. Basically it’s a mini-wartime economy, but the guns are chips and the tanks are databases pic.twitter.com/E11IxmYtOv — Derek Thompson (@DKThomp) August 1, 2025 AI spending is now bigger than the telecom boom in 2000. With data center spending rising above 1% of GDP, that&#8217;s a massive figure. However, its still a fraction the peak economic activity of the railroad buildout in the 1800s which eventually contributed 6% of overall economic activity. In the video above, AI Investor Podcast Host Austin Smith and analyst Eric Bleeker look at the historic figures of AI spending and discuss how AI has overtaken consumer spending as the top driver of America&#8217;s economy.

Transcript Eric Bleeker: But Austin, what I&#8217;m seeing in earnings season, the biggest, as we&#8217;ve said before, what is the strongest force in the known universe? Austin Smith: Well, typically it&#8217;s the American consumer, but I think there&#8217;s another major economic predator out there on the horizon right now. Eric Bleeker: Yes, another economic predator is brewing. But yes, the American consumer—we will buy anything that&#8217;s released. If you go into Five Below or any store, it&#8217;s a testament to what the American consumer can do. We will spend into any debt possible. We will take any means to keep buying whatever the world will pump out. It is rather amazing that we had GDP released this week showing 3% growth, largely driven by the tariff situation with fewer imports into the country. However, what we saw was AI spending actually eclipsing the American consumer. In the latest two quarters, AI spending is now generating about 1% of GDP growth, while consumer spending is at 0.65%. We are seeing that in earning season. This is what we&#8217;re going to talk about today. Some of the results from this earning season show a real inflection point we&#8217;ve been discussing in recent episodes. Now we&#8217;re seeing it in the numbers. There’s good and some bad, but we are definitively seeing an inflection point. So let&#8217;s get started with talking about earnings because we are really in the teeth of earning season.The post AI Spending is Now the #1 Driver of America&#8217;s Economy appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/08/12/ai-spending-is-now-the-1-driver-of-americas-economy/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/ai-spending-is-now-the-1-driver-of-americas-20250814.jpg

Analysts at Oppenheimer reiterated an outperform rating on Walmart, with a price target of $115 from $110. “Following a more difficult backdrop to start the year due to unexpected tariff and expense headwinds, we believe a positive guidance revision cycle could again materialize soon,” said the firm, as also quoted by CNBC. The Nasdaq is pushing even higher. Last trading at 23,995 in premarket, it could easily test 25,000 over the next few days. Helping, inflation data was tamer than expected, cooling investor fears that tariffs are not having a substantial impact on prices. With the latest data, investors are also pricing in a 90% chance of an interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s September meeting. The producer price index (PPI) report on wholesale inflation will be out at 8:30 am EST. Piper Sandler just raised its price target on Nvidia ahead of earnings Piper Sandler just raised its price target on Nvidia ahead of earnings, calling for the stock to hit $225 a share. The firm also has an overweight rating on the tech giant. “We are expecting another positive quarter from NVDA and see upside to numbers for both the July and October quarters,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. “While we are modeling largely in-line for the July quarter and slightly below Street for October, we are calling for upside given the recent positive commentary from U.S. hyper scalers as well as the inclusion of revenues from China,” added the firm. Nvidia will release its quarterly numbers on August 27. Analysts are looking for EPS of $1 on revenue of $45.76 billion. CoreWeave dropped on better-than-expected revenue CoreWeave just posted better-than-expected revenue of $1.21 billion, which was ahead of estimates of $1.08 billion. Unfortunately, its EPS loss of 60 cents was greater than expectations for a loss of 23 cents, as noted by Barron’s. “Our strong second-quarter performance demonstrates continued momentum across every dimension of our business,” CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said in its press release. “We are scaling rapidly as we look to meet the unprecedented demand for AI.” Moving forward, the company expects for current quarter revenue to range from $1.26 billion to $1.3 billion, which is ahead of estimates of $1.25 billion. For the full year, the company expects for revenue to range from $ 5.15 billion to $5.35 billion, which is above expectations for $5.05 billion revenue. Stock Upgrade: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Ahead of earnings on August 18, PANW saw two upgrades. Both Piper Sandler and Deutsche Bank upgraded their ratings for PANW to a buy rating. Piper Sandler raised its price target to $225 from $200. Deutsche Bank raised its target to $220 from $200. After tacking on $7.23 just yesterday, PANW is up another $3 in premarket. Plus, according to Wedbush analysts, PANW’s recent $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk could reshape the cybersecurity market. &#8220;We view this move as a strategic home run deal by PANW to strengthen its platformization strategy with PANW on the acquisition hunt further to build an all-in-one shop for all cyber solutions to battle the rising threats from AI while injecting this technology into its broader portfolio,&#8221; said Wedbush analysts, as quoted by Seeking Alpha. &#8220;This represents a key strategic poker move by the cyber stalwart with the expanding competitive landscape within cyber as PANW brings on the most dominant player within the Privileged Access Management space.&#8221; The post Nasdaq Composite Live: Index Heading to Higher Highs appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/08/13/nasdaq-composite-live-index-heading-to-higher-highs/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/nasdaq-composite-live-index-heading-to-higher-highs-20250814.jpg

Morgan Stanley Just Reiterated an Overweight Rating on Apple 8:32 am This morning, Morgan Stanley reiterated an outperform rating on Apple, noting that the tech giant appears to be “turning a corner.” “We are turning more bullish – forward iPhone unit/revenue growth expectations are still relatively muted, many of the same factors that got us bullish last July remain, we’re past peak tariff risk&#8230;,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. The firm also reiterated an outperform rating on Nvidia. “The chips and their system design should be finalized next March, with the chip entering mass production in 2Q26, followed by server racks ramp in 3Q26. So it appears there will be no delay to the Rubin schedule, despite some investor concerns,” they added. After dropping on news that the producer price index (PPI) was hotter than expected, the Nasdaq is fighting to go green earlier this morning. Helping, Intel is gaining momentum following a Bloomberg report that the Trump Administration is in talks to have the U.S. take a stake in the stock. “Such a move would mark another intervention by U.S. President Donald Trump in industries seen as vital to national security,” as noted by Reuters, adding, “Intel declined to comment on the report but said it was deeply committed to supporting Trump&#8217;s efforts to strengthen U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.” Apple Just Had its Best Week since 2020 Now up to $232.78, we’d like to see Apple rally to $250 next. Analysts at BTIG have reiterated a buy rating on the stock with a $198 price target. This was after Apple announced it would reintroduce its Blood Oxygen feature for certain Apple Watch models. As noted by Investing.com, “The original Blood Oxygen feature was disabled following an International Trade Commission ruling that took effect in late 2023. In January 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection permitted Apple to sell its Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 with a software workaround that excluded the pulse oximeter function.” Apple is also releasing other new and updated AI-powered devices, including robots, a smart speaker with display and security cameras, and an updated &#8220;lifelike&#8221; Siri capable of communicating with several users at once, as noted by Bloomberg. July Retail Sales Data is on Deck Later this morning, markets will get a look at retail sales and consumer sentiment. At the moment, Wall Street is looking for 0.5% as compared to 0.6% for the prior month. Stay tuned for more updates.

At the moment, the Nasdaq is down about 45 points. The Dow is down about 19, with the S&amp;P 500 down about eight points. The Federal Reserve will remain in focus this week, as central bank members meet in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for their annual symposium. Investors will be listening for any clues about the future path of interest rates. As noted by Yahoo Finance, “Ahead of Powell&#8217;s speech — likely to be his last as Fed chair — markets are placing the probability the Fed will cut rates by at least 0.25% next month at around 85%. Clues from Powell about the speed and depth of the cycle the Fed is about to embark on will be the week&#8217;s biggest market-moving event.” Aside from the central bank, investors are waiting on earnings from Home Depot, Lowe’s, Target, and Walmart. All are under the microscope, with concerns about the strength of the U.S. consumer mounting. Helping, analysts at Evercore ISI just added Target to its tactical outperform list, noting that Target earnings could be better than expected. “So, in our view, a relief rally could result, especially if trends into 2H show any BTS (back to school) improvement, with potential mgmt change and stimulus proving hope into 2026. In recent days, much has been made of the Target / Ulta partnership ending, yet we believe Target is hunting for new partners and/or opportunities to scale, for example, with Warby Parker,” as quoted by CNBC. Stock Upgrades: RBC Capital Just Upgraded Sunrun RBC Capital analysts just upgraded Sunrun to an outperform rating with a price target of $16 from $12. As a catalyst, the firm pointed to guidance from the Treasury Department on how renewable projects might qualify for tax credits. “While the act terminates investment and production tax credits for solar and wind projects after 2027, projects that start construction within 12 months of the passage of the act can still claim credits beyond this deadline,” according to CNBC. Bank of America reiterated a buy rating on Apple, noting, “Services has been, and we expect will continue to be, the leading driver of y/y gross profit dollar growth. Reiterate Buy on stable cash flows, earnings resiliency, and strong capital return program.” Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating on Nvidia, giving it a $206 price target. The firm noted, “While the near-term bar is higher now, the 12-month picture across demand, supply, and competitive outlook all continue to be very favorable.” The post Nasdaq Composite Live: All Eyes are on Jackson Hole Symposium appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/08/18/nasdaq-composite-live-all-eyes-are-on-jackson-hole-symposium/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/nasdaq-composite-live-all-eyes-are-on-jackson-hole-20250818.jpg

One of these is Jensen Huang, the leader of dominant AI chip maker Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA). The other is Sam Altman, leader of AI company OpenAI. Altman recently said the industry is in a high-risk bubble. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points OpenAI’s Sam Altman warns of an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble. Big tech stocks like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) could collapse if Altman is correct. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Altman told a group of journalists recently that AI has formed a dangerous bubble. “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth.” He added that AI has a remarkable future, but investors have gotten ahead of themselves. Although Altman did not say so exactly, it appears he is referring to the dot-com bubble of 1999 to 2002, according to CNBC. The Nasdaq dropped 80% over the period, and some of the most prominent companies in the industry went under. Dr. Torsten Sløk, the chief economist of Apollo Academy, wrote last month that “The difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&amp;P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s.” The Apollo Academy is part of the global private equity leader Apollo Global Management. What This Means for the Magnificent 7 If Altman and Sløk are right, the stocks of some of America’s largest companies could face a significant sell-off. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported that they will invest tens of billions of dollars in AI server farms this year. This could be the most significant capital expenditure level in history. The earnings of the large companies rely heavily on the success of their AI initiatives. That, in turn, translates into the value of their stocks. What is the best way to look at a potential sell-off of the world&#8217;s most valuable companies based on market cap? One way is to look at their stock prices before the AI investment frenzy. In August 2023, Microsoft traded at $311. Today, it trades at $520, which is a gain of 67%. Meta traded at $274 in the same month. Today, it trades at $785. Meta’s stock is on its way to tripling over the same period. Granted, Meta and Microsoft have posted good earnings in the past two years, but that cannot, in and of itself, explain the jump in their share prices. If Altman is correct, the collapse of these stocks could be tremendous.

AI Is The Only Thing That Matters","Key Points The rapid adoption of AI is expected to eliminate a wide range of high-earning professional roles, including software engineers, Wall Street analysts, and legal researchers, creating economic disruption that may affect sectors dependent on white-collar employment. Nvidia&#8217;s (NASDAQ: NVDA) AI leadership and vision of voice-driven programming underscore the accelerating pace of AI automation, potentially diminishing traditional technical skills as competitive advantages. Utility and energy companies stand to benefit significantly from the AI boom, with anticipated surges in electricity demand prompting renewed interest in solar, wind, nuclear, and even coal energy investments.

[00:00:11] Doug McIntyre: What we&#8217;re talking about right now will probably in affect the stock market more than anything other than a war. Everything else that we look at day in and day out is not important based on what we&#8217;re talking about right now. Right, right. So my son had a person who wrote for him, who was a software coder last year. [00:00:35] Doug McIntyre: That guy doesn&#8217;t have a job right now because using ai, my son, who&#8217;s a portfolio manager, is not a software engineer, is able to do all of that guy&#8217;s work in half the time. I bet he can code in Python. Okay. Yeah. A primary language. He does not know how to use Python. Jensen Wong, our friend at Nvidia, gave a speech at UCLA. [00:01:03] Doug McIntyre: About seven, eight months ago to the graduating class PhDs in computer sciences. He said, my goal is that every human being in the world who can speak into a computer will be able to do the level of coding you can by simply using their voice in the concept of what they want the software to do. [00:01:25] Lee Jackson: That&#8217;s exactly what my son is doing right now. [00:01:28] Doug McIntyre: Alright. So if Jensen Wong is right. There are gonna be a whole category of high earning people who are not gonna have jobs. They&#8217;re not, there&#8217;s no place for those people to go. There are gonna be people in the legal industry, the people who write appellate briefs. Those people will not be needing, you do not need a human to write and appellate brief once you&#8217;ve got AI and it has access to all the law, books and history. [00:01:54] Lee Jackson: Yeah, and, also what, about Wall Street analysts? [00:01:58] Doug McIntyre: Wall Street analysts gone. We&#8217;ll be gone. I don&#8217;t care. I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re the top auto analyst rated by institutional investor in the country or the world. Right. You are out of a job period. Probably. [00:02:11] Lee Jackson: Not only are you out a job, unless you can run the AI that will scan all the corporate documents won&#8217;t need it. [00:02:18] Lee Jackson: Won&#8217;t need it. [00:02:18] Doug McIntyre: I know, I know. That&#8217;s my point. You won&#8217;t need it. I mean, there&#8217;s a company called My Logic IQ, which is basically AI search of the SEC. All the documents that, that, that work is gone. The people who do that are already out of business. [00:02:32] Lee Jackson: Yeah. It&#8217;s absolutely history. So, [00:02:34] Doug McIntyre: so we have the people who aren&#8217;t gonna have jobs, and then we have the people coming out of college who thought that they knew what that $90,000 job was for them. [00:02:45] Doug McIntyre: When they were a junior, they said, oh, I will have a job, working, at Toll Brothers as an analyst of how many houses you can fit inside a, subdivision. Not gonna happen. Wall Street Journal ran an article yesterday which said that people are coming out thinking they would have a job outta college. [00:03:08] Doug McIntyre: And what it says is basically those people are all on their way to Chipotle. And that&#8217;s not to eat. That&#8217;s not to eat, it&#8217;s to work. So if, you&#8217;re looking at your portfolio and you should be right, everybody within the Sound of voice consider the effect of AI. [00:03:24] Lee Jackson: Not today, but tomorrow, five years from now, whatever your investment timeline is a absolutely right. [00:03:32] Doug McIntyre: and people say, well, there&#8217;ll be guardrails on AI. The answer to that is no, it will not. This is a war. Among the big tech companies over who gets the lead. It&#8217;s like the big oil guys were, when they were polluting the world, none of them were gonna say, ah, I&#8217;ll stop doing that. And everybody else runs &#8217;em over in the industry and they end up being roadkill. [00:03:56] Doug McIntyre: There, there will be no guardrails on AI. The government it can&#8217;t be mandated. The AI will just say, the AI app will say, well, what are you gonna do? Put me in prison? Yeah. [00:04:07] Lee Jackson: Yeah. Well, I think in conclusion, we can tell our viewers and those that also read 24/7 Wall Street, that they said the same thing when the car came out. [00:04:17] Lee Jackson: it&#8217;s not gonna catch on, not this, not that. Well, in about 10 years, the buggy industry. Was gone. It was gone. from, because they went from horse and buggy in the early 19 hundreds to cars everywhere by 1920. That was just 20 years. And there, there was so many, there were so many industries that were just left in its wake that, but again, this is where people can be somewhat encouraging is that look at all the jobs that the car companies created. [00:04:52] Lee Jackson: So there&#8217;s a likelihood that could happen as well, but probably not on that scale. [00:04:58] Doug McIntyre: Well, before we leave this topic, if you&#8217;re an interested in utilities, Eric Schmidt, who used to be the chairman of, of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) before it was Alphabet, I think, two months ago, said that 99% of all the electricity produced in the world will go towards AI server farms and training. [00:05:18] Doug McIntyre: Now it&#8217;s that number&#8217;s impossible. But he did say it and he is, a genius. But his point I think is that the competition for electricity is going to be unreal. Yeah. So if you look at utility companies, and even though I know solar and wind are out of favor right now, you&#8217;ve got to get them online. [00:05:45] Doug McIntyre: You&#8217;ve got, you don&#8217;t have any choice. I don&#8217;t care. [00:05:48] Lee Jackson: They&#8217;re gonna have to, they&#8217;re gonna have the president. We&#8217;re gonna have to build these small nuclears quick too. When we come back, for, our next session, we&#8217;ll have a complete list of electric, utilities. That will be benefactors of this. [00:06:01] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. So we&#8217;ll do that. But I, that&#8217;s another thing to look at is look at the energy industry. Very strong. There&#8217;ll be very few losers. Yep. I agree. There&#8217;ll be very few losers in energy. You may say, well, Solar&#8217;s not doing well because of the president and wind isn&#8217;t. Guess what? The arms race for AI is gonna be so aggressive that any coal will be a coal comeback. [00:06:27] Doug McIntyre: I don&#8217;t know if buy coal, futures. I agree. There&#8217;ll be the equivalent of a gold rush to California. When it comes to energy stuff.. One thing you wanna look at is any energy stock that you can invest in.

Les tests manuels sur le Web sont de plus en plus fragmentés. Les équipes d'assurance qualité jonglent avec une demi-douzaine d'extensions et d'applications, passent d'un onglet à l'autre, se connectent à plusieurs comptes et passent des heures chaque semaine à configurer et à changer d'environnement. Beaucoup passent à côté de tous les outils qui pourraient améliorer la couverture, en particulier pour des contrôles tels que l'accessibilité et la conception de sites Web réactifs. Testing Toolkit met de l'ordre dans ce chaos. Cette extension permet d'accéder en un seul clic à un ensemble complet de fonctionnalités couvrant l'intégralité du cycle de vie des tests manuels : configuration, exécution et signalement des bogues. « Testing Toolkit est né d'un constat simple : les flux de travail en matière de tests Web manuels étaient devenus très fragmentés », a déclaré Nakul Aggarwal, cofondateur et directeur technique de BrowserStack. « Avec ce lancement, nous offrons aux testeurs et aux développeurs un moyen puissant et léger de rationaliser leurs tâches quotidiennes. Pas d'encombrement. Juste le meilleur des tests. » « Le meilleur plug-in ou la meilleure extension pour les tests Web manuels. Les tests manuels sont à présent beaucoup plus rapides. Je l'ai déjà recommandé à tous mes collègues, testeurs et développeurs de l'entreprise », a déclaré Ayush Agarwal, développeur de logiciels chez Webninjaz, l'un des premiers à l'avoir adopté. Testing Toolkit est déjà conquis plus de 3 000 utilisateurs et est maintenant disponible sur le Chrome Web Store, permettant aux équipes de récupérer les heures de productivité perdues. À propos de BrowserStack BrowserStack est la première plateforme mondiale de test de logiciels alimentée par l'IA, conçue pour permettre aux développeurs et aux équipes chargées de l'assurance de la qualité de fournir rapidement des logiciels de qualité. Plus de 50 000 équipes, comme celles d'Amazon, de Microsoft et de NVIDIA, font confiance à BrowserStack pour effectuer plus de trois millions de tests chaque jour dans 21 centres de données mondiaux. La plateforme offre aux équipes un accès instantané à plus de 30 000 appareils et navigateurs réels.Fondée en 2011, BrowserStack est une société privée soutenue par Accel, Bond et Insight Partners.

Last checked, there’s now a 75% chance of a quarter-point cut by September. “I think the Fed and what Powell is going to try to articulate and communicate is an explanation and a justification for the Fed to start a process of cutting interest rates starting in September,” Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s Jim Caron told CNBC. “And I think that should be supportive for markets.” Shares of Cracker Barrel Just Lost $200 Million of Value Shares of Cracker Barrel lost about $200 million of their value after releasing its new logo, which eliminates the drawing of an overalls-clad man leaning against a barrel. Now, the logo will just feature the chain’s name, which isn’t sitting well with diners or investors. Plus, according to the company’s site, “This year we even unveiled a brand-new logo! Rather than just showing one person, we wanted to feature lots of people. The idea was to celebrate the diversity of all our guests with a logo that represented our continued passion for pleasing people of all races, colors, and genders.” For some investors, the change is a “Bud Light” moment with heavy backlash. Still, keep an eye on the Cracker Barrel (CBRL) stock. Once the pullback over a brand logo change is over, we do expect it to regain lost ground – especially if earnings can remain as strong as they have been.

It’s now 10 pm. That party goes to 4 am,” as quoted by CNBC. With that, Ives still believes tech heavyweights, such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta, will be some of the top standout winners.

(NYSE: SNOW) slipped 0.68% over the past month following a surge of 6.56% the month prior. Since hitting its year-to-date low on April 4, the stock is up more nearly 63%, bringing its year-to-date gain to 34.75%. When the company reported Q1 earnings on May 21 after the close, it announced a beat on EPS with revenue meeting expectations. Revenue guidance for June came in above expectations as well. But the big takeaway was that quarterly revenue topped $1 billion for the first time, coming in at $1.04 billion. The company plans to report Q2 earnings on Aug. 21. In late June, Morgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh assumed coverage of Snowflake with an overweight rating and a bullish $262 price target. Singh cites how SNOW — under the leadership of new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy — has become a &#8220;better executing and faster innovating company.&#8221; The firm sees AI &#8220;creating a long growth runway&#8221; in Snowflake&#8217;s core business while market expansion into data engineering and AI provide the path to 20% growth annually through 2030. Big Data is big business, and the companies that provide cloud storage solutions are at the forefront of an explosive industry. Snowflake is the quintessential example. Despite having to face cloud-based data warehousing competitors such as Google BigQuery, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), or Redshift, a business division of Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the $602.31 billion industry&#8217;s projected growth. According to Grand View Research, the global cloud computing market size is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.2% between 2024 and 2030, with the U.S. cloud computing market forecast to grow at a slightly lower — but still considerable — CAGR of 20.3% over the same time frame. In addition to its data management services, Snowflake provides clients with customized infrastructure solutions, a pay-as-you-go pricing model, scalability, low to no latency as well as analytics capabilities. In doing so, the Bozeman, Mont.-based company has amassed a $71.10 billion market cap. However, its stock has struggled since 2021 when it hit its all-time high of $392.15 per share, falling 45.51% since. With the industry ripe for expansion, 24/7 Wall Street has performed an analysis that suggests there is considerable upside potential for the tech company. Here is where prospective investors and current shareholders might expect the stock to be over the course of the next five years. Key Points Snowflake&#8217;s strong earnings record suggests the ability to continue to produce positive earnings while growing alongside the cloud data storage industry. Since the first quarter of 2021, the company has beat on earnings per share (EPS) in 15 out of 16 quarters. Snowflake has been experiencing explosive revenue growth that reflects the industry in which it operates. After posting total revenue of $264.75 million in 2020, the company saw revenue grow to $592.05 million in 2021, $1.22 billion in 2022, $2.07 billion in 2023, $2.81 billion in fiscal year 2024 — good for an enormous 961.38% increase between 2020 and 2024.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Snowflake&#8217;s Recent Stock Performance Shares of SNOW could be considered undervalued given the combination of its recent stock performance, its significantly growing revenue figures, and the overall industry&#8217;s projected CAGR through 2030. Snowflake&#8217;s stock surged after its IPO on Sept. 15, 2020. However, as previously mentioned, it has struggled since hitting its all-time high in November 2021. Year Share Price Revenue* Net Income* 2020 $281.40 $0.264 -$0.348 2021 $338.75 $0.592 -$0.539 2022 $143.54 $1.22 -$0.679 2023 $199.00 $2.07 -$0.796 2024 $195.64 $2.81 -$0.836 *Revenue and net income in $billions Despite the 45.51% drop from its all-time high, the stock has performed better than usual in the last two quarters of 2024. Despite a negative price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of -50.8, its total assets of $8.22 billion already outweigh its total liabilities of $3.03 billion while its free cash flow has grown from -$199.41 million in 2020 to $784.29 million in 2024, good for a jaw-dropping 493.31% increase. These metrics suggest that the company&#8217;s underlying fundamentals are strong and could set the table for a turnaround in share performance in the near future. Key Drivers of Snowflake&#8217;s Stock Performance 1. Collaboration With NVIDIA: Snowflake recently announced a partnership with NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA). Snowflake has implemented NVIDIA&#8217;s AI Enterprise software, which will allow it to help customers build customized AI data applications. This will allow the company to enjoy a twofold growing industry demand between its existing offerings for cloud-based data storage as well as a vast array of AI applications meeting the needs of its tech clientele. 2. A Loyal Customer Base: According to Yahoo! Finance, Snowflake is delivering solid growth while experiencing exceptional customer loyalty evidenced by revenue retention of 127%. Those customers run the games from mega-cap companies like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and small-cap companies like Petco Health and Wellness Company Inc. (NASDAQ: WOOF) to privately held yet popular enterprises such as Orangetheory Fitness and public entities such as the City of San Francisco and the Florida State University. 3. An Industry Primed for Growth: As previously discussed, the CAGR for the U.S. cloud computing market, which stood at $602.31 in 2023, is 20.3%. Grand View Research cites the rise of hybrid and milt-cloud solutions in driving the industry, as well as increased cloud adoption among both private and public (government) enterprises, both in the developed and developing world. Coupled with the rise of AI and machine learning, companies like Snowflake are uniquely positioned to serve as so-called hyper-scalers allowing them to use their flexibility to diversify service offerings that cater to the specific needs of a growing clientele that spans a broad range of industries and sectors.

(NASDAQ: NVDA) investors. In April, shares hit a year-to-date low below $87 apiece. Like its fellow Magnificent 7 members, Nvidia struggled due to economic uncertainties about the effects of tariffs, as well as due to Chinese AI innovations. Bears saw Nvidia stock falling further because of bearish pressure from the broader market. Yet, some investors remain optimistic for a sustained rebound, and that seems to have been the case. The stock returned to all-time highs as some tariff fears dissipated and macro data improved. --> --> 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock continues to recover from the year-to-date low. With the AI darling now trading near an all-time high, many are wondering where the stock could go next. This analysis looks at three scenarios and where Nvidia stock could be in 2030. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of “Next Nvidia Stocks” that could be even better. Click here to learn more. --> --> The bearish argument that prevailed on Wall Street early this year is not entirely gone, though. While the AI rally may continue, it remains speculative, whereas the reasons for Nvidia stock’s decline in the spring were genuine. Nvidia may still be at a crossroads right now. We do not know for sure where the stock will go next, but with the data on hand, we can speculate. That’s what we are doing here. Three Key Drivers of Nvidia Performance Through 2030 Will Nvidia continue to lead in AI? 1. AI Infrastructure Dominance: Nvidia controls an estimated 80% of the AI accelerator market through its H100/H200 GPUs and CUDA software ecosystem. It is tough for Nvidia customers to switch to another supplier. This has allowed the company to dominate the industry, with customers returning year after year. As such, it is well-positioned to capture growth from the $400 billion AI chip market projected for 2030. 2. Data Center Expansion: Its data center revenue has surged from $4.3 billion in Q1 2023 to over $35.6 billion in Q4 2024. Maintaining leadership here requires continuous innovation in GPU architecture and energy efficiency as AI workloads grow exponentially. So far, Nvidia has managed to do that. 3. Margin Preservation: One of the biggest arguments against Nvidia is that it may not be able to hold on to its massive margins as competitors catch up and become more attractive to Nvidia’s customers. This has not happened yet, and Nvidia has maintained its hold on the market quite well. In turn, this has allowed the company to have industry-leading gross margins at 73% in Q4 FY2025. Nvidia Stock Price Prediction in 2030: Bull, Bear, &amp; Baseline Will it reach new heights or tumble further? 24/7 Wall St. estimates that Nvidia’s stock price in 2030 will be $491 per share in our bull case, $241 in our base case, and $38 in our bear case. That would represent increases of 192.2% and 43.3%, and a decrease of 77.4%, respectively, from current levels. Each of these estimates comes from a specific scenario analysis of Nvidia’s business segments. The Bull Case for Nvidia’s Share Price Assumptions for our bull case are as follows: AI growth: Nvidia currently holds about 80% of the AI accelerator market. Analysts project this dominance could continue through Blackwell GPU adoption and CUDA’s software moat. This may allow data center revenue to grow at a 25% CAGR to $351 billion by 2030 vs. $115.2 billion in FY2025. Gross margins could remain above 70% due to limited competition in high-end AI training chips. Automotive and robotics: A 50% CAGR in automotive revenue to $25 billion by 2030 is achievable if Level 4 autonomy reaches even 15% to 20% penetration. Software: CUDA is already a big part of Nvidia’s moat, but this could get even better if the AI narrative succeeds in the long run. Nvidia could potentially shift this to a SaaS model once more developers become dependent on it. All things considered, $491 per share is possible, with around $240 billion in net income if all that revenue materializes and margins hold up. Investors will still have to pay a 50x TTM earnings multiple for the stock. The market cap would be $12 trillion. The likelihood of this happening is quite low, given the amount of ground Nvidia would have to cover. The Base Case for Nvidia’s Share Price Assumptions for our base case are as follows: AI growth: Data center revenue can grow at 15% CAGR to $230+ billion by 2030. If Nvidia retains a 60% to 65% market share here, it could reach that goal, especially if competitors keep falling behind. AI narrative success: The AI narrative would still have to succeed for Nvidia to reach our base case price of $241. Otherwise, there would be no growth, and investors would quickly slash the growth premium to a discount. Nvidia’s valuation for the base case would be $8.9 trillion. We strongly recommend reading this share price forecast for a more detailed analysis of our base case. The Bear Case for Nvidia’s Share Price You may have noticed the big gap between the base case and the bear case. This is mostly because the bear case assumes that the AI narrative would fail. If that happens, the result would be catastrophic for Nvidia and its stock. The only reason the shares trade at such a high valuation is that the company is directly linked to AI and its prospects. Without it, it will return to being known as a gaming GPU company with some links to crypto mining. However, that scenario is unlikely. AI demand is not going to disappear overnight. However, what can happen is that AI development could slow down. As a result, Nvidia would slow down too. It needs continuous orders from hyperscalers and AI startups to maintain its momentum and strong margins. If AI slows down and companies are no longer willing to run massive AI models at a loss, they’re also unlikely to upgrade their GPUs to whatever Nvidia has to offer. This would crush Nvidia’s margins and turn revenue growth red, and investors would no longer pay a growth premium for the stock. $38 for such a scenario is reasonable, if not a bit rich, considering that would still leave Nvidia with a $932 billion valuation. Regardless, our baseline remains at $241 for 2030. Is Nvidia a $50 Trillion Stock?

Undoubtedly, if you&#8217;re not a basketball fan, you probably have no idea what the name of the ETF entails. In basketball, a granny shot is just an underhand free throw. If you tune into any NBA game, you&#8217;ll probably never see it being performed — not because it isn&#8217;t effective, but because it simply does not look &#8220;sexy&#8221; compared to the overhead free throw. But in the world of investing, sexy isn&#8217;t always the answer. So let&#8217;s take a loot at two ETFs that are on opposite ends of that spectrum. --> --> Key Points The Granny Shots ETF could have a better shooting record than the QQQ. Fans of Tom Lee should check out what&#8217;s underneath the hood as they look for greater diversification and potentially less downside risk in an AI bubble burst.

Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) --> --> What Is the Granny Shots ETF? As the name suggests, you&#8217;ll look like a granny taking a free throw. And while it&#8217;s hard not to giggle when someone throws a granny shot, it is, surprisingly, very effective, if not better than the way just about everyone shoots free throws. NBA legend Rick Barry scored a 89% free-throw rate, thanks in part to his granny shots. These are profoundly impressive stats that I think should convince just about everyone throwing granny shots. Fundstrat&#8217;s head of research, Tom Lee, is a man who&#8217;s looking to follow the granny shot-style in the investment world. Indeed, his Fundstrat Granny Shots US Large Cap ETF (NYSEARCA:GRNY) looks to make the basket at all costs, regardless of how &#8220;unsexy&#8221; a shot (or stock pick) may seem on the surface. If you&#8217;ve tuned into CNBC, you&#8217;ve probably seen Tom Lee as a guest on a couple of occasions. He&#8217;s made several well-timed market calls over the years and his track record of calls, I think, warrants giving his Granny Shots ETF a closer look. Underneath the hood, you&#8217;ll see many intriguing large-cap tech stocks that have done a lot of heavy lifting for the market averages. And while Tom Lee&#8217;s thematic approach to stock selection could give the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 a good run for their money, I do think prospective investors should dig into the holdings first. Let&#8217;s do just that, and I&#8217;ll chime in on whether I think Granny Shots has what it takes to be a slam dunk for investors or if it&#8217;s just better to stick with the tech-heavy, growth-focused Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ). Granny Shots US Large Cap ETF has a lot over the QQQ Granny Shots has been a slam dunk for Tom Lee thus far, bringing in more than $2 billion in its first nine months on the market. And while the methodology is intriguing, the ETF needs more than just a few months (or even years) to prove itself as a better bet than something like the QQQ. Indeed, I&#8217;m a big fan of Tom Lee, as are many investors out there who have witnessed the man make the right calls at the right time. But that alone isn&#8217;t enough to justify the 0.75% adjusted expense ratio, which is quite pricier than an indexing solution such as the QQQ. So, what goes in the Granny Shots ETF? First up, I have to remark on how well-diversified the ETF is, especially against the Nasdaq 100, which as you&#8217;re probably aware by now has too much weighting towards NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). With Granny Shots, no company has a weighting of more than 3% of the total portfolio, ensuring a good amount of diversification across the 40 or so hand-picked names. What&#8217;s in the GRNY ETF? Indeed, a big chunk (around 38%) of the portfolio is in tech stocks. Tom Lee, who&#8217;s a massive bull, has had big things to say about the AI revolution, after all. Additionally, there&#8217;s an 18% allocation in financials and industrials, providing far more sector diversification than even the S&amp;P 500. American Express (NYSE:AXP), which fits many themes that Lee and his team look for, is one of the larger holdings at the time of writing, as is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and a number of Magnificent Seven stocks. What you won&#8217;t find, however, is NVIDIA, which I think sets GRNY apart from the Nasdaq 100, especially if an AI bubble bursts. Though there is a lot of tech in the GRNY, it&#8217;s mature tech with modest valuations and limited semiconductor exposure. I expect that would prevent the fund from getting crushed in an AI-led correction. So, in short, I like what I see in GRNY and think it&#8217;s a better bet than the QQQ. Perhaps it&#8217;s better to shoot underhand with the ETF rather than indexing like so many investors are doing these days.

One of the easiest ways to achieve this is to invest in dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They are easy to buy and sell, often have low expense ratios and can offer tremendous portfolio diversification. You can give investors access to a basket of stocks while also making dependable monthly or quarterly distributions. With hundreds of ETFs to choose from, you need to be picky — that&#8217;s particularly true if you&#8217;re in income investor. But balance is important, so a combination of the following three ETFs can offer broad-exposure, balanced safety and passive income. I’d recommend holding the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) for safety and loading up on the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI) and the Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM) for dividend income. Top firms manage these ETFs; they carry low expense ratios and offer regular payouts. --> --> Key Points These three ETFs could be your best bets for 2025. JEPI and VYM offer steady income and some diversification within U.S. equities, while VOO provides growth potential and broad exposure to large-cap U.S. stocks. Together, they can contribute to a diversified U.S. equity portfolio. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

Don’t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) --> --> JEPI: Income and Growth Managed by the experts at JPMorgan, JEPI was launched in 2020 and has become a top choice of income investors. It is actively managed and uses a covered call options trading strategy to generate an attractive yield of 8.62%. It holds 126 stocks, which include both top dividend companies and growth firms. No one stock in its portfolio has a weighting higher than 2%, which reduces volatility to some extent. The options strategy allows it to maintain a buffer in case of market downturns, while focusing on the top blue-chip companies ensures stability. With $41.35 billion in assets under management, JEPI is a top choice today. As a bonus, it pays its dividend monthly. From a portfolio construction standpoint, its highest allocation is in the technology sector (14.9%), followed by financials (14%). Some of the top companies in the fund include NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). JEPI is an ideal fund for retirement and could possibly outperform the S&amp;P 500 this year. It has generated cumulative returns of 34.15% in three years. The ETF has a low expense ratio of 0.35% considering that it&#8217;s actively managed. Its NAV is $56.65. While the fund isn’t as diversified as many other ETFs, such as the aforementioned VOO, it does own top-tier businesses and employs a top-tier strategy. Plus, it pays monthly dividends, allowing you to enhance your passive income over the long term. An investment of $10,000 in JEPI in May 2020 would be worth $17,920 today. VYM: An Under-appreciated Dividend Fund The VYM is another ETF that deserves your attention if you&#8217;re an income-oriented investor. One of the top ETFs today, VYM has an expense ratio of only 0.06%. The share price of VYM is up 9.4% year-to-date, 13.3% in 12 months and 66% over five years. It pays quarterly dividends and is a passively managed fund that tracks the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. The fund holds 580 stocks and has a dividend yield of 2.48%. VYM picks companies that have paid above-average dividends for the past 12 months. Its holdings include strong dividend-paying companies like Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). With over 500 stocks in the portfolio, you enjoy ultimate diversification at low risk. No stock has a weightage higher than 7%. The fund has the highest allocation in financials (21.60%), followed by industrials (13.60%) and technology (12.30%). Overall, it offers a strong yield and pairs well with JEPI for steady income and multi-sector diversification. A few holdings may overlap with JEPI, but you’ll get passive income from both the ETFs. VYM is a growth ETF and has delivered 116.27% over 10 years. Driven by its exposure to financials and industrials, I expect the fund to outperform the market in the coming years. VOO: Safety and Stability The VOO tracks the S&amp;P 500 index and offers diversified exposure to the top 500 U.S. companies across different sectors. VOO has an expense ratio of 0.03% and has soared in 2025 as the S&amp;P 500 hit a new all-time high. It is the largest ETF in the world by assets under management. There are several reasons to buy VOO for safety. First, it is a highly diversified fund that holds 504 companies, meaning you have broad exposure which, in turn, can reduce volatility. Second, it invests heavily in technology (34.10%), followed by financials (13.60%) and consumer discretionary (10.40%). The top 10 holdings include the Magnificent Seven, but it also has a few dividend stalwarts. With VOO, you’ll also find giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). It holds several familiar businesses across different categories, from technology to consumer staples and energy. The ETF has an expense ratio of 0.03%, making it one of the least expensive funds in the space. Besides ultimate diversification, VOO generates impressive returns. The share price of VOO rose by 10% year-to-date, 19% in 12 months and an impressive 88% in five years. VOO pays quarterly dividends and has a yield of 1.16%.

Investors are seeking fairly priced stocks that still have the potential to continue growing and AI is no longer limited to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Those who invested in NVDA at the right moment have already made big gains. But if you’re looking for AI stocks to invest now, you need to be picky. Top AI stocks are either priced at a premium or face high expectations, which offer both risk and opportunities. NVIDIA failed to impress Wall Street with its Q2 earnings. Its data center revenue was slightly below consensus, and it reported a modest quarter. While the stock is up 25% in 2025, it is suffering due to elevated expectations. NVIDIA will continue to dominate the AI industry, but there are three other AI stocks worth loading up on. Here are three leveraged to AI that you should consider instead. --> --> Key Points If you&#8217;re looking for AI stocks other than Nvidia, here are the top three stocks soaring higher this year.

The company has benefited from the increased spending on cloud computing infrastructure and has a partnership with OpenAI. Besides the outsized gains in recent years, Oracle has had an excellent 2025. The company has turned into a complete ecosystem and is no longer restricted to a software database business. It started to build its own cloud services and offers AI powered database services. It also offers software-as-a-service for marketing, automating workflows, financial reporting, and more. A strong player in the cloud business today, Oracle is spending aggressively to capture the market. It reported a revenue of $15.9 billion in its Q4 financial results announced in June. Cloud revenue jumped 27% to $6.7 billion for the quarter, while total revenue for 2025 was up 8% to $57.4 billion. The management is aiming to achieve a 70% revenue growth in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure segment, and it is aiming for the total revenue to increase 16% to $67 billion in FY 2026. Its remaining performance obligations increased 41% to $138 billion. It shows the total value of the company’s unfulfilled contracts at the end of a period. A 41% jump is nothing but impressive. The company is already a part of the massive $500 billion Stargate project. Announced by OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and MGX, Oracle is the funder and technology partner. Stargate AI aims to invest $500 billion towards new data centres and infrastructure over the next four years. There’s a lot of space for the stock to show its strength and soar higher. Broadcom Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) supplies custom AI chips to three of the biggest tech giants- Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and TikTok owner ByteDance. Up 28% year-to-date, the stock is exchanging hands for $297 and has soared 94% in 12 months. The company makes AI and networking chips that ensure efficient and quick movement of data from one server to another. Its fundamentals are strong, and the company has seen a significant improvement in its market cap to $1.36 trillion. In the recent quarter, the AI revenue jumped 46% year-over-year to $4.4 billion, accounting for 30% of the total sales. The company&#8217;s management is aiming to generate $5.1 billion in AI revenue this quarter. Its networking division also benefits from the AI infrastructure demand. As companies continue to set aside billions of dollars for AI, Broadcom’s infrastructure becomes an integral part of their business. The scope of expansion is massive, and Broadcom is making the most of this opportunity. It is sitting at the intersection of custom chips, networking equipment, and integrated systems. While the stock isn’t cheap, it could be worth betting on. The company is set to report results on September 4, and we could see the stock rally. Analysts are bullish on the stock. Oppenheimer analyst has a price target of $325 with an Outperform rating while UBS has a price target of $345 with a Buy rating. AVGO is one of the top tech giants to keep on your radar. CoreWeave A new AI cloud services provider, CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV), has been making news after the expiration of its IPO lockup period. Up 157% in 2025, CoreWeave stock is exchanging hands for $103 and has reported robust quarterly results. The company has a market cap of $47 billion, and it rents out NVIDIA GPU-equipped servers. A fairly new name in the AI space, the stock has impressed investors, and this could be a start to a solid journey. In 2022, the company spent about $100 million to install Nvidia’s H100 GPU’s in its data centers, and then it used those as collateral to secure funding to open more data centres. The strategy impressed tech giant Nvidia, which invested $100 million in the company in 2023 and another $250 million in the IPO this year. This is NVIDIA&#8217;s single biggest investment in the stock and has garnered attention from many. CoreWeave has 33 data centers in the U.S. and Europe, and top customers include Meta, OpenAI and IBM (NYSE: IBM). The growing expenses have led to wide losses, and analysts expect the company to continue reporting net losses this year. In the recent quarter, it posted a loss of 60 cents per share versus $1.62 per share loss reported a year earlier. CoreWeave saw a 206% jump in revenue to $1.21 billion, beating expectations. For the full year, it has raised guidance by $250 million to $5.25 billion. Unlike bigger AI companies, which offer a range of computing and storage services, CoreWeave only focuses on one service- providing cloud-based GPUs for processing AI tasks. It enjoys an early mover advantage, has an impressive client base, and the potential to grow at a rapid rate.

With a 106% year-to-date gain, the stock is exchanging hands for $154 at the time of writing. However, it is down 18% from its all-time high. The company is in an incredible place to benefit from AI demand and is the best performing stock of the S&amp;P 500 this year. PLTR stock is trading at a premium, and many investors have valuation concerns. But there’s a lot to be excited about. The company reported an impressive second quarter with a 48% year-over-year jump in the top line. It is aggressively expanding in the commercial sector and has seen a 93% jump in the U.S. commercial revenue. It closed 157 deals of at least $1 million and 42 deals of at least $10 million. The U.S. commercial remaining deal value was up 145% year-over-year to $2.79 billion. Driven by the success of its bespoke AI platforms, Palantir is one of the few companies that have demonstrated impressive growth and profitability. It continues to remain a favorite of the federal government and was recently awarded a $10 billion contract with the military. I must mention that Palantir shares have an astronomical valuation. However, it continues to drive the market right now and Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock with a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. NVIDIA Tech giant NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) needs no introduction. The biggest driver of AI growth across the country, NVIDIA has made the most of this thriving market. It has soared to new highs driven by its AI chips and has already delivered double digit gains in 2025. Up 23% year-to-date, the stock is exchanging hands for $170. Once known for setting the gold standard in graphics processing units for the gaming industry, NVIDIA quickly shifted gears and started building GPUs for AI. It is a dominant chip designer, and the numbers are impressive. In the second quarter results, the company reported a revenue of $46.7 billion, up 56% year-over-year, and the data center revenue was $41.1 billion. About 40% of the revenue comes from only two customers. While the company hasn&#8217;t named the customers, it mentioned that one customer represented 23% of the total revenue, while another represented 16% of the revenue. It could be one of the big tech companies heavily relying on Nvidia. For Q3, company management is aiming for revenue of $54 billion. While high concentration on a few customers can present a significant risk, the top tech giants have plenty of cash on hand to spend on AI. As companies increase their AI spending, NVIDIA will continue to benefit. NVIDIA presented at the Goldman Sachs Technology Conference on Sept. 8, and any announcements of new launches could boost the stock. NVIDIA has been carrying the market for a long time now and there’s no other company that can come close to it. It is an irreplaceable company you must add to your portfolio. Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is one stock to buy and hold forever. A major supplier for chip companies like NVIDIA and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), TSMC has also built strong relationships with Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). The company recently reported results and generated over $30 billion in sales for the quarter. There’s growing demand for its 5nm and 3nm chip nodes, which continue to drive sales. It is sitting at the forefront of chip technology and has recently launched the 2nm chip node. This could indicate higher growth for the company as there will be improvements in 2nm which is why companies are willing to adopt this technology. The company has cut ties to Chinese chipmaking tools and secured additional NVIDIA orders, playing a strategic role in the China-U.S. competition. The world’s largest contract chipmaker, TSMC has fast-tracked its U.S. manufacturing footprint. Production has already begun at its Japan lab, and the management has plans for American expansion this year. Fundamentally, TSMC is in a strong position. It saw a 38% jump in revenue and an improved gross margin. The revenue stood at $30.07 billion and the EPS was $2.50, up 61% year over year. Its market share reached 70%, driven by the growing demand for smartphones, AI accelerators and PCs. This was TMSC’s strongest quarter, and it has gained a position that is hard to beat. Tech giants are increasing their investment in AI, and TSMC will benefit from it. The company is well positioned to capitalize on the growing AI investment and could grab a larger market share in the coming years.

NVDA,2025-08-27,2025-08-13,2025-09-10,NVDA,,2025-09-10 09:30:10,2025-09-10T09:30:10-04:00,2025-09-10,Did You Just Miss Out On the Most Undervalued AI Stock?,"--> --> Key Points Nebius Group (NBIS) is gaining attention as a potentially undervalued AI stock with significant growth potential, distinct from Nvidia’s chip-focused dominance. The company’s Q2 earnings project an ARR of up to $1.1 billion, signaling a dramatic revenue ramp-up. Its focus on AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters and cloud platforms, positions it as a critical player in the AI revolution. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of ‘Next Nvidia Stocks’ that could be even better. Click here to learn more. --> --> A Rising Star in AI Infrastructure In the fast-evolving artificial intelligence (AI) landscape, Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS) has emerged as a hidden gem, quietly positioning itself as a powerhouse in AI infrastructure. While Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates headlines with its AI chip supremacy, Nebius has been carving out a niche as a provider of full-stack AI solutions, including large-scale GPU clusters, cloud platforms, and developer tools. Once known as the Russian search engine giant Yandex, this Netherlands-based company has undergone a remarkable transformation, with its second-quarter earnings projecting an annualized revenue run rate (ARR) of up to $1.1 billion &#8212; a massive leap from its $117.5 million in 2024. This meteoric growth trajectory has fueled speculation that Nebius was, until recently, the most undervalued AI stock, offering explosive 10x growth potential. Investors who overlooked it may now wonder if they’ve missed a golden opportunity as its stock soars. A Game-Changing Partnership Nebius Group’s trajectory is taking a seismic leap forward after announcing a $17.4 agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) last night. This landmark deal positions Nebius as a key provider of AI infrastructure, specifically high-performance GPU clusters powered by Nvidia’s cutting-edge chips, to support Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform. The agreement is expected to significantly boost Nebius’ data center capacity, enabling it to meet the surging global demand for AI computing power. With Microsoft’s backing, Nebius is poised to become a linchpin in the AI data center market, offering scalable, high-performance solutions that cater to the needs of hyperscalers driving the AI revolution. This partnership not only validates Nebius’ technological prowess but also amplifies its visibility and credibility in a crowded market. Scaling New Heights with Hyperscaler Potential Adding to its momentum, Nebius is a key partner of Nvidia, building its AI cloud infrastructure using Nvidia’s advanced GPUs. This symbiotic relationship enhances Nebius’ standing, as it now has the support of two industry titans &#8212; Microsoft and Nvidia. By leveraging Nvidia’s GPUs within its cloud platforms and developer tools, Nebius creates a robust ecosystem that appeals to enterprises scaling their AI operations. This dual backing from major players not only strengthens Nebius’ business model but also positions it to capture a significant share of the AI infrastructure market, projected to grow exponentially as AI adoption accelerates across industries. The Microsoft deal is likely just the beginning. Nebius’ ability to deliver large-scale, GPU-driven infrastructure makes it an attractive partner for other hyperscalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet&#8216;s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). As these tech giants race to expand their AI capabilities, Nebius’ full-stack solutions could become a go-to choice, further driving its revenue and market presence. The company’s nearly $2.5 billion cash pile provides the financial flexibility to invest in capacity expansion, ensuring it can meet growing demand. This strategically positions Nebius on the cusp of becoming a cornerstone of the AI ecosystem. Key Takeaways With Nebius’ stock soaring 55% in premarket trading this morning &#8212; now at $99 per share &#8212; investors face a critical question: is it too late to jump in, or does the stock still offer value? The Microsoft deal and Nebius’ role as a supplier to Nvidia signal strong growth potential, with analysts projecting continued revenue expansion as more hyperscalers sign on. However, at $99, the stock’s valuation is less of a bargain than it was months ago. While the long-term outlook remains bullish &#8212; driven by its infrastructure expertise and hyperscaler partnerships &#8212; short-term volatility could offer a better entry point. Investors may benefit from waiting for a pullback to maximize returns, but those with a long-term horizon could still find Nebius a compelling buy given its trajectory.
