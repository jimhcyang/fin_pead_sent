    "text": "Millionaire Venture Capitalist and tech analyst, Luke Lango, is no stranger to uncovering little-known stocks on the verge of huge run ups… Lango called the rise of AMD, GameStop and Blink while they were all trading under $2. So while most of the world fixates on the rollercoaster swings of A.I. stocks like Nvidia, Google and Microsoft… Luke Lango says you have to look beyond the headlines to see the real AI wealth creation story taking shape… And he claims its centered around a tiny $3 AI stock at the heart of a $100 Trillion wealth shift. It’s a startup he says could soon be “The Amazon of Real Estate.” As its proprietary AI technology revolutionizes how virtually everyone buys and sells their home, Luke believes this small startup could soon balloon to a $100 billion company. That kind of growth, Lango projects, could send the stock price soaring by as much as 1,000% in the coming year. In a brand new streaming video, Luke Lango travels straight to the Silicon Valley headquarters of this company to reveal why this could be “the biggest wealth-generation opportunity no one is talking about.” Lango says the stock’s share price is not likely to stay low for long, due to the enormous buzz it’s generating in Silicon Valley. As a Silicon Valley insider himself, Luke decided to “break ranks” and share the name, ticker and details of this company right here — no strings attached. So make sure you have a pen and paper ready to go when he reveals the ticker of his NEXT big 1,000% AI bet. Click Here to Watch the Full Story… With Innovation Investor, Luke Lango’s goal is to offer readers research on an elevated small-cap investing strategy that goes beyond anything that’s been done before on Wall Street. Luke was ranked America’s #1 stock picker in 2020 according to TipRanks and has 15 recommendations that have soared as high as 1,000% or more over his tenure. *All investing includes risk of loss*",

    "text": "Today’s market has turned decidedly negative as soured sentiment in the Dow Jones Industrial Average spills over, spoiling the S&amp;P 500’s record run. The Dow is spiraling by 500 points and is being pressured by retailer Walmart (NYSE: WMT), whose earnings results confirmed tariff-related fears. Among the few technology gainers are Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) as of early trading. Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is among the rare gainers in the Dow today. Walmart warned that its profit growth is expected to slow down amid the company’s vulnerability to the likely Mexico and Canada tariffs. Walmart’s stock is down over 6% despite beating consensus estimates on the top and bottom lines in its fiscal Q4 as Wall Street focuses on an uncertain future. Nevertheless, TD Cowen analyst Oliver Chen told Yahoo Finance that Walmart is “hitting on all cylinders” for now, pointing to a resilient consumer that continues to drive revenue. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 502.74 (-1.13) Nasdaq Composite: -165.58 (-0.80%) S&amp;P 500: Down 44.26 (-0.72%) Key Points The Dow Jones Industrial Average is spiraling by 500 points. Alibaba shares are soaring after a blowout quarterly earnings report. Big Tech stocks are mixed. Palantir is sinking on fears of U.S. defense budget cuts. Market Movers Alibaba is boosting tech sentiment today, rising 11.7% on the heels of its fiscal Q3 earnings report, which executives attributed “robust” AI momentum . The company’s results were driven by cloud technology as well as AI-product revenue, both of which have been soaring. Alibaba is also receiving tailwind’s from China’s competitive AI investments, including DeepSeek, as a result of which BABA stock has skyrocketed 50% so far in 2025. Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) is giving up some of its recent gains, falling below the psychologically sensitive $100 level today amid a 13% drop in the stock. The Trump Administration is defense budget cuts, the industry for which Palantir creates AI-powered software solutions. Toy company Hasbro (NYSE: HAS) is among the winners in today’s session, gaining 11% on the heels of a quarterly earnings and revenue beat. Hasbro has also launched a new line of PLAY-DOH Barbie dolls in a licensing partnership with Mattel that is set to hit the store shelves at Target (NYSE: TGT). Apple shares are posting fractional gains a day after introducing the lower-priced iPhone 16. Citi analysts expect this model will represent 10% of the company’s units sold in 2025.

    "text": "After Friday’s fear-induced market sell-off, stocks attempted a recovery, led by an early-morning 100-plus point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Those gains have faded, but the Dow is attempting to stay alive. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain in the red. All eyes are on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) for hopes of a renewed rally when Wall Street’s AI darling reports its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. In the meantime, there is tech optimism, with each of the Magnificent 7 stocks initially trading in the green but then turning mixed. Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has agreed to invest a whopping $500 billion into the U.S. market over four years in an American innovation push, improving sentiment. Apple plans to double its Advanced Manufacturing Fund and is targeting Texas for the development of advanced technology. AAPL stock is up fractionally. Also among the Mag 7 stocks is Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), which has turned south, falling over 2% as of mid-morning. The stock can’t seem to get out of its own way of late and remains close to 30% below its record high of $480 reached in December. In a competitive move, Tesla plans to roll out its driver assistance technology akin to full self-driving software in China. Meanwhile, Rivian Auto (Nasdaq: RIVN) is tumbling 9% on the day. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 42.49 (+0.12%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 174.16 (-0.89%) S&amp;P 500: Down 18.74 (-0.31%) Key Points The markets attempted gains but are struggling to hold onto them. Apple stock is a gainer among the Mag 7 Nike is rallying and helping both the Dow and S&amp;P 500. Palantir Tech is extended its losing streak. Market Movers With Tesla’s sell-off today, Berkshire Hathaway has currently surpassed the EV maker in market cap at $1.074 trillion compared with Tesla’s $1.06 trillion. Berkshire’s stock is up nearly 4% on the day on the heels of Warren Buffett’s letter to shareholders. Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) has announced a wave of layoffs, including 1,100 corporate jobs, to accelerate its restructuring. The stock is up fractionally today. Nike (NYSE: NKE) is bucking the downward trend today, rising 6% and helping both the Dow and S&amp;P 500. A bullish call from Jefferies analysts is the catalyst amid a forecast for “changes afoot.” Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) is sinking almost 11% on the day, extending recent declines in a sell-off sparked by reports of U.S. defense budget cuts, where the company plays.

    "text": "The market has been a wild roller coaster ride these past five years. As the longest-running bull market hit new highs in early 2020, the pandemic struck causing the Nasdaq 100 to lose more than a quarter of its value in a matter of weeks. Yet immediately after, the technology-oriented reversed course to go on a new 21-month tear, surging 139%, only to make another u-turn and lose one-third of its value in 2023. The Nasdaq 100 has doubled in value since that low point. This white-knuckle ride has only served to prove the adage that the only constant is change. While no one knows where the stock market will head tomorrow, let alone over the coming year, investors looking to trounce the index in 2025 should look no further than the two Vanguard funds below. 24/7 Wall St. Insights: The stock market has been on a tremendous bull run for years, albeit with some stomach-churning dips along the way. The Nasdaq 100 index, because of its heavy tech sector weighting, has been a stellar performer as the market has favored these companies. Vanguard is a premier asset manager known for its low fees, but it also offers ETFs that have handily outperformed the tech-heavy index in recent years and should outperform again. 4 million Americans are set to retire this year. If you want to join them, click here now to see if you’re behind, or ahead. It only takes a minute. (Sponsor) The Nasdaq 100 index, of course, is the 100 largest, non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Itis heavily weighted toward technology and growth stocks, including the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It’s why it tends to serve as a high-growth stock benchmark. Vanguard exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are best-known as the premiere strategy for low-cost, passive indexing and broad diversification. Many will track specific sectors, regions, or asset classes, so not all will match the Nasdaq 100’s tech-heavy growth, but some Vanguard ETFs focus on technology or growth stocks, making them the leading contenders to outperform the tech-heavy index. The following two are the best positioned to do so. Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) The Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT) tracks the MSCI U.S. Investable Market Information Technology index, focusing on tech companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple, and Nvidia. The ETF has delivered total returns of 66% over the last three years, just surpassing the Nasdaq 100’s of 64%. The Vanguard ETF’s heavy weighting in mega-cap tech stocks gives it the top shot at beating the index, especially if Nvidia and other chipmakers continue their artificial intelligence-fueled surge for the coming year. All eyes will be on Nvidia on this Wednesday as it reports fourth-quarter results after the market closes. Most analysts expect the AI chipmaker to post stellar results for the quarter, but it will be its guidance for the coming year that sets the tone. If it has a robust outlook, it could set the stock and the sector on fire once more, though more muted guidance could send stocks careening lower. Nvidia is the second largest holding in VGT at around 13%, second only to Apple and just ahead of Microsoft. Remarkably, over the last five years, the Vanguard ETF has done even better, beating the Nasdaq 100 145% to 138%. While Vanguard is well-known as the low-cost leader in ETFs, with cheap expense ratios, VGT’s tiny 0.09% ratio ensures that virtually all of your money put into the ETF is working for you and not enriching the money-manager. Vanguard Mega Cap Growth Index Fund ETF (MGK) Traditionally, investing in large and mega cap stocks meant slow, but steady growth. However, that’s changed in recent years, the market’s biggest stocks are all fast-growing tech stocks. In fact, eight of the 10 largest companies are all tech companies. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:MGK) tracks the CRSP U.S. Mega Cap Growth index, including many of the same tech giants as VGT, including Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon (which is technically classified as consumer discretionary but is seen by many as a growth-oriented tech stock). Over the past three years, MGK just eked out a win over the Nasdaq 100, offering total returns of 64.6%. Because its 50 to 60 largest growth stocks also include components of the index, it give MGK a strong overlap. However, its broader diversification has the potential to dilute its returns compared to Nasdaq 100, but that’s not how it has played out. Now it did have an impact over the last five years, but not by much. Where the tech index gained 138%, the Vanguard Mega Cap ETF gained 126%, so you weren’t giving up much by investing in it, while gaining downside protection from the diversified portfolio. Moreover, Its expense ratio is even better than VGT at 0.07%. Today, tech stocks are ascendant so that’s what MGK is heavily weighted towards, or 62.5% of its holdings. But if another sector rises strong and its leaders become mega cap giants, then the ETF will tilt towards them. It ensures that investors are always invested in the market’s biggest growth stocks, no matter what their underlying business is.

    "text": "Shares of NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) bounced back on Wednesday, gaining 3.67% in the lead-up to the company’s aftermarket Q4 2024 earnings call. Yesterday’s gain was a nice change of pace from recent losses, including the stock falling by -2.80% on Tuesday and -6.31% over the past five trading sessions. Nonetheless, the stock is up 10.86% over the past month and 65.99% over the past year. From an earnings perspective, NVIDIA handily outperformed expectations. The company beat on EPS and revenue by 5.22% and 3.08%, respectively. Nonetheless, after hours, the stock chopped around and ultimately ended -1.49% lower than it was at the close Over the past few years, AI has consistently fueled the largest gains for the market. And one company in particular is at the vanguard: NVIDIA. NVIDIA is the premier manufacturer of components critical to the surge in AI; namely, semiconductors, microchips, and graphics processing units (GPUs). As a result, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has seen its stock skyrocket in the recent past. Over the past five years, shares have gained nearly 1,776%, and since going public, NVIDIA’s stock is up a preposterous 316,475%. Despite those mind-boggling gains, analysts still expect significant upside potential in the medium and long term. 24/7 Wall Street has performed analysis to provide prospective investors and current shareholders with an idea of where NVIDIA’s stock might be headed over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: NVIDIA’s track record of strong earnings suggests an ability to remain at the forefront of its industry, as competitors fight for the leftovers. Between NVIDIA’s client list of Magnificent Seven companies and the burgeoning trend in AI, growth in both revenue and net income is projected to continue its steep climb. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. NVIDIA’s Recent Stock Success Unless you have been living under a rock, chances are you have caught wind of the very well-documented and rather exponential surge in NVIDIA’s share price since 2022. But before 2022’s price-per-share explosion, it was steadily appreciating as it underwent a series of stock splits. Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $0.51 $4.130 $0.588 2015 $0.82 $4.681 $0.800 2016 $2.67 $5.010 $0.929 2017 $4.88 $6.910 $1.851 2018 $3.24 $9.714 $3.085 2019 $5.98 $11.716 $4.143 2020 $13.06 $10.918 $3.580 2021 $29.64 $16.675 $6.277 2022 $14.61 $26.914 $11.259 2023 $49.52 $26.974 $8.366 2024 $134.29 $60.974 $29.76 *Post-split adjusted basis **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, NVIDIA’s revenue grew by more than 553% while its net income increased by just over 1,323%. The company experienced a slight contraction in revenue and net income in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it rebounded soundly the following year and has continued to steadily grow both metrics since. Meanwhile, shares were able to increase by 9,610% from 2014 to 2023. As the AI lynchpin and Magnificent Seven mainstay looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of NVIDIA’s Stock Performance Stronghold on the GPU Industry: No one makes GPUs like Nvidia makes GPUs, and the industry demanding them is well aware of that. While semiconductor competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) do command some attention in their respective corners of the market, simply comparing the three companies’ market caps demonstrates the discrepancies between NVIDIA and, well, every other company. While Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have respectable market caps of $194.67 billion and $861.41 billion, respectively, those are dwarfed by NVIDIA’s $3.34 trillion. Demand From Unrivaled Tech Customers: The company’s primary clientele are the other members of the Magnificent Seven, which are leading the way forward in the AI revolution. In fact, only four Big Tech rival companies — Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) — account for 40% of NVIDIA’s revenue as they vie with one another to become the front runner of the transition to generative AI. The AI Trend Is Just Getting Started: According to Grand View Research, the market size of AI in 2023 was $196.63 billion. As large as that seems, it pales in comparison to where the market is headed. From 2024 to 2030, it is expected that the industry will grow at an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6%, with “continuous research and innovation directed by tech giants that are driving adoption of advanced technologies in industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing,” according to Grand View Research’s report. NVIDIA (NVDA) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus one-year price target for NVIDIA, according to analysts, is $177.87, which represents 40.46% potential upside over the next 12 months based on today’s closing share price of $126.63. Of all the analysts covering NVIDIA, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.3 “Strong Buy” rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). However, by the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast projects shares of NVIDIA to be trading for $137.50 based on a projected EPS of $2.75 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50, with a best-case scenario of $192.50 per share and a worst-case scenario of $82.50 per share. NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue* Net Income* EPS 2025 $121.255 $68.392 $2.75 2026 $168.151 $95.246 $3.83 2027 $193.852 $108.182 $4.44 2028 $225.462 $130.155 $5.28 2029 $236.498 $152.001 $6.16 2030 $265.522 $175.412 $7.24 *Revenue and net income in $billions NVIDIA Stock Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates that NVIDIA’s stock will be trading for $362.00, good for a 159.68% increase over today’s share price, based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 50. Our high-end price target is $506.80 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 70. Meanwhile, our low-end price target is $217.20 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 30.

    "text": "Close Key Takeaways Nvidia shares gave up early gains Thursday after the chipmaker reported earnings that topped Street estimates. Investors may have expected more from the AI darling.However, analysts said they're still bullish on the chipmaker's prospects, anticipating strong demand as Big Tech ramps up spending on AI infrastructure.Bank of America called Nvidia a \"top pick\" on its AI dominance and raised its price target for the stock. Nvidia (NVDA) shares gave up early gains Thursday after the chipmaker reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped Street estimates. Investors may have expected more from the AI darling. Shares were down about 3% at $127 in intraday trading. The stock has had a tough start to 2025, with shares down about 5% for the year so far, after nearly tripling in value in 2024. Better-than-expected results have become \"routine\" for Nvidia, Morgan Stanley analysts said, with expectations climbing ahead of the company's report. However, \"everything improves from here,\" the analysts said, and raised their price target to $162 from $152, pointing to Nvidia's strong outlook and \"language around 'amazing' levels of Blackwell demand.\" Bank of America analysts called the stock a “top pick on AI dominance” and raised their price target to $200 from $190. Nvidia’s data center segment, which delivered record quarterly revenue, “potentially faces strong, long-term demand dynamics,” the analysts added. Several of Nvidia’s Big Tech buyers, including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), recently announced plans to raise their capital expenditures to fuel their AI ambitions. Wedbush analysis said the results showed “few (if any) blemishes” with “seemingly only good news ahead.” Nvidia’s annual GPU Technology Conference is in March, and CEO Jensen Huang told analysts on the company’s earnings call to expect “exciting things to come” including what’s next after its Blackwell line of chips. Wedbush maintained its price target of $175 and “outperform” rating. Nvidia reported $11 billion in quarterly revenue from Blackwell, which CFO Colette Kress said was the company’s fastest-ever product ramp, according to an earnings call transcript provided by AlphaSense. Going forward, Jefferies analysts said “the supply chain should continue to improve, and we see no signs of demand issues.” The analyst posted a price target of $185. Despite recent losses, Nvidia shares have added nearly two-thirds of their value over the past 12 months. Do you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters? Please email us at tips@investopedia.com",

    "text": "In the popular consciousness, disc-shaped UFOs immediately bring space aliens to mind. In reality, though, several countries have actually designed, built, and flown “flying saucers,” including some that might surprise you. Of course, that begs the question, did we get the idea of alien spacecraft from military test vehicles . . . or did we build military test vehicles based on alien tech? Key Points Several countries have tried to build flying saucers but the design has not proved stable enough to go into production. Also, check out these special reports: 2 Dividend Legends To Hold Forever and Discover “The Next NVIDIA” Early Disc-Shaped Aircraft Experimentation with disc- or saucer-shaped aircraft goes back to the early days of flight. One of the first experiments was the Lee-Richards Annular Biplane and Monoplane, a circular design that flew in a way described delicately as “not very satisfactory.” Aviators experimented with numerous craft of similar circular design, including vertical take-off craft and hovercraft, up through the mid-Cold War years. Nazi Germany Did the Nazis build a UFO? In the 1950s, rumors circulated in the media that during World War II Germany and Italy were working on disk-like craft. It’s well documented that German aeronautical engineers were pursuing breakthroughs in aviation technology to help win the war. Allegedly, a crew took one of these on a test flight in 1945 that rose to 12,400 m in 3 minutes and flew at 2,200 km/h in level flight. These claims cannot be substantiated, but many German engineers were brought to the United States after the war to help develop missile technology. If Germans were working on this tech, then the advanced designs the U.S. began testing after the war could help support those claims. United States &amp; Canada In the 1950s, the United States developed a number of different flying wing designed military aircraft, hovercraft, and discs. The most notable project was the VZ-9 Avrocar, a project funded by the U.S. Air Force but secretly developed in Ontario, Canada by Avro Aircraft. As seen in the replica pictured above, it was a quintessential flying saucer. It was 18 feet in diameter and 3.5 feet thick. Its central structure was built around a large equilateral triangle. A 124-blade turborotor was in the middle of the triangle to provide downward thrust. The craft had thrust and stability issues, so the project was finally cancelled in 1961. Soviet Union / Russia Russia was a bit later to the flying saucer trend. Its most notable attempt was a project known as EKIP, which in Russian is an acronym for “Economy and Progress.” The flying disc this program produced was a multifunctional craft capable of hovering over water or soil and landing softly using an air cushion without need of a runway. By 1994, a prototype was developed that could carry 400 passengers or 40 tons of cargo. Development of the project lasted from 1978-1999 but was canceled due to funding issues. Romania Romanian engineers Razvan Sabie and Iosif Taposu publicized their development of the All-Directional Flying Object (ADIFO) in 2019. The 4-foot diameter disc had four ducted fans to enable vertical takeoff and landing and two electrical fans in the back for horizontal flight. On a full-scale version, twin jets would replace the fans. Pending finding partners to invest in the project, Sabie and Taposu envision creating single- and multi-seat manned aircraft using their design as well as UAVs. Why Haven’t We Developed These Craft More Aggressively? Disc-shaped flying craft look futuristic and have some advantages. They have a huge wing area compressed into a compact shape. It’s an efficient design for take-off and landing on an aircraft carrier, taking up less space than winged aircraft. They can also make quick turns in flight. However, they have serious aerodynamic problems that makes them inefficient and unstable. Circular wings have too much atmospheric drag, so they use up more energy to stay in flight. Those that launch edge-on rather than vertically have to fly at a steep angle during takeoff and landing, interfering with visibility and control. And they’re harder to control than conventional aircraft. They can turn quickly, but maintaining control when they do is hard because of all the extra drag the design causes. Is It Alien Tech? For UFO enthusiasts, an intriguing possibility is that these disc designs have come about as the U.S. and other countries attempt to reverse engineer crashed alien spaceships. Of course, it’s tempting to ask, if aliens are so advanced, why do their spacecraft keep crashing? Given the flight issues of the disc craft we know about, it seems far more likely that at least some of the UFO saucer reports were rumors based on real experimental military designs, or civilian sightings of a test flight of one of these unusual craft, not advanced extraterrestrial technology. On the other hand, reports of a wobbly pie-pan-looking metal disc staggering drunkenly across the sky are not your typical UFO sighting. Many of these have been reported to have sophisticated flight characteristics that seem hundreds of years advanced over currently-known technology. So for now, what we know for a fact is that several countries have tested such craft and found them lacking. What else they might be testing, and how effective it might be, is anyone’s guess.

    "text": "If you want to invest your money in stocks but do not know how to pick the right stocks, you are not alone. Many retail investors have the money but are not sure how to get started in the stock market. With thousands of companies and stocks to choose from, it is natural to get confused. Fortunately, there are exchange-traded funds or ETFs that can help you with the task. These funds invest in individual stocks and help achieve diversification. All you need to do is choose an ETF that works with your risk appetite and investment goals. Growing market volatility has led several investors towards ETFs and the global ETF industry saw an inflow of $1.45 trillion in 2024. If you are ready to invest in ETFs, here are three ETFs to buy in March. Key points in this article: Investors are playing safe and looking for ETFs to park their money. Besides providing immediate diversification, ETFs also generate steady returns. If you are looking for individual stocks instead of an ETF, get your hands on our “The Next Nvidia” stocks, it has one stock with 10X potential. Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF If you want a safe way to ride the stock market, consider the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO). With a low expense ratio, it is one of the best ways to invest in the top U.S. companies. As of writing, VOO is trading at $546 and is close to the 52-week high of $563. It has generated 15% returns in a year and over 100% returns in five years. It holds 505 stocks and allocates 30% of the funds into the information technology sector, followed by 14% in the financial sector and 11% in the consumer discretionary industry. One good reason to invest in the ETF is that it follows the S&amp;P 500 and you will be able to own a piece of the top companies without having to pick them individually. Some of the fund’s top holdings include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), the four stalwarts leading the tech industry. It has an expense ratio of only 0.03% and the Assets Under Management are $498.5 billion. While it offers diversification to your portfolio, it is heavily dependent on the tech industry for majority gains. Hence, if you are optimistic about the growth of the tech sector, this is an ideal ETF to own. As long as the tech sector continues to post gains, VOO will keep soaring. Invesco QQQ The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) is ideal for investors who want higher exposure to the tech sector. It follows the Nasdaq 100 and has an expense ratio of 0.15%. At the time of writing, QQQ is up 14% in the year and 146% in the past five years. Its NAV is $508 and is lower than the 52-week high of $540. Since its launch in 1999, the fund has shown strong performance and generated +443.43% higher returns than the S&amp;P 500. The Assets Under Management (AUM) of the fund is $171.86 billion. QQQ offers high exposure to the Magnificent Seven and allows you to own some of the most popular stocks. Its biggest holdings include Microsoft Corporation, Apple Inc., and NVIDIA, the three tech giants driving the market today. Over 50% of the fund’s holdings are in the tech sector followed by the consumer discretionary. Notably, the fund also owns stocks in different industries and has some long-term winners like Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR). Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST). The solid diversification of the fund ensures that it stands strong when volatility hits the tech industry. Invesco QQQ is ideal for low-risk investors who seek steady growth and steady income. While it offers exposure to the technology sector, it maintains a strong balance in its total holdings. ARK Fintech Innovation ETF Cathie Wood’s ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NASDAQ: ARKF) focuses on companies that are transforming the financial sector through digital assets, blockchain, and mobile payments. It has an expense ratio of 0.75% and an NAV of $38.07. The fund has generated 31% returns in the year and 54% in the past five years. I believe the fintech industry is going through a solid transition and some of the biggest companies like Coinbase and Shopify will lead the change. There is optimism about the future of fintech and this ETF will help investors make the most of it. The fund allocation includes 39% in the technology sector followed by 28% in the financial services sector and 18% in communication services. The fund’s top three holdings include Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP), Coinbase Global Inc (COIN), and Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD). These three stocks are on a rally and have impressed the market with stellar financials. However, there is one risk associated with the ETF, if the financial sector falls, the returns will drop. However, the current situation suggests that the fintech sector is poised for growth. The fund has a low NAV, making it a strong buy at the current level. It is down from the 52-week high of $44. If you are someone who follows Cathie Wood’s investment decisions and is optimistic about the financial sector, this ETF is an exciting buy for the month.

    "text": "Now that a down February is in the rearview mirror, the markets breathed a sigh of relief but it didn’t last. After coming out of the gate higher, stocks have since reversed course, with all three of the major stock market indices trading in the red, dragged lower by a 5% slide in Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock. There are also some standout gainers. Among them is Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) rising nearly 3% this morning and recapturing the $300 per share level. Wall Street is helping the stock, with Morgan Stanley analysts calling it a “top pick” among auto stocks with a $430 price target attached, reflecting 43% upside potential. Elon Musk’s net worth now hovers at a reported $351 billion. Palantir (Nasdaq: PLTR) is rising over 5% today to nearly $90 per share. Once again, analysts have set the bullish tone, suggesting that Palantir is poised to benefit from government contract momentum despite recent headlines of defense department budget cuts. Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) is extending positive momentum on news of its upcoming standalone AI app to go head-to-head with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini in 2025. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 11.43 (-0.03) Nasdaq Composite: Down 120.47 (-0.62%) S&amp;P 500: Down 19.33 (-0.32%) Key Points Stocks came out of the gate in the green but have since reversed course. Nvidia stock is weighing on the Nasdaq. Tesla and Palantir are bright spots, both recapturing recently lost ground. Other Market Movers MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is another bright spot, rising 4.5% on the Bitcoin rally, owing to the company’s heavy BTC holdings on its balance sheet. The Bitcoin price has been rallying on news of a new crypto reserve being introduced by the Trump administration which will hold BTC, among other digital assets. At $269, MSTR stock is still a far cry from its 52-week high of $543 per share. T-Mobile (Nasdaq; TMUS) is gaining 1.4% on the day on reports of a partnership with AI phenomenon Perplexity. Nvidia is down 5% on the day and is preventing the Nasdaq Composite from further gains. Nvidia is off to a rocky start in 2025, falling 12.5% year-to-date. Constellation Energy (Nasdaq: CEG) is falling 4.6%. The Wall Street Journal reported that “AI fever” in the power sector is shifting from nuclear, which Constellation is active, to natural gas. Constellation operates the biggest fleet of nuclear power plants in the U.S. The post Live Nasdaq Coverage: Why Palantir (PLTR) and Tesla (TSLA) Are Up Today appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

    "text": "It’s probably going to be a long time before Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has a chance to split again. With shares back in bear market territory, the name may be at risk of falling back to the double-digits in short order. While such steep drops are nothing all too uncommon for the GPU juggernaut, this bear market dip does feel a bit more unnerving, thanks primarily to DeepSeek. While Nvidia is still the undisputed champ in AI GPUs, the trillion-dollar question is what happens when the next DeepSeek pops up. Undoubtedly, we seem to be trending towards lower-cost AI models and more those that can be run entirely on the edge. While models only stand to get cheaper and more portable with time, I still think the race on the high-end is still on. For instance, OpenAI recently delayed its launch of GPT-4.5, citing a GPU shortage as the reason for this. Key Points Nvidia stock is on the retreat. Yet, analysts are still sticking with the name as the firm readies its next-gen GPU. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of ‘Next Nvidia Stocks’ that could be even better. Click here to learn more. OpenAI’s GPU shortage suggests Nvidia’s best days may not be behind it While it’s unclear when progress on the high-end (every firm wants that number-one spot currently held by OpenAI) will begin to slow, I do think that the rise of agentic AI, reasoning models, and other power-hungry models (perhaps AGI in the future?) will grow ever power-hungry. Perhaps DeepSeek’s existence doesn’t pull the plug on the race on the very cutting edge. Either way, the Magnificent Seven are betting a lot to advance the effort on the high-end, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is slated to spend $500 billion in four years in an effort that could see the iPhone maker pull ahead (perhaps to the front) in this AI race. Either way, things are about to get interesting in the deep end of the AI waters. And despite big tech’s efforts to insource AI chips, we’re still likely a long way off from a climate that would see Nvidia GPUs experience demand that’s less than heated. For now, it’s DeepSeek, tariff tremors, fatigue in the AI trade and rising competitive threats that have some NVDA shareholders more than willing to throw in the towel. Analysts are sticking with the name Don’t expect analysts to downgrade the stock just because of a bit of volatility. If anything, some upgrades may be in order, given the added value in buying the name on weakness. On the high-end, the most bullish analyst sees $220.00 as a price target on the stock. That entails a 93% gain from current levels. Until more bears step forward (they’re a rare breed when it comes to Nvidia), I’d not shy away from the name on weakness, as it could prove a wise contrarian bet. A high-growth stock on the cheap? Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood isn’t one of the doubters. She still views Nvidia as a high-growth play despite the recent margin forecast that startled investors. As shares of the GPU juggernaut come in again, perhaps dip-buyers, like Wood, will have more of an opportunity to pounce. After the latest slide, NVDA stock goes for 28.2 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) — that’s close to the cheapest it’s been all year. Only time will tell if Blackwell can reignite the stock. Indeed, there exists a scenario where DeepSeek and an efficiency boom is actually a boon for Nvidia as an increasing number of players (think startups and firms we haven’t heard about) look to buy their own picks and shovels to get in on the AI gold rush. Even if they don’t get the highest-quality picks and shovels, they can still unearth quite a bit of gold for themselves. Either way, I find it hard not to be more enticed by shares of NVDA now that they’re trading at forward P/E multiples that are lower than some rival Mag Seven members. Who knows? Nvidia may be a relative value option as investors turn on an AI trade that may still have legs.

    "text": "The markets are recovering from yesterday&#8217;s massive sell-off by starting today as a mixed bag. After the worst performances from the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 in several years, both indexes are showing fractional movement in either direction while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slides a bit further. Wall Street&#8217;s AI darling and a Mag 7 stock Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) is helping sentiment today, rising 2.6% at last check and lifting some of its tech peers. NVDA stock as well as Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) were helped by analysts at Bernstein, who reiterated their &#8220;outperform&#8221; ratings on both stocks, advising investors to pounce on any dip. Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) shares are also popping with a 3.6% gain after yesterday&#8217;s double-digit-percentage drop. President Trump has come out swinging against Tesla boycotters, announcing he would be buying an EV for himself in support of Elon Musk, whose net worth was slashed by $29 billion in yesterday&#8217;s market sell-off. Morgan Stanley analysts have reiterated their overweight rating on Tesla stock, calling the pullback in the stock a &#8220;buying opportunity.&#8221; With the exception of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock, which is falling about 2%, each of the Mag 7 stocks started the day in the green. Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) is gaining 2.5% on the day after revealing it would begin charging customers for checked bags in a first for the airline. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 303.11 (-0.74%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 23.62 (+0.11%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.02 (-0.34%) Key Points The markets are licking their wounds after yesterday&#8217;s historic sell-off. Nvidia&#8217;s gains are lifting tech boats. Tesla is also recovering with gains after a Wall Street endorsement. Market Movers Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) is testing an in-house chip for AI systems, sending the stock about 2% higher on the day. Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) is gaining 2.6% on the day after growing subscribers by 24 million in H2 2024. Kohl&#8217;s (NYSE: KSS) stock is among the biggest losers today, falling over 16% on a disappointing profit and revenue outlook. Athletic apparel company Nike (NYSE: NKE) stock is falling 2% today despite a positive analyst note. Barclays analysts consider NKE stock an &#8220;equal weight&#8221; rating, saying that the &#8220;fundamental bottom&#8221; is near. Nike reports its quarterly results later this month.
