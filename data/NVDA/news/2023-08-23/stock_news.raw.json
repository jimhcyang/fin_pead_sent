    "text": "As a former Nvidia Corporation investor, I recently sold my position due to concerns about valuation and supply chain risks, which are often overlooked amidst market trends. This reinforces a core principle of my investment philosophy. My in-depth Discounted Cash Flow analysis sheds light on the current conundrum surrounding Nvidia's stock. Even under optimistic assumptions, the current valuation leaves little room for substantial upside. In my article, I explore supply-chain integration and geopolitical challenges for Nvidia, and I also discuss the rationale behind valuation discounts for companies in the chip realm and why it also warrants caution for those who depend on it.",
