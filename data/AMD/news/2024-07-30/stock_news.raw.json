    "text": "Despite last week's massive 18% dip, AMD's stock remains overvalued. The premium doesn't seem justified as the company continues to struggle against Nvidia. The stock's likely overvaluation is evident from insiders selling throughout the last 12 months, including aggressive sales by the CEO in the past 6 months. AMD's performance across key P&L metrics in the next three quarters is expected to lag behind Nvidia, allowing Nvidia to amass more resources for increased R&D spending.",
