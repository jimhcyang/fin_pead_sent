Furthermore, the MI400 in 2026 will support another growth cycle. For Q3, AMD management guided $8.7B revenue (±$300M) and 54% non-GAAP gross margin. The Street's projections sit at $8.75B and $1.17 EPS, with focus squarely on the MI350 momentum. Key risk is China: MI308 exports effectively removed from Q3 guidance, with an $800M charge pressuring margins. I believe China won't materially help this year, despite licenses already being granted.",
