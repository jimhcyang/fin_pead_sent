A tech malaise fueled by Google parent Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) and chipmaker AMD (Nasdaq: AMD) is pressuring the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 moderately lower while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is eking out a gain. The tech malaise can be blamed on Alphabet’s steep 8% drop, owing to a revenue shortfall coupled on top of an aggressive AI spending plan that didn’t sit well with Wall Street. AMD stock, a member of the Nasdaq Composite, is currently down 9% as of mid-morning. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) shares are down in sympathy ahead of the company’s earnings report after the closing bell tomorrow. Key Points Tech is weighing on the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is eking out modest gains. Google parent Alphabet stock is sinking 8% on aggressive AI capex plans despite a revenue miss. AMD shares are down a steep 9% on weak data center results, but Wall Street says the quarter was “better than feared.” Amazon shares are down in sympathy ahead of the company’s quarterly results on Thursday. Despite selling pressure the S&amp;P 500 is managing to hover above the key 6,000 level, buoyed by stocks like Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) with a 4% gain and trucking company Old Dominion Freight Line (Nasdaq: ODFL) with a 6% jump in response to earnings. On the economic front, the economy appears to be humming as the workforce added a higher than expected 183,000 private payrolls in January, fueled by service providers, while wages rose, according to ADP data. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: up 38.57 (+0.09%) Nasdaq Composite: down 78.77 (-0.41%) S&amp;P 500: down 7.76 (-0.13%) Tech Earnings Roundup Alphabet’s Q4 revenue missed consensus estimates while the company has earmarked a whopping $75 billion in AI capex, including the development of data centers, amid fierce competitive headwinds from the U.S. and China. Google’s YouTube was another drag as its ad revenue slowed. AMD’s stock is reeling after its data center revenue failed to meet high expectations. It shows how much AI is running the show, as AMD’s top and bottom lines came in better than expected. Wall Street Moves A slew of analysts responded to AMD’s earnings print. Among them, Citi described AMD’s results as “decent” but lacking on AI revenue guidance. Goldman Sachs analysts called the results “better than feared” while the data center performance fell short. As for Alphabet, Goldman Sachs maintains a “buy” rating with a $220 price target, while BofA said, “Street could be underestimating AI Overview benefits for Search monetization in 2025.” Grab Holdings (Nasdaq: GRAB) is down 6% on the heels of a JPMorgan analyst downgrade to a “neutral” rating from “overweight” with a $5.60 price target, saying they are looking to better entry levels on the stock.

The S&amp;P 500 has been buoyed by stocks like Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) while Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) got off to a slower start. President Trump is expected to hold a news conference on reciprocal tariffs this afternoon, which should be positive for the auto sector. Tesla is extending its gains in morning trading, rising by nearly 4% after securing a massive $400 million contract from the U.S. government for its armored vehicles. Separately, following Elon Musk’s nearly $100 billion bid for OpenAI, the serial acquirer said he would drop his offer if the company remains in its current structure as a non-profit, according to reports. OpenAI backer Microsoft is trading slightly lower at last check. Here’s a look at market performance as of mid-morning: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 80 points (+0.18) Nasdaq Composite: Up 157.29 points (+0.83%) S&amp;P 500: Up 30.11 points (+0.50) Key Points Stocks are attempting gains out of the gate in the face of hot inflation data. Tesla is a catalyst after the EV maker landed a lucrative government contract. Earnings season rolls on. Market Movers Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is getting a pop, rising almost 2% as of mid-morning. Some insider buying activity could be sparking gains as the company’s chief commercial officer scooped up $500,000 worth of shares in his first purchase in years. Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) continues its bullish run with an impressive 8% gain on the day. The stock hasn’t put on a show like this in over 20 years. Robinhood (Nasdaq: HOOD) stock is racing ahead by a double-digit percentage on strong earnings including a whopping 700% y-o-y increase in cryptocurrency revenue. Analyst firm Baird is reportedly bullish on energy services play GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV), saying the company is well positioned to meet growing energy demand. Baird analysts started coverage of the stock with an “outperform” rating and $448 price target attached. The stock is up 1.5% today. Casino operator MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) is soaring about 14% on the day, buoyed by a strong earnings print, further buoyed by China and a rosy forecast. Hertz (Nasdaq: HTZ) shares are sinking in response to weaker-than-expected quarterly results, including a wider loss than anticipated. The stock is down over 4%, owing to its failed push into electric vehicles for which it featured Teslas.

(NASDAQ: NVDA) was mostly flat on Tuesday, losing -0.58% after a strong five-day stretch that has seen the stock rise 9.10%. That has been welcome news to investors who endured the AI sell-off that hit the market in January amid news of low-cost Chinese competitor DeepSeek, which resulted in the company shedding nearly $600 billion from its market cap — by far the largest single-day value wipeout in market history. Year-to-date, NVDA remains down -3.98%. Investors will want to mark Feb. 26 on their calendars, when the company will announce its Q4 earnings. Last month, the stock got a bump from President Trump’s announcement that his administration is planning major AI infrastructure investments, which suggests a willingness for the new administration to work alongside Big Tech companies to expand the use of the technology. That continued the momentum from Jan. 5 when NVIDIA announced that it is hosting its first-ever “Quantum Day” at GTC 2025. The event will focus on exploring advancements in quantum computing. It will include expert discussions, a keynote address from CEO Jensen Huang, developer sessions, hands-on training and other special addresses. Over the past few years, AI has consistently fueled the largest gains for the market. And one company in particular is at the vanguard: NVIDIA. NVIDIA is the premier manufacturer of components critical to the surge in AI; namely, semiconductors, microchips, and graphics processing units (GPUs). As a result, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has seen its stock skyrocket in the recent past. Since the first day the market opened in 2023, shares have gained nearly 809%, and in the decade from August 2014 to the present, they are up a preposterous 33,951%. Despite those mind-boggling gains, analysts still expect enormous upside potential in the medium and long term. 24/7 Wall Street has performed analysis to provide prospective investors and current shareholders with an idea of where NVIDIA’s stock might be headed over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: NVIDIA’s track record of strong earnings suggests an ability to remain at the forefront of its industry, as competitors fight for the leftovers. Between NVIDIA’s client list of Magnificent Seven companies and the burgeoning trend in AI, growth in both revenue and net income is projected to continue its steep climb.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. NVIDIA’s Recent Stock Success Unless you have been living under a rock, chances are you have caught wind of the very well-documented and rather exponential surge in NVIDIA’s share price since 2022. But before 2022’s price-per-share explosion, it was steadily appreciating as it underwent a series of stock splits. Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $0.51 $4.130 $0.588 2015 $0.82 $4.681 $0.800 2016 $2.67 $5.010 $0.929 2017 $4.88 $6.910 $1.851 2018 $3.24 $9.714 $3.085 2019 $5.98 $11.716 $4.143 2020 $13.06 $10.918 $3.580 2021 $29.64 $16.675 $6.277 2022 $14.61 $26.914 $11.259 2023 $49.52 $26.974 $8.366 *Post-split adjusted basis **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, NVIDIA’s revenue grew by more than 553% while its net income increased by just over 1,323%. The company experienced a slight contraction in revenue and net income in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it rebounded soundly the following year and has continued to steadily grow both metrics since. Meanwhile, shares were able to increase by 9,610% from 2014 to 2023. As the AI lynchpin looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of NVIDIA’s Stock Performance Stronghold on the GPU Industry: No one makes GPUs like Nvidia makes GPUs, and the industry demanding them is well aware of that. While semiconductor competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) do command some attention in their respective corners of the market, simply comparing the three companies’ market caps demonstrates the discrepancies between NVIDIA and, well, every other company. While Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have respectable market caps of $194.67 billion and $861.41 billion, respectively, those are dwarfed by NVIDIA’s $3.34 trillion. Demand From Unrivaled Tech Customers: The company’s primary clientele are the other members of the Magnificent Seven, which are leading the way forward in the AI revolution. In fact, only four Big Tech rival companies — Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) — account for 40% of NVIDIA’s revenue as they vie with one another to become the front runner of the transition to generative AI. The AI Trend Is Just Getting Started: According to Grand View Research, the market size of AI in 2023 was $196.63 billion. As large as that seems, it pales in comparison to where the market is headed. From 2024 to 2030, it is expected that the industry will grow at an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6%, with “continuous research and innovation directed by tech giants that are driving adoption of advanced technologies in industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing,” according to Grand View Research’s report. NVIDIA (NVDA) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus one-year price target for NVIDIA, according to analysts, is $178.84, which represents a nearly 34.66% potential upside over the next 12 months based on the current share price of $132.80. Of all the analysts covering NVIDIA, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.3 ‘Strong Buy’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). However, by the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast projects shares of NVIDIA to be trading for $137.50 based on a projected EPS of $2.75 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50, with a best-case scenario of $192.50 per share and a worst-case scenario of $82.50 per share. NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue* Net Income* EPS 2025 $121.255 $68.392 $2.75 2026 $168.151 $95.246 $3.83 2027 $193.852 $108.182 $4.44 2028 $225.462 $130.155 $5.28 2029 $236.498 $152.001 $6.16 2030 $265.522 $175.412 $7.24 *Revenue and net income in $billions How NVIDIA’s Next Five Years Could Play Out NVIDIA Stock Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates that NVIDIA’s stock will be trading for $362.00, good for a 163% increase over today’s share price, based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 50. Our high-end price target is $506.80 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 70. Meanwhile, our low-end price target is $217.20 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 30.
