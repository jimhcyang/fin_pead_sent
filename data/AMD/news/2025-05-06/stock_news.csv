Now the markets are gearing up to process quarterly earnings results from Ford (NYSE: F), whose stock fell 1.2% during regular market hours. Automakers have had a target on their backs for tariffs, and the markets will be looking for greater clarity on any impacts in Ford&#8217;s performance. Here&#8217;s how the major indices finished the day: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 69.52 (-0.17%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 132.40 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 36.79 (-0.66%) America First Economy 12:38 pm by Gerelyn Terzo U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is speaking at the Milken conference today, addressing global investors about President Trump&#8217;s economic agenda. As part of his America First vision, President Trump is looking to make the U.S. economy more appealing to investors amid a strategy involving tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation &#8211; oh my. While the markets await further details on trade talk progress, the three major stock market averages are mixed, including a slight gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain lower. Tariff Uncertainty Remains 11:36 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Dow Jones Industrial Average has turned higher, managing a 7-point gain after starting the session in the red. Meanwhile, technology stocks continue to weigh on the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. According to TD Cowen, tariff-related price hikes are set to rear their heads in May&#8217;s inflation print. Much of the tariff damage will unfold in the summer months as lower-priced inventories dwindle at businesses. The firm says consumers are between a rock and a hard place as tariff-related costs trickle down to them, a situation exacerbated by higher shipping costs. Selling Eases 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure this morning but are off their lowest levels of the session. Netflix (Nasdaq; NFLX) shares are off about 2% on the day after last week&#8217;s rally. ON Semi (Nasdaq: ON) is falling 8% on the day after reporting its Q1 results, while industry peer Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is gaining 2%. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand with the broader market averages: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 53.67 (-0.16%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 97.38 (-0.55%) S&amp;P 500: Down 30.46 (-0.52%) After a week of gains, fear has settled into the markets once again amid a bevy of catalysts. In addition to earnings, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell set to comment on the economy this week, suggesting it could be yet another roller coaster ride for investors. First-quarter earnings season continues to roll on, with names like Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) as well as Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Diamondback Energy (Nasdaq: FANG) on the docket in the coming days. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red out of the gate, including a 1% decline in the Nasdaq Composite.

Recently, it has traded down only 7% for the year. It has only been a quarter of a century since the last market wipeout. The Nasdaq dropped 75% from March 2000 to October 2002. Most of the reason was the .com companies had raised too much money as their losses mounted, and the value of their business models was viewed as unsustainable. Key Points The Market Could Drop 50% Trillions Of Dollars Would Disappear Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The most notable part of the market crash was that it destroyed company stocks with strong business models that are today&#8217;s market titans, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). When the market imploded, Microsoft’s market cap dropped 65%. If the market dropped 75% today, the Nasdaq would collapse from 17,100 to 4,475, and its market value would collapse by $23 trillion, hammering the wealth of many Americans. It is worth noting that the 2000 to 2022 Nasdaq market collapse was not accompanied by a significant recession. GDP fell only .3% in that period, and unemployment rose to 5.5%. That is hardly a recession at all. One of the first signs of a new, sharp market drop is that stocks in the AI craze have started to crater. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), considered the No. 2 AI chip maker, traded at $227 in March last year. A few weeks ago, it dropped to $88 and has since recovered to $102. Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) reached $125 in February last year. It dropped to $74 early last month, a 40% drop. It recently moved up to $117. What is critical about Palantir and AMD is that they are remarkably healthy companies with growing revenue and what appear to be successful models, unlike the .com companies of 2000 and 2002. Nevertheless, their shares collapsed. If there is a massive market sell-off, it would happen for one of two reasons. The first is that the huge bet on AI falters. It could. Companies could get “out over their skis.” Meta (NASDAQ: META) says it will invest $50 billion to $75 billion in AI this year. Microsoft has pegged its investment at $80 billion for the same period. AI is supposed to change the world. Many public companies with prospects driven by AI investments are supposed to have tremendous revenue growth unless they don’t. The other threat to the market is hyperinflation. Inflation rose to 14% in 1979. If there is a similar problem this year, it will be because of tariffs, which could be as high as 100% on Chinese goods. The inflationary problem would ripple across the US economy in months. Sixty percent of US adults own stocks. That statistic says everything.

AMD Up 5% in Mid-Day Trading 1:07 pm by Joel South Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is up 5.3% shortly after 1 p.m. ET. AI stocks across the board are seeing market-beating gains today. NVIDIA is up 3.7% while infrastructure stocks like Vertiv are also seeing gains. Still, AMD&#8217;s gain is higher than most stocks thanks to the announcement of its deal with Humain as well as its $6 billion share buyback. Looking to the back half of 2025, whether or not AMD can outperform the market largely depends on whether it can continue making inroads as companies continue spending more on inferencing, and also whether it can diversify its customer base. The deals announced this week with Saudi Arabia have led to significant gains for AI stocks because they demonstrate a path to AI companies reducing their reliance on hyperscalers for revenue. Advanced Micro Devices Just Announced a $6 Billion Buyback 10:09 am At the moment, Advanced Micro Devices is up 5.7%, or by $6.50 to $118.86. From here, we’d like to see the tech giant test $125 initially. Fueling upside, the trade war with China is finally cooling. Second, the company just partnered with Saudi Arabia’s AI company, Humain, in a $10 billion deal. AMD also just announced a $6 billion stock buyback program. As noted by Yahoo Finance, “Shares of the chip company jumped nearly 7% on the news that the board has approved that $6 billion share repurchase plan. Represents about 3.3% of the company&#8217;s current market value, according to data from Bloomberg. The new authorization in addition to the remaining balance from their last authorization of about $4 billion. What that means, the total current repurchase authorization of about $10 billion.” The Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock is set to open even higher when markets open today. At the moment, shares of AMD are up about 3.3%, or $3.74. That’s because of two key catalysts. First, the trade war with China is finally cooling, at least for the next 90 days. That should remove a good deal of uncertainty from tech stocks, like AMD. Second, the company just partnered with Saudi Arabia’s AI company, Humain, in a $10 billion deal. As noted by Wedbush, “We believe the market opportunity in Saudi Arabia could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming years and this dynamic is not being priced into the market and tech names in our view”. Analysts are Calling for AMD to Challenge $200 Analysts at DZ Bank just reiterated a buy rating on AMD with a $200 price target. All thanks to blowout earnings. EPS of 96 cents beat by three cents. Revenue of $7.44 billion, up 36% year over, beat estimates by $320 million. Data Center revenue jumped 57% year-over-year to $3.7 billion thanks to its MI300 AI accelerator and its Instinct and EPYC processors. Revenue from the Client and Gaming segment, which houses AMD&#8217;s PC business, was up 28% year-over-year to $2.8 billion. Client revenue was $2.3B, up 68% year-over-year, while gaming revenue tumbled 30% year-over-year to $647 million. Analysts expected EPS of 94 cents on revenues of $7.12 billion. Analysts at Bank of America just raised its price target by $10 to $130 a share.
