And one company in particular is at the vanguard: NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA). NVIDIA is the premier manufacturer of components critical to the surge in AI; namely, semiconductors, microchips, and graphics processing units (GPUs).ca As a result, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has seen its stock skyrocket in the recent past. Since the first day the market opened in 2023, shares have gained 894.25%, and in the decade from August 2014 to present, they are up a preposterous 30806.38%. In June 2024, NVIDIA underwent its sixth stock split, further fueling demand for its shares as the company surged upward and is now the second largest by market cap. Despite those mind-boggling gains, analysts still expect enormous upside potential in the medium and long term. 24/7 Wall Street has performed analysis to provide prospective investors and current shareholders with an idea of where NVIDIA’s stock might be headed over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: NVIDIA’s track record of strong earnings suggests an ability to remain at the forefront of its industry, as competitors fight for the leftovers. Between NVIDIA’s client list of Magnificent Seven companies and the burgeoning trend in AI, growth in both revenue and net income is projected to continue its steep climb.

NVIDIA News and Updates 11/12/2024 Nvidia’s stock price increased today following a positive analyst report from Mizuho. The firm raised its price target for the company to $165 from $140. This bullish sentiment has contributed to Nvidia’s stock price nearing recent record highs. 11/11/2024 Melius Research increased its price target for Nvidia to $185.00 (previously $165.00), with a “Buy” rating on the stock. 11/8/2024 Nvidia has officially joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Nvidia’s stock price has risen by about 9% this week, surpassing Apple as the world’s most valuable company. 11/7/2024 The Federal Reserve delivered a 25 basis point interest rate cut today, bringing its benchmark rate down to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The market reacted positively to the news, with shares of Nvidia hitting new all-time highs. 11/6/2024 Several stocks surged on Wall Street today following the U.S. presidential election. Nvidia hit a record high, solidifying its position as the world’s most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.58 trillion. 11/5/2024 Nvidia has claimed its position as the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, surpassing Apple. This surge in valuation is the result of an unprecedented demand for the company’s high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential for powering artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. 11/4/2024 Nvidia will be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Dow Inc. (DOW), effective before the market opens on November 8th. 11/1/2024 Nvidia is developing a new type of chip that combines both a CPU and a GPU on a single chip. This new chip is designed to power consumer PCs, competing directly with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X series. 10/31/2024 Nvidia’s stock price decreased 4% today. The decrease follows the European Commission’s announcement that the company’s proposed acquisition of AI startup Run requires EU antitrust clearance due to potential competition concerns. 10/29/2024 Nvidia has introduced enterprise reference architectures (RAs) to assist businesses in streamlining their infrastructure strategies. These RAs serve as blueprints to help Nvidia’s partners and their customers construct “AI factories”, high-performance data centers optimized for AI workloads. NVIDIA’s Recent Stock Success Unless you have been living under a rock, chances are you have caught wind of the very well-documented and rather exponential surge in NVIDIA’s share price since 2022. But before 2022’s price-per-share explosion, it was steadily appreciating as it underwent a series of stock splits. Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $0.51 $4.130 $0.588 2015 $0.82 $4.681 $0.800 2016 $2.67 $5.010 $0.929 2017 $4.88 $6.910 $1.851 2018 $3.24 $9.714 $3.085 2019 $5.98 $11.716 $4.143 2020 $13.06 $10.918 $3.580 2021 $29.64 $16.675 $6.277 2022 $14.61 $26.914 $11.259 2023 $49.52 $26.974 $8.366 *Post-split adjusted basis **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, NVIDIA’s revenue grew by more than 553% while its net income increased by just over 1,323%. The company experienced a slight contraction in revenue and net income in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it rebounded soundly the following year and has continued to steadily grow both metrics since. Meanwhile, shares were able to increase by 9,610% from 2014 to 2023. As the AI lynchpin looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of NVIDIA’s Stock Performance Stronghold on the GPU Industry: No one makes GPUs like Nvidia makes GPUs, and the industry demanding them is well aware of that. While semiconductor competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) do command some attention in their respective corners of the market, simply comparing the three companies’ market caps demonstrates the discrepancies between NVIDIA and, well, every other company. While Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have respectable market caps of $233.04 billion and $858.30 billion, respectively, those are dwarfed by NVIDIA’s $3.65 trillion. Demand From Unrivaled Tech Customers: The company’s primary clientele are the other members of the Magnificent Seven, which are leading the way forward in the AI revolution. In fact, only four Big Tech rival companies — Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) — account for 40% of NVIDIA’s revenue as they vie with one another to become the front runner of the transition to generative AI. The AI Trend Is Just Getting Started: According to Grand View Research, the market size of AI in 2023 was $196.63 billion. As large as that seems, it pales in comparison to where the market is headed. From 2024 to 2030, it is expected that the industry will grow at an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6%, with “continuous research and innovation directed by tech giants [that] are driving adoption of advanced technologies in industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing,” according to Grand View Research’s report. NVIDIA (NVDA) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for NVIDIA, according to analysts, is $150.00, which represents a nearly 3.26% potential upside over the next 12 months based on the current share price of $145.26. Of all the analysts covering NVIDIA, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.3 ‘Buy’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). However, by the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast projects shares of NVIDIA to be trading for $137.50 based on a projected EPS of $2.75 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50, with a best-case scenario of $192.50 per share and a worst-case scenario of $82.50 per share.

That would result in a share price of $137.50, or -5.34% higher than where the stock is currently trading. Our high-end price target is $192.50, while our low-end price target is $82.50. When 2026 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA’s revenue to be $168.151 billion resulting in a net income of $95.246 billion.

Our high-end price target is $268.10, while our low-end price target is $114.90. When 2027 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA’s revenue to be $193.85 billion resulting in a net income of $108.182 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $222.00, representing a gain of 52.83% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $310.80, while our low-end price target is $133.20. When 2028 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA’s revenue to be $225.462 billion resulting in a net income of $130.155 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $264.00, representing a gain of 81.74% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $369.60, while our low-end price target is $158.40. When 2029 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA’s revenue to be $236.498 billion resulting in a net income of $152.001 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $308.00, representing a gain of 112.03% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $431.20, while our low-end price target is $184.40. NVIDIA Stocks Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates that NVIDIA’s stock will be trading for $362.00, good for a 149.21% increase over today’s share price, based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 50. Our high-end price target is $506.80 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 70. Meanwhile, our low-end price target is $217.20 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 30.

Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI) is one of those companies. The San Jose, Calif.-based tech firm specializes in high-performance and high-efficiency servers, but it also provides software solutions as well as storage systems for data centers and enterprises focusing on cloud computing, AI, 5G, and edge computing. Nonetheless, analysts expect big upside potential for the tech stock. Hindsight is 20/20, and all that matters now is how Super Micro Computer will perform going forward. So 24/7 Wall Street has performed analysis to provide investors — and potential investors — with an idea of where shares of SMCI could be headed over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: Super Micro Computer’s future stock performance is being bolstered by explosive demand in the IT services industry. SMCI is shrinking its margins to increase production capacity to meet demand.

Super Micro Computer News and Analysis 11/12/2024 Super Micro Computer is racing to secure a new auditor after Ernst &amp; Young’s sudden resignation. However, there are few potential firms capable of auditing a company of its size, and an auditor must be secured by the November 16th deadline to avoid delisting from the Nasdaq stock exchange. 11/8/2024 Super Micro Computer’s stock price dropped by 3.1% today, reaching as low as $23.76. Trading volume was also significantly lower than average. 11/7/2024 A new lawsuit alleges that Super Micro Computer executives misled investors with false claims about the company’s financial health. The suit claims that these misleading statements were made before a short seller exposed potential accounting irregularities. 11/6/2024 Super Micro Computer experienced a huge 20% decline in its share price today. This sharp drop was triggered by investor concerns that the company might face delisting from the Nasdaq exchange. 11/5/2024 Super Micro Computer has announced its preliminary financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. The company expects net sales to be between $5.9 billion and $6.0 billion, falling short of its previous forecast of $6.0 billion to $7.0 billion. 11/4/2024 Super Micro Computer is set to provide a business update on Tuesday, but market attention is primarily focused on the company’s potential delisting from the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. Despite this, the company’s stock price increased by 5.6% today. 11/1/2024 Super Micro Computer is at risk of being removed from the Nasdaq Stock Exchange following the sudden resignation of its auditor, Ernst &amp; Young. The company has been given a deadline of November 16th to submit a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing rules. 10/31/2024 Yesterday, Ernst &amp; Young resigned as Super Micro Computer’s auditor, leading to a 33% drop in the company’s stock price. Today, SMCI’s stock price continued to decline an additional 16%. 10/29/2024 Super Micro Computer’s stock price increased by 2.2% today, reaching a high of $48.70. 10/24/2024 Super Micro Computer’s share price increased 3.6% and traded as high as $47.24 during mid-day trading today. Super Micro Computer’s Recent Stock Success Shares of SMCI have been particularly rewarding to shareholders in the recent past, as they exploded by gaining 3,096% in the five years between August 2019 and August 2024. The following table summarizes Super Micro Computer’s share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2023: Year Share Price (pre-split) Revenues* Net Income* 2014 $36.39 $1.467 $.054 2015 $24.66 $1.954 $.092 2016 $28.05 $2.225 $.072 2017 $20.93 $2.484 $.067 2018 $13.90 $3.360 $.046 2019 $24.65 $3.500 $.072 2020 $31.66 $3.339 $.084 2021 $43.95 $3.557 $.112 2022 $82.19 $5.196 $.285 2023 $284.26 $7.123 $.640 *Revenue and net income in $billions In the last decade, Super Micro Computer’s revenue grew by more than 385% while its net income increased by just over 1,085%. Despite seeing a minor revenue contraction in 2020 with a decrease of 4.6%, shares of SMCI still managed to increase year-over-year on still-growing net income. As the IT services provider looks forward to the second half of the decade, we have identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance. Key Drivers of Super Micro Computer’s Stock Performance Enormous Industry Growth: According to Statista, global revenues generated by the IT services industry are $1.420 trillion. Looking forward, that figure is forecast to balloon to $1.879 trillion worldwide by the end of 2029, which is good for a market increase of 32.32%. Most of this growth will be driven by demand for services and solutions that support AI, but other drivers include digital transformation and cloud IT infrastructure — both of which are major business segments for Super Micro Computer. The company has a global reach, with more than half of its revenue being produced from outside of the U.S., meaning it will play a central role in meeting that global growth demand. Shrinking Margins to Increase AI Production Capacity: Super Micro Computer finished the fiscal year 2024 with a sizable reduction in its margins. And while that would usually be interpreted negatively by investors, it makes perfect sense for the company. In 2024, gross margins shrink to 14.2% from 18.1% in fiscal 2023. The main driver is increasing production of its server solutions to deploy AI graphics processing units (GPUs) — like those produced by tech behemoths NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). As a result, the company is positioning itself for growth alongside increased demand for GPUs, which ultimately will cause NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices’ successes to trickle down to Super Micro Computer. Most recently, 70% of SMCI’s revenue was from sales of its GPU server solutions for AI implementation. The market for direct liquid cooling (DLC) servers — which Super Micro Computer provides — is expected to grow from $5 billion in 2024 to $21 billion in 2029. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for Super Micro Computer is $65.00, which represents a nearly 179.81% potential upside over the next 12 months based on the current share price of $23.23. Of all the analysts covering Super Micro Computer, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 2.38 ‘Outperform’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month forecast projects Super Micro Computer’s stock price to be $68.34 based on a projected EPS of $3.35 in 2025. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue* Net Income* EPS 2025 $28.265 $1.974 $3.35 2026 $31.634 $2.548 $4.31 2027 $37.116 $1.458 $5.49 2028 $42.631 $1.881 $6.76 2029 $50.154 $2.428 $8.49 2030 $59.005 $3.134 $10.62 *Revenue and net income in $billions How Super Micro Computer’s Next 5 Years Could Play Out At the end of 2025, we expect to see revenue, net income, and EPS rise by 89.16%, 63.41%, and 70.08%, respectively. That would result in a per share price of $683.40 (or $68.34 on a post-split-adjusted basis), which is 2841.89% higher than where the stock is currently trading. When 2026 concludes, we estimate the price of SMCI to be $798.66 (or $79.87 on a post-split-adjusted basis), which is 3338.05% higher than where shares are trading today. This is based on modest revenue gains, an assumed EPS of $44.37, and a healthy projected P/E ratio of 18. At the conclusion of 2027, we forecast a sizable jump in the stock price to $861.28 (or $86.13 on a post-split-adjusted basis) driven by $37.116 billion in revenue and $1.458 billion in net income, which will result in shares trading for 3607.62% higher than the current share price. By the end of 2028, we expect to see shares trading for $1041.04 (or $101.40 on a post-split-adjusted basis), or 4381.45% higher than the stock is trading for today on revenues of $42.631 billion, net income of $1.881 billion, and an EPS of $67.60.
