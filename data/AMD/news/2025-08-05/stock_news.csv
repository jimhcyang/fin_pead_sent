Analysts at Oppenheimer just reiterated a Perform rating on Apple ahead of earnings, noting, “We take a neutral view into AAPL’s F3Q25 earnings. We expect investors to focus on the revenue outlook for F4Q25 after normalizing the potential FX tailwind, Services revenue growth, and the sales trend in Greater China.” Citi analysts reiterated a buy rating on Coinbase, with a price target of $505 from $270. The firm noted the company has seen several catalysts recently. That includes the GENIUS Act, the House passage of the CLARITY Act, and its addition to the S&amp;P 500 index.

Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore on Wednesday raised his Marvell price target by about 10% to $80 while maintaining an “equal weight” rating. “Marvell is firmly in the AI winners camp, and sentiment has swung aggressively negative compared to a few months ago,” Moore wrote. “We are more excited for their opportunity in optical, which brings higher margin and durability vs. their ASIC opportunity, which has disappointed.” (ASIC refers to application-specific integrated circuit, a class of customizable chip that combines several circuits to perform tasks that would otherwise require multiple interconnected chips.) Marvell shares were up more than 9% in recent trading, making it the best-performing stock in the Nasdaq 100. Despite Wednesday's gain, Marvell shares are down about 23% since the start of the year. Marvell is just one of several semiconductor stocks Moore expects to benefit from strong AI demand over the next year. He also raised his 12-month price targets on Nvidia (NVDA) by 17%, Broadcom (AVGO) by 25%, Astera Labs (ALAB) by 26%, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) by more than 50%. All of those stocks were also trading in the green on Wednesday. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) “While stock prices have moved higher, our conviction on AI spend durability in 2026 continues to grow,” Moore wrote. Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) last week raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast, citing the need to accelerate data center buildouts to meet seemingly insatiable demand for AI and cloud computing. Investors will get more updates on the strength of AI investment after markets close on Wednesday when tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) report earnings.

Nasdaq up 300 at the Open 9:54 am Despite a poor outing on Friday, the Nasdaq just opened 300 points higher. All as investors attempt to shake off trade war and job uncertainty. The Dow Jones is up 340. The S&amp;P 500 is up 61. Gold prices are up by $13.82 at $3,381.98. Oil is down $1.70 at $65.63. Shares of Tesla Are Racing Higher in Pre-Market 8:58 am Shares of Tesla (TSLA) are accelerating on news that the company just approved a compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, which consists of 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at about $29 billion. On Semiconductor is down after issuing third-quarter guidance of 54 cents to 64 cents, with analysts expecting 58 cents. The lower end of the expected revenue of $1.465 billion to $1.565 billion also fell short of estimates of $1.50 billion. Bank of America Reiterated a Buy Rating on Nvidia 8:44 am After dropping late last week on jobs growth and tariff concerns, the Nasdaq is turning aggressively higher in the pre-market. At the moment, it’s up 188 points at 23,073.75 Bank of America just reiterated its buy rating on Nvidia, noting it sees a strong beat/raise when it posts earnings later this month. UBS just initiated a buy rating on Pony AI with a price target of $20. Evercore ISI reiterated an outperform rating on Amazon, noting, “We reiterate our Outperform on AMZN in the wake of our proprietary research into Alexa+, Amazon’s AI Agent currently being rolled out to its Echo platform devices. We have tested Alexa+ on and off for two weeks now and have run our own proprietary survey of 1,350 current Smart Device owners,” as quoted by CNBC. Markets were doing well until the latest tariffs and a slowdown in jobs created uncertainty. Non-farm payrolls came in at 73,000 with prior months revised lower. With the latest numbers, investors are digesting what it could mean for interest rates. At the moment, investors are betting on reduced chances for a September cut. Unfortunately, the probability of a September fell to 40%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. With tariffs, Trump signed an executive order that modified reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, with updated duties ranging from 10% to 41%. It’s why the Dow dropped 542 points on Friday, why the S&amp;P 500 shed 101, and why the NASDAQ lost 472 points. This morning, in an attempt to brush off the negativity, the major indices are exploding in the pre-market. The Dow Jones is up about 192. The S&amp;P 500 is up about 35, as the NASDAQ tacks on about 174 points. It’ll be interesting to see if they can hold the gains – especially with the latest tariffs, the potential for a worsening trade war, and jobs. We also have to consider that August is historically a weak month for the Dow, heading back to 1988, according to CNBC. It’s the second-worst month for the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. Key Earnings are on Deck Key earnings from Palantir, Disney, McDonald’s, Advanced Micro Devices, and Eli Lilly will also help decide the markets’ direction. This morning, Tyson Foods posted better-than-expected earnings. EPS of 91 cents was above expectations of 80 cents. Revenue of $13.88 billion was also above the estimates of $13.54 billion. It also raised its revenue guidance for the full year, expecting an increase in production for certain meat products like chicken. Berkshire Hathaway saw a year-over-year decline in operating earnings, which fell 4% to $11.16 billion. All thanks to week insurance writing. Warren Buffett also warned that steep tariffs would hurt its business. &#8220;The pace of changes in these events, including tensions from developing international trade policies and tariffs, accelerated through the first six months of 2025,&#8221; Berkshire said in its earnings report. &#8220;Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events.&#8221; OPEC+ Just Agreed to Raise Oil Production OPEC+ just agreed to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September. This is the latest in a series of accelerated output hikes to regain market share, especially with concerns mounting over potential supply disruptions linked to Russia. “Given fairly strong oil prices at around $70, it does give OPEC+ some confidence about market fundamentals,&#8221; said Amrita Sen, co-founder of Energy Aspects, adding that the market structure was also indicating tight stocks, as quoted by CNBC.

Morgan Stanley Just Ugraded Apple 8:55 am Morgan Stanley just reiterated its overweight rating on Apple, noting that the tech giant is well-positioned after the latest tariff news from President Trump. According to the firm, as quoted by CNBC, “Apple’s commitment to investing an added $100B in the U.S. &#8211; mind you, with zero new major final assembly/production in the U.S. &#8211; means Apple is entirely exempt from Section 232 tariffs. Therefore, for Apple, tariff rates should get no worse, which is a much better-than-feared outcome.” Goldman Sachs Just Hiked Nvidia Price Target Ahead of Earnings 8:29 am Goldman Sachs just raised its price target on NVDA to $200 from $185, with a buy rating. As noted by CNBC, “Analyst James Schneider said that even though investor expectations are high heading into fiscal second-quarter results at the end of August, the chipmaker should have no trouble rising to the occasion.” In premarket, NVDA is now up about $2.45 a share to $181.81. Futures are racing even higher. Just days after tariff news and jobs data sank the markets, the major indices are exploding. At the moment, the Dow is up 250 points. The S&amp;P 500 is up about 41, with the NASDAQ up another 190 points to 23,610. All thanks to President Trump’s new chip tariffs that include broad exemptions. Announced last night, the President said there would be a 100% tariff on imported chips. However, that will not apply to companies building chips in the U.S. All of which positively impacted Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and ETFs such as the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH). Helping even more, Apple is up about 2.6% in premarket after announcing it would invest $100 billion more in U.S. companies and suppliers over the next four years. That’s on top of the $500 billion commitment Apple made earlier this year. “We’re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said, as quoted by CNBC. “But the good news for companies like Apple is if you’re building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge.” With the 2025 NFL Season Weeks Away, Gambling Stocks are Gaining Momentum Ahead of the 2025 NFL season, gambling stocks, like DraftKings (DKNG) are exploding higher. In 2024, the American Gaming Association said Americans were expected to spend about $35 billion on NFL games this year. That’s up from the $26.7 billion wagered a year prior. At the time, as noted by CBS Sports, “The NFL remains king, and more money is wagered on the NFL than any other league. The NFL also attracts six-figure wages (and sometimes seven-figure wagers) on a regular basis throughout the season.” From its August 2024 low of $31.26, DKNG ran to a high of about $45.72. The RoundHill Sports Betting &amp; iGaming ETF (BETZ) ran from an August 2024 low of about $16.30 to a high of $20.50. Shares of Flutter Entertainment (FLUT) ran from an August 2024 low of about $175.60 to a high of $283.45. With regards to DKNG, its stock is up after posting better-than-expected earnings and reiterated its full-year outlook. Its EPS of 38 cents missed by three cents. However, revenue of $1.51 billion, up 37.3% year over year, beat by $80 million. &#8220;We set records for revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, driven by an acceleration in revenue growth to 37% year-over-year,&#8221; said CEO Jason Robins. &#8220;We are pleased to be maintaining our fiscal year 2025 guidance, with revenue expected to be closer to the high end of our range, highlighting the strength of our platform as we prepare for an exciting new state launch.” The post Nasdaq Composite Live: This is Why the Index is Still Exploding Higher appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/08/07/nasdaq-composite-live-this-is-why-the-index-still-exploding-higher/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/nasdaq-composite-live-this-is-why-the-index-is-20250807.jpg

AMD,2025-08-05,2025-07-29,2025-08-19,AMD,,2025-08-12 12:00:16,2025-08-12T12:00:16-04:00,2025-08-12,Nasdaq Composite Live: Futures Tick Higher Ahead of Key Inflation Data,"Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Wells Fargo just reiterated its overweight rating on Nvidia 9:24 am Wells Fargo just reiterated its overweight rating on Nvidia, raising its price target to $220 ahead of earnings. “With strong intra-qtr demand data points + reports of approved licenses to resume H20 sales into China, we increase our ests (above street) ahead of NVDA’s upcoming (8/27) F2Q26 print,” as quoted by CNBC. This also follows news that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices agreed to give part of their revenue from certain chips sold in China – in exchange for export licenses, as reported by CNBC. “In exchange for 15% of revenues from the chips, the two chipmakers will receive export licenses to sell Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308 chips in China, according to the FT,” as reported by CNBC. Shares of Intel Jump on White House News 8:59 am Shares of Intel jumped about 3% ahead of Intel Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan’s visit to the White House on Monday. This comes just days after President Trump called for his resignation over ties to Chinese businesses. As noted by Fox Business, “A month after Tan was tapped to lead the company, Reuters reported that Tan had invested in hundreds of Chinese companies – some of which had links to the Chinese military. He also invested hundreds of millions in Chinese advanced manufacturing and chip firms between March 2012 and December 2024, Reuters reported. A source told Reuters earlier this year that Tan had divested from his positions, though the extent of his divestitures wasn&#8217;t clear.” The Nasdaq is pushing even higher, as we head into key inflationary data this week. Up about 22 points to 23,735.25, it’s nearing all-time highs. One of the biggest reasons the tech-heavy index isn’t higher is because of news that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices agreed to give part of their revenue from certain chips sold in China – in exchange for export licenses, as reported by CNBC. “In exchange for 15% of revenues from the chips, the two chipmakers will receive export licenses to sell Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308 chips in China, according to the FT,” as reported by CNBC. Still, Wells Fargo believes this will be a positive for Nvidia, raising its price target to $185 with an overweight rating on the stock. “We would assume NVDA can recapture the full $8B/qtr revenue impact the H20 China ban was expected to have on the F2Q26 (July) qtr by F4Q26 (Jan),” analysts added. “We would expect China demand to grow from the $8B/qtr level going forward.” Markets Waiting on Market-Moving Inflation Data Later this week, we’ll also get market-moving inflation data. The consumer price index (CPI) will be released tomorrow. The producer price index (PPI) will be released on Thursday. Both will be critical with what happens with the Federal Reserve and interest rates. JP Morgan Just Raised Its Price Target on CoreWeave This morning, analysts at JPMorgan raised their price target on CRWV heading into earnings after the bell. The firm raised its price target to $145 from $66, with an overweight rating. “Our sense is that CoreWeave’s opportunities are going to get bigger and lumpier, likely to the surprise of investors, though we are not making a specific call on the upcoming Q2 results as it is likely a futile exercise to speculate on the closing of specific deals and investors should in fact expect extreme lumpiness in CoreWeave’s pattern of large bookings,” the analysts said, as also quoted by CNBC. Bitcoin Broke Above $122,000 Earlier Today Exploding even higher, Bitcoin briefly tested $122,000. While it’s pulling back, analysts still believe it could test $125,000 near term. Helping, The White House recently unveiled a 160-page blueprint that’s considered to be “the most comprehensive piece of work on digital assets that’s ever been produced,” as noted by ABC News. With it, the President has ordered his Administration to supercharge the crypto industry, rolling back regulatory blockades, and pushing forward legislation that could broaden the accessibility and appeal of Bitcoin. The White House added, “By implementing these recommendations, policymakers can ensure that the United States leads the blockchain revolution and ushers in the Golden Age of Crypto.” The White House also signed an executive order that will make it easier for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts.
