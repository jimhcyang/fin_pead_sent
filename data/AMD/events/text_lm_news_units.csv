The artificial intelligence-fueled rally has been the foremost contributor to the major market indices’ sizable gains over the past several years. And one company in particular is at the vanguard: NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA). NVIDIA is the premier manufacturer of components critical to the surge in AI; namely, semiconductors, microchips, and graphics processing units (GPUs).ca As a result, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has seen its stock skyrocket in the recent past. Since the first day the market opened in 2023, shares have gained 894.25%, and in the decade from August 2014 to present, they are up a preposterous 30806.38%. In June 2024, NVIDIA underwent its sixth stock split, further fueling demand for its shares as the company surged upward and is now the second largest by market cap. Despite those mind-boggling gains, analysts still expect enormous upside potential in the medium and long term. 24/7 Wall Street has performed analysis to provide prospective investors and current shareholders with an idea of where NVIDIA’s stock might be headed over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: NVIDIA’s track record of strong earnings suggests an ability to remain at the forefront of its industry, as competitors fight for the leftovers. Between NVIDIA’s client list of Magnificent Seven companies and the burgeoning trend in AI, growth in both revenue and net income is projected to continue its steep climb.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. NVIDIA News and Updates 11/12/2024 Nvidia’s stock price increased today following a positive analyst report from Mizuho. The firm raised its price target for the company to $165 from $140. This bullish sentiment has contributed to Nvidia’s stock price nearing recent record highs. 11/11/2024 Melius Research increased its price target for Nvidia to $185.00 (previously $165.00), with a “Buy” rating on the stock. 11/8/2024 Nvidia has officially joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Nvidia’s stock price has risen by about 9% this week, surpassing Apple as the world’s most valuable company. 11/7/2024 The Federal Reserve delivered a 25 basis point interest rate cut today, bringing its benchmark rate down to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The market reacted positively to the news, with shares of Nvidia hitting new all-time highs. 11/6/2024 Several stocks surged on Wall Street today following the U.S. presidential election. Nvidia hit a record high, solidifying its position as the world’s most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.58 trillion. 11/5/2024 Nvidia has claimed its position as the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, surpassing Apple. This surge in valuation is the result of an unprecedented demand for the company’s high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential for powering artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. 11/4/2024 Nvidia will be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Dow Inc. (DOW), effective before the market opens on November 8th. 11/1/2024 Nvidia is developing a new type of chip that combines both a CPU and a GPU on a single chip. This new chip is designed to power consumer PCs, competing directly with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X series. 10/31/2024 Nvidia’s stock price decreased 4% today. The decrease follows the European Commission’s announcement that the company’s proposed acquisition of AI startup Run requires EU antitrust clearance due to potential competition concerns. 10/29/2024 Nvidia has introduced enterprise reference architectures (RAs) to assist businesses in streamlining their infrastructure strategies. These RAs serve as blueprints to help Nvidia’s partners and their customers construct “AI factories”, high-performance data centers optimized for AI workloads. NVIDIA’s Recent Stock Success Unless you have been living under a rock, chances are you have caught wind of the very well-documented and rather exponential surge in NVIDIA’s share price since 2022. But before 2022’s price-per-share explosion, it was steadily appreciating as it underwent a series of stock splits. Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $0.51 $4.130 $0.588 2015 $0.82 $4.681 $0.800 2016 $2.67 $5.010 $0.929 2017 $4.88 $6.910 $1.851 2018 $3.24 $9.714 $3.085 2019 $5.98 $11.716 $4.143 2020 $13.06 $10.918 $3.580 2021 $29.64 $16.675 $6.277 2022 $14.61 $26.914 $11.259 2023 $49.52 $26.974 $8.366 *Post-split adjusted basis **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, NVIDIA’s revenue grew by more than 553% while its net income increased by just over 1,323%. The company experienced a slight contraction in revenue and net income in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it rebounded soundly the following year and has continued to steadily grow both metrics since. Meanwhile, shares were able to increase by 9,610% from 2014 to 2023. As the AI lynchpin looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of NVIDIA’s Stock Performance Stronghold on the GPU Industry: No one makes GPUs like Nvidia makes GPUs, and the industry demanding them is well aware of that. While semiconductor competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) do command some attention in their respective corners of the market, simply comparing the three companies’ market caps demonstrates the discrepancies between NVIDIA and, well, every other company. While Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have respectable market caps of $233.04 billion and $858.30 billion, respectively, those are dwarfed by NVIDIA’s $3.65 trillion. Demand From Unrivaled Tech Customers: The company’s primary clientele are the other members of the Magnificent Seven, which are leading the way forward in the AI revolution. In fact, only four Big Tech rival companies — Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) — account for 40% of NVIDIA’s revenue as they vie with one another to become the front runner of the transition to generative AI. The AI Trend Is Just Getting Started: According to Grand View Research, the market size of AI in 2023 was $196.63 billion. As large as that seems, it pales in comparison to where the market is headed. From 2024 to 2030, it is expected that the industry will grow at an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6%, with “continuous research and innovation directed by tech giants [that] are driving adoption of advanced technologies in industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing,” according to Grand View Research’s report. NVIDIA (NVDA) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for NVIDIA, according to analysts, is $150.00, which represents a nearly 3.26% potential upside over the next 12 months based on the current share price of $145.26. Of all the analysts covering NVIDIA, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.3 ‘Buy’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). However, by the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast projects shares of NVIDIA to be trading for $137.50 based on a projected EPS of $2.75 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50, with a best-case scenario of $192.50 per share and a worst-case scenario of $82.50 per share. NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue* Net Income* EPS 2025 $121.255 $68.392 $2.75 2026 $168.151 $95.246 $3.83 2027 $193.852 $108.182 $4.44 2028 $225.462 $130.155 $5.28 2029 $236.498 $152.001 $6.16 2030 $265.522 $175.412 $7.24 *Revenue and net income in $billions How NVIDIA’s Next Five Years Could Play Out At the end of 2025, we expect to see revenue, net income and EPS rise 99%, 111.66% and 111.54%, respectively. That would result in a share price of $137.50, or -5.34% higher than where the stock is currently trading. Our high-end price target is $192.50, while our low-end price target is $82.50. When 2026 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA’s revenue to be $168.151 billion resulting in a net income of $95.246 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $191.50, representing a gain of 31.83% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $268.10, while our low-end price target is $114.90. When 2027 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA’s revenue to be $193.85 billion resulting in a net income of $108.182 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $222.00, representing a gain of 52.83% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $310.80, while our low-end price target is $133.20. When 2028 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA’s revenue to be $225.462 billion resulting in a net income of $130.155 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $264.00, representing a gain of 81.74% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $369.60, while our low-end price target is $158.40. When 2029 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA’s revenue to be $236.498 billion resulting in a net income of $152.001 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $308.00, representing a gain of 112.03% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $431.20, while our low-end price target is $184.40. NVIDIA Stocks Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates that NVIDIA’s stock will be trading for $362.00, good for a 149.21% increase over today’s share price, based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 50. Our high-end price target is $506.80 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 70. Meanwhile, our low-end price target is $217.20 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 30.

Super Micro Computer News and Analysis 11/12/2024 Super Micro Computer is racing to secure a new auditor after Ernst &amp; Young’s sudden resignation. However, there are few potential firms capable of auditing a company of its size, and an auditor must be secured by the November 16th deadline to avoid delisting from the Nasdaq stock exchange. 11/8/2024 Super Micro Computer’s stock price dropped by 3.1% today, reaching as low as $23.76. Trading volume was also significantly lower than average. 11/7/2024 A new lawsuit alleges that Super Micro Computer executives misled investors with false claims about the company’s financial health. The suit claims that these misleading statements were made before a short seller exposed potential accounting irregularities. 11/6/2024 Super Micro Computer experienced a huge 20% decline in its share price today. This sharp drop was triggered by investor concerns that the company might face delisting from the Nasdaq exchange. 11/5/2024 Super Micro Computer has announced its preliminary financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. The company expects net sales to be between $5.9 billion and $6.0 billion, falling short of its previous forecast of $6.0 billion to $7.0 billion. 11/4/2024 Super Micro Computer is set to provide a business update on Tuesday, but market attention is primarily focused on the company’s potential delisting from the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. Despite this, the company’s stock price increased by 5.6% today. 11/1/2024 Super Micro Computer is at risk of being removed from the Nasdaq Stock Exchange following the sudden resignation of its auditor, Ernst &amp; Young. The company has been given a deadline of November 16th to submit a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing rules. 10/31/2024 Yesterday, Ernst &amp; Young resigned as Super Micro Computer’s auditor, leading to a 33% drop in the company’s stock price. Today, SMCI’s stock price continued to decline an additional 16%. 10/29/2024 Super Micro Computer’s stock price increased by 2.2% today, reaching a high of $48.70. 10/24/2024 Super Micro Computer’s share price increased 3.6% and traded as high as $47.24 during mid-day trading today. Super Micro Computer’s Recent Stock Success Shares of SMCI have been particularly rewarding to shareholders in the recent past, as they exploded by gaining 3,096% in the five years between August 2019 and August 2024. The following table summarizes Super Micro Computer’s share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2023: Year Share Price (pre-split) Revenues* Net Income* 2014 $36.39 $1.467 $.054 2015 $24.66 $1.954 $.092 2016 $28.05 $2.225 $.072 2017 $20.93 $2.484 $.067 2018 $13.90 $3.360 $.046 2019 $24.65 $3.500 $.072 2020 $31.66 $3.339 $.084 2021 $43.95 $3.557 $.112 2022 $82.19 $5.196 $.285 2023 $284.26 $7.123 $.640 *Revenue and net income in $billions In the last decade, Super Micro Computer’s revenue grew by more than 385% while its net income increased by just over 1,085%. Despite seeing a minor revenue contraction in 2020 with a decrease of 4.6%, shares of SMCI still managed to increase year-over-year on still-growing net income. As the IT services provider looks forward to the second half of the decade, we have identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance. Key Drivers of Super Micro Computer’s Stock Performance Enormous Industry Growth: According to Statista, global revenues generated by the IT services industry are $1.420 trillion. Looking forward, that figure is forecast to balloon to $1.879 trillion worldwide by the end of 2029, which is good for a market increase of 32.32%. Most of this growth will be driven by demand for services and solutions that support AI, but other drivers include digital transformation and cloud IT infrastructure — both of which are major business segments for Super Micro Computer. The company has a global reach, with more than half of its revenue being produced from outside of the U.S., meaning it will play a central role in meeting that global growth demand. Shrinking Margins to Increase AI Production Capacity: Super Micro Computer finished the fiscal year 2024 with a sizable reduction in its margins. And while that would usually be interpreted negatively by investors, it makes perfect sense for the company. In 2024, gross margins shrink to 14.2% from 18.1% in fiscal 2023. The main driver is increasing production of its server solutions to deploy AI graphics processing units (GPUs) — like those produced by tech behemoths NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). As a result, the company is positioning itself for growth alongside increased demand for GPUs, which ultimately will cause NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices’ successes to trickle down to Super Micro Computer. Most recently, 70% of SMCI’s revenue was from sales of its GPU server solutions for AI implementation. The market for direct liquid cooling (DLC) servers — which Super Micro Computer provides — is expected to grow from $5 billion in 2024 to $21 billion in 2029. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for Super Micro Computer is $65.00, which represents a nearly 179.81% potential upside over the next 12 months based on the current share price of $23.23. Of all the analysts covering Super Micro Computer, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 2.38 ‘Outperform’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month forecast projects Super Micro Computer’s stock price to be $68.34 based on a projected EPS of $3.35 in 2025. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue* Net Income* EPS 2025 $28.265 $1.974 $3.35 2026 $31.634 $2.548 $4.31 2027 $37.116 $1.458 $5.49 2028 $42.631 $1.881 $6.76 2029 $50.154 $2.428 $8.49 2030 $59.005 $3.134 $10.62 *Revenue and net income in $billions How Super Micro Computer’s Next 5 Years Could Play Out At the end of 2025, we expect to see revenue, net income, and EPS rise by 89.16%, 63.41%, and 70.08%, respectively. That would result in a per share price of $683.40 (or $68.34 on a post-split-adjusted basis), which is 2841.89% higher than where the stock is currently trading. When 2026 concludes, we estimate the price of SMCI to be $798.66 (or $79.87 on a post-split-adjusted basis), which is 3338.05% higher than where shares are trading today. This is based on modest revenue gains, an assumed EPS of $44.37, and a healthy projected P/E ratio of 18. At the conclusion of 2027, we forecast a sizable jump in the stock price to $861.28 (or $86.13 on a post-split-adjusted basis) driven by $37.116 billion in revenue and $1.458 billion in net income, which will result in shares trading for 3607.62% higher than the current share price. By the end of 2028, we expect to see shares trading for $1041.04 (or $101.40 on a post-split-adjusted basis), or 4381.45% higher than the stock is trading for today on revenues of $42.631 billion, net income of $1.881 billion, and an EPS of $67.60. And at the end of 2029, Super Micro Computer is forecast to achieve revenue of $50.154 billion and net income of $2.428 billion, resulting in a per share price of $1188.59 (or $118.86 on a post-split-adjusted basis), which is 5016.62% higher than the stock’s current price. Super Micro Computer’s Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, we estimate an SMCI share price of $1386.08 (or $138.61 on a post-split-adjusted basis), good for a 5866.77% increase over today’s share price, based on an EPS of $106.62 and a P/E ratio of 13.

Today’s trading reveals technology investors see the glass half empty at the moment. A tech malaise fueled by Google parent Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) and chipmaker AMD (Nasdaq: AMD) is pressuring the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 moderately lower while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is eking out a gain. The tech malaise can be blamed on Alphabet’s steep 8% drop, owing to a revenue shortfall coupled on top of an aggressive AI spending plan that didn’t sit well with Wall Street. AMD stock, a member of the Nasdaq Composite, is currently down 9% as of mid-morning. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) shares are down in sympathy ahead of the company’s earnings report after the closing bell tomorrow. Key Points Tech is weighing on the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is eking out modest gains. Google parent Alphabet stock is sinking 8% on aggressive AI capex plans despite a revenue miss. AMD shares are down a steep 9% on weak data center results, but Wall Street says the quarter was “better than feared.” Amazon shares are down in sympathy ahead of the company’s quarterly results on Thursday. Despite selling pressure the S&amp;P 500 is managing to hover above the key 6,000 level, buoyed by stocks like Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) with a 4% gain and trucking company Old Dominion Freight Line (Nasdaq: ODFL) with a 6% jump in response to earnings. On the economic front, the economy appears to be humming as the workforce added a higher than expected 183,000 private payrolls in January, fueled by service providers, while wages rose, according to ADP data.

Among them, Citi described AMD’s results as “decent” but lacking on AI revenue guidance. Goldman Sachs analysts called the results “better than feared” while the data center performance fell short. As for Alphabet, Goldman Sachs maintains a “buy” rating with a $220 price target, while BofA said, “Street could be underestimating AI Overview benefits for Search monetization in 2025.” Grab Holdings (Nasdaq: GRAB) is down 6% on the heels of a JPMorgan analyst downgrade to a “neutral” rating from “overweight” with a $5.60 price target, saying they are looking to better entry levels on the stock.

Today the markets are displaying a show of resilience in the face of headwinds like inflation and tariffs, with all three of the major indices trading higher out of the gate. The S&amp;P 500 has been buoyed by stocks like Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) while Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) got off to a slower start. President Trump is expected to hold a news conference on reciprocal tariffs this afternoon, which should be positive for the auto sector. Tesla is extending its gains in morning trading, rising by nearly 4% after securing a massive $400 million contract from the U.S. government for its armored vehicles. Separately, following Elon Musk’s nearly $100 billion bid for OpenAI, the serial acquirer said he would drop his offer if the company remains in its current structure as a non-profit, according to reports. OpenAI backer Microsoft is trading slightly lower at last check. Here’s a look at market performance as of mid-morning: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 80 points (+0.18) Nasdaq Composite: Up 157.29 points (+0.83%) S&amp;P 500: Up 30.11 points (+0.50) Key Points Stocks are attempting gains out of the gate in the face of hot inflation data. Tesla is a catalyst after the EV maker landed a lucrative government contract. Earnings season rolls on. Market Movers Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is getting a pop, rising almost 2% as of mid-morning. Some insider buying activity could be sparking gains as the company’s chief commercial officer scooped up $500,000 worth of shares in his first purchase in years. Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) continues its bullish run with an impressive 8% gain on the day. The stock hasn’t put on a show like this in over 20 years. Robinhood (Nasdaq: HOOD) stock is racing ahead by a double-digit percentage on strong earnings including a whopping 700% y-o-y increase in cryptocurrency revenue. Analyst firm Baird is reportedly bullish on energy services play GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV), saying the company is well positioned to meet growing energy demand. Baird analysts started coverage of the stock with an “outperform” rating and $448 price target attached. The stock is up 1.5% today. Casino operator MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) is soaring about 14% on the day, buoyed by a strong earnings print, further buoyed by China and a rosy forecast. Hertz (Nasdaq: HTZ) shares are sinking in response to weaker-than-expected quarterly results, including a wider loss than anticipated. The stock is down over 4%, owing to its failed push into electric vehicles for which it featured Teslas.

Shares of NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) was mostly flat on Tuesday, losing -0.58% after a strong five-day stretch that has seen the stock rise 9.10%. That has been welcome news to investors who endured the AI sell-off that hit the market in January amid news of low-cost Chinese competitor DeepSeek, which resulted in the company shedding nearly $600 billion from its market cap — by far the largest single-day value wipeout in market history. Year-to-date, NVDA remains down -3.98%. Investors will want to mark Feb. 26 on their calendars, when the company will announce its Q4 earnings. Last month, the stock got a bump from President Trump’s announcement that his administration is planning major AI infrastructure investments, which suggests a willingness for the new administration to work alongside Big Tech companies to expand the use of the technology. That continued the momentum from Jan. 5 when NVIDIA announced that it is hosting its first-ever “Quantum Day” at GTC 2025. The event will focus on exploring advancements in quantum computing. It will include expert discussions, a keynote address from CEO Jensen Huang, developer sessions, hands-on training and other special addresses. Over the past few years, AI has consistently fueled the largest gains for the market. And one company in particular is at the vanguard: NVIDIA. NVIDIA is the premier manufacturer of components critical to the surge in AI; namely, semiconductors, microchips, and graphics processing units (GPUs). As a result, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has seen its stock skyrocket in the recent past. Since the first day the market opened in 2023, shares have gained nearly 809%, and in the decade from August 2014 to the present, they are up a preposterous 33,951%. Despite those mind-boggling gains, analysts still expect enormous upside potential in the medium and long term. 24/7 Wall Street has performed analysis to provide prospective investors and current shareholders with an idea of where NVIDIA’s stock might be headed over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: NVIDIA’s track record of strong earnings suggests an ability to remain at the forefront of its industry, as competitors fight for the leftovers. Between NVIDIA’s client list of Magnificent Seven companies and the burgeoning trend in AI, growth in both revenue and net income is projected to continue its steep climb.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. NVIDIA’s Recent Stock Success Unless you have been living under a rock, chances are you have caught wind of the very well-documented and rather exponential surge in NVIDIA’s share price since 2022. But before 2022’s price-per-share explosion, it was steadily appreciating as it underwent a series of stock splits. Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $0.51 $4.130 $0.588 2015 $0.82 $4.681 $0.800 2016 $2.67 $5.010 $0.929 2017 $4.88 $6.910 $1.851 2018 $3.24 $9.714 $3.085 2019 $5.98 $11.716 $4.143 2020 $13.06 $10.918 $3.580 2021 $29.64 $16.675 $6.277 2022 $14.61 $26.914 $11.259 2023 $49.52 $26.974 $8.366 *Post-split adjusted basis **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, NVIDIA’s revenue grew by more than 553% while its net income increased by just over 1,323%. The company experienced a slight contraction in revenue and net income in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it rebounded soundly the following year and has continued to steadily grow both metrics since. Meanwhile, shares were able to increase by 9,610% from 2014 to 2023. As the AI lynchpin looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of NVIDIA’s Stock Performance Stronghold on the GPU Industry: No one makes GPUs like Nvidia makes GPUs, and the industry demanding them is well aware of that. While semiconductor competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) do command some attention in their respective corners of the market, simply comparing the three companies’ market caps demonstrates the discrepancies between NVIDIA and, well, every other company. While Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have respectable market caps of $194.67 billion and $861.41 billion, respectively, those are dwarfed by NVIDIA’s $3.34 trillion. Demand From Unrivaled Tech Customers: The company’s primary clientele are the other members of the Magnificent Seven, which are leading the way forward in the AI revolution. In fact, only four Big Tech rival companies — Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) — account for 40% of NVIDIA’s revenue as they vie with one another to become the front runner of the transition to generative AI. The AI Trend Is Just Getting Started: According to Grand View Research, the market size of AI in 2023 was $196.63 billion. As large as that seems, it pales in comparison to where the market is headed. From 2024 to 2030, it is expected that the industry will grow at an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6%, with “continuous research and innovation directed by tech giants that are driving adoption of advanced technologies in industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing,” according to Grand View Research’s report. NVIDIA (NVDA) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus one-year price target for NVIDIA, according to analysts, is $178.84, which represents a nearly 34.66% potential upside over the next 12 months based on the current share price of $132.80. Of all the analysts covering NVIDIA, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.3 ‘Strong Buy’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). However, by the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast projects shares of NVIDIA to be trading for $137.50 based on a projected EPS of $2.75 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50, with a best-case scenario of $192.50 per share and a worst-case scenario of $82.50 per share.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Ford in Focus 3:55 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets finished the day the way that it started &#8211; lower -putting an end to a multi-day winning streak. Now the markets are gearing up to process quarterly earnings results from Ford (NYSE: F), whose stock fell 1.2% during regular market hours. Automakers have had a target on their backs for tariffs, and the markets will be looking for greater clarity on any impacts in Ford&#8217;s performance. Here&#8217;s how the major indices finished the day: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 69.52 (-0.17%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 132.40 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 36.79 (-0.66%) America First Economy 12:38 pm by Gerelyn Terzo U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is speaking at the Milken conference today, addressing global investors about President Trump&#8217;s economic agenda. As part of his America First vision, President Trump is looking to make the U.S. economy more appealing to investors amid a strategy involving tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation &#8211; oh my. While the markets await further details on trade talk progress, the three major stock market averages are mixed, including a slight gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain lower. Tariff Uncertainty Remains 11:36 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Dow Jones Industrial Average has turned higher, managing a 7-point gain after starting the session in the red. Meanwhile, technology stocks continue to weigh on the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. According to TD Cowen, tariff-related price hikes are set to rear their heads in May&#8217;s inflation print. Much of the tariff damage will unfold in the summer months as lower-priced inventories dwindle at businesses. The firm says consumers are between a rock and a hard place as tariff-related costs trickle down to them, a situation exacerbated by higher shipping costs. Selling Eases 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure this morning but are off their lowest levels of the session. Netflix (Nasdaq; NFLX) shares are off about 2% on the day after last week&#8217;s rally. ON Semi (Nasdaq: ON) is falling 8% on the day after reporting its Q1 results, while industry peer Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is gaining 2%.

In addition to earnings, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell set to comment on the economy this week, suggesting it could be yet another roller coaster ride for investors. First-quarter earnings season continues to roll on, with names like Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) as well as Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Diamondback Energy (Nasdaq: FANG) on the docket in the coming days. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red out of the gate, including a 1% decline in the Nasdaq Composite. Mag Seven stocks are mixed while the sell-off continues to unfold in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) shares, with a 2% decline today. All sectors of the economy are currently lower, the most severe of which is happening in energy stocks, which are down 2% this morning as the oil price continues its descent. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) has reached the end of an era now that billionaire Warren Buffett announced his retirement after six decades at the helm. With $300 million in cash on the sidelines, BRK-B is losing 6% on the day for a market cap of $1.09 trillion. Greg Abel will succeed Buffett at year-end 2025. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 196.82 (-0.49%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 175.23 (-1.03%) S&amp;P 500: Down 52.04 (-0.88%) Market Movers Footwear company Skechers (NYSE: SKX) is going private, agreeing to a private equity takeover by 3G Capital in a deal that values the company at $63 per share, sending the stock higher by a double-digit percentage today. Jefferies has reiterated its &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), suggesting the valuation has already given the stock the benefit of the doubt in areas like tech innovation and scalability. Mizuho analysts like Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE), upgrading shares to an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating from &#8220;neutral&#8221; on an attractive risk/reward profile. The stock is up 3.5% today.

The stock market had a 20% reset in April, which lasted only a few days, if even that. Recently, it has traded down only 7% for the year. It has only been a quarter of a century since the last market wipeout. The Nasdaq dropped 75% from March 2000 to October 2002. Most of the reason was the .com companies had raised too much money as their losses mounted, and the value of their business models was viewed as unsustainable. Key Points The Market Could Drop 50% Trillions Of Dollars Would Disappear Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The most notable part of the market crash was that it destroyed company stocks with strong business models that are today&#8217;s market titans, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). When the market imploded, Microsoft’s market cap dropped 65%. If the market dropped 75% today, the Nasdaq would collapse from 17,100 to 4,475, and its market value would collapse by $23 trillion, hammering the wealth of many Americans. It is worth noting that the 2000 to 2022 Nasdaq market collapse was not accompanied by a significant recession. GDP fell only .3% in that period, and unemployment rose to 5.5%. That is hardly a recession at all. One of the first signs of a new, sharp market drop is that stocks in the AI craze have started to crater. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), considered the No. 2 AI chip maker, traded at $227 in March last year. A few weeks ago, it dropped to $88 and has since recovered to $102. Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) reached $125 in February last year. It dropped to $74 early last month, a 40% drop. It recently moved up to $117. What is critical about Palantir and AMD is that they are remarkably healthy companies with growing revenue and what appear to be successful models, unlike the .com companies of 2000 and 2002. Nevertheless, their shares collapsed. If there is a massive market sell-off, it would happen for one of two reasons. The first is that the huge bet on AI falters. It could. Companies could get “out over their skis.” Meta (NASDAQ: META) says it will invest $50 billion to $75 billion in AI this year. Microsoft has pegged its investment at $80 billion for the same period. AI is supposed to change the world. Many public companies with prospects driven by AI investments are supposed to have tremendous revenue growth unless they don’t. The other threat to the market is hyperinflation. Inflation rose to 14% in 1979. If there is a similar problem this year, it will be because of tariffs, which could be as high as 100% on Chinese goods. The inflationary problem would ripple across the US economy in months. Sixty percent of US adults own stocks. That statistic says everything.

Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. AMD Up 5% in Mid-Day Trading 1:07 pm by Joel South Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is up 5.3% shortly after 1 p.m. ET. AI stocks across the board are seeing market-beating gains today. NVIDIA is up 3.7% while infrastructure stocks like Vertiv are also seeing gains. Still, AMD&#8217;s gain is higher than most stocks thanks to the announcement of its deal with Humain as well as its $6 billion share buyback. Looking to the back half of 2025, whether or not AMD can outperform the market largely depends on whether it can continue making inroads as companies continue spending more on inferencing, and also whether it can diversify its customer base. The deals announced this week with Saudi Arabia have led to significant gains for AI stocks because they demonstrate a path to AI companies reducing their reliance on hyperscalers for revenue. Advanced Micro Devices Just Announced a $6 Billion Buyback 10:09 am At the moment, Advanced Micro Devices is up 5.7%, or by $6.50 to $118.86. From here, we’d like to see the tech giant test $125 initially. Fueling upside, the trade war with China is finally cooling. Second, the company just partnered with Saudi Arabia’s AI company, Humain, in a $10 billion deal. AMD also just announced a $6 billion stock buyback program. As noted by Yahoo Finance, “Shares of the chip company jumped nearly 7% on the news that the board has approved that $6 billion share repurchase plan. Represents about 3.3% of the company&#8217;s current market value, according to data from Bloomberg. The new authorization in addition to the remaining balance from their last authorization of about $4 billion. What that means, the total current repurchase authorization of about $10 billion.” The Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock is set to open even higher when markets open today. At the moment, shares of AMD are up about 3.3%, or $3.74. That’s because of two key catalysts. First, the trade war with China is finally cooling, at least for the next 90 days. That should remove a good deal of uncertainty from tech stocks, like AMD. Second, the company just partnered with Saudi Arabia’s AI company, Humain, in a $10 billion deal. As noted by Wedbush, “We believe the market opportunity in Saudi Arabia could over time add another $1 trillion to the broader global AI market in the coming years and this dynamic is not being priced into the market and tech names in our view”. Analysts are Calling for AMD to Challenge $200 Analysts at DZ Bank just reiterated a buy rating on AMD with a $200 price target. All thanks to blowout earnings. EPS of 96 cents beat by three cents.

Key Points in This Article: Arm Holdings (ARM) aims to capture 50% of the data center CPU market by 2025, up from 15% in 2024, primarily displacing x86 leaders Intel and AMD. The data center CPU market is projected to grow from $7.42 billion in 2024 to $8.35 billion in 2025, with Arm’s success potentially boosting its revenue to $3.3–3.4 billion and market cap to as much as 168.3 billion. Arm’s goal faces skepticism due to x86’s entrenched ecosystem, but its energy-efficient designs and hyperscaler adoption make it a formidable contender. On a Mission to Dominate British chip design titan Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) sent shockwaves through the tech industry earlier this year with a bold claim: it aims to capture 50% of the data center CPU market by the end of 2025, up from 15% in 2024. This ambitious goal threatens to reshape the competitive landscape, challenging x86 giants Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). As artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing drive unprecedented demand for energy-efficient processors, Arm’s rise could redefine the data center industry. But who stands to lose most, and what would this mean for Arm’s revenue and valuation? Who Arm Would Displace Arm’s audacious target puts Intel and AMD, the x86 architecture leaders, directly in its crosshairs. Intel, with its Xeon processors, has long dominated the data center CPU market, while AMD’s EPYC chips have gained traction with competitive performance. If Arm achieves a 50% share, it would primarily erode Intel’s larger market position, as Intel lacks new server CPUs until 2026, making it vulnerable to Arm’s energy-efficient designs like Amazon&#8216;s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS Graviton and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Grace. AMD would also face significant losses, as hyperscalers like AWS, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google increasingly adopt Arm-based CPUs for their cost and power savings. Arm’s rise is fueled by the AI boom, with its CPUs serving as host chips in AI systems, and a growing Arm-native software ecosystem that challenges x86’s legacy advantage. A Big and Growing Data Center CPU Market The global data center chip market, encompassing CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators, was valued at $21.21 billion in 2024 by Grand View Research and is projected to grow at a 12.5% CAGR, reaching $23.86 billion by the end of this year. The CPU segment, roughly 30% to 40% of this market, translates to approximately $7.42 billion in 2024 and $8.35 billion in 2025 &#8212; an increase of $930 million. Arm’s 50% share of the CPU market would give it influence over $4.175 billion in chip value, a significant leap from its 15% share last year. What It Means for Arm’s Revenue and Valuation Arm’s business model, centered on licensing IP and collecting royalties (2% to 3% per data center chip), differs from traditional chipmakers. In fiscal 2025, Arm generated $4 billion in total revenue, with its cloud and networking business contributing approximately $326 million to $434 million, based on industry royalty estimates. Capturing 50% of the data center CPU market could boost Arm’s data center revenue to $504 million to $604 million, driving total revenue to as much as $4.1 billion. With some 4.175 million CPUs at a $1,000 average price and a 2.5% royalty, Arm could earn around $104 million in royalties, plus increased licensing fees from hyperscalers like AWS and Nvidia. Note, though, that analysts estimate Arm is earning higher royalty rates for its new v9 architecture, which Morningstar estimates could reach a blended 5% rate by 2030, which would scale revenue significantly higher. In terms of valuation, Arm’s current market cap is $172.5 billion at a stock price of $163 per share. Achieving its goal could justify a premium, with analysts projecting a forward P/E of 73 to 150. At a conservative P/E of 73 and fiscal 2025 earnings of $1.63 per share, Arm’s market cap could grow to around $200 billion. At a bullish P/E of 150, it could hit almost $260 billion by the end of the year. These ranges suggest a stock price between $190 and $246 per share, implying 16% and 51% upside by the end of the year. Analyst price targets currently average $142 per share, but attaining its goal could see them boost it much higher, reflecting optimism around Arm’s AI-driven growth. Key Takeaway Arm’s 50% target is ambitious but faces skepticism. Analysts like Omdia’s Manoj Sukumaran estimate Arm-based servers will reach only 20% to 23% of the market by the end of 2025, citing x86’s entrenched ecosystem and software compatibility challenges. Arm’s success hinges on flawless execution, hyperscaler adoption, and overcoming Intel and AMD’s potential counter-moves, like energy-efficient x86 designs. While Arm’s energy efficiency and AI relevance position it strongly, achieving 50% market share in one year seems aspirational. I&#8217;m not certain Arm Holdings can&#8217;t actually achieve its goal, but it&#8217;s clear the chip designer is laser focused on the future and even partial success could solidify its role as a data center powerhouse.

Helping, JPMorgan says the market will continue to run until Nvidia reports earnings in late August. “We continue to find evidence for our bullish hypothesis: (i) resilient macro data; (ii) positive earnings growth; (iii) thawing trade war rhetoric,” JPMorgan said, as quoted by CNBC. “This week we are focused on [July nonfarm payrolls] and MegaCap Tech earnings.” We’re also waiting on earnings from Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple this week. Nasdaq could easily see higher highs 9:13 am With excitement over a trade deal with the US-EU, and hopefully with China, the Nasdaq could see higher highs. Helping, we&#8217;ll soon see major earnings from some of the top Magnificent 7 stocks, and hopeful hints of a potential interest rate cut by September&#8217;s Fed meeting. Stay tuned for more. Nasdaq futures are up about 108 points to 23,599 at the moment. If it can open at that level, that’ll put the tech-heavy index at new all-time highs. According to CNBC, “The moves come after the broad market index and the Nasdaq hit new all-time and closing highs during Monday’s trading session, just barely seeing gains. It was the 15th record close for the broad market index in 2025.” Fueling momentum, tech giants like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) soared by about $7.19 a share yesterday. Shares are up another $2.80 in premarket trading today. Helping, analysts at Bank of America just raised their price target on AMD to $200. The stock is also rising on news of a price increase for its Instinct MI350 chips. In addition, there’s been excitement over the recent US-EU trade deal. Now, markets are waiting to see if a deal can be made with China. That&#8217;s ahead of President Trump’s August 1 deadline. Plus, all eyes will be on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to leave interest rates as is. However, they’ll be listening to hints about a potential rate cut by September’s meeting. Friday will also be an important day, with the release of non-farm payroll numbers. Goldman Sachs Reiterated a Buy Rating on Microsoft Goldman Sachs says it’s bullish on Microsoft heading into earnings. “Microsoft is well-positioned to capitalize on this shift with a more capital-efficient and higher-margin recurring revenue model, just as it did during the on-prem to cloud transition,” as noted by CNBC. Analysts at Oppenheimer just reiterated a Perform rating on Apple ahead of earnings, noting, “We take a neutral view into AAPL’s F3Q25 earnings. We expect investors to focus on the revenue outlook for F4Q25 after normalizing the potential FX tailwind, Services revenue growth, and the sales trend in Greater China.” Citi analysts reiterated a buy rating on Coinbase, with a price target of $505 from $270. The firm noted the company has seen several catalysts recently. That includes the GENIUS Act, the House passage of the CLARITY Act, and its addition to the S&amp;P 500 index. Bank of America also reiterated a buy rating on Roblox, with a price target of $133. The firm sees an “extended runway for mid-20% growth as users worldwide adopt Roblox’s Metaverse, in a virtuous cycle that will draw developers, brands, and merchants to the platform,” as also quoted by CNBC.

Close Shares of Marvell Technology (MRVL) soared on Wednesday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the chipmaker’s stock, citing the “exceptional” strength of AI demand. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore on Wednesday raised his Marvell price target by about 10% to $80 while maintaining an “equal weight” rating. “Marvell is firmly in the AI winners camp, and sentiment has swung aggressively negative compared to a few months ago,” Moore wrote. “We are more excited for their opportunity in optical, which brings higher margin and durability vs. their ASIC opportunity, which has disappointed.” (ASIC refers to application-specific integrated circuit, a class of customizable chip that combines several circuits to perform tasks that would otherwise require multiple interconnected chips.) Marvell shares were up more than 9% in recent trading, making it the best-performing stock in the Nasdaq 100. Despite Wednesday's gain, Marvell shares are down about 23% since the start of the year. Marvell is just one of several semiconductor stocks Moore expects to benefit from strong AI demand over the next year. He also raised his 12-month price targets on Nvidia (NVDA) by 17%, Broadcom (AVGO) by 25%, Astera Labs (ALAB) by 26%, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) by more than 50%. All of those stocks were also trading in the green on Wednesday. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) “While stock prices have moved higher, our conviction on AI spend durability in 2026 continues to grow,” Moore wrote. Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) last week raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast, citing the need to accelerate data center buildouts to meet seemingly insatiable demand for AI and cloud computing. Investors will get more updates on the strength of AI investment after markets close on Wednesday when tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) report earnings.

AMD's rumored 70% price jump for its Instinct MI350 AI chips - from $15,000 to around $25,000 - is a real-time signal that AMD is evolving from being just a chip supplier to a full-scale AI compute platform player.

This chip isn't just a budget-friendly alternative anymore - it's being used in real-world, mission-critical AI workloads.

Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Nasdaq up 300 at the Open 9:54 am Despite a poor outing on Friday, the Nasdaq just opened 300 points higher. All as investors attempt to shake off trade war and job uncertainty. The Dow Jones is up 340. The S&amp;P 500 is up 61. Gold prices are up by $13.82 at $3,381.98. Oil is down $1.70 at $65.63. Shares of Tesla Are Racing Higher in Pre-Market 8:58 am Shares of Tesla (TSLA) are accelerating on news that the company just approved a compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, which consists of 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at about $29 billion. On Semiconductor is down after issuing third-quarter guidance of 54 cents to 64 cents, with analysts expecting 58 cents. The lower end of the expected revenue of $1.465 billion to $1.565 billion also fell short of estimates of $1.50 billion. Bank of America Reiterated a Buy Rating on Nvidia 8:44 am After dropping late last week on jobs growth and tariff concerns, the Nasdaq is turning aggressively higher in the pre-market. At the moment, it’s up 188 points at 23,073.75 Bank of America just reiterated its buy rating on Nvidia, noting it sees a strong beat/raise when it posts earnings later this month. UBS just initiated a buy rating on Pony AI with a price target of $20. Evercore ISI reiterated an outperform rating on Amazon, noting, “We reiterate our Outperform on AMZN in the wake of our proprietary research into Alexa+, Amazon’s AI Agent currently being rolled out to its Echo platform devices. We have tested Alexa+ on and off for two weeks now and have run our own proprietary survey of 1,350 current Smart Device owners,” as quoted by CNBC. Markets were doing well until the latest tariffs and a slowdown in jobs created uncertainty. Non-farm payrolls came in at 73,000 with prior months revised lower. With the latest numbers, investors are digesting what it could mean for interest rates. At the moment, investors are betting on reduced chances for a September cut. Unfortunately, the probability of a September fell to 40%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. With tariffs, Trump signed an executive order that modified reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, with updated duties ranging from 10% to 41%. It’s why the Dow dropped 542 points on Friday, why the S&amp;P 500 shed 101, and why the NASDAQ lost 472 points. This morning, in an attempt to brush off the negativity, the major indices are exploding in the pre-market. The Dow Jones is up about 192. The S&amp;P 500 is up about 35, as the NASDAQ tacks on about 174 points. It’ll be interesting to see if they can hold the gains – especially with the latest tariffs, the potential for a worsening trade war, and jobs. We also have to consider that August is historically a weak month for the Dow, heading back to 1988, according to CNBC. It’s the second-worst month for the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. Key Earnings are on Deck Key earnings from Palantir, Disney, McDonald’s, Advanced Micro Devices, and Eli Lilly will also help decide the markets’ direction. This morning, Tyson Foods posted better-than-expected earnings. EPS of 91 cents was above expectations of 80 cents. Revenue of $13.88 billion was also above the estimates of $13.54 billion. It also raised its revenue guidance for the full year, expecting an increase in production for certain meat products like chicken. Berkshire Hathaway saw a year-over-year decline in operating earnings, which fell 4% to $11.16 billion. All thanks to week insurance writing. Warren Buffett also warned that steep tariffs would hurt its business. &#8220;The pace of changes in these events, including tensions from developing international trade policies and tariffs, accelerated through the first six months of 2025,&#8221; Berkshire said in its earnings report. &#8220;Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events.&#8221; OPEC+ Just Agreed to Raise Oil Production OPEC+ just agreed to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September. This is the latest in a series of accelerated output hikes to regain market share, especially with concerns mounting over potential supply disruptions linked to Russia. “Given fairly strong oil prices at around $70, it does give OPEC+ some confidence about market fundamentals,&#8221; said Amrita Sen, co-founder of Energy Aspects, adding that the market structure was also indicating tight stocks, as quoted by CNBC.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Second quarter revenue was a record $7.7 billion, gross margin was 40%, operating loss was $134 million, net income was $872 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.54. On a non-GAAP( *) basis, gross margin was 43%, operating income was $897 million, net income was $781 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.48. As previously announced, our second quarter results were impacted by the U.S. Government's export control on our AMD Instinct™ MI308 data center GPU products. For the quarter, these restrictions led to approximately $800 million in inventory and related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP gross margin would have been approximately 54%.",121.0,75.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.02666666666666667,0.0,0.013333333333333334,-0.013333333333333334

AMD beat Q2 revenue expectations, driven by surging demand for AI accelerators, resulting in record Data Center revenue.

I reiterate my strong buy rating on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. I now expect the share price to test the $200s before year-end. In my view, the likely approval of MI308 GPU exports to China is a key catalyst ahead, as the current guidance excludes China sales. The MI350 GPU ramp, plus record EPYC CPU sales, should, I believe, push AMD Q3 revenue past management's and the Street's estimates and hold gross margins near 54%.",91.0,51.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0392156862745098,0.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549

Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Morgan Stanley Just Ugraded Apple 8:55 am Morgan Stanley just reiterated its overweight rating on Apple, noting that the tech giant is well-positioned after the latest tariff news from President Trump. According to the firm, as quoted by CNBC, “Apple’s commitment to investing an added $100B in the U.S. &#8211; mind you, with zero new major final assembly/production in the U.S. &#8211; means Apple is entirely exempt from Section 232 tariffs. Therefore, for Apple, tariff rates should get no worse, which is a much better-than-feared outcome.” Goldman Sachs Just Hiked Nvidia Price Target Ahead of Earnings 8:29 am Goldman Sachs just raised its price target on NVDA to $200 from $185, with a buy rating. As noted by CNBC, “Analyst James Schneider said that even though investor expectations are high heading into fiscal second-quarter results at the end of August, the chipmaker should have no trouble rising to the occasion.” In premarket, NVDA is now up about $2.45 a share to $181.81. Futures are racing even higher. Just days after tariff news and jobs data sank the markets, the major indices are exploding. At the moment, the Dow is up 250 points. The S&amp;P 500 is up about 41, with the NASDAQ up another 190 points to 23,610. All thanks to President Trump’s new chip tariffs that include broad exemptions. Announced last night, the President said there would be a 100% tariff on imported chips. However, that will not apply to companies building chips in the U.S. All of which positively impacted Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and ETFs such as the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH). Helping even more, Apple is up about 2.6% in premarket after announcing it would invest $100 billion more in U.S. companies and suppliers over the next four years. That’s on top of the $500 billion commitment Apple made earlier this year. “We’re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said, as quoted by CNBC. “But the good news for companies like Apple is if you’re building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge.” With the 2025 NFL Season Weeks Away, Gambling Stocks are Gaining Momentum Ahead of the 2025 NFL season, gambling stocks, like DraftKings (DKNG) are exploding higher. In 2024, the American Gaming Association said Americans were expected to spend about $35 billion on NFL games this year. That’s up from the $26.7 billion wagered a year prior. At the time, as noted by CBS Sports, “The NFL remains king, and more money is wagered on the NFL than any other league. The NFL also attracts six-figure wages (and sometimes seven-figure wagers) on a regular basis throughout the season.” From its August 2024 low of $31.26, DKNG ran to a high of about $45.72. The RoundHill Sports Betting &amp; iGaming ETF (BETZ) ran from an August 2024 low of about $16.30 to a high of $20.50. Shares of Flutter Entertainment (FLUT) ran from an August 2024 low of about $175.60 to a high of $283.45. With regards to DKNG, its stock is up after posting better-than-expected earnings and reiterated its full-year outlook. Its EPS of 38 cents missed by three cents. However, revenue of $1.51 billion, up 37.3% year over year, beat by $80 million. &#8220;We set records for revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, driven by an acceleration in revenue growth to 37% year-over-year,&#8221; said CEO Jason Robins. &#8220;We are pleased to be maintaining our fiscal year 2025 guidance, with revenue expected to be closer to the high end of our range, highlighting the strength of our platform as we prepare for an exciting new state launch.” The post Nasdaq Composite Live: This is Why the Index is Still Exploding Higher appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",648.0,325.0,8.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.024615384615384615,0.012307692307692308,0.009230769230769232,0.0,0.012307692307692308,0.012307692307692308

This also follows news that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices agreed to give part of their revenue from certain chips sold in China – in exchange for export licenses, as reported by CNBC. “In exchange for 15% of revenues from the chips, the two chipmakers will receive export licenses to sell Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308 chips in China, according to the FT,” as reported by CNBC. Shares of Intel Jump on White House News 8:59 am Shares of Intel jumped about 3% ahead of Intel Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan’s visit to the White House on Monday. This comes just days after President Trump called for his resignation over ties to Chinese businesses. As noted by Fox Business, “A month after Tan was tapped to lead the company, Reuters reported that Tan had invested in hundreds of Chinese companies – some of which had links to the Chinese military. He also invested hundreds of millions in Chinese advanced manufacturing and chip firms between March 2012 and December 2024, Reuters reported. A source told Reuters earlier this year that Tan had divested from his positions, though the extent of his divestitures wasn&#8217;t clear.” The Nasdaq is pushing even higher, as we head into key inflationary data this week. Up about 22 points to 23,735.25, it’s nearing all-time highs. One of the biggest reasons the tech-heavy index isn’t higher is because of news that Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices agreed to give part of their revenue from certain chips sold in China – in exchange for export licenses, as reported by CNBC. “In exchange for 15% of revenues from the chips, the two chipmakers will receive export licenses to sell Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308 chips in China, according to the FT,” as reported by CNBC. Still, Wells Fargo believes this will be a positive for Nvidia, raising its price target to $185 with an overweight rating on the stock. “We would assume NVDA can recapture the full $8B/qtr revenue impact the H20 China ban was expected to have on the F2Q26 (July) qtr by F4Q26 (Jan),” analysts added. “We would expect China demand to grow from the $8B/qtr level going forward.” Markets Waiting on Market-Moving Inflation Data Later this week, we’ll also get market-moving inflation data. The consumer price index (CPI) will be released tomorrow. The producer price index (PPI) will be released on Thursday. Both will be critical with what happens with the Federal Reserve and interest rates. JP Morgan Just Raised Its Price Target on CoreWeave This morning, analysts at JPMorgan raised their price target on CRWV heading into earnings after the bell. The firm raised its price target to $145 from $66, with an overweight rating. “Our sense is that CoreWeave’s opportunities are going to get bigger and lumpier, likely to the surprise of investors, though we are not making a specific call on the upcoming Q2 results as it is likely a futile exercise to speculate on the closing of specific deals and investors should in fact expect extreme lumpiness in CoreWeave’s pattern of large bookings,” the analysts said, as also quoted by CNBC. Bitcoin Broke Above $122,000 Earlier Today Exploding even higher, Bitcoin briefly tested $122,000. While it’s pulling back, analysts still believe it could test $125,000 near term. Helping, The White House recently unveiled a 160-page blueprint that’s considered to be “the most comprehensive piece of work on digital assets that’s ever been produced,” as noted by ABC News. With it, the President has ordered his Administration to supercharge the crypto industry, rolling back regulatory blockades, and pushing forward legislation that could broaden the accessibility and appeal of Bitcoin. The White House added, “By implementing these recommendations, policymakers can ensure that the United States leads the blockchain revolution and ushers in the Golden Age of Crypto.” The White House also signed an executive order that will make it easier for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts.
