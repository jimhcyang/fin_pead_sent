CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bank of America today announced that it directed more than $13 million in 2020 to Native American communities across the U.S. disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus. The funds included capital investments into Native American Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and philanthropic grants to nonprofits and institutions focused on meeting health, hunger and jobs-related needs in Native American communities as part of the bank’s overall efforts to advance economic opportunity and racial equality. Bank of America also donated personal protection equipment (PPE) masks, gloves and hand sanitizer to Native American communities last year. Among the investments were $10 million to Native American Bank, the only national American Indian-owned community development bank in the country, to provide capital for small businesses, affordable housing, community facilities such as schools and healthcare clinics, and consumer lending needs. An additional $3.1 million was in the form of grants to nonprofits serving Native American community needs - nearly half of these grants went to local nonprofits in states serving some of the highest proportions of Native Americans, including Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma and New Mexico. According to National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), many Native Americans experience lower life expectancy, lower educational achievement levels, high unemployment rates and are among the poorest populations in the United States. The prolonged health and humanitarian crisis has exacerbated the need for critical services and support for this vulnerable population. Navajo Nation, for example, has experienced more coronavirus cases per capita than nearly any other place in the United States, and during the height of the pandemic the rate of infection among the Navajo people was more than eight times the overall rate in New Mexico alone. “The economic needs in tribal communities continue to be a challenge that we, as a society, need to address,” said Andrew Plepler, Head of Environmental, Social and Governance at Bank of America. “These challenges have been further exacerbated by the coronavirus. There is an urgent need to invest in tribal and native-owned small businesses, healthcare and jobs development, to mitigate some of the enormous economic and health risks these communities currently face.” Organizations receiving grants include: American Indian College Fund; First Nations Development Institute; National American Indian Housing Council; National Congress of American Indians; Partners in Health, in collaboration with Community Outreach & Patient Empowerment; Our Native American Business Entrepreneurship Network (ONABEN); Citizen Potawatomi Community Development Corp; United National Indian Tribal Youth (UNITY); Navajo Technical University; Mesa Community College; Denver Indian Center; Denver Indian Health and Family Services; Indian Pueblo Cultural Center; Native American Connections; First Nations Community Health Source; Oklahoma City Indian Clinic; Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma; Community Food Bank of Eastern Oklahoma; and First Nations Oweesta Corporation. Bank of America has provided critical financial services to Native American governments and territories for more than 60 years, and is also the largest investor into CDFIs at $1.6 billion across the U.S. Bank of America At Bank of America, we’re guided by a common purpose to help make financial lives better, through the power of every connection. We’re delivering on this through responsible growth with a focus on our environmental, social and governance (ESG) leadership. ESG is embedded across our eight lines of business and reflects how we help fuel the global economy, build trust and credibility, and represent a company that people want to work for, invest in and do business with. It’s demonstrated in the inclusive and supportive workplace we create for our employees, the responsible products and services we offer our clients, and the impact we make around the world in helping local economies thrive. An important part of this work is forming strong partnerships with nonprofits and advocacy groups, such as community, consumer and environmental organizations, to bring together our collective networks and expertise to achieve greater impact.

CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bank of America today announced the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend on Bank of America common stock of $0.18 per share, payable on March 26, 2021 to shareholders of record as of March 5, 2021. Also, the Board authorized the repurchase of $2.9 billion in common stock through March 31, 2021, plus repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the same period, estimated to be approximately $0.3 billion. This authorization equals the maximum allowed for the period, according to guidelines established by the Federal Reserve Board following the results of the latest Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review examination. The Board’s decision reflects the strength of the company’s balance sheet and its continued focus on growing responsibly. At December 31, 2020 the company’s common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio was at an all-time high of 11.9 percent. This translates into $36 billion in capital above the minimum requirement. The repurchase program will be subject to various factors, including the company's capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The common stock repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including Rule 10b5-1 plans. The Board also declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $1.75 per share on the 7% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, Series B. The dividend is payable on April 23, 2021 to shareholders of record as of April 9, 2021.

CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Last year, more and more people relied on digital connections and capabilities to manage multiple aspects of their daily lives. Through it all, Bank of America made it easy, convenient and secure for its clients to manage their finances through high-tech and high-touch channels. “This past year digital capabilities were more important than ever to our clients,” said David Tyrie, head of digital at Bank of America. “Our investments in mobile and online channels over the last 10 years, along with new and enhanced capabilities introduced throughout last year, enabled us to deliver more personalized experiences for each client through a balance of digital and in-person tools and services across their entire relationship with us.” Bank of America saw record levels of digital engagement among new and existing clients last year. The company’s 39 million digital clients, including 31 million active mobile users, increasingly adopted key features within its mobile and online platforms – including mobile check deposits and digital lending applications, Erica®, Zelle®, Life Plan® and CashPro®. Surge in digital engagement – Today, approximately 70% of Bank of America consumer client households and small business clients and 77% wealth management client households are digitally active. Bank of America clients deposited 160 million checks using the mobile banking app in 2020. Last year, 84% of deposits were made through the company’s automated channels (mobile, online and ATMs), up from 78% the prior year. Digital sales accounted for 42% of total consumer sales last year, up from 30% in 2019. Furthermore, 68% of consumer mortgage sales and 74% of direct auto sales were made digitally, compared to 36% and 60% respectively in 2019. Challenges faced by clients last year also led many more to digitally schedule appointments, with 2.6 million arranging in-person and virtual appointments, a 14% increase year over year. Since April 2020, 25% of financial center traffic was driven by the company’s Bank by Appointment capability. Virtual assistant becomes core to serving clients – Last year, 7 million clients used Erica for the first time. Launched in June 2018, Bank of America’s AI-driven virtual financial assistant now has more than 17 million total users, a year-over-year increase of 67% in 2020, and has helped clients with over 230 million requests. At the onset of the pandemic, Erica was trained to understand over 60,000 coronavirus-related terms and questions. More than half (58%) of all Erica interactions to date took place in 2020 alone, with 135 million client requests completed last year. Significant growth in peer-to-peer payments – 13 million Bank of America clients are now active Zelle users, including small businesses, a 33% increase year-over-year. These clients sent and received more than 517 million transactions in 2020 totaling $141 billion, a year-over-year increase of 71% and 80% respectively. Helping clients plan for what is most important to them – Bank of America’s latest digital experience, Life Plan, is one of the most rapidly-adopted offerings in the company’s history. With Life Plan, clients can set and track near- and long-term goals based on their life priorities, and better understand and act on steps toward achieving them. Since launching nationally in the fall of 2020, more than 2.3 million Life Plans have been created by clients within the Bank of America mobile app and online banking platform. Available in both English and Spanish, Life Plan can be used when meeting with the company’s financial professionals, either virtually or in person, enabling clients to have conversations about their life priorities. More businesses using digital to manage and grow their companies – In 2020, clients increasingly turned to digital tools to more easily and conveniently manage and grow their businesses. Four out of five (81%) small business clients are now digitally active, and sales of products and solutions through digital channels increased to 24% last year, up from 10% in 2019. More than 500,000 commercial, corporate and business banking clients use CashPro, a complete digital banking platform to manage their payments, loans and liquidity. Last year, more than a million clients logged into their CashPro app, increasingly using their mobile device to authorize payments and deposit checks. Additionally, companies are increasingly adopting Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as more realize their advantages, from immediate access to their data to foreign exchange rates to account reporting. Last summer, the company also announced several enhancements to its mobile app. Within this single app, millions of Bank of America clients with either a Merrill investing or retirement relationship or a Bank of America Private Bank relationship can now benefit from: an integrated view of their accounts; extended support from Erica through insights on portfolio performance, trading, investment balances, quotes and holdings; the ability to access and execute trades for their Merrill investment accounts; and greater opportunity to maximize their benefits with a consolidated view of rewards and offers across all of their accounts. “The client is at the center of everything we do within our digital experience, which is guided by three core principles: it has to be in the client’s best interest, provide information and advice that is relevant and timely, and always offer the choice of the next best step,” Tyrie added. “Going forward, we’ll continue to innovate and to be there to support our clients – tailoring banking, lending and investing experiences to each individual, in real time.” Recent awards and recognition Over the last 10 years, Bank of America’s commitment to delivering the best digital experiences for clients has helped the company become a global leader in digital banking, lending and investing. Throughout 2020, the company was recognized with more than 50 awards for its digital leadership, including such accolades as: “Best Consumer Digital Bank in the U.S.” by Global Finance, “North America’s Best Digital Bank” by Euromoney, “Best in Class” for the fourth consecutive year and recognition for excellence in mobile and online banking in the Javelin Strategy & Research 2020 Mobile Banking and 2020 Online Banking Scorecards, industry leader in The Forrester Banking Wave™: U.S. Mobile Apps report and in The Forrester Banking Digital Experience Review™: U.S. Mobile Apps report, and Stevie® Award in the 2020 American Business Awards® for the Bank of America mobile app. Bank of America Bank of America is one of the world’s leading financial institutions, serving individual consumers, small and middle-market businesses and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management and other financial and risk management products and services.

CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Concerned about threats to financial success outside of their control, 46% of affluent Americans have been getting their financial lives in order during the last year, according to a recent study from Bank of America. The research also found that, despite challenges imposed by the pandemic, most survey respondents believe they are on track to reach several financial milestones earlier in life than their parents. The Bank of America Preferred Insights: Hindsight is 20/20 Personal Finance Report explores more than 2,000 affluent1 Americans’ financial decisions and reflections over the last two decades, and changes in financial behaviors and priorities over the last year. The research is based on a survey of adults aged 25 and above with investable assets between $100,000 and $1 million and 18- to 24-year-olds with investable assets between $50,000 and $1 million. Looking back over the last two decades, the study found that 89% of Gen X, baby boomer and senior respondents are satisfied with the financial decisions they have made. However, in hindsight, one-third of these respondents (34%) would have done things differently, wishing they had saved more (66%), and started saving (59%) and investing earlier (61%). “The health crisis has caused many people to take stock of their life priorities and to control what they can during a period of uncertainty,” said Aron Levine, President, Preferred and Consumer Banking & Investments at Bank of America. “In addition to getting their finances in order, people are looking ahead at new possibilities, plotting a course for their future and engaging with educational resources and advice that will help them make informed financial decisions and pursue new and exciting goals for themselves and their families.” When asked about the most prominent threats to their future financial success, respondents across generations cited concern about factors outside of their control, including economic recession (62%), market volatility (55%), rising cost of healthcare (50%), and the continuation of the global health crisis (44%). Not Your Parents’ Definition of Success The survey found that the vast majority of affluent Americans are prioritizing many traditional milestones in life, including owning a car (98%), owning a home (97%), saving their goal amount for retirement (95%) and paying off credit card debt (94%). In fact, 84% of respondents indicated they plan to achieve or have already achieved one or more financial milestones earlier than their parents – including opening an investing account (54%) and starting to save for retirement (53%). More than half of this group (53%) say they have already achieved or plan to achieve five or more financial milestones earlier than their parents. However, when asked about the most important measures of personal success today, respondents choose those less financially focused, including good health (63%) and supportive family and friends (59%), over such options as having a stable source of income (51%) or the money to maintain a desired lifestyle (47%). Pandemic Shifts Financial Behaviors and Conversations The pandemic has caused many affluent Americans to re-evaluate the way they save, spend and invest. Nearly half (48%) say they have made no changes to their investment risk tolerance during this period. Among the 44% of investors who have made changes to their investment risk tolerance, they are split in terms of how they have responded to market volatility – with 23% indicating they have been more aggressive and 21% indicating they have been more cautious. More than half of millennials (52%) say they are taking a more aggressive approach to their investing (vs. 23% of the national sample), and many younger investors are managing their portfolios more frequently than they did prior to the pandemic (55% vs. 32% nationally). During this period, four out of five respondents (81%) have taken money normally spent on entertainment, travel and dining and set it aside – namely toward savings accounts (52%) and emergency funds (25%). When life returns to “normal” after the pandemic, affluent Americans plan to spend more on grocery delivery (30%), food prep/meal-kits (27%), restaurant delivery (26%), house cleaning (25%) and laundry services (22%). The survey also found that people are opening up more about certain financial topics today than they did 20 years ago. Approximately three out of four affluent Gen X, baby boomer and senior respondents have long been comfortable talking to friends about real estate decisions, healthcare costs, and their approach to saving for retirement. However, they have become increasingly comfortable talking about changes to life plans due to financial concerns (72% today vs. 66% 20 years ago) and how market volatility impacts their personal investments (71% today vs. 63% 20 years ago). Compared to other generations today, millennials are even more comfortable talking with friends about all types of financial topics. The Modern Investor: Getting Educated and Socially Conscious Respondents are turning to a range of resources to learn about the market and manage their investments in light of recent events, including financial advisors (45%), online investment management platforms (37%), informational websites (32%), and their friends or family (30%). The survey also revealed the following about affluent investors today: More than half (56%) of affluent Americans are taking a self-directed approach to investing or using self-directed investing in combination with a financial advisor for guidance. Among those surveyed: 40% conduct their own research and fully manage their investments using online platforms; 28% consult only a financial advisor for investment advice; 16% use a combination of self-directed and a financial advisor for guidance; and 9% only consult a robo advisor. When it comes to choosing a financial advisor or online brokerage, Americans take into consideration credible reputation (63%) and fees (53%), as well as personal recommendations (42%) and accessibility (41%). One out of five (20%) respondents prioritize socially responsible investing, with top considerations including environmental impact/conservation (50%), personal interest/use of the company’s products (43%), and equity for racial minorities (41%). Additionally, 40% of respondents would be more likely to consider investing in a company that provides pay equity for all employees and supports charitable efforts aligned with their own. “No matter where our clients are on their investment journey, we’re seeing high levels of engagement with educational resources, the latest insights from our Chief Investment Office, and personalized guidance aligned to their life goals,” said Levine. “In doing so, our clients are redefining what it means to be an informed investor.” For more information about the financial behaviors and priorities of affluent Americans, read the Bank of America Personal Finance Insights: Hindsight is 20/20 Personal Finance Report and an infographic spotlighting millennial findings. 1 Hindsight is 20/20 Survey Methodology Concentrix (an independent market research company) conducted a panel-sample online survey on behalf of Bank of America / Merrill from Oct. 28 – Nov. 5, 2020. The survey consisted of 2,000 affluent respondents throughout the U.S. Respondents in the study were defined as aged 18 to 24 (Gen Z) with investable assets between $50,000 and $1,000,000 or aged 25-plus with investable assets between $100,000 and $1,000,000. For this purpose, investable assets consist of the value of all cash, savings, mutual funds, CDs, IRAs, stocks, bonds and all other types of investments such as a 401(k), 403(B), and Roth IRA, but excluding primary home and other real estate investments. Concentrix also conducted an oversampling of 300 affluent respondents in each of the following six regions: Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, North Carolina’s Triangle, Phoenix and Seattle. Regional oversampling took place from Nov. 9 – Nov. 30, 2020. The margin of error is +/- 2.2 percent for the national sample and about +/- 5.6 percent for each of the oversample markets, reported at a 95 percent confidence level.

CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bank of America today announced a goal of deploying and mobilizing $1 trillion by 2030 in its Environmental Business Initiative in order to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable economy. This commitment will anchor a broader $1.5 trillion sustainable finance goal by both environmental transition and social inclusive development purposes, spanning business activities across the globe. “The private sector is well-positioned to ensure that the capital needed – at the scale it is needed – can drive the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable economy,” said Bank of America Vice Chairman, Anne Finucane, who leads the company’s environmental, social and governance (ESG), sustainable finance, and public policy efforts. “We will meet our commitment by working with clients to provide lending, capital raising, advisory and investment services, and to develop financial solutions and drive innovation to ensure the transition to a sustainable economy.” Bank of America’s broader $1.5 trillion sustainable finance target is consistent with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), and will spur transformative change nationally and around the world. Beyond the $1 trillion climate-related finance, the balance of the sustainable finance goal is focused on social inclusive development, scaling capital to advance community development, affordable housing, healthcare, and education, in addition to racial and gender equality. “We stand alongside our clients in helping drive the transition in sustainable lending, investing, and markets activity,” said Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag, who co-chairs Bank of America’s Sustainable Markets Committee with Finucane. “Bank of America will continue to mobilize players across the entire financial system to increase the flow of capital.” Environmental Business Initiative Today’s announcement increases Bank of America’s 2019 commitment of $300 billion to low-carbon, sustainable business initiatives, to $1 trillion by 2030 as part of its Environmental Business Initiative. This commitment advances an environmental transition across sectors to solutions in energy efficiency, renewable energy, sustainable transportation, resource efficiency, sustainable water and agriculture as well as improved forestry and pollution control measures. Since launching the Environmental Business Initiative in 2007, Bank of America has deployed more than $200 billion to low-carbon, sustainable business activities, including expanding its asset-based lending, tax equity investment and capital raising activities across current and emerging clean energy and power, transportation and other industry sectors important for environmental transition. Today’s news follows the company’s recent announcement to achieve Net Zero before 2050. Leading innovation and development in Sustainable Finance Finucane and Montag co-chair the company’s Sustainable Markets Committee, which collaborates across business lines to deliver innovative financing solutions in support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The company’s sustainable finance highlights include: A top issuer of Green, Social and Sustainability bonds: In 2020, Bank of America issued a $1 billion corporate social bond to support those on the front lines of the coronavirus health crisis; and a first-of-its kind $2 billion equality progress sustainability bond to help advance racial equality, economic opportunity and environmental sustainability. Since 2013, the company has issued $9.85 billion in eight corporate Green, Social and Sustainability bonds. A top underwriter in ESG capital markets globally, and a top underwriter of Green Bonds for U.S. Municipalities. Since 2013, the company has helped more than 225 clients support their sustainable business needs by raising in excess of $300 billion through more than 400 ESG-themed bond offerings including green, social and sustainability bonds. The top renewable energy investor and lender in the U.S. since 2015. The company’s renewable energy tax equity portfolio at the end of 2020 was approximately $10.1 billion. These investments have contributed to the development of approximately 17% (33GW) of all total installed renewable wind and solar energy capacity in the U.S. A leader in carbon neutrality and net zero advisory services to all corporate and institutional clients, and a leader in financing, capital markets and M&A services that help drive environmental and social sustainability globally.

CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bank of America Corporation today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $25 billion of common stock over time. This authorization reflects the company’s commitment to return to shareholders excess capital that is not needed to support economic growth, deliver for customers and communities, invest in the future and sustain strength and stability through the cycle. The Board also authorized repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans. For the second quarter 2021, the company’s repurchase plans will be consistent with Federal Reserve System’s (FRB) restrictions that common stock repurchases and common stock dividends be correlated to the average quarterly net income for the previous four quarters. Following the expiration of the restrictions, Bank of America expects to distribute additional capital to shareholders. Bank of America’s ability to make capital distributions depends, in part, on its ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above the 9.5% CET1 requirement: the sum of the FRB regulatory minimum of 4.5% and applicable regulatory buffers; including the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) of 2.5%; and the Global Systemically Important Bank Holding Company surcharge of 2.5%. As of March 31, 2021, Bank of America’s CET1 ratio was 11.8%, which equated to approximately $35 billion excess CET1 capital above the 9.5% CET1 requirement. The timing and amount of common stock repurchases made pursuant to the Bank of America common stock repurchase program are subject to various factors, including the company's capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions. Also, it may be suspended at any time. The common stock repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bank of America, N.A. announced today that it issued a $1 billion six-month floating rate bank note referencing the one-month tenor of the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield IndexSM (BSBY) to multiple investors earlier this week. BSBY adheres to the International Organization of Securities Commissions’ (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks and measures the average yields at which large, global banks access U.S. dollar unsecured wholesale funding. It is dynamic, credit sensitive and reflects marginal funding cost at overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month tenors. “We are pleased to be in a position to help lead the market’s transition away from LIBOR,” said Bank of America Treasurer Andrei Magasiner. “The development of a robust alternative term rate, such as BSBY, is an important development for traditional banking products and for our clients.” “We are continuously looking for ways to innovate and provide creative solutions to the market,” said Andrew Karp, Head of Investment Grade Capital Markets. “We have seen interest from US market participants for a credit sensitive rate alongside SOFR in the transition away from LIBOR. We believe BSBY is a viable alternative and we expect to see more transactions referencing credit sensitive rates going forward.” Forward-Looking Statements Certain information contained in this news release may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions difficult to predict or beyond our control.

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bank of America today announced a $1.5 million commitment as part of its work to advance racial equality and economic opportunity in Massachusetts. King Boston, an organization dedicated to raising awareness of the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King in Boston, and the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, which offers support and assistance to the state’s 52 community health centers, will both receive funding. The grant funding is aligned to the bank’s $1.25 billion, five-year commitment, which further accelerates work already underway to address racial inequality and catalyze similar efforts across the private sector. King Boston, founded in 2017 to create a memorial and related programming honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King’s legacy, will receive a $1 million grant from Bank of America. The grant will support: the creation of the memorial, named The Embrace, on the Boston Common; a new Center for Economic Justice in Nubian Square to promote solutions to further racial and economic justice; and a public ideas series that engages the community in anti-racist discourse through the arts and humanities. “It is with generous contributions from large, established institutions that we are able to interrogate racism and advocate for the issues that Dr. and Mrs. King fought for over 50 years ago – wealth, housing, racial equity and public education,” said Imari Paris Jeffries, executive director of King Boston. “Thanks to our corporate partners like Bank of America for investing in change, and for their ongoing commitment to everything King Boston represents – convening, learning, healing, appreciating and honoring.” The Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, which together serves more than one million people across the state, has been awarded a $500,000 grant from Bank of America to address critical health equity concerns with COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The state’s community health centers are uniquely positioned in communities of color to address these gaps as the vaccine rollout expands and accelerates. “Bank of America’s generous contribution recognizes the need for both an urgent infusion of funds and support for building longer-term responses to inequities. Immediate funding will go far in helping us meet expanding demand for the COVID-19 vaccine in the communities we serve – the same communities that have been unduly battered by the pandemic,” said Michael Curry, President & CEO of the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers. “At the same time, the flexibility of this funding will give us room to respond to community-specific needs and support social, health and economic recovery as we work our way out of this pandemic.” “The health and humanitarian crisis has demonstrated just how far we have to go in correcting longstanding inequities in our society,” said Miceal Chamberlain, President of Bank of America Massachusetts. “The time for action is upon us and our hope is that by continuing to take specific steps to address economic and racial disparities, we can serve as a catalyst for a broader response across the private sector.” To date, the bank has made more than $350 million in various investments from its initial $1 billion commitment, announced in June 2020, across the primary focus areas of health, jobs/reskilling, affordable housing and small business, including providing support to Pine Street Inn, Innovation Studio, Morgan Memorial Goodwill Industries, La Colaborativa and Asian American Civic Association locally in Boston.

CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--What’s driving home sales, higher home prices and bidding wars in many areas of the country? Low housing inventory and low interest rates are often factors, but Bank of America’s 2021 Homebuyer Insights Report found that a sense of community and good neighbors are also key priorities for today’s homebuyer. According to the survey of 2,000 adults who currently own a home or plan to in the future, half (51%) of younger buyers – those ages 18 to 43 – and nearly one third (32%) of older generations – ages 57 to 75 – say community has become more important over the past year. Specifically, people want neighbors who share similar interests (73%) and are active in the community (70%). Along with a desire for more space and smart home technology, individuals are looking for a sense of connectedness and belonging when it comes to where they live. “Over the last year, people have had plenty of time at home to reassess their priorities and goals, including how their living space and surroundings fit into their lives,” said AJ Barkley, SVP, Neighborhood Lending and Retail Sales East Executive, Consumer Lending at Bank of America. “We know homeownership remains as important as ever, especially for younger generations looking for that sense of community. We’re helping them take the next steps no matter where they are on their homebuying journey.” Across all generations, homeowners were more likely than non-homeowners to say they like their neighbors (42% vs. 29%) and neighborhood (44% vs. 32%) more now than they did a year ago. The feeling of safety is also important when it comes to home surroundings and community. Over two-thirds (68%) of younger prospective homebuyers and three quarters (75%) of younger homeowners say safety and security have become greater priorities when choosing where they will live. A desire for more space Beyond a sense of community, as prospective homebuyers have spent more time at home, they have re-evaluated and placed greater importance on the amount of space they need, both inside and outside. Nearly half (48%) of prospective homebuyers between 18 and 43 say the importance of square footage has increased, and 60% say outdoor space is more important to them now. The need for space has traditionally meant a move to the suburbs. While 42% of younger prospective buyers currently live in cities, only 24% want to own a home there. Half (48%) want to buy in the suburbs and 29% want to buy in rural areas. This is an increase from last summer, when 18% indicated a desire to purchase a home in a rural area. The evolving home The past year has also given people a peek into the homes of their coworkers, family and friends amidst the virtual environment. Three quarters (75%) have participated in video calls, and of this group, 37% have gotten ideas for something to do in their own home. A quarter (25%) have even asked others for information on where something was purchased or how a certain renovation was done based on what they saw. The home has become more than a place people leave in the morning and come back to at the end of the day. Two-thirds (66%) of all respondents agree that activities done in the home have changed, and this is especially true for younger generations (77%). Those ages 18 to 43 are using their homes as an office (45%), a school (31%), a movie theater (28%) and a gym (27%). While fewer, respondents ages 57 to 75 are also using their homes as an office (28%), a movie theater (24%) and a gym (14%). Additionally, younger prospective buyers are expressing a desire for new technologies in their homes, including smart/Wi-Fi enabled security system (51%), solar energy products (42%), and smart/Wi-Fi enabled appliances (44%). Accelerating the path to financial stability Despite this uncertain time, 65% of younger homeowners say their financial security has remained stable compared to 51% of non-homeowners in the same age group. It’s no surprise that 18- to 43-year-old prospective buyers are eager to swap unpredictable monthly rents with steady monthly mortgage payments, with nearly half (46%) saying that building equity is now more important than ever. They recognize that homeownership is a way to build long-term stability. “Homeownership is one of the most positive drivers of wealth creation,” shares Barkley. “That’s why we recently tripled our financial commitment to affordable homeownership solutions, which include grants to help home buyers with their down payments and closing costs, with no repayment required.” Those ready to leave renting behind aren’t going into homebuying blindly; they’re taking action. Most (87%) prospective buyers ages 18 to 43 say saving to purchase a home is a priority. Others are even accelerating their homebuying timelines (19%) compared to last summer (14%). In today’s competitive market, it is important to get a mortgage preapproval and plan ahead to compete with other buyers. For those ready to start their home search now, the Bank of America Real Estate Center® provides a simple way to research neighborhoods, shop for homes and identify properties that may be eligible for the bank’s homebuyer grants.

CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bank of America today announced the launch of the Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card, which allows clients to earn unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases. This new credit card is the latest among Bank of America’s suite of rewards cards, each designed to fit a variety of clients’ needs. “We heard from our clients that they want earning rewards on their credit card to be uncomplicated,” said Jason Gaughan, credit card executive at Bank of America. “With our new Unlimited Cash Rewards card, we’ve made earning cash back on all purchases even easier, and are helping clients optimize their spending.” Unlimited Cash Rewards Features – Clients will automatically earn 1.5% cash back on all purchases, with no limit on the amount of cash back earned. Cash rewards don’t expire, and redemption is simple: clients can redeem their cash back for any amount, at any time for statement credits or deposits directly into a Bank of America checking or savings account, or for credit to an eligible account with Merrill. The Unlimited Cash Rewards card has no annual fee. Earn Even More with Preferred Rewards – Members of Bank of America’s Preferred Rewards program earn 25% to 75% more cash back on every purchase made with the Unlimited Cash Rewards card, depending on their rewards tier. That means the unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases could increase to up to 2.62% cash back. Award-Winning Credit Card Options – The new card joins the suite of award-winning credit cards from Bank of America including the Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards credit card, which offers clients 3% cash back in a category of their choice. Cardholders choose from one of six categories including gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drug stores and home improvement. Customized Cash Rewards cardholders also earn 2% cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs, and unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases. Clients earn 3% and 2% cash back on the first $2,500 in combined purchases each quarter in the choice category, and at grocery stores and wholesale clubs, then earn unlimited 1% thereafter. Coming Soon: Business Advantage Unlimited Cash Rewards – Bank of America will launch a similar credit card for business owners in October. The Business Advantage Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card will enable clients to earn unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases. Business Advantage Unlimited Cash Rewards clients enrolled in Preferred Rewards for Business can increase their credit card rewards bonus by 25% to 75%, depending on the rewards tier for which they qualify.

CIUDAD DE NUEVA YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merrill Lynch Wealth Management publicó hoy tres estudios que analizan las comunidades afroamericanas, LGBTQ+ e hispanas de altos ingresos. Los primeros informes de estudios de este tipo titulados, “Puntos de vista diversos: comprender la riqueza en los EE. UU.” (solo se ofrece en inglés), buscan tener un mejor conocimiento acerca de cómo las personas de estas comunidades diversas logran alcanzar el éxito y aumentar su patrimonio, motivaciones, desafíos y metas para el futuro. “Atender a un grupo de clientes diversos requiere de un entendimiento profundo de las experiencias particulares y la trayectoria de la vida financiera de cada persona”, dijo Andy Sieg, director de Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. “Y aunque nunca podamos ponernos realmente en el lugar del otro, este estudio enfatiza aún más nuestro compromiso de apreciar y reflexionar con mayor amplitud sobre los mercados diversos en las comunidades a las que atendemos”. Los estudios fueron realizados por la firma de investigación Ipsos y encontraron que el crecimiento de estos hogares diversos de altos ingresos (ingresos anuales de más de $125,000) está superando al de la población en general. Desde 2015, las comunidades afroamericanas, LGBTQ+ e hispanas de altos ingresos han crecido en un 65%, 76% y 81% respectivamente, mientras que la población general ha crecido en un 53%. Si bien la encuesta encontró muchos puntos en común y surgieron temas notables en cada una de estas comunidades, también identificó diferencias en comparación con la población general de personas con altos ingresos: Metas Afroamericanos: En cuanto a su vida financiera, las personas de esta comunidad dan prioridad a apoyar a los familiares, invertir en los negocios de personas que conocen y asegurar el patrimonio a través del espíritu empresarial LGBTQ+: Comenzar una familia se convierte cada vez más en un objetivo. Casi una cuarta parte de las personas aspira casarse y el 13% de los jóvenes LGBTQ+ (de 20 a 34 años) afirma que tener un hijo es una de sus metas financieras más importantes (en comparación con el 5% de los LGBTQ+ de 35 a 54 años). A largo plazo, más miembros de esta comunidad mencionan el pago de la atención médica y la atención prolongada como una meta financiera importante (24% vs. 17% de la población general de altos ingresos) Hispanos: Los miembros de esta comunidad tienden cuatro veces más a afirmar que su objetivo financiero más importante es “planear para ayudar o apoyar a padres mayores”. Además, uno de cada cinco hispanos también dice que es muy importante dejar una herencia a su familia Motivaciones y prioridades financieras Afroamericanos: El deseo de superación personal tiende a motivar el doble a las personas de esta comunidad. Además, el deseo de preparar para el éxito a generaciones futuras tiende a motivarlos un 25% más LGBTQ+: Los miembros de esta comunidad están enfocados en vivir de manera auténtica con las actividades que les gusta hacer o simplemente vivir la vida de la manera que desean. Además, tienden a ver un 45% más como prioridad principal la retribución y el apoyo a su comunidad Hispanos: El 35% afirma que el cuidado de su familia es una de las principales motivaciones personales. Además, se ven impulsados tres veces más por el deseo de enorgullecer a su familia Desafíos Afroamericanos: Las personas de esta comunidad enfrentan muchos de los mismos desafíos que los demás. Sin embargo, tienden a concentrarse el doble en reducir sus niveles de deuda actuales, 25% más a mantener económicamente a su familia, y tres veces más a afirmar que pagar la educación es una fuente de estrés LGBTQ+: Un tercio no se siente aceptado por su familia. Como resultado, el 58% afirma que ha tenido que trazar su propio camino hacia la independencia financiera Hispanos: Las personas de esta comunidad están más estresadas por poder pagar las cuentas del hogar (17% vs. 12%) y equilibrar financieramente el cuidado de los demás mientras se mantienen a sí mismos (15% vs. a 12%) “Muchos desafíos financieros han tenido un impacto desproporcionado en las comunidades diversas en los últimos años. A través de estos resultados, esperamos generar un diálogo adicional y significativo con los clientes y a través de la industria que promueva nuestra capacidad de cubrir las necesidades de todas las personas y comunidades”, dijo Kirstin Hill, director de operaciones de Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. Para avanzar en la conversación, Merrill convocó a miembros de las comunidades afroamericanas, LGBTQ+ e hispanas de altos ingresos para discusiones de mesa redonda. Metodología de “Puntos de vista diversos: comprender la riqueza en los EE. UU.” Los investigadores de la firma Ipsos resumieron y revisaron una variedad de publicaciones y estudios académicos sobre temas de diversidad, patrimonio e inclusión en los servicios financieros, entre otros. Además, se realizaron entrevistas con expertos y académicos destacados. A partir de allí, se llevó a cabo un estudio cualitativo a través de una comunidad en línea, seguida de etnografías en casa con encuestados que representan el segmento de altos ingresos de las comunidades afroamericana, hispana y LGBTQ+. También se realizó una encuesta cuantitativa entre más de 450 miembros de cada una de las comunidades, con personas con más de $100,000 en activos invertibles. Cada comunidad se comparó con una muestra representativa de 1,000 estadounidenses de altos ingresos, un grupo al que se hace referencia en los informes como la población general de altos ingresos. Se realizó un análisis estadístico en los cuatro grupos para garantizar la representación, precisión e integridad.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merrill Lynch Wealth Management published today three studies examining the affluent Black/African American, LGBTQ+ and Hispanic/Latino communities. The first-of-its-kind research reports titled, “Diverse Viewpoints: Understanding Affluence in the U.S.,” aim to better understand how individuals in these diverse communities achieve success and grow their wealth, their motivations and challenges and goals for the future. “Serving a diverse client base requires a deep understanding of people’s unique experiences and financial life paths,” said Andy Sieg, head of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. “And while we can never really know what it’s like to walk in someone else’s shoes, this research further underscores our commitment to more fully appreciating and reflecting the diverse markets in the communities we serve.” Conducted by research firm Ipsos, the studies found that the growth of these diverse affluent households (annual income more than $125,000) is outpacing that of the general population. Since 2015, affluent Black/African American, LGBTQ+ and Hispanic/Latino communities have grown by 65%, 76% and 81% respectively, while the affluent general population has grown by 53%. While the survey found many commonalities, within each of these communities notable themes emerged, as did differences when compared to the general population of affluent individuals: Goals Black/African American: With respect to their financial life, individuals in this community prioritize supporting family members, investing in the businesses of people they know, and securing wealth through entrepreneurship. LGBTQ+: Starting a family is increasingly a goal, with nearly a quarter aspiring to get married and 13% of young LGBTQ+ (20-34 year olds) citing having a child as one of their most important financial goals (compared to 5% of LGBTQ+ 35-54 years old). Longer-term, more members of this community cite paying for healthcare and long-term care as an important financial goal (24% vs. affluent general population 17%). Hispanic/Latino: Members of this community are four times as likely to cite that their most important financial goal is ‘planning to assist or support aging parents.’ One-in-five also say leaving an inheritance to their family is very important. Motivators & Financial Priorities Black/African American: Individuals in this community are two times more likely to be motivated by a desire for personal achievement. They are also 25% more likely to be motivated by a desire to set future generations up for success. LGBTQ+: Members of this community are focused on being able to live authentically by pursuing activities they love or simply living life the way they want.

Through these findings we hope to spark additional, meaningful dialogue with clients and across the industry that furthers our ability to meet the needs of all people and communities,” said Kirstin Hill, chief operating officer at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. To advance the conversation, Merrill convened members of the affluent Black/African American, LGBTQ+ and Hispanic/Latino communities for roundtable discussions. Methodology for “Diverse Viewpoints: Understanding Affluence in the U.S.” Researchers at the firm Ipsos synthesized and reviewed an array of publications and academic research on the topics of diversity, wealth and inclusion in financial services and beyond. Additionally, interviews were conducted with leading experts and academics. From there, qualitative research was conducted through an Online Community, followed by in-home ethnographies with respondents representing the affluent segment of the Black/African American community, Hispanic/Latino community and the LGBTQ+ community. A quantitative survey was also conducted among more than 450 members of each of the communities, with individuals with more than $100,000 in investable assets. Each community was compared to a representative sample of 1,000 affluent Americans, a group referred to in the reports as the affluent general population. Statistical analysis was conducted on all four groups to ensure representation, accuracy, and completeness.

One major Wall Street bank is weighing in on what it calls “an extreme scenario” in which no Group-of-10 central bank cuts interest rates this year due to sticky inflation, strong economic growth, or fresh shocks that push price gains higher.In a note on Tuesday, Athanasios Vamvakidis, a U.K.-based FX strategist at Bank of America BAC, -2.64%, said it's worth considering the implication of a seemingly “unrealistic” scenario in which major central banks stay on hold.For now, markets are pricing in about six interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, starting respectively in March and April; five cuts by the Bank of England; and two cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia. BofA foresees fewer cuts for all of them due to sticky inflation, resilient economies, and “stretched” labor markets, the strategist said."

Upside to NIM can drive profitability closer to management's goal. At 11x forward EPS estimates, the stock looks like a reasonable value for long-term investors."

What is &#8220;the best card that can give me the max amount of cash back for everyday purchases like gas etc?&#8221; This is the question posed in our next drawing from the Reddit mailbag. Our caller today, let&#8217;s call her &#8220;Gwen,&#8221; is a young adult fresh out of college and off to a good start with a credit score of 746 (which FICO considers &#8220;very good&#8221;), but looking for a better credit card to maximize her cash back. Gwen is rocking a Chase Freedom Student card at present, a holdover from her college days that Chase Bank actually no longer offers. The Chase Freedom Student has been phased out and replaced by a similar card that&#8217;s now called &#8220;Chase Freedom Rise.&#8221; It&#8217;s not a bad card as cashback cards go. It doesn&#8217;t charge any annual fee for example. But it only pays 1.5% cash back on purchases, which these days is really the absolute minimum you should demand in a cash back card. Long story short, Gwen can do better. Let&#8217;s help her out with that. .keypoints-box { margin-bottom: 20px; } Key Points No one credit card is best for cash back. A good cash back strategy includes a single all-around card paying 2%, supplemented by multiple cards paying more cash back for specific kinds of purchases. The Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express pays 6% cash back for gas grocery and streaming purchases, but it does charge an annual fee. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) Ordinarily, my advice when picking cash back cards is to go for a mixed approach, holding one card that pays a decent cash back rate on all purchases in all categories, with no limit on the cash back you can earn, and no annual fee. Any of several major branded credit cards fit this bill, including The Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) Active Cash card, Citi (NYSE: C) Double Cash, and SoFi&#8216;s (Nasdaq: SOFI) Unlimited 2% credit card. This all-around &#8220;good enough&#8221; card should then be paired with a handful of other cards that pay less than 2% for what Gwen might call &#8220;etc&#8221; purchases, but more than 2% for specific categories of purchases where she spends heavily. Whenever making one of these specific purchases, Gwen would switch out her good-enough card, and use one of these credit cards tailored to the specific purchase she&#8217;s making, be it gas, or groceries, or restaurants for example. Good options for this part of the package might include Bank of America&#8216;s (NYSE: BAC) Customized Cash card, which lets a cardholder pick one category of purchase to receive 3% cash back on; or Citi&#8217;s Custom Cash card, which let&#8217;s you pick a category to receive 5% cash back (albeit, only up to $500 in purchases per month). Is the Blue Cash Preferred Card a good cash back card? Gwen seems to be thinking along these same lines as well, asking specifically if she should ditch her Chase Freedom Student card in favor of the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express (NYSE: AXP). So should she? My first instinct is to say &#8220;no&#8221; without thinking, because unlike all of the cards I&#8217;ve named above, the AmEx card charges a $95 annual fee (after the first year). But on further reflection, the Blue Cash Preferred Card idea may have some merit, especially when used in conjunction with a second, good-enough card. Why? Well, consider this: The Blue card pays a superb 6% cashback on grocery purchases, 6% more on &#8220;select&#8221; streaming subscriptions, and 3% on gas stations. It pays only 1% cashback on everything else, but Gwen already has a card that she can use for everything else, her Chase card, and it pays 1.5%. The question really comes down to this: Will Gwen spend enough on groceries and streaming, to cover the $95 annual fee, and still give her more cash back than she&#8217;d get if she used a different card (or cards) paying only 3% on groceries and streaming? It&#8217;s not too hard to answer that question, though. First, we need to know how much Gwen pays for groceries and streaming in an average month. Is it $500? If so, then at 6% cashback she&#8217;s getting $30 back a month on those purchases, or $360 a year, instead of the $15 a month, or $180 a year, she&#8217;d be getting with a 3% cash back card (or cards). The difference between $360 and $180 ($180), is more than the $95 annual fee, so Gwen is actually getting a good deal in this case. Conversely, if Gwen spends only $200 a month on groceries and streaming, her cashback at 6% is $144 a year. Minus the $95 annual fee, she&#8217;s netting only $49 cash back, which is less than the $72 she&#8217;d get on a 3% cashback card with no annual fee. In that case, she&#8217;s better off finding a different card, and leaving the AmEx card to bigger spenders.

Which Cards Are Best For Me?,"My Cash Back Cards Aren’t Great and I Don’t Care About Travel Rewards. Which Cards Are Best For Me?
Short and sweet. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;d describe this next letter from the Reddit mailbag. In 53 words, four of which are conjunctions, our caller today (let&#8217;s call him &#8220;Al&#8221;) polls the Reddit-verse advice on &#8220;the best&#8221; cash back credit card, to replace his current cash back card, which Al consider suboptimal. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking for a credit card that has better cash back than my current ones. I don&#8217;t really care for the travel points or anything like that. Just strictly cash back. I&#8217;ve heard chase sapphire is good and discover it, but I&#8217;m wondering what you all have found to be the best. Thanks!&#8221; In just 53 words, you wouldn&#8217;t expect Al could go far wrong with his request, and yet in fact he does. The problem with Al&#8217;s question you see, lies in his assumption that there must be one best cash back credit card out there. But there isn&#8217;t. Rather, the best way to make use of credit cards to get cash back, is to use them in combination. Key Points There is no such thing as one &#8220;best&#8221; cash back credit card. To maximize your cash back, it&#8217;s best to use one general cash back card, plus a combination of multiple specialized cards paying extra cash back on specific kinds of purchases. A combination like this can increase your monthly cash back by 20% or more. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) Think of it like this: Some cash back cards pay you a decent rate, say 2% on everything you buy. Other cash back cards pay you a superior rate, say 5% on purchases of gas (but only in certain time periods, like from January to March), or they may pay you back 3% on gas all the time, but 1% on everything else. The devil, as the saying goes, is in the details. And it&#8217;s these details that make it hard to say if a card paying 5% on one thing, 3% on another, and 1% on everything else, is better than a card that just pays you a straight 2% cash back on whatever you charge on the card. How to work the system on cash back credit cards So you do you untangle this intricate web of rewards? I can answer that in two steps. Step 1: You start off by getting one single, all-around cash back card that pays a decent rate on everything, all the time, and with no limits or fees. The Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) Active Cash card, Citi (NYSE: C) Double Cash, and SoFi&#8216;s (Nasdaq: SOFI) Unlimited 2% credit card all pay 2% on all purchases in all categories, with no limit on how much cash you can get back, and none of these cards charges an annual fee for the privilege. You only need one of these cards; there&#8217;s little point in having more than one, other than to increase the total amount you can charge across cards. If asked to choose, of the three, I prefer SoFi&#8217;s card over the others, because it does not charge foreign exchange fees when traveling outside the country (and unlike Al, I actually do &#8220;care for the travel&#8221;)! Step 2: Now that you&#8217;re guaranteed a minimum of 2% cash back on all your spending, you try to bump up your average cash back from there, trying to inch past 2%. Add a Capital One (NYSE: COF) Savor Card for example, to get 3% cash back on groceries and restaurants. Add a Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) Customized Cash card and choose to get 3% back on gas for your car. Add a Citi Custom Cash card (similar concept, but from a different bank) and choose to get 5% back your internet provider&#8217;s bill (only up to $500 per month, but most internet bills are less than that). Then substitute the Capital One card for your SoFi card when buying food or visiting restaurants, substitute the BofA card when paying your internet bill, and substitute the Citi card when filling up. Say in a given month you spend $700 on food, $200 on gas, $100 on internet, and $2000 on everything else. How does this work out? Well, your total cash back across the four cards will be: $700 x 0.03 = $21 $200 x 0.03 = $6 $100 x 0.05 = $5 And $2000 x 0.02 = $40 Add it up, and you got $72 cash back on $3000 in spending. $3000 divided into $72 = 2.4%. That&#8217;s the total cash back you&#8217;re getting, and it&#8217;s 20% better than a plain vanilla 2% cash back card.

In the cashback and travel credit card world, everyone is always looking for the best offers when wanting a new card. With all the different perks and benefits available today, it makes perfect sense to shop around and find who offers the best deal. Key Points This Redditor is looking for a great combination of general and travel card. Sadly, they don’t want to live in a cash-back world. There are a few really strong recommendations that are worth considering. The right travel credit card can take you to places you’ve never dreamed of. Click here now to see our top picks. (Sponsor) This is precisely the situation with one Redditor posting on r/CreditCards, as they are looking to find the card that best matches their goals and travel needs. This individual is looking at travel as their primary goal, so all efforts here will be about earning miles and points. It’s a little confusing that the Redditor wants a card that excels for both general and travel purposes, as most cards do one or the other really well, but there is no harm in trying to find something that works. The Criteria With an income of over $300,000 and a FICO score of 800, this Redditor hopes to get a solid travel card that allows them to use points for domestic and international travel. Currently, they are okay with category-specific cards but do not favor rotating-category cards, which knocks some of the more popular cashback cards off the board. While they only travel once per year, either domestically or internationally, they have an international trip already planned, so it would be ideal to have a card they could use to rack up some points this year. As far as expenses, they have their once-yearly travel plans, a $5,000 monthly mortgage, a $500 HOA, and $350 in monthly utilities, none of which are paid by card. There is also a Costco membership, but this really isn’t a factor, and they already have a Costco Citi Visa, BoA unlimited cash rewards, BoA customized cash rewards, and a Discover card. So, after considering the AMEX Platinum and Bilt cards, they are still waiting to find something better. However, it’s worth noting that in the comments, they clarify that they are okay with an annual fee and the option to downgrade if they find themselves traveling less. The Options AMEX Platinum Among the top recommended options is a card that the original poster is already considering. The American Express Platinum card has a $695 annual fee, which is a definite negative, but it also has many bonuses to help offset this charge. However, before getting into the benefits, it&#8217;s worth knowing that the attractive 80,000 membership reward point bonus requires $8,000 in eligible purchases over 6 months. While we don’t know precisely what the Redditor spends monthly, this should be manageable based on their overall income and general spending habits. With this card, you get a $155 Walmart+ credit, a $200 hotel credit every year, a $240 digital entertainment credit, and a $200 airline fee credit, which means the $695 annual fee is offset by $900 in value when you also get a $15 Uber Cash credit every month. Capital One Venture X Another solid option for this Redditor might be the Capital One Venture X card. While it has a $395 annual fee, it offers a $300 annual travel credit, a $120 Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit, 10,000 bonus miles (equivalent to $100) every year, and 75,000 bonus miles after you spend $4,000 in the first three months. Earning 10X miles on hotel and car rentals, 5X miles on flights, and 2X miles on all other purchases, this Redditor should have more than enough time to spend and save for their once-yearly big trip. Plus, you get access to more than 1,300 lounges, which could be beneficial if and when the original poster goes international and wants a nicer place to sit and wait for their flight. Chase Sapphire Preferred Among Chase’s best cards, this one offers an outstanding balance between general and travel spending, making it a top option. The Chase Sapphire Preferred has a $95 annual fee but offers 100,000 bonus points with just $5,000 in spending after 90 days, a pretty strong bonus overall. In addition, you get $200 in partner value from Chase partners, $50 statement credits every year when booking through Chase Travel, and 25% more value when rewards are redeemed for travel. To earn rewards, you can earn 2X on all travel purchases, 3X on dining out or taking in, 3X points on grocery purchases, and 3X on streaming services, so rewards can quickly add up.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Bank of America shareholders voted on Tuesday to approve pay packages for CEO Brian Moynihan and the lender's top executives, and also elected its 14 directors on the board. Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended that investors vote against the payouts, expressing concerns about the process used to set the compensation. aAdsList.push('Article'); aAdsListSize.push([300, 250]); aAdsListCA.push(null); Moynihan earned $35 million for last year, an increase of roughly 21%. The company's board credited him with growing its net income 2.3% last year and boosting revenue 3.4%. On U.S. plans to impose tariffs on trading partners, Moynihan said any impact on the bank will be indirect - on how a trade war affects the economy. ""The impact on our bank will be through the economic impact of a trade war... so if you believe that consumption falls and that results in reductions in force of employees and unemployment rate would go up,"" he said. The administration of President Donald Trump earlier this month announced, then paused, sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, throwing the global economy into a state of uncertainty. Moynihan reiterated that the bank's economic team does not see a recession this year, but expects the Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates because inflation is sticky. Regarding a question about the risk of Trump sacking Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the CEO said an independent central bank is one of the important things about U.S. consistency. Trump stepped up his criticism of Fed Chair Powell for not cutting interest rates, calling him a ""major loser"", in a social media post on Monday, which raised concerns about the president's influence over the central bank. BofA's shareholders also voted on other management proposals, but rejected all individual shareholder proposals. These individual proposals included a request to the board to annually report on the alignment of its lobbying and policy influence activities with regard to its 2030 sectoral emissions reduction and 2050 net zero targets. BofA had joined other major U.S. banks to leave the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, one of the world's top banking sector climate coalitions in recent months. BofA topped estimates for first-quarter profit as interest income grew and volatile markets helped its stock traders rake in a record haul.

LOS ANGELES, CA — Four ""crime tourists"" are facing federal charges stemming from accusations they stole $10,000 from a person who had just withdrawn the cash from an ATM in Los Feliz, according to the U.S. Attorney' Office. Authorities claim the group — one man and three women — were caught red-handed committing the April 16 theft, as they were being surveilled in connection to a similar theft of a Rolex in Orange County earlier this year, according to the criminal complaint obtained by Patch. In this case, authorities say one of the women was inside a Vermont Avenue Bank of America scouting for victims. There, she let a person cut in front of her in the ATM line and that person withdrew $10,000, ATF Special Agent Wyatt Haccou wrote in court documents. After that, the woman and her group followed the victim via car from the ATM to a 76 gas station at Melrose and Vermont avenues. While the victim was at the gas pump, the group found the $10,000 inside the vehicle's center console and took off with it, according to prosecutors. ATF agents watched the theft unfold and followed the group in their vehicle to a residence near Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue, where they arrested the four suspects, prosecutors said. Several of the suspects said they commit these types of crimes in order to send money back to their families, according to prosecutors. All four were charged with conspiracy to transport, transmit or transfer at least $5,000 of stolen money in interstate or foreign commerce: Javier Jesús Cordoza Araújo, 41, of Venezuela; Ingrid Carolina Medina, 40, of Colombia; Gladys Gruz Navarro, 62, of Venezuela; and Guadalupe Delcristo Martínez, 46, of Mexico. The ATF was surveilling the group as part of the investigation into the theft of a $100,000 Rolex from a vehicle in Orange County. Authorities suspect the watch was stolen by one of the group members from a victim's vehicle after the victim had been shopping at a jewelry store, according to court documents."

This post may contain links from our sponsors and affiliates, and Flywheel Publishing may receive compensation for actions taken through them. Key Points A Reddit user is concerned because Bank of America cut his credit limit. He’s not sure why his limit was reduced by over $5,000. Possible reasons for a credit limit reduction include not using the card enough, or banks becoming concerned about your debt. Finding the best credit card just got a lot easier. We’ve assembled a list of cards with unlimited cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 fees, and more. See the list for yourself. You can click here to get started. A Reddit user is upset that his Bank of America credit card just had its limit slashed. While the poster originally had an $11,000 balance, his limit has now been cut by over $5,000, which he discovered when he tried to use the card and it was declined. The original poster (OP) wanted to know why the card had been declined, and other posters chimed in with some possible reasons. Why did the bank cut the poster&#8217;s credit limit? Of course, the only way to get a clear answer on why the poster had his credit limit cut would be to call Bank of America directly and see if he can find out. However, there are a number of possible explanations. Some Redditors said that the issue might be that the OP wasn&#8217;t using the card very much. Many banks will reduce your credit line, or even close your card entirely, if the card is dormant. Since it&#8217;s typically not a good thing to see old credit cards shut down or to have your credit limit reduced, this is why it is a good idea to use your card on occasion. Even if you don&#8217;t use the card often because you have moved on to others, charge one or two small purchases every few months and pay them off just to keep the card active. Other Redditors said that the credit limit decline may have happened if the banks ran a credit check and saw signs of red flags that could suggest the OP was getting into financial trouble. One poster who replied explained that credit card companies may reduce your credit limit if they sense economic turmoil based on a review of your finances, as they want to limit their risk exposure. Since the poster here said he has been carrying a balance on some cards, and he had started using the Bank of America card a lot more recently, the most likely reason for the cut in this case is that the bank got nervous he was getting too deeply into debt. How to build good credit using your credit cards Unfortunately, the OP is not in a great situation here because having a credit line cut can hurt your credit score by reducing the amount of available credit that you have available to you. Credit utilization is the second most important factor in the credit scoring formula, and it is determined by dividing the credit used by the credit available. Since the OP has now had his credit line cut, at the same time as he said he is carrying balances, he could see a big decline in his credit score due to the reduction in his account limit. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s not a whole lot he can do about that unless he can get Bank of America or some of his other card issuers to raise his limit again, or unless he can start paying down his debt. The reality is, credit cards can be a great tool to help you build credit, but you need to be smart about how to use them in order to make that happen. You should research to find a great cash back card or two, use the cards regularly to develop a positive payment history, but keep your balance below 30%, and pay off the bill in full every month. If you do that, hopefully your card can help you build a great score that helps ensure banks want to give you as much credit as possible, rather than cutting your limit for reasons you don&#8217;t understand.

Orthocell Ltd CEO and managing director Paul Anderson earlier this week spoke with Proactive after the company reported record revenue for the June 2025 quarter, citing strong uptake of its flagship Remplir nerve repair product. Highlights The company said quarterly revenue reached A$2.73 million, representing a 22.80 percent increase compared to the previous quarter. Orthocell highlighted that this growth reflected continued adoption across Australia, with more than 206 surgeons now using Remplir in over 166 hospitals. Anderson told investors that the commercial launch in Australia has been a “spectacular” success. The company noted that none of the reported revenue was generated in the United States, where it recently completed its first procedure. Orthocell said it has established a distribution network in the US, comprising 14 distributors and more than 100 representatives across 21 states. The company expects this infrastructure will drive further growth as the product is adopted by additional hospitals and surgeons. Anderson stated that preparations over the past two years have positioned the company to scale internationally. He said, “It leaves us in such a strong position,” adding that the lessons learned in Australia will inform the US commercial rollout. Potential catalysts for investors include increased US revenue contributions, further hospital engagements, and broader clinical use of Remplir. Orthocell also expects rising adoption rates in Australia to continue contributing to revenue momentum over the coming financial year. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL, ETR:APC) continues to show strength in its Services business, with global App Store revenue estimated to have increased by 12% year-over-year in June, according to Bank of America analysts. The firm maintains its ‘Buy’ rating on Apple and $235 price target, pointing to strong capital returns, leadership in on-device AI, and ongoing revenue diversification within the App Store. Bank of America estimates App Store revenues reached $8.4 billion in fiscal Q3 2025, up 11.5% year-over-year, based on developer-level data from SensorTower. Downloads across iPhone and iPad rose 4.3% year-over-year to 8.6 billion in the quarter, with dollars per download increasing to $0.98, a 6.9% improvement. “For the month of June, App Store revenue increased 12% year-over-year globally, outpacing app store download growth of 3% year-over-year,” analysts noted. Despite regulatory scrutiny and the Epic Games ruling, Bank of America analysts say there's no evidence of a material impact to App Store monetization. “We do not observe any indication of adverse impact on app store revenue,” they wrote, even as trends toward off-app payments become more common. The bank believes investor concerns around the ruling’s severity “appear to be moot.” The report also highlights a notable shift in App Store revenue mix, with gaming losing ground to other categories. While games still generate the largest share of revenue, their portion has dropped from over 50% to 45% in fiscal Q3. “Games remain as the leader of the global app store revenue by category list, though their share has declined,” the analysts wrote. Categories such as Photo & Video, Lifestyle, Books, Education, and Utilities each gained 100 basis points year-over-year, while Productivity jumped 200 basis points, the largest gain of any group. “This mix shift, albeit not as meaningful currently, may signal legacy game developers to diversify into non-games or expand existing in-app purchasing options,” Bank of America wrote. “We believe either scenario in the ensuing years could be a long-term tailwind for Apple’s App Store revenue.” Additionally, the top 10 developers globally now account for nearly a quarter of Apple’s year-to-date App Store revenue, according to the firm’s analysis. This group includes both single-app players like ChatGPT, FUNFLY, and Tinder, as well as diversified developers like Tencent, Google, and TikTok, which maintain broad app portfolios spanning entertainment, utilities, and productivity. Impact of US-Vietnam trade deal Meanwhile, proposed tariffs on goods exported from Vietnam into the US will have a minimal impact on Apple, analysts at UBS believe. While Vietnam has become an increasingly important part of the tech giant’s supply chain diversification strategy, the analysts highlighted that the region still accounts for only a small fraction, roughly 5%, of Apple’s global supply chain footprint. “Given the relatively small physical footprint and focus on ancillary products, a 20% tariff on imports into the US will have a negligible impact on Apple margins in our view,” they wrote. They see the financial impact as a “gross margin rounding error.” UBS estimates that approximately 35 Apple suppliers operate around 38 discrete facilities in Vietnam, concentrated in areas like Bac Giang, Bac Ninh, Hai Phong, Phu Tho, and Vinh Phuc. In comparison, mainland China still dominates the supply chain, representing over 35% of Apple’s supplier locations globally. UBS has a ‘Neutral’ rating and $210 price target on Apple, based on about 28 times their calendar year 2026 earnings per share (EPS) estimate, reflecting a higher equity risk premium and interest rates. “We note our financial projections reflect the impact of the proposed tariffs in the June quarter but not beyond given the fluid nature of the discussions,” they wrote. Shares of Apple finished Thursday’s trading session at about $213."

Asking 'why' repeatedly is crucial for investors to understand the root causes of macroeconomic shifts and avoid being blind sided by market disruptions. The current U.S. policy shift favors growth over inflation control, increasing risks of higher inflation and short-term debt refinancing challenges. Given these risks, I recommend increasing exposure to real assets, REITs, and cyclical value stocks for inflation protection and potential outperformance."

HAUPPAUGE, NY — A free farmers market for people 65 and older is coming to Long Island Cares, the food bank announced in partnership with PSEG Long Island. The drive is scheduled for 9 a.m. to noon Wednesday at the Long Island Cares Center for Community Engagement, at 75 Davids Drive, Hauppauge. The food bank plans to give away more than a dozen locally sourced fresh produce items, thanks to a grant from PSEG Long Island. Two Long Island Cares nutritionists will be doing cooking demonstrations and educating seniors on the value of the food the charity is giving them. ""Magic happens when like-minded entities come together for the betterment of the community,"" Jessica Rosati, Long Island Cares vice president for programs and community services, told Patch. Rosati said the PSEG Long Island and Long Island Cares partnership is a ""clear and successful example."" The seniors farmers market is open to any Long Island senior in need of fresh food. The outdoor event will run rain or shine and be first-come, first-served. When seniors arrive, they provide their demographic information to Long Island Cares staff. They will then be guided to PSEG Long Island for a re-usable tote and information. They are then welcome to select items from the fresh market, Rosati said. This year, Long Island Cares will be showcasing its newest program ""Farm to Truck,"" a mobile farmers market, during this event. The truck was made possible by a $250K grant from Bank of America. The food bank is in its fourth year facilitating community events in partnership with PSEG Long Island. ""Each year, it gets larger, and better than the last,"" Rosati said. Michael Presti, PSEG Long Island director of customer experience and marketing, said the company is proud to partner with Long Island Cares to provide seniors and veterans in the community with hundreds of pounds of fresh produce, Thanksgiving turkeys and fixings, and other items at the six community events that PSEG Long Island sponsors. ""At each event, dozens of PSEG Long Island employee-volunteers help participants shop, carry their bags, and we have customer advocates available to share information on our financial programs and money-saving tips,"" Presti said. ""We also provide hundreds of LED lightbulbs and reusable shopping bags to hold their items. This is the third year we are partnering with Long Island Cares to support these communities, who are our neighbors and customers. Part of PSEG Long Island’s core commitments is to support our communities. Seniors are a large part of our community — our neighbors and friends. Some seniors struggle to put food on the table and pay bills. These initiatives provide support for our seniors directly where they need it."" Each year, Long Island Cares ends its series with a market and resource fair. Long Island Cares stated it is dedicated to serving seniors, both where they live and at events. More than 1,500 seniors a month are served by Long Island Cares's various programs. Another farmers market and resource fair is scheduled for Aug. 6, also at the food bank's Center for Community Engagement. Patch has partnered with Feeding America since 2020 to help raise awareness in our local communities of hunger, a persistent national problem exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Feeding America, which supports 200 food banks and 60,000 local meals programs across the country, estimates that nearly 34 million people, including 9 million children — about 1 in 6 Americans — are living with food insecurity. This is a Patch social good project; Feeding America receives 100 percent of donations. Find out how you can donate in your community or find a food pantry near you."

The Omaha of Nebraska has amassed a fortune of $145.3 billion as of mid-2025 since making his first investment at the ripe age of 11. Now that he&#8217;s 94 years old, Buffett has become better with age, making him one of the most successful investors who ever lived. Fortunately, Buffett has shared investment nuggets along the way from which investors can glean to build their own winning strategies, formulas that fit both their risk tolerance, financial goals and budget. While Buffett is known for investing in individual stocks, those whose business models are simple enough to understand, he is ultimately an investor who is in it for the long haul. Similarly, ETFs are designed to let investors ride the market wave without having to make frequent changes if they don&#8217;t want to. That is why we believe we&#8217;ve identified three ETFs that Buffett himself would approve of for the average investor in July. iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF) Considering Warren Buffett&#8217;s inaugural investment was famously in a bank—Cities Service preferred shares—and financial institutions remain a lighthouse for his investment decisions, it makes sense to begin our exploration here. Our first pick: the iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF). And with Buffett&#8217;s own Berkshire Hathaway counted among this ETF&#8217;s top holdings, it would likely appeal to the Oracle of Omaha. In addition to banks, IYF targets exposure to the insurance sector, playing into the hands of Buffett&#8217;s affinity for insurance, which he has called the &#8220;engine&#8221; that has powered Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s performance for decades. The IYF ETF boasts a lineup of colossal financial institutions like JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), offering investors access to stable banks renowned for their robust balance sheets. These titans of finance have a demonstrated history of navigating—and profiting through—evolving market cycles. This resilience can significantly benefit investors, especially when these institutions commit to enhancing shareholder value through activities like stock buybacks. Even in economic climates with elevated interest rates, banks often find an advantage, benefiting from higher loan rates for borrowers while simultaneously attracting savers with compelling yields. Investors have also been betting on the likelihood of lower interest rates, a phenomenon that could take hold as soon as July at the next Fed meeting. This optimism has benefited the iShares U.S. Financials ETF, sending the fund to revisit its 52-week high level of approximately $123 recently, offering investors an opportunity to potentially ride this wave in July. As of early July, the IYF ETF has delivered returns of 10.8%, nearly doubling the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s returns of 6.75% over the same stretch. Over the past year, this financials ETF boasts a total return of 19.5%, in line with its benchmark index, the Russell 1000 Financials 40 Act 15/22.5 Daily Capped Index (USD). With an expense ratio of 0.39%, investors won&#8217;t have to worry about having to overpay: If you invest $10,000 in IYF, you would pay approximately $39 in fees per year. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Next up is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD). Not only does this ETF deliver consistent income, but one of its core components is yet another Warren Buffett favorite: Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). The iconic beverage giant commands a 4.3% slice of the SCHD ETF, and remarkably, represents a whopping 9.7% of Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s total portfolio. Within the SCHD ETF, Coca-Cola is joined by fellow dividend stalwarts like Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), Altria Group (NYSE: MO) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT). These companies have built reputations for consistently returning value to shareholders through robust dividends, making them almost a guaranteed fit for Buffett&#8217;s investing playbook. Their predictable cash flows and essential products underpin a long history of rewarding shareholders, a characteristic central to Buffett&#8217;s philosophy. While Buffett&#8217;s company, Berkshire Hathaway, isn&#8217;t a dividend-paying stock itself, that certainly doesn&#8217;t mean he discounts their power. Buffett has openly championed dividend-paying stocks as a shrewd strategy for investors on the hunt for steady income. Perhaps the most convincing evidence lies in Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s top holding—Coca-Cola—a stock that diligently pays a dividend, which Buffett has no intentions of selling anytime soon. Its global brand power and consistent profitability make it a perpetual cash cow for Berkshire&#8217;s coffers. In early 2025, Coca-Cola announced its 63rd straight annual dividend hike, lifting its quarterly payout by 5.2% to $0.51 per share. Considering Buffett owns approximately 400 million shares of Coca-Cola stock, his company is effectively raking in over $800 million each year in dividend checks. Coca-Cola stock is also up 14.5% year-to-date, offering investors the added bonus of capital appreciation alongside their income. As for the broader Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, it meticulously tracks the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. With an incredibly modest expense ratio of just 0.060%, the SCHD ETF boasts over 100 holdings, granting shareholders a strong degree of diversification for protection. The fund’s underlying strategy prioritizes quality over quantity, avoiding risky high-yielding dividend stocks. Instead, it favors companies with long, proven track records of reliable payouts, offering investors a more reliable income stream and reduced volatility. This disciplined approach means even when the fund&#8217;s overall value experiences a dip, as it appears to have done in this wild 2025, investors still receive the benefit of earning consistent income through dividend distributions—which, Buffett seems to agree, is the ultimate icing on the cake for dividend stock investors anyway. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) is a popular ETF known for its exposure to some high-flying technology stocks, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). In fact, most of its top-10 holdings are technology stocks, with the exception of Costco Wholesale (Nasdaq: COST). While Warren Buffett isn&#8217;t known for his technology prowess, favoring instead businesses with more simple models, he has warmed up to the technology sector in recent years. Today, Apple and Amazon comprise 21.7% and 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s portfolio, respectively. Apple is one of only a handful of Buffett&#8217;s technology stocks, which he began adding nearly a decade ago. The billionaire investor dove in head first with a $1 billion investment, making the iPhone maker one of the top holdings of Berkshire&#8217;s portfolio. Today Apple remains a key holding, with Berkshire&#8217;s investment worth over $64 billion. Buffett also bemoaned his hesitancy to add Amazon stock sooner than he did, kicking himself for for being &#8220;too dumb.&#8221; But he won&#8217;t make that mistake twice, and his AMZN holdings are now worth $2.2 billion in the Berkshire portfolio. Given their high-growth nature, the companies that make up the QQQ ETF are heavy capex spenders. While this strategy comes with an inherent amount of risk, which is the first group to be punished in challenging economic environments, the payoff can be equally as rewarding. And when it comes to capital appreciation, QQQ doesn&#8217;t disappoint. The QQQ ETF has delivered impressive long-term returns, outshining the S&amp;P 500 in seven out of the past 10 years. Investors who directed $10,000 invested in Invesco QQQ in 2020 would have seen their investment balloon to approximately $22,976 today. So far in 2025, QQQ posted a strong year-to-date gain of approximately 8%; at this pace, it will replicate last year&#8217;s returns of approximately 16%. Investors also receive a rather efficient expense ratio of just 0.20%, making it a cost-effective investment vehicle for access to Big Tech stocks, among other sector leaders. Investors with an appetite for risk and growth might find the QQQ appealing while also seizing the opportunity to hold a couple of Warren Buffett favorites.The post Here Are 3 ETFs Warren Buffett Would Approve Of for the Average Investor appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Key Points The bank consolidations caused by the 2008 subprime mortgage banking meltdown wound up favoring large corporations for ongoing business at the expense of smaller ones. The Business Development Company sector has filled the debt financing gap for small and medium sized businesses abandoned by the large banks after 2008. Due to BDC registration requirements for capital markets access, shareholders receive 90% of BDC profits, often resulting in double digit annual yields. It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. Prior to 2008, some of the more popular US banking institutions included: Lehman Brothers Bear Stearns Wachovia Bank Washington Mutual Merrill-Lynch IndyMac As depicted in the 2015 movie, The Long Short, the unsustainable subprime mortgage bubble wound up causing a banking industry meltdown. All of the banks in the list above despite decades of successful operations, were caught flatfooted and insolvent when the crash hit. The federal government was forced to trigger TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) which helped to shore up the balance sheets of the largest institutions. The leftover banks were steered towards the TARP recipients for acquisition, with Bear Stearns most notably being acquired by JP Morgan Chase at a fire-sale price of $2 per share. Unsurprisingly, turning around operations to remove red ink from balance sheets became the imperative of all of these new consolidated banks. For example, Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, which acquired Merrill-Lynch, issued a directive for brokers to close out accounts smaller than $200,000. An unforeseen casualty of the bank consolidations were the small and medium sized businesses that had been relying on the Washington Mutuals, et al. for their revolving credit lines, their inventory finance, and a panoply of other debt finance services. With millions of medium and small businesses suddenly stuck without financing options, Business Development Companies (BDCs) emerged to fill the gap, which has subsequently created a sizable standalone BDC category estimated to be over $350 billion and part of the larger $1.8 trillion private credit sector. As BDCs are registered with the SEC, they are treated comparably to REITs and thus, shareholders receive 90% of BDC profits. The five BDC examples below give a good example of the demand strength in the sector and the boost to entrepreneurship and business creation and the yields each offers investors. WhiteHorse Finance, Inc. WhiteHorse Finance has provided over $2.78 billion worth of financings since 2012, with a partiality to software companies. WhiteHorse Finance, Inc. (NASDAQ: WHF) Yield: 17.66% WhiteHorse Finance, Inc. is a Business Development Company that finances lower and mid-tier companies with growth capital in the form of senior secured notes or first lien notes. Headquartered in Miami, FL, WhiteHorse typically originates its debt underwritings in the $25 million to $50 million range for US companies in the $50 million to $350 million enterprise value category. It has deployed its $642 million portfolio to finance $2.78 billion across 260 transactions since going public in 2012. Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. Investment banking behemoth Goldman Sachs has a BDC industry presence under its own moniker. Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.(NYSE: GSBD) Yield: 14.13% The lucrative profits that well financed firms can avail themselves of in the BDC space have caused some of the aforementioned larger banks to get a foothold into it as well, after abandoning it years ago. Goldman Sachs is one of them. MSNBC’s Jim Cramer described Goldman Sachs recently as a firm with “a thirst that can’t be slaked without more deals.” Journalist Matt Taibbi dubbed Goldman Sachs, the prestigious (some would say nefarious) investment bank with the nickname, “Great Vampire Squid” due to it being “wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money” and its omnipresent shadow on any financial platform where money can be made. The self-descriptive Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. represents the Goldman Sachs BDC footprint. Stellus Capital Investment Corporation Orthotics producer Dr. Scholl&#8217;s is one of Stellus Capital Management&#8217;s 350+ financing clients. Stellus Capital Investment Corporation (NYSE: SCM) Yield: 11.47% Participating in both the private corporate debt and equity markets, Houston, TX headquartered Stellus Capital Investment Corp. finances deals for American and Canadian companies with EBITDA between $5 million and $50 million. With a $3.4 billion AUM warchest, Stellus has invested over $9.8 billion across 350+ investments since beginning over 20 years ago. The company currently has over 100 financings currently active. Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc. Carlyle Secured Lending is the BDC arm of Carlyle Group, best known for its financings in the aerospace and defense industries. Stock: Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc. (NASDAQ: CGBD) Yield: 12.93% Best known for its involvement with its aerospace and defense industry investments, NY based Carlyle Group has stakes in a number of other financial platforms. With a multi billion portfolio, Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc. is Carlyle Group’s entry into the BDC arena. Golub Capital BDC Inc. Small businesses and private credit financings that might be too small for most BDCs make up a sizable portion of Golub Capital&#8217;s clientele, and have helped it to earn its numerous awards. Golub Capital BDC Inc. (NASDAQ: GBDC) Yield: 10.65% Golub Capital BDC Inc. has an unbroken award winning decade-long streak in process, with its 2024 Lender of the Year win. In 2023, Golub Capital won all three Lender of the Year, Senior Lender of the Year, and BDC Manager of the Year in the Americas awards from Private Debt Investor (PDI), and has won 24 PDI awards since 2013. Its latest acknowledgement came this year from Newsweek, which listed Golub Capital BDC in its “America’s Greatest Midsize Workplaces” rankings.

Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) It wasn&#8217;t very long ago that passive income investors had to wait three full months before an exchange traded fund (ETF) would finally pay a dividend. Recently, however, an explosion in the number of ETFs has enabled more frequent cash distributions and powerful wealth-compounding possibilities. Five funds in particular are changing the ETF game with eye-catching yields and monthly cash payouts. Ambitious dividend harvesters can try out some of these funds or even, if they dare, buy all five of the following passive income ETF all-stars. MSTY, QQQI, and JEPQ for Tech Exposure All five of the ETFs featured today provide cash dividends/distributions each and every month. Yet, there are crucial differences between these funds, especially when it comes to their annual yields and risk profiles. To start off, I&#8217;ll direct your attention to an ETF that&#8217;s on the hotter end of the risk spectrum. I&#8217;m referring to the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSTY), which generates some income from U.S. Treasury bonds but mainly relies on option-trading strategies. More specifically, the MSTY ETF uses synthetic covered call strategies (or possibly synthetic covered call spread strategies) to indirectly derive income from Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock. As you may be aware, Microstrategy is a technology firm that aggressively invests in Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC). Since Microstrategy stock can be quite volatile and option-trading strategies can be risky, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF isn&#8217;t for the faint of heart. On the other hand, high risks can come with huge rewards as the MSTY ETF currently advertises a gigantic 72.93% annual distribution rate. While MSTY pays you every month and has an enormous annual yield, it&#8217;s not everybody&#8217;s cup of tea. Maybe you still want exposure to interesting technology companies but aren&#8217;t prepared to accept high risk. If so, then I&#8217;ve got two monthly-paying funds that emphasize the tech sector but aren&#8217;t overly volatile. The first one is the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI), which is centered around the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 stock index. This fund uses options-trading strategies to squeeze income from a basket of approximately 100 stocks, including NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). The NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF is reshaping portfolios by eliminating the need to pick individual tech stocks while also providing monthly income. In addition, QQQI&#8217;s 14.65% annual distribution rate will undoubtedly make it attractive to yield hunters. In a similar vein to QQQI, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) focuses on stocks in the NASDAQ 100. This fund collects income from 108 stocks that are mainly in the technology sector, and like MSTY and QQQI, the JEPQ ETF utilizes options-trading strategies. Thus, it shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising that the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF enables portfolio exposure to technology titans like NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon, Broadcom, and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). With a 12-month rolling dividend yield of 11.52%, the JEPQ ETF should impress any passive income enthusiast yearning for monthly wealth-building opportunities. SPYI and DIVO for Multi-Sector Diversification There&#8217;s no denying that audacious ETFs like MSTY, QQQI, and JEPQ are taking passive income investing to the next level. But then, you might prefer funds that venture beyond the technology sector while still paying out distributions each month. On that topic, I&#8217;ve got a pair of potent funds offering instant multi-sector diversification. One of them is the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). Instead of sticking to the NASDAQ 100, the SPYI ETF concentrates on the S&amp;P 500 and has around 500 stocks in its holdings. This fund can quickly diversify your portfolio across a wide variety of stocks and sectors. Within the SPYI ETF, you&#8217;ll see large-cap standouts like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Like the other funds on this list, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF relies on options-trading strategies to produce income. After you discover that SPYI features monthly cash payouts and a 12.15% annual distribution rate, you may find it hard to resist taking a share position. Rounding out this five-pack of passive income boundary breakers is the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO), which derives income from dividends and options-trading strategies based on 24 stocks. Those 24 stocks aren&#8217;t all tech stocks, mind you. Sure, you&#8217;ll find Microsoft stock in the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF&#8217;s holdings. However, you&#8217;ll also find non-tech-focused firms like Home Depot, Visa (NYSE:V), RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Maybe DIVO&#8217;s 4.73% annual distribution rate isn&#8217;t as mind-blowing as the other funds I&#8217;m highlighting today. Nevertheless, the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF&#8217;s diversified basket features some rock-solid companies and the fund&#8217;s monthly payouts will add up over the long run. As you can see, there are similarities but also important distinctions between MSTY, QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, and DIVO. All five of these ETFs are altering the landscape of passive income investing so, if you&#8217;re ready, feel free to try them out today.The post These 5 ETFs (MSTY, QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, DIVO) Are Reshaping Passive Income Portfolios appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Key Points The QDVO ETF offers a high annual yield and exposure to famous large-cap stocks. Meanwhile, the RSPA ETF is widely diversified but also pays big dividends. It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. If you&#8217;ve managed to save up $500,000 to invest in stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs), pat yourself on the back. You&#8217;re in a great position to earn tens of thousands of dollars in worry-free income each and every year. Two passive income powerhouses are particularly well-suited for investors seeking relatively safe dividends/distributions. With these two high-yield funds, you could generate $40,000 per year from a half-a-million-dollar account. So, let&#8217;s look at a pair of ETFs that could help you grow your fortune while you sleep soundly at night. QDVO: Tech Exposure, Decent Diversification It might sound risky to take $500,000 and equally divide it among just two funds. However, this plan can make sense if the two funds provide good diversification across well-known stocks. The first ETF that fits this description is the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF (NYSEARCA:QDVO). This ETF generates income from dividends and premium payments from writing/selling call options. Since the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF includes 42 stocks in its holdings, you&#8217;ll achieve diversification with just this one fund. Plus, you&#8217;ll get portfolio exposure to highly established technology giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). While the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF emphasizes large-cap technology stocks, it also includes non-tech names such as Visa (NYSE:V), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), and RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX). Consequently, your $500,000 portfolio won&#8217;t be too tech-heavy with the QDVO ETF. An added bonus of the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF is that it pays out its dividends/distributions on a monthly basis. Hence, there&#8217;s no need to wait three full months to start seeing the cash show up in your account. Getting down to the nitty-gritty, the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF offers an annual distribution rate of 9.87%, but also deducts 0.55% worth of operating expenses. This means that QDVO&#8217;s expected annualized net yield for investors would be 9.87% &#8211; 0.55%, or 9.32%. RSPA: High Yield, Hundreds of Famous Names Even though the the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF has plenty of benefits, you don&#8217;t have to pour an entire $500,000 account into one fund. Instead, you could allocate $250,000 toward QDVO and the remaining $250,000 into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF (NYSEARCA:RSPA). Generally based on the S&amp;P 500 index, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF has 524 stocks in its holdings. Moreover, it&#8217;s not too heavily allocated toward technology or any other sector, as the RSPA ETF places roughly equal weighting on each stock. Within the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF you&#8217;ll find technology luminaries like Microsoft, Apple, and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). Yet, you&#8217;ll also discover non-technology-focused firms such as PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Hence, you can massively diversify your portfolio with the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF and sleep all night long worry-free. Furthermore, there&#8217;s an added benefit with this fund because, like QDVO, RSPA pays out its distributions every month. The annual distribution rate for the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF is 9.13%, which is quite impressive. When we subtract the operating fees of 0.29% per year, the RSPA ETF should provide an expected net annual yield of 9.13% &#8211; 0.29%, or 8.84%. Getting $40,000 Each Year From Two ETFs Now, let&#8217;s do the math with these two terrific funds. For extra-wide diversification, you could put $250,000 into the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF and another $250,000 into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF. Then, your average expected net annual yield would be (9.32% + 8.84%) / 2, or 9.08%. Actually, your yield could be even higher if you reinvest the cash distributions every month, but let&#8217;s keep it simple and assume a 9.08% yield for now. After one year, assuming the two funds don&#8217;t reduce their distribution rates, you could expect to receive cash distributions totaling $500,000 x 9.08%, or $45,400. This allows some room for error, as it easily beats your goal of earning $40,000 in dividends/distributions. Of course, you should monitor the share prices of the two ETFs and not only the distribution rates. After all, you&#8217;ll want to see some share-price appreciation to further build your $500,000 nest egg. There&#8217;s no need to lose sleep over this issue, though, since the QDVO and RSPA ETFs should gain value over the long run. These two funds hold a variety of blue-chip stocks so you can rest easy while collecting $40,000 in cash every 12 months.The post How to Turn $500K into $40,000 in Annual Passive Income Without Losing Sleep appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

We will continue providing analysis in this live article. Still No Morgan Stanley Earnings 7:20 am by Eric Bleeker We still don&#8217;t have Morgan Stanley&#8217;s earnings out, but Bank of America&#8217;s have been released. The company beat on the bottom line but slightly missed on revenue. Shares are up 1.5% in premarket trading. Before Today&#039;s Earnings: A Look Back at Q1 7:00 am by Eric Bleeker With Morgan Stanley about to report its Q2 earnings, let&#8217;s look back at some key figures from their Q1 report. $MS | Morgan Stanley Q1&#8217;25 Earnings Highlights: • Adj. EPS: $2.60 • Revenue: $17.7B Q1 Segment Performance: • Institutional Securities Revenue: $9.0B ; UP +28% YoY • Wealth Management Revenue: $7.3B ; UP +15% YoY • Investment Management Revenue: $1.6B ; UP +16% YoY Other Key Q1 Metrics: • Effective Tax Rate: 21% (vs. 22% YoY) • CET1 Ratio: 15.3% CEO Commentary: &#8211; Edward N. Pick: &#8220;The Firm delivered a very strong quarter with $17.7 billion in revenue, $2.60 in EPS and a 23% return on tangible. Wealth added $94 billion of net new assets, bringing the Firm total to $7.7 trillion. Equities had a record $4 billion-plus quarter, which led to strong results across institutional securities. Morgan Stanley delivered returns while supporting clients, buying back stock opportunistically and building $2 billion of capital.&#8221; CFO Commentary: &#8211; Sharon Yeshaya: &#8220;The firm produced record revenues of $17.7 billion and EPS of $2.60 with a strong ROTCE of 23%. The results demonstrate the power of advice and supporting clients as the intermediary of capital across products and geographies, particularly during periods of uncertainty.&#8221; Strategic Updates: &#8211; The firm continues to invest in technology and automation to enhance operational efficiency and client service capabilities, while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation amidst market volatility. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) reports before the bell today. Large financial companies struggled yesterday. Stocks in the Financials sector declined 1.71%. Both Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) saw particularly steep declines after reporting earnings. Will Morgan Stanley plummet as well? We&#8217;ll be updating this live article with analysis after the company&#8217;s earnings drop. Let&#8217;s take a look at the need-to-know figures Wall Street is watching. Q2 Earnings Expectations Here are the key figures Wall Street is expecting when Morgan Stanley&#8217;s earnings release: Revenue: $16.02 billion EPS (Normalized): $1.98 Book Value/Share: $61.38 Net Income (GAAP): $3.14 Billion Key Areas to That Could Drive Today&#8217;s Performance What areas will determine whether Morgan Stanley&#8217;s stock rises or falls after today&#8217;s earnings release and conference call (scheduled for 8:30 a.m. ET). Wealth Management Margins: Last quarter normalized pre-tax margins for Wealth Management came in below their target (30 to 32%). With net interest income (NII) on the decline and exepnse pressures, any continued margin pressure in this unit could cause Morgan Stanley&#8217;s stock to sell off today. How Significant is NII Pressure: Wells Fargo shares fell yesterday on NII pressure and Morgan Stanley came in below many peers last quarter. If the company sees NII continue to trend down, it could be the primary area Wall Street focuses on today. Investment Banking Rebound: Investment banking was a bright spot in the first quarter. If Morgan Stanley speaks bullishly about its pipeline headed into the second half of the year and 2026, that could be a share price catalyst today.

NII Projected to $15.5B to $15.7B by Q4 7:25 am by Eric Bleeker This banking earnings season has been dominated by how banks are guiding net interest income, and Bank of America guided to $15.5B to $15.7B in Q4. That will likely be a number that analysts focus on in the company&#8217;s conference call which starts shortly. The Two Numbers to Watch 7:16 am by Eric Bleeker Bank of America just delivered $.89 in adjusted EPS versus estimates of $.86. Revenue came in at $26.5 billion, which is slightly below expectations of $26.73 billion in revenue. Shares are initially up 1.45% in premarket trading.

A Look Back at Bank of America&#039;s First Quarter 6:50 am by Eric Bleeker Before Bank of America reports its second-quarter earnings, let&#8217;s look back at how they fared in the prior quarter. Bank of America Q1&#8217;25 Earnings Highlights: • Adj. EPS: $0.90 ; UP +18% YoY • Revenue: $27.5B ; UP +6% YoY • Net Income: $7.4B ; UP +11% YoY • Return on Assets: 0.89%; UP +3 bps YoY • Return on Tangible Common Equity: 14%; UP +100 bps YoY • Deposits: Nearly $2 trillion; UP +8% from mid-2023 low Outlook: &#8211; Expectation for continued growth in net interest income (NII) driven by fixed-rate asset repricing and loan growth. &#8211; Anticipate stable deposit growth despite potential economic headwinds.

We saw good organic client activity, good growth in revenue and earnings, and we continue to invest in the future growth of our company.&#8221; CFO Commentary: &#8211; Alastair M. Borthwick: &#8220;We generated $7.4 billion in net income or $0.90 per diluted share this quarter, and that represents good growth over both last quarter and the year earlier period. Noninterest expense was $17.8 billion, up from the fourth quarter, driven by seasonally elevated payroll taxes and markets revenue-related costs of processing and incentives.&#8221; Strategic Updates: &#8211; Continued investment in commercial banking and wealth management to drive organic growth. &#8211; Focus on enhancing digital capabilities and customer engagement, with significant growth in digital interactions and sales. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) is reporting earnings this morning and we&#8217;ll be updating this article with live analysis once results hit. Yesterday, companies like Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) reported earnings that broadly beat expectations, but still saw their shares fall. One reason for the drops: financial stocks have generally seen a strong 2025 year-to-date. Wells Fargo was up more than 18% headed into earnings, so poor interest income guidance was enough to sink the stock. Bank of America has lagged many of its peers, with &#8216;just&#8217; a 4% return year-to-date. So, the stock may be able to see stronger performance if its results top Wall Street expectations. What Wall Street Expects When Bank of America Reports Here are the key figures to watch when Bank of America reports shortly: Revenue: $26.73 billion EPS (Normalized): $.86 Net Income (GAAP): $6.51 billion Book Value/Share: $36.85 3 Key Areas to Watch in Bank of America&#8217;s Conference Call Bank of America is hosting its conference call at 8 a.m. ET. Here are some key areas Wall Street will be watching: Net Interest Income Pressure: Wells Fargo&#8217;s shares fell today on NII pressure. It&#8217;s likely that Wall Street will be zeroed in on how much lower short-term rates could impact Bank of America&#8217;s net interest in the second half of the year. Revenue Growth and Expense Management: With sluggish growth projected in 2025, Bank of America can continue to grow profitability by keeping expense management in check and growing operating leverage. Investment Banking Trends: Bank of America saw stronger investment banking business last quarter. Was the bounce temporary or the beginning of sustained growth in the division?

Key Points You can use diversified ETFs (QQQI, SPYI) to generate the bulk of your passive income in retirement. To boost your monthly income potential, try a few high-yield funds that focus on single stocks (APLY, GOOY, AMZY, NVDY). It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. Retirement is almost here? No need to fear! Even if your monthly goal of earning $5,000 in dividends starts in just three months, it&#8217;s possible to achieve this by carefully investing in high-yield exchange traded funds (ETFs). To get dividends/distributions totaling $5,000 per month or $60,000 per year, you can use a combination of diversified income-producing ETFs and single-stock-focused funds. Assuming you&#8217;ll have saved up $500,000 for retirement three years from now, you will need to achieve a 12% average annual yield to get $60,000 worth of income per year. The plan is to allocate 80% of your investable capital toward a pair a diversified ETFs that offer annual yields of around 12% to 15%. Then, to put you decisively above the $5,000-per-month threshold, you could invest the remaining 20% of your retirement funds in a few ETFs that derive high yields from single stocks. So, let&#8217;s dive right in and see how this powerful plan works. 2 Diversified ETFs With High Yields The first part of the plan is to devote 80% of your investable retirement savings toward two diversified ETFs. More specifically you can allocate 40% of your capital toward the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) and other 40% toward the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). To earn passive income of $5,000 per month when you retire in three years, you&#8217;ll need to achieve at least 12% average annual yield on a $500,000 investment. The NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF exceeds the 12% objective with an annual distribution rate of 14.65%. You&#8217;ll end up paying annualized operating fees of 0.68%, but even after subtracting that, QQQI&#8217;s yield would still be above 12%. There&#8217;s still the question of whether this is safe yield, though. I would assess the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF as reasonably safe because this diversified fund invests in approximately 100 well-known technology firms. Based on the NASDAQ 100 index, the QQQI ETF&#8217;s holdings include tech leaders like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Furthermore, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF pays out its cash distributions each and every month. Consequently, you may be able to take advantage of the compounding effect by reinvesting the distributions. For even more diversification, you can match your QQQI allocation with an equal-sized investment in the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF. Centered around the prestigious S&amp;P 500 large-cap stock index, the SPYI ETF includes around 500 stocks in its list of holdings. You&#8217;ll probably recognize many of the names on that holdings list, such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Since the fund includes so many famous names across multiple market sectors, you can invest in the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF with confidence. Like QQQI, the SPYI ETF pays its distributions on a monthly basis, so that&#8217;s a nice benefit. Will the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF achieve a 12% yield, though? The fund currently advertises an annual distribution rate of 12.15%, but you&#8217;ll have to pay operating fees totaling 0.68%. Remember, though, that you can invest equally in the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF and the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF. That way, you should average 12% yield or more (assuming there are no distribution cuts) with 80% of your portfolio. Boost Your Yield With Single-Stock Funds Just to make sure that you&#8217;ll achieve at least $5,000 of monthly passive income, you can dedicate the remaining 20% of your portfolio toward a handful of single-stock funds. These ETFs are riskier because they&#8217;re not diversified, but their annual yields are quite impressive. I&#8217;m referring to four ETFs which all pay their distributions on a monthly basis. You can go here for detailed explanation of the four funds, but I&#8217;ll provide a quick summary right now. The YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:APLY) indirectly derives income from Apple stock. It advertises an annual distribution rate of 26.97% but you&#8217;ll have to deduct operating expenses of 1.06%. That still leaves you with an expected net yield of 26.97% &#8211; 1.06%, or 25.91%, which is nothing to sneeze at. Here are three similar ETFs to consider: The YieldMax GOOGL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:GOOY); based on the stock of Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL); annual distribution rate of 33.14% &#8211; 1.2% worth of operating expenses = expected net yield of 31.94%. The YieldMax AMZN Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMZY); based on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock; annual distribution rate of 47.52% &#8211; 1.17% worth of operating expenses = expected net yield of 46.35%. The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY); based on NVIDIA stock; annual distribution rate of 50.19% &#8211; 1.27% worth of operating expenses = expected net yield of 48.92%. Balancing Safety and Risk Since they involve more risk, you wouldn&#8217;t want to invest too much of your retirement money in APLY, GOOY, AMZY, and NVDY. However, it&#8217;s not excessive to allocate 5% toward each ETF for a total of 20%. After all, these are four gigantic technology firms and the huge yields will quickly boost your portfolio&#8217;s total yield above 12%. Besides, 80% of your investment account would be invested in the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF and the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF, which are safer because they&#8217;re more diversified. If you get started today, you can use these ETFs to build a safety-and-risk-balanced retirement portfolio generating $5,000 per month or more.The post Retiring in 3 Years and Need $5,000/Month—Here’s the Portfolio to Build Now appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Key Points The RSPA ETF will immediately turn the bulk of your $25,000 account into a diversified income machine. Smaller allocations into SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV will help you build a low-fee passive income foundation. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) How far can $25,000 get you? If you have a well-considered plan in place, you can actually turn your small account into a passive income factory. This can be done with a carefully selected group of high-yield, low-fee exchange traded funds (ETFs). With just $25,000, you can build a super-low-cost portfolio that consistently pays you cash dividends/distributions. Plus, you can de-risk your portfolio through multi-sector diversification and investment in famous large-cap companies. So, let&#8217;s start right now with a smart-money plan to extract sizable cash payouts from a small but growing account. Start With RSPA for Extra Diversification Out of a $25,000 account, you can confidently put $10,000 into just one ETF. That&#8217;s because the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF (NYSEARCA:RSPA) checks all of the right boxes for a small-sized high-growth portfolio. To populate a small-sized portfolio, I would want to use funds that invest in successful, blue-chip business. I would also insist that the ETFs should be diversified and need to have annual operating expenses below 0.5%. With a focus on companies in the prestigious S&amp;P 500 index, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF has 525 stocks in its holdings. Suffice it to say, then, that the RSPA ETF is widely diversified. When you examine the fund&#8217;s holdings list, you&#8217;ll find established large-cap leaders across multiple economic sectors. Some examples are Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED). An interesting feature of the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF is that each of the holdings has a small, roughly equal weighing to the other stocks in the fund. That way, you won&#8217;t over-invest in any single stock. In addition, the RSPA ETF is low-cost as it only deducts annualized operating fees of 0.29%. And for all of you yield hunters out there, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF currently features a 12-month distribution rate of 9.42%. All in all, this ultra-diversified fund is ideal for a $25,000 account and I would feel comfortable dedicating $10,000 toward RSPA. Expand Your Portfolio With SCHD and JEPQ Even though the RSPA ETF would already expose you to 500+ stocks, you still probably wouldn&#8217;t want to toss your entire $25,000 into just one fund. Consequently, we will now explore three more ETFs and, after conducting your own due diligence, you could invest $5,000 in each one of them. The first of these three intriguing funds is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and has a portfolio comprising 103 stocks. Again, we&#8217;re looking for famous large-cap names and multi-sector diversification. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF meets these expectations with recognizable stocks like Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Merck (NYSE:MRK), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF serves up a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.87% but only deducts 0.06% worth of annual operating expenses. Therefore, investors should have no objections to allocating $5,000 toward the SCHD ETF. Next up is the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ), which is centered around the technology-focused NASDAQ 100 index. This fund includes 107 stocks so you can participate in the growth of tech&#8217;s heavy hitters, such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Committing $5,000 of your $25,000 portfolio to the JEPQ ETF will unlock extra share-price appreciation potential from a variety of top tech firms. You&#8217;ll also get access to substantial cash distributions as the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF features an impressive 11.52% annual yield. We&#8217;re still sticking to the low-cost theme here since JEPQ only deducts operating fees of 0.35% per year. So, why not add some technology-fueled firepower to your small portfolio with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF? Round It Out With FDVV To round out your $25,000 passive-income plan, you could assign $5,000 toward the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:FDVV). Instead of concentrating on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, or NASDAQ 100, the FVDD ETF corresponds to the Fidelity High Dividend Index. Among the holdings list of the Fidelity High Dividend ETF, you&#8217;ll find large-cap superstars like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Visa (NYSE:V), Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Overall, you&#8217;ll get exposure to plenty of consistent dividend deliverers with FDVV. The other need-to-know stats are that the Fidelity High Dividend ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.07% but only deducts 0.16% in annualized operating expenses. With all of those benefits in mind, you can proudly add $5,000 worth of FDVV shares to your $25,000 account. Now, you&#8217;ve got a four-pack of funds with RSPA as your anchor as well as SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV for extra diversification. That&#8217;s a savvy plan to keep the fees to a minimum while turning your $25,000 account into a low-risk regular income producer.The post How to Build a Super Low Cost Passive Income Fund for Only $25,000 appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Bank of America's preferred dividends remain well-covered, with less than 5% of net profit needed to service them, ensuring strong income security.

Shares of Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) gained 2.33% over the past month, bringing its year-to-date gain to 15.02%. Since hitting its 2025 low on April 4, the stock is up nearly 40%. When the company reported Q2 earnings earlier in July, it announced mixed results with EPS of 89 cents versus analysts&#8217; expectations of 86 cents, and revenues of $26.61 billion versus expectations of $26.72 billion. It was the only major U.S. bank to fall short on revenue for the quarter. Since its Depression-era roots in San Francisco, Bank of America has weathered close to a century of wars and financial upheavals to rise as one of the top financial institutions in the US, ranking #2 behind JP Morgan Chase by asset size. Bank of America’s massive AUM heft made it a $45 billion “too big to fail” TARP bailout recipient during the 2008 subprime banking meltdown. It also acquired Wall Street investment banking stalwart Merrill-Lynch as a kicker. CEO Brian Moynihan has ruthlessly slashed operations to focus on growing assets under management with lower overhead. 24/7 Wall St. has analyzed the stock, industry, sector and the macro environment to forecast where shares of Bank of America could be heading over the next five years. Bank of American (BAC) Recent Stock Success After reaching its five-year high of $49.18 per share in January 2022, Bank of America has struggled to attain that level again. Efforts to climb higher had been thwarted, but after bottoming in late October 2023, the stock has rallied back gaining nearly 84% by the end of January 2025. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock&#8217;s performance over the next one, five and 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall St. aims to present some farther-looking insights based on Bank of America’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research.

Interest Sensitive Balance Sheet: The Federal Reserve&#8217;s Fed Funds rate hikes have boosted BAC&#8217;s net interest income (NII), but negatively impacted the stock price. Rate cuts might temporarily help lending and mortgage finance, but any renewed inflation signs will be red flags and could trigger further problems. 2. Net Interest Income: The rise in NII due to higher interest rates and corresponding robust loan interest rate growth has been a critical factor for that segment, but at the cost of higher default rates and lower transaction volumes. 3. Branch Growth: Expanding financial centers and branches into currently untapped demographic markets is a part of Bank of America’s “local” growth strategy. Its Branch Expansion agenda aims to have a presence in every state. The physical presence results in a 100% increase in digital sales, and looks to expand its 3,800 branches. 4. Technology: Improved digital offerings and the use of AI and other customer service tools, can boost customer satisfaction and fees that could boost earnings. 5. Capital Deployment Strategies: Bank of America&#8217;s dividend increases and share repurchase plans reflect a strong capital position, attractive to dividend hawk-oriented investors. Bank of America (BAC) Stock Prediction for 2025 The current Wall Street consensus, median one-year price target for Bank of America is $52.24, which represents 8.96% potential upside from today’s share price. BAC receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating from the 19 analysts covering the stock, with 16 assigning it as a &#8220;Buy,&#8221; three assigning it as a &#8220;Hold&#8221; and none assigning it as a &#8220;Sell.&#8221; 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s 12-month forecast for Bank of America is more conservative. We see BAC ending 2025 at a price of $47.20, or 1.54% lower than today&#8217;s share price. Bank of America (BAC) Stock Forecast 2025–2030 By 2030, the Branch Expansion program should have met its targeted location goals, and all of them would be primed for using the latest and most sophisticated Bank of America digital financial tools. Bank of America Erica(c) digital assistant, Zelle, Venmo, proprietary digital payment systems, online brokerage and other virtual platforms would be fully implemented and income generating. 24/7 Wall St.’s price target for 2030 is $63.96 per share, representing a potential gain of 33.41% from the current share price.

Credit card companies offer various perks to attract and retain customers. You may get a good welcome bonus if you spend enough money within a few months, and you will also likely receive points or cash back on every purchase. However, a Fat FIRE advocate recently expressed dissatisfaction with Amex Platinum. This individual no longer feels valued by the company despite spending $50,000 each month. Other Redditors jumped into the comments to share their thoughts about this trend and recommend some ways to maximize credit card benefits. Key Points Some credit card companies don&#8217;t have the same reward structures that made them so popular. A Redditor who spends more than $50,000 per month is looking for alternatives after AMEX fell below their expectations. It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. Use Bank Of America The top commenter suggested putting $100,000 into a Merrill Lynch or Bank of America account and then using the company&#8217;s Visa card for maximum benefits. This setup will net you 3.5% cashback on travel and dining, plus 2.625% cashback on everything else. The recommendation came from someone who was fed up with using different credit cards for different categories and opening a bunch of cards just for their bonuses. This route can save you a lot of time while allowing you to secure top-tier rewards. Bank of America also doesn&#8217;t have an annual membership fee that is tied to those benefits. To top it all off, there are a lot of expenses that count as travel and dining, even if it&#8217;s not obvious. &#8220;They are *extremely* generous about how they code for travel and dining. For example, I pay monthly maintenance expenses on several rental properties with the card. Magically, that&#8217;s counted as lodging, so I get 3.5% back,&#8221; the top commenter stated. Fees Add Up The original poster isn&#8217;t the only one who&#8217;s fed up with Amex cards. One Redditor commented that the Amex Centurion card isn&#8217;t as good as it used to be, despite paying roughly $5,000 in fees. The Redditor got plenty of upvotes from that comment. You can choose from many credit cards that do not have annual fees. If you don&#8217;t have to contend with an annual fee, all of your rewards are pure profit as long as you pay off your credit card balance at the end of each month. Plenty of credit cards offer unlimited 2% cashback on every purchase, and that may be enough to edge out some of the credit cards with annual fees. While big spenders may be able to justify the high annual fee, it isn&#8217;t worth it for everyone. Travelers Benefit The Most From High-End Credit Cards Another Redditor mentioned that most of the top-tier credit cards only serve people who travel often. While this setup benefits regular travelers, it&#8217;s important to keep this distinction in mind if you do not travel. It&#8217;s important to view each credit card while considering how you spend your money and what you want out of life. Some people enjoy traveling, but opting for a simple cashback credit card may be the better choice for others. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re getting the deal of a lifetime if you enjoy boarding airplanes and going to new destinations. Some Redditors criticized the travel portals of various credit cards. They said that hotel and car prices include travel agent markups and are not competitive. It&#8217;s always good to review the numbers before opening a card or making any big travel purchases to ensure you are getting the best deal.
