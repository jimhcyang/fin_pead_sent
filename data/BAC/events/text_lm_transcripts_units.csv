Before I pass the call to Paul to review the fourth quarter, I want to hit a few points. First I want to provide some brief commentary on 2020 for the full year then talk about what we see in the economy as we enter 2021, and then highlight some areas where I believe we made strong strategic progress that will drive momentum into 2021 and beyond. So starting on slide two. 2020 was a tough operating environment as you all know. In that period, we generated net income of nearly $18 billion or $1.87 in EPS and earned a return above our cost of capital. Our EPS was down 32% compared to 2019 driven by the impacts of coronavirus pandemic on the company and the economy. As you know, the Fed dropped rates to nearly zero. Longer rates also fell to historic lows. Loan demand surged and then waned as the panic subsided. That reduced net interest income. But as we told you last quarter that we believed that NII had likely bottomed in the third quarter of 2019. In fact, we saw a modest improvement this quarter which Paul will cover later despite the challenges from lower loans. Non-interest revenue declined slightly, but included some interesting dynamics highlighting diversity of Bank of America's model. Consumer fees declined driven by the activity levels of clients, but also by higher account balances and customer accounts. That's a good thing for the economy going forward. Our business mix allowed us to benefit from more market-related activities in sales and trading, investment banking and investment brokerage in the wealth management businesses. Our full year revenue of $15 billion from sales and trading rose 17% and we generated more than $7 billion of Investment Banking revenues this year an increase of 27% over last year.",310.0,168.0,6.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.02976190476190476,0.023809523809523808,0.0,0.0,0.005952380952380952

As I did last quarter, I will mostly compare our results relative to Q3, as most investors we speak with are more interested in our progress as we transverse the pandemic rather than in comparison to pre-pandemic periods. In Q4, we earned $5.5 billion or $0.59 per share, which compares to $4.9 billion or $0.51 a share in Q3. Compared to Q3, the earnings improvement was driven by lower provision expense, as we released $828 million in reserves, nearly offsetting net charge-offs, which also declined. Also benefiting earnings, expenses declined $474 million from Q3 on lower litigation costs, and NII moved from the Q3 trough. Non-interest income declined from Q3, but results across individual line items were mixed. First, the decline in other income was driven by seasonal client activity with respect to ESG investments, which created higher partnership losses, but benefited our annual tax rate, as I have described in previous discussions. Our tax rate for the year was 6%. If we adjust for the tax benefit of our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been roughly 21%. I point this out to emphasize that the full year tax benefits of the socially responsible investments more than offset the portion of losses recorded in other income throughout the year. Relative to Q3, non-interest income was also impacted by lower sales and trading, which typically slows from Q3 to Q4. But, while sales and trading revenue was down linked-quarter, year-over-year it was up 7%. On the positive side, non-interest income benefited from higher asset management fees as the market improved. And we grew net new households again this year. And finally, we had another good quarter of Investment Banking revenue, which increased from both the strong Q3 levels and year-over-year. Also when comparing net income to Q3, remember, the Q3 tax expense benefited by $700 million from the revaluation of our UK deferred tax asset. Finally with respect to returns, note that our ROTCE was 11.7% and our ROA approached 80 basis points. Moving to slide 8, the balance sheet expanded $81 billion versus Q3 to $2.8 trillion in assets, total assets. The main point is that deposits are driving and funding substantially all of this growth. Deposits grew $93 billion in the quarter and are up $361 billion from Q4 2019. On the other hand, loans declined from Q3. With deposits up, loans down, excess liquidity is piling up in our cash and securities portfolios. Global Liquidity sources are up $367 billion year-over-year and $84 billion just from Q3. In fact, Global Liquidity is up so much that it now exceeds total loans. With respect to regulatory ratios, the standardized approach remains binding at 11.9% consistent with Q3. Shareholders' equity increased $4 billion, as earnings were more than three times the amount of common dividends paid plus we issued preferred stock totaling $1.1 billion. But, this was offset by higher RWA, as we invested more cash in securities. At 11.9%, our CET1 ratio is 240 basis points above our minimum requirement, which equates to a $36 billion capital cushion. Our TLAC ratio also increased and remains comfortably above our requirements. Before leaving the balance sheet, as usual, we provide the charts on slide 9 and 10 to show the historical trends with respect to average loans and deposits. For reference, we included these same charts on an end-of-period basis in the appendix. Overall, year-over-year, total loans are down 4%. And in the lines of business, they are down 2%. The decline year-over-year was driven by lower revolver utilization and other paydowns in commercial and by pullback in credit card activity. On slide 10 we provide the same trends by line of business for deposits. Brian already made a number of points on deposits and you can see the tremendous year-over-year growth in every line of business that led to 23% growth in deposits for the company. At $1.7 trillion in deposits far surpasses any previous record for deposits. We believe our strong deposit growth reflects our customers' overall experience with us, as we continue to innovate around digital capabilities, as well as enhance our nationwide physical footprint of financial centers and ATMs, which have continued to prove important to customers and clients. I will just add that, given historically low interest rates, our rate paid on deposits declined modestly linked-quarter and we are now lower than the rate paid to customers in 2015 before the Fed began raising rates. And I will point out that our interest cost on $1.7 trillion of deposits this quarter was only $159 million. Turning to slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis NII in Q4 was $10.25 billion, $10.37 billion on an FTE basis, while net interest income declined  million from Q3. The improvement from Q3 was driven by the increased deployment of excess deposits into securities. Lower loan balances, lower reinvestment rates and modestly higher mortgage-backed securities premium write-offs mitigated the improvement in NII. The net interest yield was relatively stable, declining only one basis point from the Q3 level. Note that given all the deposit growth, plus the low starting point with respect to interest rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains quite large and is a good reminder of the value of these deposit relationships. Now with respect to NII. As we move into 2021, we offer the following perspectives. Our perspective on NIIs assume that net interest rates follow the forward curve and do not move lower than current levels and that the economy does not take a meaningful step backwards as a result of recent negative COVID developments. With that said, first I would remind everyone that Q1 will be impacted by two less days of interest, which is a headwind of nearly $200 million. Also, seasonally, we would expect to see payments related to holiday spending result in lower card balances. We also have the continuing impact of higher-yielding assets maturing or paying off and being replaced with lower-yielding ones. Offsetting these headwinds we currently intend to again invest a portion of our excess deposits which continued to grow in Q4 into securities. Having listed those specific Q1 impacts, NII improvement, more generally, will depend on all the factors we are all focused on such as loan growth, PPP loan forgiveness and PPP new originations and mortgage refinancings, as well as mortgage-backed security payment speeds, which impact the write-off of bond premiums. Should those trends develop in a positive way, our NII and earnings will benefit. One final note on NII. We added a slide in the appendix that shows the difference between 2015 when short-term rates were last this low and today. The important difference between then and now is the growth in our balance sheet which improved NII and the decline in expenses since then. Speaking of expenses and turning to slide 12. Q4 expenses were $13.9 billion; $474 million lower than Q3. The decline was driven by a reduction in litigation expense. We also saw a reduction in COVID-related expenses, primarily those associated with processing claims for unemployment insurance. Higher planned marketing costs across the firm and revenue-related processing and incentives mitigated the reductions. As we move into 2021, remember, Q1 will include seasonally higher payroll tax expense, which we estimate at roughly $350 million. Given the resurgence of COVID cases across the U.S. and in Europe, we estimate that $300 million to $400 million of net COVID-related expense remained in our Q4 expenses. We continue to work hard to lower these types of expense, but not at the expense of the safety of our employees and customers. And outside of these COVID costs, we continue to manage expense tightly, using gains in productivity and digital activity to mitigate other increases. Turning to asset quality on slide 13. Our total net charge-offs this quarter were $881 million, or 38 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs continued to benefit from years of responsible growth, as well as government stimulus and loan deferral programs. A $91 million decline in net charge-offs was driven by lower credit card losses. The loss rate on credit card declined to a 20-year low of 206 basis points of average loans. Provision expense was $53 million, which not only reflected an improvement in macroeconomic projections, but also incorporated uncertainties that remain in the economy due to the health crisis. These considerations resulted in an $838 million reserve release this quarter, reducing consumer loan reserves by $621 million and commercial by $207 million. Our allowance as a percentage of loans and leases ended the year at 2.04%, which is well above the 1.27% where we began the year, following our day one adoption of the CECL accounting standards. With respect to key variables used in setting our reserve. As done in previous quarters, we continued to include a number of downside scenarios. Based on our Q4 2020 weighting of those scenarios, GDP is forecasted to return to its Q4 2019 level in the early part of 2022. This improved by a couple of quarters relative to Q3. The weighting scenario also resulted in an unemployment rate at the end of 2021, consistent where it is today, just north of 6.5%. On slide 14 we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. On the consumer front, COVID's effects on net charge-offs continued to remain benign. Overall, consumer net charge-offs declined $82 million, driven by card losses and remained near historic lows. We experienced modest increases in delinquency and NPL levels, but they remained low and were expected, given the deferral activity of customers. While expired deferrals drove consumer 30-day delinquency modestly higher compared to Q3, importantly, they remain 22% below the year-ago level. And, consumer deferral balances continued to decline in Q4, ending the year at $8 billion. Moreover, balances are now mostly consumer real estate-related with strong underlying collateral values. We added a slide in our appendix which further highlights delinquency trends for credit card. It shows a modest bulge of the expected deferral-related delinquencies moving their way through time and into the 90-plus bucket at year-end. As the bulge of deferral-related delinquencies passed through time periods, delinquencies receded. As an example, in Q4, five-day delinquencies were down more than 30% year-over-year which shows that after deferrals passed through this time period, delinquencies fell and stayed lower. So, assuming net losses follow their historical relationship to delinquencies in the 90-plus day bucket and no other changes in card payment trends, we would expect card losses to be higher in Q1 but then decline in Q2. Moving to commercial, net charge-offs were relatively flat to Q3 even as we sold some loans in affected industries, crystallizing losses but reducing risk. Overall, given the environment, the asset quality of our commercial loan book remained solid, and 89% of exposures were either investment-grade or collateralized. Our reservable criticized exposure metric continue to be the most heavily impacted by COVID and increased this quarter by $3 billion from Q3, led by downgrades -- downgraded exposures in commercial real estate primarily hotels. Importantly, commercial NPLs while up modestly, remained low at only 45 basis points of loans. Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 15. Consumer Banking throughout 2020, has been the segment most impacted -- most heavily impacted by COVID. It bore the brunt of revenue disruption from interest rates, customer activity and fee waivers. Reserve-building impacted provision expense. And expenses increased for PPP programs and protection of associates and customers. In Q4, compared to Q3, revenue, expenses and provision all improved. We earned six -- $2.6 billion in Consumer Banking in Q4 versus $2.1 billion in Q3. But with earnings still below prior year pre-pandemic levels, we know we still have plenty of room for improvement. Client momentum in this business continued to show strength around deposits and investment flows, while near-term loan growth was -- has been impacted by the decline in mortgage balances from heightened refinance activity. Looking at the components of the P&L linked-quarter, revenue growth included both higher NII and fees. Consumer fees reflected an increased level of holiday spending as well as higher investment account activity. Even as revenue moved higher expenses moved modestly lower, as we had a reduction in pandemic costs and continued to realize the benefits of a more digitally engaged customer base. As Brian noted, and as you can see on slide 17, we saw an improvement in digital enrollment. Most importantly, customer use of our digital capabilities increased with not only more sign-ons and higher digital sales, but also more service fulfillment through digital channels as reflected by volume growth in both Erica and Zelle. Note also that, both our rate paid and cost of deposit declined. Cost of deposits is now 135 basis points. In the past year, we added over 500,000 net new checking accounts grew deposits 23% and dropped our cost of deposits 17 basis points, even with the increase in costs associated with the pandemic. Let's skip to Wealth Management on slide 18 and 19. And I will refer to both slides, as I speak. Okay. Here again the impact of lower rates on a large deposit book pressured NII, impacting an otherwise solid quarter with positive AUM flows, market appreciation and solid deposit and loan growth. Net income of $836 million improved 12% from Q3, as revenue growth and improvement in provision exceeded, a modest increase in expense. With respect to revenue, NII grew driven by solid growth of both loans and deposits. And asset management fees grew to a new record on higher market valuations and solid flows. Expenses increased driven by revenue-related expense and investments in our sales force. Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank both continue to grow households, as we remain a provider of choice for affluent clients. Client balances rose to a record of more than $3.3 trillion up $302 billion year-over-year driven by higher market levels as well as positive client flows. Let's move to our Global Banking results on slide 20. COVID has also heavily impacted Global Banking due to lower interest rates, softer loan demand and higher credit costs. But here, again we saw improvement. The business earned nearly $1.7 billion in Q4 improving $751 million from Q3 driven by lower provision expense and improved revenue. On a year-over-year basis, earnings were $341 million lower, driven by NII. Looking at revenue and comparing to Q3, revenue improvement was driven by higher Investment Banking fees as well as more leasing activity associated with our clients' ESG investments. Investments Banking fees for the company of nearly $1.9 billion grew 5% from Q3 and were up 26% year-over-year. As Brian noted, this performance led to improved market share overall and in a number of key products. Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $266 million in Q4, compared to a build in reserves of $555 million in Q3. Non-interest expense was higher compared to the linked quarter and year-over-year, primarily reflecting investments in the platform as well as support for the PPP program and also reflecting the recording of merchant services expense, given the change in accounting versus the year-ago quarter. As Brian noted earlier, customers continued to appreciate the ease, safety and convenience of our digital banking capabilities. And usage continued to grow, helping defray other costs. We present some digital highlights on slide 22. As noted earlier, loans declined but saw stabilization late in the quarter. And continuing to trend since Q2, the spread of the loan portfolio continued to tick higher as spreads on new originations on average exceeded the average spread of the portfolio. Average deposits increased 26% relative to Q3 as businesses remained highly liquid. Okay. Switching to Global Markets on slide 23. Results reflect solid year-over-year improvement in revenue from sales and trading, but declined from the robust levels of Q3. As I usually do, I will talk about segment results, excluding DVA. This quarter net DVA was a small loss of $56 million. On that basis, Global Markets produced $834 million of earnings in Q4, a decline from the more robust trading in Q3, but up markedly from Q4 2019. Focusing on year-over-year revenue was up 13% on higher sales and trading. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by higher activity-based costs for both trading and unemployment claims processing. Sales and trading contributed $3.1 billion to revenue increasing 7% year-over-year, driven by a 30% improvement in equities and a 5% decline in FICC. The strength in equities was driven by market volatility and investment repositioning, which drove client activity higher. The decline in FICC reflected strong credit trading performance, which was more than offset by declines across most macro products and mortgage trading. As Brian noted, the year-over-year performance of this business has been strong in every quarter of 2020. You can see that on slide 24 and that produced strong segment returns of 15% on allocated capital for the year. Okay. Finally on slide 25, we show All Other which reported a loss of $425 million. Compared to Q3 the decline in net income, was driven primarily by the prior quarter's tax benefit of $700 million associated with our U.K. deferred tax asset. Revenue declined from Q3 driven by the accounting for wind and solar and other ESG investments. We also experienced some modest equity investment losses. Expenses declined from Q3 on lower litigation expense, but were partially offset by higher marketing costs. For 2021, absent any changes in the current tax laws or unusual items, we would expect the effective tax rate to be in the low double digits driven by the level of ESG client activity relative to pre-tax earnings. And with that, I'll turn it back to Lee and Brian for Q&A.",2943.0,1643.0,46.0,64.0,18.0,8.0,3.0,9.0,5.0,13.0,0.02799756542909312,0.038953134510042606,0.010955569080949483,0.004869141813755326,0.0018259281801582471,-0.010955569080949483

So, yes, flat year-over-year all-in number. And then we're working the dynamics underneath it. But importantly remember, we are investing $3.5 billion in technology next year, new financial centers expansion employees to help sell more, and we'll continue to drive it through.

I mean, you're making big strides with digital banking in so many ways with 39 million digital households are engaged. And you go through all those metrics and you see efficiency ratio for the quarter of 69%. And if you take out your $400 million of COVID cost, maybe it would be 67%, but that's still a far cry from the 57% to 59% where you had been. I know low rates hurt a little bit, but either you're investing more than your -- you've disclosed. Or are there some other COVID costs in there?

And so as we work that back up and ultimately as rates rise that $2 billion that's per quarter so $8 billion in revenue, with really no cost. That will go up. So we continue to get more efficient in the branch as the cost of operating over the deposit base is now at 1.35%, and we added 700,000 of checking accounts. So you're right it's -- but it's more affected by the revenue impact to NII than it is by anything else in terms of expenses. Remember, we're saying net COVID cost of $300 million or $400 million. That includes offsetting against that whole savings on travel and stuff. The gross costs are obviously much higher than that. We've got about -- just we opened up PPP today.

But I do think as you think about how you want to estimate and model NII and how it may unfold in 2021, I think it's really sort of helpful to kind of review the progress we made in 2020. There's a lot of clues there. Remember in Q1 of '20, interest rates fell to historically low levels. Short rates were down 150 and long rates were down 100 basis points plus loans declined significantly beginning in Q2 as demand weakened and larger companies accessed the capital markets to pay down debt and build liquidity.  In the past, when we've had situations like this where interest rates and/or loans have declined, it's always taken sort of several quarters to reach a point where renewed balance sheet growth was significant enough to compensate. We believe we found that NII bottom in Q3 and NII indeed moved higher in Q4. All else equal day count et cetera, it should become easier from here to grow NII. I think what helped us to start to grow again quickly in this crisis was the tremendous influx of deposits and our relatively recent confidence to invest the excess in securities instead of holding that excess in cash.  So our continued investment of that cash in Q4 leads us to believe that we can offset the headwinds of low loan demand in the near-term recent -- reinvestment yields and two less days of NII in Q1, leaving NII relatively flat in Q1 versus Q4 before moving up through the balance of the year. Remember in Q2 and Q3, we picked back up those days of interest we lost in Q1. As Brian reviewed, we also saw commercial loans stabilize at the end of Q4 providing hope that increased loan demand will soon follow. Given that we expect some loan demand through the year and using the existing rate curve, which has steepened over the past 90 days, we would expect NII in Q4 2021 for example to be much higher than Q1 2021. And when we get to the second half of 2021, year-over-year quarterly comparisons to 2020 as well as the second half of 2021 compared to the first half of '20 should be quite favorable.",384.0,186.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.026881720430107527,0.026881720430107527,0.016129032258064516,0.0,0.0,0.0

The big leverage point would be more deposit acquisitions in markets we're not and stuff like that, but we can't do it. It's illegal and has been for all the way back since GLBA or whatever it was 20, 30 years ago so or even before–. And then asset management, remember, we sold asset management because we believed that being the large distributor is the priority. So don't expect us -- we look at stuff from time-to-time like everybody does. But the way we're going to -- we built this company was organic growth and then delivering the capital back to the shareholders. And what's interesting, we'll see what the rules change. But remember that things like the SLR and the accommodations that were given, we didn't need and we have plenty of SLR. It doesn't have any constraint. It doesn't become an issue. Like you said even if you look at the SCB recalcs and stuff we've got plenty over that. So we will be aggressive on returning capital. We got basically two months to return those $3 billion and change we've got to return now. And then we'll see what the Fed instructions are and then we'll get after it as we move forward. And we look at things from time-to-time, but they -- there just isn't much to consider in the United States right now and the best answer is to continue development of this franchise on an organic basis and it works. If you look in the markets, we've expanded our brand system too.

I can give you a lot more -- there's lots of things in that line item, but the volatility is often driven certainly in the fourth quarter by those partnership losses. Other things in that line are equity investment gains, gains and losses on the sale of debt securities.

So, the good news is, is that we're reverting to norm. And so in December, for example, we had 198,000 booked accounts in credit card. That -- 191,000, that's the highest really going back to pre-COVID days, but we were running 300,000 back then. So we got some work to do to get it back to the full amount on the card side, for example. In terms of mortgage. Again, we are careful there, but also we're conservative on rates and we gone to look at that. So, we booked about $7 billion in the secured lending side including mortgage in the core consumer business. And so we feel better about that. Auto picked back up, but home equity is down to $0.5 billion a quarter or something like that when it was running $3 billion or something. So we've got some room to go. But the good news is the card is stable the balances are sort of stabilized. And at the 85 million you have some seasonality, but at least they stabilize there. And then the mortgage looks like we're picking back up a bit as we've made some adjustments and gone back to the more normalized underwriting, and auto has been strong. So we'll see it play out. But you're right, we had to pull back and have lost about half the credit card volume on a given month.

And this is about sort of the relationship side of commercial business, Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking, Global Corporate Investment Banking. Basically in March, April, we stopped prospecting frankly because it was sort of impossible to do plus you want to make sure you understood the portfolios. We've done quarterly portfolio reviews, every single loan going through to make sure the ratings are right make sure we understood with the customer to make sure we understood whether they're going to need covenant waivers. That over the course of the time here has sorted the group of customers which are in the industries that Paul talked about that are difficult. And the rest of the customers are solid in good shape. And frankly, their credit has been improving as we looked at it by quarter. And so about four months ago, we moved into prospecting with very narrow list of prospects for Business Bank and Global Commercial Banking think for middle market and upper end of small business across all our markets. But then recently we flipped and they can go back to full prospecting except for limited industries that you'd expect. On the small business side because of the nature of the business, it was a little more dramatic and we've opened back up. And we're getting -- we're up I think in the fourth quarter to give you a sense we were up 50% in terms of the originations quarter-over-quarter, but we're still -- we were up a lot more than that more than 50%. We're still down 50% year-over-year up 100-plus percent in quarter -- linked-quarter I think. And so new commitments up 135%; but year-over-year still down 47%. So that shows you that's coming through and we will see that happen in the small business side. So, that was probably the slowest because it's -- they are the most risk. And so that's the commercial side. When you go to the consumer side, the reality was we basically -- we stayed on LTVs on the commercial -- on the consumer mortgage side. We basically stopped with the FICO requirements we slowed down and do the market dynamics home equity slowed down. Auto, we went back out more quickly just because of the secured nature of and short-term nature of it. So, we felt good about that and probably we're always super prime and stayed there. But it's really what's changed in consumer in the last several -- last few months has been the move. And we're back to probably 80%, 90% of the ability to generate that we had. We were down probably 20% and we moved back up and so we'll see that flow through. But it was really just until you had some clarity where this thing was going you had to be careful for a while.

If you take our reserve setting weighting in other words what we set the reserve by December for year end 2020, because we set it before the statistics, the unemployment rate was 7.8% and for year end 2021 it was 6.6%. And obviously the actual was 100 basis points-plus below that. So, you would expect as you have more confidence that the forward path is into a narrower range and the forward probability two things are going to happen as you go forward. One is the sheer dollar volumes of site activity has changed and so you're dealing with less in terms of charge-offs and things like that which gives you confidence of where the path is. But most importantly, as you think about real reserve setting and lifetime reserves is that the economic assumptions are clarifying and the end of the COVID era is clarified with the vaccine. And as we see that you'll see the uncertainty come down pretty quickly on the other side of that when that shows up in our assumptions. So we weighted downside nearly 50% of the elements. That weighting will come down over time. And so when that comes down over time, you'll see the reserves releases come away from that. The second thing is as the duration of the rest of the crisis comes in with more certainty i.e. more people vaccinated, you also see the lifetime calculation include the other side of the river to a bigger and bigger portion and so that will drive it. So both of those things will change it. And as Paul said earlier, if you look at our underlying economics team they have the economy crossing over where it was before and growing past in terms of sheer size at the end of this year and our reserve setting takes it into next year and things like that.

As we think about what we faced: A wild operating environment with work-from-home, massive customer deferrals that diminished over the course of the year, massive borrowing that paid us back, deposit inflows, government programs to implement, changes in those government programs, multiple cases of those government programs and yet the team did a great job. So I thank the team for all the hard work they did. We finished the year stronger than -- the stronger quarter of the three during the crisis. We continue to see asset quality and -- mitigate now. And so we feel good. We're back in the market buying back stock today. We told you we'll buy $3 billion-plus this quarter. Our strong balance sheet capital ratios allow us to do that. And as we also said NII troughed in the third quarter and we continue to push up from here. And expenses year-over-year will be flattish, despite the fact we're investing heavily to have the best franchise. So thank you for your support. We look forward to talking to you next time.

It's been a year since we first reported our results, which would include the health crisis impact. But what we see different now is we see an accelerating recovery versus the economic uncertainty that we would have faced the last year at this time. The most recent economic indicators reflected an economic recovery that has gained momentum and continues to be supported by fiscal monetary policies. From our company's perspective, we have emerged as an even stronger company and competitor than what we were when we entered the healthcare crisis. Compared to last year, Bank of America's balance sheet has higher capital ratios, higher reserves with lower charge-offs and record liquidity. Our diverse business model with leadership positions across all our businesses has helped us earn our way through the crisis. Our Global Markets and Global Wealth Management businesses, which would typically benefit from this healthy capital markets environment continued to perform well this quarter. Our Consumer and Global Banking businesses also performed well. But they were – thisis after being more negatively impacted for several quarters by the interest rate environment and credit costs.

As I've done in the past few quarters now, the majority of my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter to reflect how we are progressing through this health crisis rather than year-over-year. In Q1, we earned net income of $8.1 billion, or $0.86 per share, which compares to $5.5 billion, or $0.59 per share in Q4. The earnings improvement included strong revenue growth, which more than offset higher expense. Additionally, earnings also included a $2.7 billion reserve release, which resulted in a $1.9 billion provision benefit. Revenue growth was driven by strong sales and trading results, record investment banking fees, and record asset management fees, and our wealth management business, while consumer fees faced the seasonal challenge against elevated Q4 holiday spending. With respect to returns, return on tangible common equity was 17.1 and ROA was 113 basis points. Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 8. The balance sheet expanded $150 billion versus Q4 to $2.97 trillion in total assets. Deposit growth continued to drive the balance sheet higher. Deposits grew $89 billion in the quarter and are up $300 billion from Q1 2020. Note that as deposits continue to grow, loans declined $25 billion from Q4. We deployed some of this excess liquidity into debt securities, which increased $172 billion while cash balances declined $54 billion and reverse repo also fell. It is also worth noting that our liquidity portfolio is now more than one-third of our total balance sheet and has surpassed $1 trillion. On a period-end basis, our Global Markets balance sheet increased by $129 billion, coming off year-end seasonal lows and as customers increase their activity with us. Note that on an average basis, it is only up marginally from the prior year, and versus Q4, up only $40 billion. Shareholders' equity increased $1 billion. Earnings were mostly offset by $4.5 billion in net capital distributions and a decrease in OCI of $1.8 billion, driven by an increase in long bond rates. With respect to regulatory ratios, consistent with the fourth quarter, standardized remain our binding approach for us, and at 11.8%, our CET1 ratio is our binding metric. While the CET1 ratio declined 15 basis points from Q4, it is 230 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into a $35 billion capital allocation. The benefits to the ratio from an increased level of capital were more than offset by higher RWA from the liquidity deployed into mortgage-backed securities and growth in our global markets balance sheet. Our supplemental TLAC ratio at quarter-end was 7% and 6.1% on a pro forma basis, excluding the relief for deposits at the Fed and investments in treasuries. 6.1% versus the 5% minimum requirement leaves us plenty of room for growth in the balance sheet. Our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements. Let me spend a minute on loans and deposits before moving away from the balance sheet. I will focus on averages as that is what drives NII. With respect to loans, on Slide 9, you can see the downward trend across the year as customer liquidity and accommodating capital markets drove pay downs well above historic levels. I would draw your attention to the linked-quarter change, global banking, commercial loans declined $16 billion. But as Brian noted earlier, we are seeing pipelines build and balances have stabilized for more than a month, so we are hopeful for a turnaround. Loan payments by consumers continue to outpace originations with loans declining $14 billion in consumer banking led by mortgages. Plus, we saw normal seasonality in our card products as customers paid down holiday balances with stimulus contributing to the high payment rates. But what is also noteworthy is the linked-quarter improvement in GWIM and Global Markets. GWIM continued to benefit from security-based lending as well as custom lending. In Global Markets, we relax some hold limits as the economy continued to strengthen. With respect to deposits, on Slide 10, we continued to see tremendous growth across the client base, not only because of growth in the money supply, but also because we are adding new accounts and attracting liquidity from existing customers. Turning to Slide 11, and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q1 was $10.2 billion, $10.3 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income declined $1.9 billion from Q1 2020, driven by the rate environment and lower loan balances, but was relatively flat to Q4. Compared to Q4, we see this as a good outcome considering the headwinds of two fewer days of interest, lower loan levels, and modestly higher premium amortization expense. These headwinds were mostly offset by the deployment of excess deposits into securities and a benefit of approximately $100 million from a legacy litigation settlement involving some securities. The net interest yield was relatively stable, declining 3 basis points from Q4 and it was flat if you exclude Global Markets. Reducing cash and repo, we deployed some of our excess liquidity into securities in Q1, split across treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Securities increased $172 billion from year-end. On a weighted average basis relative to what we were earning on the cash, we improved our yield on that roughly $170 billion by approximately 115 basis points. Now, the improvement in yield could have been higher, however, but similar to Q4 purchases, we hedged a portion of the treasuries purchased with swaps, effectively keeping those securities floating. As you will note, given all the deposit growth and low rates, our asset sensitivity is rising. Our asset sensitivity to rising rates remained significant, highlighting the value of our deposit and customer relationships. The sensitivity is lower from the year-end levels as higher rates and deployment of liquidity into securities increased our baseline. So the sensitivity no longer assumes that liquidity is available to invest at higher rates. A few thoughts on NII for the remainder of the year. But first, please note that these forward-looking comments on NII assume that the forward interest rate curve materializes, that the economy continues to recover, and that we have some fairly modest loan growth in the back half of the year. Given those assumptions, we expect some improvement in premium amortization across the next few quarters if mortgage rates follow the forward curve. At $1.5 billion in Q1, write-off of premium continued to be a headwind as mortgage prepayments remained quite high. So forward-looking comments include a lot of material moving parts from rates, loan levels and premium amortization. But as Brian said, we believe 4Q 2021 NII could rise by as much as $1 billion from this quarter's level. Okay. Turning to Slide 12 and expenses. Q1 expenses were $15.5 billion, $1.6 billion higher than Q4. I will add to some of the remarks Brian mentioned earlier. First, Q1 included the normal seasonal elevation of payroll tax expense of about $350 million. Second, as a result of the current period's solid revenue performance and a better outlook for revenue for the remainder of the year, we accrued for higher incentives and experienced increased processing costs. This added roughly $500 million to the quarter. Third, we incurred some expense that differs from our typical operating expense. We reversed a decision made on some 2020 incentive comp awards, making certain portions of those awards retirement eligible. This accelerated approximately $300 million of expense into Q1 that would have been expensed over four years. We also recorded an impairment charge of $240 million for real estate realization. And we incurred $160 million of severance charge as we moved back toward business as usual with respect to our headcount. This is based on an expectation that as roles get eliminated through process improvement, some associates might choose severance over opportunities to work in a different role in the company. Lastly, our COVID costs remained largely unchanged as modest declines in some employee-related costs were offset by cost associated with restarting PPP originations and forgiveness and additional unemployment claims processing. COVID costs are proving a little slower to safely reduce than we had hoped. Turning to asset quality on Slide 13. Government stimulus and support has helped customers get through this pandemic. That support coupled with our customer assistance programs and years of underwriting discipline under responsible growth, has resulted in low net charge-offs. Net charge-off this quarter were $833 million, or 37 basis points of average loans, and were lower than Q4. And they were 14% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019, which was the last quarter before the pandemic despite an expected increase in card losses of $229 million in Q1. With the exception of a small uptick in small business and the card losses, losses in every other category declined from Q4. Provision was a $1.9 billion benefit in the quarter as an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and lower loan balances resulted in a $2.7 billion release of credit reserves. Total consumer reserve releases were $1.4 billion, driven primarily by card, while the commercial release was $1.2 billion. Our allowance as a percent of loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.8%, which still remained well above the 1.27% where we began 2020 following our day-one adoption of CECL. With respect to reserve setting assumptions, we continued to include a multitude of scenarios. Based upon our Q1 weighting of those scenarios, GDP is forecasted to return to its 4Q 2019 level by the end of 2021. The weighted scenario also assumes that the unemployment rate at the end of 2021 will be just north of 6%, which is in line with March unemployment rate. For 2022, the weighted average scenario assumed unemployment just under 5.5% as we exit the year. To the extent the economic outlook and the remaining uncertainties continue to improve, we expect our reserve levels will move lower. On Slide 14, we showed the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Overall, consumer net charge-offs rose $211 million from Q4, and absent the $229 million increase noted in card, other losses declined. With respect to card losses, given the reduction in late-stage delinquencies in the 180-day pipeline, we expect card losses to be lower in Q2. NPLs remained low despite a small uptick due to consumer real estate deferrals, which have limited expected loss content given healthy LTV ratios. Moving to commercial, net charge-offs declined $296 million from the fourth quarter as the portfolio stabilized with reservable criticized exposure and NPLs declining in the quarter. Overall, given the environment, the asset quality of our commercial book remains solid and 90% of the exposures are either investment grade or collateralized. Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on Slide 15. Consumer banking produced another strong quarter in terms of customer deposits and investment flows, reflecting the strength of our brand, the innovation around digital, and deployment of specialists in our centers, all of which has enabled us to capture more than our fair share of the increase in customer liquidity. The segment earned $2.7 billion in Q1 versus $2.6 billion in Q4 as the provision benefit more than offset lower mostly seasonal revenue and higher expense. Revenue declined 2%, reflecting lower card income from Q4. Q4 has elevated holiday spending. Expenses moved higher as a result of real estate impairment costs, as well as seasonally higher payroll tax expense. This also caused an increase in our cost of deposits this quarter to 142 basis points. Absent the impairment charge, the cost of deposits would have been 131 basis points. As expected, net charge-offs rose from Q4 due to the flow-through of the bulge in card delinquencies as noted earlier. A $1.4 billion reserve release resulted in a $617 million provision benefit in the quarter. On Slide 16, you can see the significant increase in consumer deposits and investments. Average deposits of $924 billion are up 25% compared to Q1 2020 with nearly two-thirds of that growth in checking. Rate paid is down to 3 basis points as 56% of the deposits are low interest checking. Lastly, note the growth throughout the quarter as average deposits were up $39 billion from Q4. We covered loans earlier, so I would just note, investment balances of $324 billion are up 53% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering. As Brian noted and as you can see on Slide 17, we continued to see improvement in digital enrollment this quarter. 70% of our consumer households use some part of our digital platform this year. We continued to see digital payments and Zelle taking hold across all our businesses. Zelle consumer dollar volume is up 72% year-over-year. Small businesses up 182% year-over-year, and 90% of our business-to-consumer payments in global banking are now made via Zelle. As you can see, our digital assistant, Erica, continues to add users' capabilities and usage. Plus, we are applying our success with Erica to other businesses as well. Okay. Turning to wealth management. We continued to deliver solid organic growth, durably comprehensive banking and investment needs of clients, and manage risk responsibly. We experienced strong household – new household acquisition in a virtual environment and a very competitive market. This resulted in a record quarter with respect to total client flows, including near-record AUM flows and record AUM fees. Net income of $881 million improved 6% from Q4 as revenue growth and improvement in provision exceeded an increase in expense. With respect to revenue, the record AUM fees were complemented by higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses increased driven by revenue-related costs and seasonally elevated payroll tax. Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank, both continued to grow clients as we remain a provider of choice for affluent clients. Client balances rose to a record $3.5 trillion, up $882 billion year-over-year, driven by higher market levels, as well as strong client flows. During Q1, our advisors added over 6,000 net new households in Merrill Lynch and nearly 700 net new relationships in the Private Bank. Let's skip to Slide 20, which is a new page that highlights our progress to digitally engage wealth management clients. In Merrill and the Private Bank, our clients and advisors have both embraced the value of a digitally enabled relationship in which digital tools are critical mechanisms for fast, safe and secure interactions. Our wealth clients are some of the most highly engaged clients in the franchise with 80% of Merrill households digitally active. In Q1, we saw a record number of log-ins. Clients are logging in to trade, check balances, and originate loans with ease all of which can be done through a simple side – sign in. We continue to enhance and modernize the capabilities for both the client and advisor, and these capabilities are becoming key differentiators, as well as being recognized by third parties. Moving to Global Banking on Slide 21. The business earned nearly $2.2 billion in Q1, improving $500 million from Q4, driven by a provision benefit and solid revenue. While loan growth has been challenging, deposit growth has been strong and investment banking revenue exceeded previous records. The team produced $2.2 billion in firmwide investment banking fees, growing year-over-year by 62% and 20% over Q4. Looking at revenue and comparing to Q4, despite the higher IB fees, total revenue declined 2%, driven by weather-related impairments on some tax-advantaged investments. Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $1.2 billion in Q1. Importantly, net charge-offs of $36 million fell by $278 million from Q4. Non-interest expense rose 14% from Q4, reflecting the incentive award changes noted earlier. Additionally, the strong IB performance and improved outlook and seasonally elevated payroll tax increased personnel costs in Q1. Looking at the balance sheet on Slide 22, average deposits moved up relative to Q4 as customers remained highly liquid. Year-over-year, deposits are up an impressive 27%, while repaid is at an historic low. As noted earlier, loans declined early in the quarter, but stabilized late in the quarter. Wholesale digital engagement continued to accelerate and usage continued to grow, driven by the same ease, safety, and convenience of our digital banking capabilities that our consumer customers enjoy. We present some wholesale digital highlights on Slide 23. Switching to global markets on Slide 24, results reflected the highest revenue quarter in over a decade with solid year-over-year improvement and an even more significant increase relative to Q4. As I usually do, I will talk about the segment results excluding DVA. This quarter, net DVA was negligible, but the year-ago quarter had a $300 million gain. Global markets produced $2.1 billion of earnings in Q1, more than double the level of Q4 and up 39% from Q1 2020. Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was up 26% on higher sales and trading and equity underwriting fees. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by volume-related expenses in both card and trading, and an acceleration in expense from changes in the incentive awards. Sales and trading contributed $5.1 billion to revenue, increasing 17% year-over-year, driven by a 22% improvement in fixed and a 10% increase in equities. These results reflected gains in commodities and strong results in credit, mortgage, and municipal products versus relative weakness in the year-ago period. This was partially offset by reduced activity and trading opportunities in other macro products. The strength in equities was driven by a strong trading performance in cash. The business has produced strong return delivering a 22% return on capital in Q1. Finally, on Slide 26, we show all other which reported profits of $257 million compared to Q1 2020. The improvement in net income was driven by a larger tax benefit given an expected increase in ESG activities this year. The year-ago quarter also included a modest reserve build. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 12% and excluding the tax credit, driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been 23%. For the full-year, absent any changes in the current tax laws or other unusual items, we expect an effective tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 12%. Okay. With that, let's go to Q&A.",2959.0,1679.0,56.0,42.0,24.0,7.0,8.0,8.0,6.0,16.0,0.03335318642048839,0.02501488981536629,0.01429422275163788,0.004169148302561048,0.004764740917212627,0.008338296605122097

I just wanted to try to get a jumping-off point on the second quarter. I think with all your comments, it gets you to the low- to mid-$14 billion range. I want to see if that's right. And then if you could give us the right perspective, meaning if you look – you all were able to keep the total expenses flat for many years while you grew the franchise. Now the economy is growing, capital markets were very strong, and the expense of dollars have crept up.

We expect expenses just north of $14 billion dependent on the revenue environment and the amount of progress we make in taking down the COVID costs. In terms of your comment about our ability to manage expenses, we agree with you. I think as Brian noted in his opening comments, we've managed not to increase expenses for years now, and we've absorbed merit increases, investments, minimum wage, improvement in benefits, all the dramatic increase in processing volumes, digital increases. So we are sort of – as talked about in other calls, we've been using operational excellence and other initiatives to basically fund the investments in our future. I think our goal here is to clearly create operating leverage over an extended period of time. We've talked about maybe expenses rising maybe at a 1% level per year. And I think that's probably the best guidance we can give you. Absent again some of the ins and outs, we had a lot of variability this quarter. And obviously, we're sitting here in the middle of a pandemic with a lot of COVID expenses that have been a little bit more sticky than we had all hoped. But they're going to come out, there's no question about that. And so we'll get back to kind of a normal level of expenses and a very reasonable growth level over the long-term relative to revenue.",252.0,116.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.008620689655172414,0.04310344827586207,0.0,0.008620689655172414,0.02586206896551724

I think we see a lot of growth in the private credit markets and it started out strong in middle-market lending. It's transitioning and doing some now large corporate lending, the specialized lending, and aircraft and transportation now. So I'm curious given the breadth of your franchise, those – all those things I mentioned are kind of in your backyard.

So sure that has an impact. But our job is to compete through it. But the reality of what's having an impact now, frankly, is that draw rates and lines of credit and stuff are low. And companies that are operating well – those companies that still need to get through the pandemic impact just aren't using their lines. And that's a bump along the bottom we've shown you as a long-term chart. So we feel good about our middle market and our business banking businesses, small businesses. We feel good about they're getting set up as the economy continues to improve and the growth will come back, and the services and rate we can provide are competitive. And so I don't think that'll ever change and I think it reaches further. Sometimes, it reaches the stuff we want to do as a company, obviously, in terms of leverage – extra amounts of leverage and things like that. But we feel we're very strong and competitive.

One is the number goes up this quarter because the average of the four quarters is a – move forward a quarter and that's a higher average, so we'll be able to do more this quarter. And then assuming the new rules come into effect in July, we have substantial cushions and we'll look to bring that cushion down. We're not going to – we're going to maintain a cushion over the – our requirement is 9.5%. We'll maintain a cushion over that.

Just on reserves, absent a deterioration in an environment which we don't expect, we believe the reserves will continue to come down in the coming quarters as we remain – as the remaining uncertainties continue to diminish. In terms of the reserve versus sort of day-one CECL, every quarter we are reserving based upon the size and mix of our portfolio at that moment, and our view of the future is based upon independent sources. So as you think about that, you've got to recognize that our portfolio has changed. For example, card, which as you know has some of the highest reserve rate is down 25% from day-one. So you really need to think about how the mix has changed. You just can't go back to our reserve level on day-one which I think was 127 basis points if I'm not mistaken. And just apply that to today's numbers, I think you're going to do a little bit of a product mix there to get back.

I have two opposing views and I'm hoping that you can help me reconcile them as it relates to efficiency. On the one hand, it's like your slides are very positive.

So all that technology progress is noted. On the other hand, I look at Slide 12, and I see the efficiency ratio and I see the expenses, and I hear the higher guidance for expenses for this year. So I guess if you can help me reconcile these positive underlying trends with this number on the page of 68% efficiency ratio. And I do recognize that you're calling out a lot of expenses.

But as you go across page 12, you got to remember and you well know this that in the – the stuff on the left-hand side of the page you had a rate environment that it finally after years had come up to some level of fed funds rate and short of LIBOR rates and stuff. And that helped our efficiency ratio move under 60%. But even if you look at this quarter at 68% and you back out the type of expenses that you drop in the low-60s, and then the NII improvement will – because that frankly as you well know, comes with very little expense attached to it and i.e. that we don't need more branches and more infrastructure, or more – even more commercial bankers as those loans' usage goes up and the spreads just spread off of our floors due to our massive deposit base. So I think you should expect that even on a pro forma basis, you could see the low-60s. You should expect it to move back in the levels you see here as we move through the year, pick up the NII.

We're now moving on the top 10, all organic, and driving off of that. And then salespeople. Now, that's what we probably lightened up last year just because the opportunities weren't there. But you're going to see us continue to reposition people from the efficiencies in the OpEx program to the front. And so headcount rose, really to support the exigencies of the circumstances. When you couldn't have your teammates anchored with each other, we had to have a few more of them move in the issues that were there for social distancing as working from home and overstaffing because of high-risk employees. So we ran up a little higher. And now you're starting to see it drift down. So that core number of headcount will drive our expenses.

That's why our client scores continue to rise during the pandemic. Obviously, as schools will reopen, we've tailored that program. We will normalize it at the end of the second quarter. That's one thing. Obviously, PPP, Mike, it got extended again. But as we're seeing the volumes be more modest this time, we can start to shape those teammates out.

Again, the guidance that we gave you that NII in the fourth quarter could be $1 billion higher than what it was in the first quarter, that's based upon the forward curve materializing and some modest loan growth in the back half of the year. We've got some flexibility because we do have liquidity, can go faster or slower on in terms of investing. We'd like to put that in loan growth and not necessarily into securities, but we will invest it over time. We've got to see the amortization expense start to come down.

You did a lot this quarter or last quarter. If we look back since the end of 2019, most of your deposits have been deployed into securities. And most of the securities, I think, are longer-term mortgage-backed that aren't hedged. I know you said some of the treasuries were hedged, but that's a small portion of what you added. So I guess just conceptually, like is this signaling that you think rates have kind of gone up, kind of the big moves already happened for the next few years?

You went all the way back to 2019 – if you go all the way back to year-end 2019, deposits are up $450 billion, and loans are down $80 billion. So we created $530 billion of liquidity to deploy somewhere, plus we're going to see some more deposit growth. So the $530 billion of liquidity, we had to deploy it somewhere. Through the end of Q1, securities are up $380 billion, and cash and equivalents are up $150 billion to $300 billion. But as I said in the remarks, we bought treasuries, but on about $150 billion of those treasuries, we have interest rate swaps. So you can really think of the $300 billion of cash as being $450 billion in terms of our ability to fund loan growth or invest for turn or other uses. So we've been balancing liquidity, capital, and earnings throughout this whole process. We don't tend to make bets on interest rates one way or another. We just want to make sure that we can deliver for our customers no matter what happens. And I think we've been trying to do that as we've gone through this pandemic.

In terms of the commercial side, there are still the affected industries that we're watching carefully, but everywhere else, I think we're back to pre-pandemic. And in light of the size of our company, in light of the need for loan growth, I think we're relaxed a little bit on some hold levels, particularly in global markets, where they have more of a moving than storage mentality around loans and what they do for customers.

You got the commercial business down, and consumer is down. Consumer is largely down because of mortgage churn, but the big thing that happened is cards came down. And what's been interesting to watch now – and so because we pulled back – this time last year's unemployment went to 15%. Everybody pulled back their underlying criteria, Matt. We've now reinstated, as Paul said. So what's happened? We did one million units of new cards a quarter. Going into the last year's first quarter, it fell as low as 400. It's back up to 600 and change already and moving north on that. And if you look by month, it's stacking back up. So yes, so that's – and if you look at where that's coming from, obviously, the branch system, which basically was run at around 2,500 of the 4,300 branches for the last six, eight months, nine months, is only catching back up as it opens up and sales come in. So that bodes well on, obviously, on the consumer side, on the cards, which are most important. Mortgages production will continue to kick back up, and prepayments will slow down at a slightly higher rate environment. You'll see that bodes well there. GWIM has done a – has some of the mortgage aspects, but on the type of lending that GWIM does to affluent, wealthy people, they've done a good job, and they've actually seen that grow. And then you go to the business banking, middle market, and that's all line usage. And so that should come through – in order for the economy to expand 7% this year, which is what our Bank of America team has it at, at some point, companies have to access capital to meet that final demand, and you should see that usage come up. So even in things like the card business, because there just aren't the cards to sell, you're seeing line usage down at lower level. So as you think across the things – the hold levels and things that Paul is talking about enable us to push a little harder just because of the sheer size of our company. But if you think about it, think about the flywheel that we have in the company as a production engine, having had necessarily to be slowed down in the crisis with 15% unemployment peaks and the final demand being crushed in the second quarter of last year, then turning that crank back up and just watch that flywheel start to take off, that's what we have good confidence in terms of getting right back on loan growth. But if you added all that together and we grew 5%, it'd be $45 billion of loans. So to Paul's point, you still have tremendous excess capacity because the deposit growth is so strong on core transactional deposits with the commercial and consumers.",527.0,234.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.021367521367521368,0.021367521367521368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

And you were one of the only GSIBs to really kind of trim down so that your GSIB number didn't go up recently. And I'm wondering if you're thinking about the opportunities there to lean into a higher GSIB, maybe do more in capital markets. I know traditionally, you've been looking to keep your RWAs in markets very tight. And I'm wondering if there's any thought to maybe leaning in at this stage given all the excess capital and liquidity that you have.

So Betsy – and the two are not mutually exclusive at all, except way – at the margin, way away from where we are now. But with stock price increases and all the things that go into that calculation, as you all know, they're not all related to straight risk in terms of sheer size and stock – just things that go in. It is harder to maintain where we were at the end of last year. And you might expect that we may move up a bucket and take advantage of that by actually expanding the business in the markets business, where the opportunity is there, based on the capabilities that Jimmy and the team and Tom and the team have put together. So why would you do that? The reason why we do that is our clients have been growing, and we kept about a third of the size. And even if you took away some of the growth just due to the deposit things, it has come down around 20% the size of the company. And the idea is to keep it in synergy and synchronize it with the company's overall size, but the company has grown around it another step. And so we've told Tom – Tom and the team are working on ideas to continue to do that. We stay – we're a little bigger now than we were at year-end, obviously, first-quarter activity, but you shouldn't expect us to come down. Now, those ratios aren't effective for a bit of time here, so we'll see how it plays out. But if the opportunities there will take them, the team has done a great job and managed the risk well. If you look at the trading results for the quarter, look at it for last quarter, look at it throughout the pandemic, they've done a great job in managing risk-reward balance. And we're proud of them and the work they've done, and we're going to support them with some more capital.",345.0,143.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.03496503496503497,0.0,0.03496503496503497,0.0,0.0,0.03496503496503497

And then separately, one of the most tedious discussions that I have with people is on comping your skillset in digital consumer apps and everything you're doing there not only for consumer but also for corporate and SMBs with FinTech players. And I say it's tedious because you have a huge market presence. Okay. But I don't feel like you're getting your message out there beyond this call.

As Mike said earlier, the idea that we run this huge consumer business at a cost advantage, which is significant due to the digitization of all the consumer activity due to the way customers interact this way we can help them the way and give guideposts. And frankly, that way we can take the fee structure out and that's – that we drop over our fees dramatically over the years and made up for it in terms of efficiency and other types of things. And so we get the word out, we tell everybody we win all kinds of awards, and the list goes on and on in terms of the different ranking agencies and they've seen, as the Merrill Edge growth, there's over 300 billion now. And so our job is to do a great job for our customers and I think, I'll leave to you and your colleagues to debate the relative merits of FinTech resources. But I will tell you – for a company making $8 billion and having 40 million new digital customers are fully active on the consumer side, half million on the digital on the – on the corporate side. The impact on our ability to have expenses be flat from even with extra money of $1.5 billion, so the first quarter from six years ago shows the impact of the ability to digitize as a company. And we learned more about this than last year in areas that we didn't do. So we'll keep pushing it out there. You can help us tell the story, but the reality is that the number one person we want to understand is our customers and that means attrition, you know, attrition in the customer is way down the penetration of their wallets way up. Just look at the wealth management statistics we threw in and see how that they've adapted to it. These are major changes, the size of which doesn't exist much out there. So we'll keep telling the way you keep telling a story. We'll keep telling the story but the key is it's producing, it's produced and they have kind earnings we're producing in the kind of efficiency we're producing, which continues to be down to our benefit going forward. The neatest thing about this stuff is where we go next with it – where we've been going with it. So Erica, there's just nothing close to it out there and driving it with volumes and things, so if you look at the charts on those pages and show it. And so it's the usage and the personalization and the ability to help people manage their payments and their things for the mass market and their investments. So we feel good about it we'll tell the story as often as we can, but the reality is I just – we'd like to see us keep growing a number of customers and drive in it and drive it on an integrated basis. We're putting major investments in a couple of areas. We had to improve merchant services, payments on the commercial side at the merchant level, and we've put major investments 401K technology to push that, with the number seven of that businesses is the lowest market position of any business we had, number six or seven of what we are. So these are major investments. We are making hundreds of millions of dollars a year that go into that expense base, better paid for by the efficiency of the core businesses.",631.0,264.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.007575757575757576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728

Now, this given – the sheer amount of growth we've seen in the MBS portfolio, the deployment of all the excess liquidity.

One, the premium amortization in the first quarter was about $1.5 billion. And as you point out, if the securities portfolio has grown, so as you try to size what it could come down to, you just can't go back to last year and look at what it was because the portfolio has gotten a lot bigger. That's sort of one. Two, and I think about that billion dollars, I would say the most important driver would be the modest loan growth and the second most important driver would be the reduction in premium amortization. So maybe that's enough guidance right there. Again, we're not going to go down to where it was in Q1. I really think, 4Q 2019, because we've grown so much. But it's going to be meaningful in terms of a few – more than a few $100 million in terms of that guidance we gave you.",163.0,67.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029850746268656716,0.0,0.0,0.0

If I look at your SLR ratio, excluding the relief in your CET1 ratios, if I assume maybe like a 10.5% target on CET1, five in a quarter on SLR, the CET1 is still your binding constraint today. But just looking at the sheer amount of balance sheet growth you guys saw this past quarter, I think was about $150 billion or so, you know, our analysis suggests that you maybe haven't another $160 billion to $200 billion balance sheet growth headroom before the SLR becomes binding. And as we consider our expectations just for additional QE Fed balance sheet growth, how are you preparing for that potential – what sort of mitigating actions might you take if the SLR does in fact become binding?",134.0,64.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.078125,0.0,0.015625,0.0

But if the ratio is going to shake out sub-six pro forma, that relief gets at a 5% ratio, that's $500 billion of capacity to grow. But in terms of like where – where you have the most access, it looks like SLR becomes binding. In relatively short order, we're just maybe a couple more quarters of $150 billion-plus growth in the balance sheet. So I guess that's what I was trying to get at, that is, would you look to mitigate it, given it becomes a little bit more binding than your CET1 constraints?",126.0,55.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.03636363636363636,0.0

Obviously, we had a little bit of an increase this quarter but 30-plus day delinquencies are now back down to almost near lows. Should we expect, I think we hit charge-offs that we're in the 400s in the fourth quarter. Are we heading back toward that?

The platform has a wonderful market position where it plays and we're very proud of the deal. But the key is that we – you got to go back to the whole history of merchant services. We sold half of it and a joint venture of 15 years ago now or whatever it was. Raise some capital, come forward, we bought it back. Remember, that's one of the reasons why our expense run rate moved up by $800 million to $900 million a year. People forget about us because we brought that in last year for half a year and it wasn't in two years ago. But the reason why bought it back is really to invest around that platform. So what is exciting about it is things like the acquisition to take us in the medical area. What's exciting about is the ability to actually sell it through this sales force without having to have a nano and sales force selling it in our small business and our business banking colleagues that thousands of people out there can and can help deliver the product and then what's really exciting is the integration of payment scheme that we've been working on for commercial payments. So it's an integration to the P2P which is held as a small business and all these payment gateways, which is outside the traditional merchant business but you have to be completely flexible along all payment schemes to actually rooted much more favorable to the merchant with very low cost to them. And in real-time contemporary value exchange. So what we're doing with real-time payments and Zelle and combination into the business platforms through the merger – through the payment gateways. These are all exciting things and you go larger and it's a different element and blockchain payments and everything else. So that's the core of the business on the commercial side but it goes all the way from small business all the way up to large companies and so that investment was part of that, the new investments were part of that and you expect us to keep driving at the implementation. The good news is we're getting the network effects of the Zelle and things like that. When you look at those pages that, Zelle's half the credit card charge volume used by our consumers to make payments now, the new line that for a minute think 35 million credit card people out there charge in the Zelle has reach and half of it checks down 25% of the last couple of years in terms of checks written by and by consumers. So you get the network effect of that and you get the merchants to use it in real-time. So this is all part of a thing that Thong Nguyen and Mark Monaco and team are leading and Faiz Ahmad on the commercial side that you should expect to see a lot. A lot of investments been made including a major replacement in the system that's coming to the P&L this year and the change in bringing the people fund fully on the balance sheet and a lot of investment will be made including acquisitions like we just made.",559.0,249.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.028112449799196786,0.0,0.0,0.004016064257028112,0.0,0.028112449799196786

But largely, I think, Paul and I last saw was a 30%-odd of the stimulus money has been spent to make it – to be a simple mind about it. And so the other 70% sitting in people's accounts are little different by stratification of the earnings power of the household. And so that has to be spent, that bodes well for an economic reopening and stuff. It has an effect on balances in cards and stuff, yes, because consumers have used to pay down their debt in part of what it has been spent – has been spent to pay down card balances. And then, with their limited travel we're just not getting as much use. But the good news is you watch January or February or March, with the virus and vaccine pathways come into for – was the – you're starting to see the purchase numbers go up. And the payments rate went way up as you've observed last year a 30%, to last year in this quarter. But you'd expect that that might be more constant and then users' rate will go up and start to drive some balanced growth which is good news. So the good news is the consumers are healthy from every aspect. We have no deferrals left except in the mortgage business. So all the debate we had about this last year this time through the system, delinquencies down, consumers sitting with their money in their accounts, and the economy opened up which bodes well and that's what you saw in the retail sales numbers today. And we expect that number those numbers to even be higher in the month of April because March was partly reopened in the month and the weather isn't too pleasant in the Northeast to even if you wanted to eat outside in the northern parts of the central country.",332.0,144.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.006944444444444444,0.013888888888888888,0.0,0.006944444444444444,0.020833333333333332

Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me just remind you, we may make some forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call regarding various elements of the financial results. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions, and they're subject to risks and uncertainties.  Factors that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials, our SEC filings on our website. Information about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are on our website. So with that, let me turn it over to you, Brian. It's all yours.",210.0,99.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.010101010101010102,0.0,0.06060606060606061,0.0,0.0,0.010101010101010102
BAC,2021-07-14,2021-07-14,,2021-07-14,2021-07-14T09:00:00-04:00,0,2021-07-14,prepared,,Brian Moynihan,"Good morning. And thank all of you for joining us, and thank you, Lee. Today, Bank of America reported $9.2 billion in after-tax net income, or $1.03 per diluted shares. These results included a few items worth highlighting, and I'm on page 2, ahead of Paul going through the details. First, as asset quality continued to improve and economy continued to recover, we released $2.2 billion of credit reserves established in the first half of last year.  The idea that a Company with our credit quality and other industry participants would be releasing reserves this quarter is not new news. But the reality is at BAC we're seeing credit quality levels that are very strong. Net charge-offs fell to 25 year-low as a percentage of loans, not just raw dollar amount. Let me mention a few items I don't believe were industry-wide expected at BAC. We recorded a $2 billion positive income tax adjustment following last month's enactment of an increase in U.K. corporate income tax rate to 25%.  This required a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets, which just reverses the write-downs from previous years when the tax rates were lower. In addition, our expense level included two things I would note. These add up to about $800 million. With our strong results and the tax benefit, we took the opportunity to pre-fund $500 million to our charitable foundation. This accelerates our planned funding for not only the rest of this year, but the next year as well. This is not new money, just utilizing some of the tax benefit to cover future expense. We also recorded roughly $300 million of expense associated with processing transactional card claims related to state unemployment benefits.  This represents, to a large degree, a catch-up as we move through claim by backlogs. Away from these [values, we] (ph) produced another quarter of solid earnings and showed evidence of good client activity in an economy that continue to recover from the pandemic. Now, as we all know, the healthcare crisis has shown improvement and economy has recovered. Progress on vaccinations along with the continued support of fiscal monetary policy has promoted a full and speedy recovery and return to economic health. We, like others, are reopening our facilities and we're seeing more products being sold by our teammates, in addition to the continued digital engagement at very high level.  Our advisors and bankers and relationship managers are once again, meeting with clients face-to-face, building even much stronger relationships. We're seeing customer demand continue to grow, given the opportunities our companies see. I'll take a minute or two on the economy. And if you go to Slide 3. We have included a few slides highlighting our customer data. Let me get a few highlights. The GDP growth estimates by our BofA Securities research team for the second quarter stand at 10%, and stand at 7% for the full-year 2021.  The re-opening is further driving projections of an economy that has continued to grow at a rate above the pre-pandemic periods into '23. Also, the unemployment rate dropped below 6% this quarter is projected by economists to continue to fall. You'll also note that stability increased consumer spending from our own BAC customers, which is not only much higher than the same periods in 2020, which you would expect, but is notably 22% higher than the first half of '21 compared to 2019. And you can see that [Indiscernible] page. That growth rate '19 was already growing strongly before the pandemic. A few comments regarding the characteristics of spending I think are interesting.  We're halfway through the year and the total payments through those -- through all the different means are $1.8 trillion; that's 60% of last year's level. Last year indeed was a record, even though it was suppressed in various periods when business were shut down. More specifically for the second quarter, the total BAC consumers [and small] (ph) business payments set a fourth quarterly consecutive record, reaching $976 billion up 41% year-over-year, and 23% over '19. The trend has also continued into early July.  Spending consolidated as COVID vaccinations increased, business reopened, and domestic travel increased. Combined spend of retailers and services comprises over 50% of debit and credit card spending a portion of the total spend. That increased 27% over 2019 second quarter, but did slow a bit towards the end of the quarter, as consumer moved their attention and started taking summer leisure trips and activity.  You can see that by noting a return of travel and entertainment spending, which comprised about 10% of debit credit card spend. You can see while recovering travel remains below 2019 spending levels. Putting the travel up a bit, as of mid-June, domestic airline purchases were up 8% over 2019, while international airline purchase on our cards are still down approximately 40%, showing the difference of the progress against the war on the virus in United States versus other places. Now let's go to Slide 4.  We just put this chart in to show you that the consumers are paying their bills. We've shown this each quarter, so you could see that the actual card delinquency levels continue to edge down even as people are out and circulating the economy. Before we go to Paul, I want to comment specifically on 3 areas of interest to you; loan growth, NII, and expense. And we can do that on pages 5 and 6. First on loans. Paul and I are going to show you the average loans.  Paul will show you that later. End-of-period loans, I'll show you in a minute, and long-term trends, which are on page 5. What all these figures point to is accelerating growth during the quarter as we've spoken about on occasion. This quarter, we saw loan levels across most every business move past stabilization begin to make progress. Companies need to build inventory, hire workers to meet the growing customer demand. This virtuous circle of hiring workers and meeting customer spending will help drive the economy and hopefully, will result in more line usage on our loans.  You can see the path on Slide 5 of loans since the pandemic started in March 2020. As you can see, all of them are turning up in recent months. But moving to Slide 6, you see the more traditional detail for our Company. Let's start on the lower right-hand side of that slide. And talking about the commercial portfolio. Commercial loan balances after adjusting for the reductions of PPP loans for Quarter 2 forgiveness grew $15 billion.  This was led by global markets client borrowing activity, but beyond that, and still excluding the PPP loan forgiveness, middle market lending grew and our business banking team finally had growth in the month of June 2021, a first since last March. Fueling some of this improvement is calling effectiveness. Relationship managers have increased their calling efforts; we're now aggressively calling on targeted prospects. And with vaccination progress, face-to-face meetings have nearly doubled each month over the past 90 days.  Commercial loans wealth manager clients grew an impressive 5% in the quarter, as these customers borrow through our custom lending products. In small business, our Practice Solutions Group, which supports medical, dental and veterinary practices, has been building throughout the quarter, and small business production overall is back to pre-pandemic level. Turning to consumer loans, overall growth and end-of-period loans was $6 billion. Car loans grew with increased spending, even as customer payment percentages remained high.  Auto originations have grown fairly consistently, although recently, lower dealer supplies have affected that. Mortgage balance growth, which is a big part of our loan portfolio in consumer, has been a challenge in the low rate environment with high refinancing volumes exceeding originations in past quarters. We are only modestly down this quarter as our origination volumes are finally overcoming the payoffs. We are pleased with the trajectory through the period, and that feeds into the second half of the year. While average loans drive - that loan balances during the third quarter will drive the NII, it's good to start with a trend that has reversed the past quarter's decline.  On NII, the good news is that we correctly called a bottom three quarters ago. We told you that in the three -- that we thought the third quarter of 2020 would be the trough. Despite the volatility, and lower rate moves, and significant decline in loans, we've been able to hold NII at that level, or more, for three straight quarters. We expect it to move higher, and Paul's going to discuss that later. The other area I want to comment on is expense. We saw -- on a reported basis, we saw a $0.5 billion in expense reduction from first quarter of '21 to second quarter of '21. This quarter, we also had around 800 million in notable items for the aforementioned charitable contribution on employment claims process.  Absent those notable items expenses would have been down about a $1 billion in and low $14 billion range. This is the level we are targeting expense as we move through the rest of the year. In the second half of the year as we normalize our operations, we'll continue to return our business to usual, working on process improvements to allow us to reduce our headcount and to continue to fund franchise investments. Headcount in second quarter including -- excluding the summer interns, declined by roughly 2500 or over 1% from the first quarter. So the messages for this quarter are straightforward.  The organic growth machine that we had rolling before the pandemic hit is reemerging as the economy normalizes. We said be careful to ensure that the war on the virus stays [won] (ph), overseeing great returns. In retail preferred and small business, we saw a strong production of core transaction accounts above pre-pandemic level. This quarter was our best net sales growth in checking accounts since the second quarter 2015.  We saw card production about 90% overall pre-pandemic. But net cards of -- net of runoff were positive for the first time since the quarter -- first quarter of 2020 when we entered the pandemic. We saw growth in new Merrill Lynch investment accounts, and Paul will talk to you about that. We saw good mortgage production. We saw stronger digital activity. In wealth management, we saw household growth and strong flows continue to grow, even with use of our banking platform to grow its credit side. In global banking, we saw loan growth and new production coming on while line usage still remains very low.  We saw investment banking close this quarter with record pipelines. In markets, we saw a strong first half, even compared to 2020, and a strong second quarter, albeit with more normal seasonal impact. So normalizing more like '19, but still higher. And we saw headcount come down as operational excellence kicked in by over 2,000 people. We have work to do to keep driving down the core expenses in getting out the net COVID expenses over time. And above all, due to responsible growth, we saw a strong core credit metrics. So as the economy continues to recover, we're seeing organic growth engine kick back in. With that, I'll turn it over to Paul.",1865.0,1014.0,36.0,16.0,7.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,3.0,0.03550295857988166,0.015779092702169626,0.006903353057199211,0.0039447731755424065,0.0009861932938856016,0.01972386587771203
BAC,2021-07-14,2021-07-14,,2021-07-14,2021-07-14T09:00:00-04:00,0,2021-07-14,qa,qna_heading,Paul Donofrio,"Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 7. As I have done in the past few quarters, the majority of my comments -- or excuse me, my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter rather than year-over-year, given the pandemic. Since Brian already covered a lot of the income statements, I will just add a couple of comments on revenue and returns. Revenue was down 6% from Q1. The decline was driven by lower sales and trading results, that more than offset solid consumer and wealth management revenue, which was a result of higher card income and AUM fees.  It is also worth noting that while investment banking fees were down from a record Q1 level, they remained strong at more than 2 billion in Q2. Lastly, when comparing revenue against the prior year quarter, remember Q2 '20 included a $704 million gain on the sale of some mortgage loans. With respect to returns, our return on tangible common equity was 20% and ROA was 123 basis points, both benefiting from the positive tax adjustment and sizable reserve release. Moving to Slide 8. Balance sheet expanded 60 billion versus Q1, to a little more than 3 trillion in total assets.  The positive growth of 24 billion supported 16 billion of loan growth, while the combination of market-based funding and long-term debt issuance supported expansion of the balance sheet in global markets. Other notable movements in the balance sheet included a continued deployment of excess cash into securities. Securities increased 83 billion while cash declined 66 billion. Driven by the additional deposit growth, our liquidity portfolio remained above 1 trillion or 1/3rd of the balance sheet. Shareholders' equity increased $3 billion, as earnings outpaced capital distribution.  Capital distributions of $5.8 billion were limited to the average of earnings in the previous four quarters per regulatory guidelines, and were well below the $9 billion earned in the quarter. With respect to regulatory ratios, consistent with Q1 standardized remained the binding approach for us and was down a little less than 30 basis points from Q1. While the CET1 ratio declined 30 basis points in Q1, it remained 200 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into a $31 billion capital cushion. While book value rose 3 billion, regulatory capital was up 1 billion as the $2 billion tax adjustment did not benefit CET1 capital.  Higher RWA from the liquidity deployed securities, growth in our market's balance sheet, and higher GWIM loan activity, more than offset the benefit to the ratio from higher capital. Our supplementary leverage ratio at quarter-end was 5.9%, dropping from the prior quarter, primarily due to the removal of the regulatory relief. 5.9% versus a minimum requirement of 5% equates to approximately 600 billion of balance sheet capacity, which leaves us plenty of room for growth. Our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements.  Turning to Slide 9. Brian reviewed ending loan balances earlier, so I will focus on average balances, which are more closely linked to NII. As you look at the year-over-year trends, note that these numbers include PPP loans, which have been moving lower now for 2 quarters driven by forgiveness. You can see the change in those PPP levels on the slide. Focusing on the linked quarter change. While loans on an ending basis were up nicely on an average basis, even with a $3 billion decline in PPP balances, loans were flat.  Wealth management and global markets experienced the most notable improvements. GWIM continued to benefit from security-based lending as well as custom lending, while continuing to have solid mortgage performance. In global markets, we looked for opportunities to lend to clients against a number of different asset types, creating mostly investment-grade exposures as a good use of our liquidity. In consumer, we saw credit card loans stabilize for the first time in more than a year, as credit spending ramped up and new accounts continued to build across the quarters. Quarterly new account levels are nearly back to 2019 level.  With respect to deposits on Slide 10, we continued to see significant growth across the client base, not only because of the growth and the money supply, but also because we added new accounts and attracted increased liquidity from existing customers. I would just note that the link quarter growth on a spot basis included a headwind of about 34 billion from customer income tax outflows. Normally, we see deposits decline in the Second Quarter given tax payments but this year, we saw strong growth even with these tax payments.  Turning to Slide 11, and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII for Q2 was 10.2 billion -- 10.3 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income declined a little more than 600 million from Q2 '20 driven by the rate environment and lower loan balances, but showed modest improvement from Q1. The year-over-year comparisons beginning next quarter are expected to improve nicely, as Q3 '20 has proven to be the nadir for NII, and we are expecting NII improvement in Q3 and Q4. Compared to Q1, the benefit of an additional day of interest and liquidity deployed was offset by a lower level of PPP loan forgiveness, the absence of proceeds recorded in NII from the Q1 litigation settlement, and modestly higher premium amortization expense.  The net interest yield declined 7 basis points from Q1, driven by the continued addition of lower-yielding debt securities in Q1 and Q2, and a larger global market balance sheet. Remember, as part of our liquidity that remains, I would include about a $150 billion of debt security, hedged to floating, which earned a bit more than cash. As you will note, given all the deposit growth low rate, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains significant and mostly unchanged from Q1, highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships.  Let me give you a couple of thoughts around NII for the back half of the year. Last quarter, when the forward interest rate environment was 30-40 basis points higher, we told you we were targeting NII roughly 1 billion higher in Q4 of this year. This quarter's loan growth is encouraging and supported with this target, and the slowdown in mortgage prepayments should also help improve NII. So while we still think getting NII $1 billion higher by 4Q is possible, admittedly the recent significant decline in long-end rates presents a challenge. This possibility, of course, assumes loans continue to grow in the Second-half and rates don't move lower from here. To improve our chances, we could decide to deploy additional liquidity at higher fixed rate in the coming weeks and months, as we evaluate the trade-offs between liquidity, capital, and earnings.  Turning to Slide 12 in expenses. Q2 expenses were 15 billion, or 0.5 billion lower than Q1. While lower than Q1, the combination of the $500 million contribution to the foundation and the nearly 300 million increase in costs associated with unemployment claims, processing kept expenses above the low $14 billion target shared with you last quarter. Outside of these two items, expense was lower, driven by the absence of a few Q1 items: seasonal payroll taxes, the real estate impairment charge, and the acceleration expense due to incentive comp award changes.  Additionally, lower incentive comp and severance costs also contributed to the decline. Lastly, our corporate costs saw a modest decline as some pandemic related employee programs began to roll off. But this was mitigated to a certain degree by preparation costs for associates returning to the office. As we go to the segments, I will just note that the sizable foundation contribution was allocated to the lines of business, and therefore negatively impact comparisons to prior quarters.  As we look forward, we continue to invest at a high rate in people and in technology and in new financial centers. We are seeing the benefits of these investments, and now as we move forward, we expect that natural attrition will allow us to reduce headcount as we transition back to a more normal business environment. As Brian mentioned, excluding summer interns, our headcount this quarter, moved down by about 2500 people. Turning to Asset Quality on Slide 13.  Nothing but good news to report here. Net charge-off this quarter fell to 595 million or 27 basis points of average loans. This is the lowest loss rate in more than two decades. That is 28% lower than Q1 and more than 30% below the Second Quarter of 2019. Our credit card loss rate was 2.67, and several loan product categories were in recovery positions this quarter. Provision was 1.6 billion -- was a $1.6 billion net benefit driven by the continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, which resulted in the $2.2 billion release of credit reserves, split fairly evenly between consumer and commercial loans.  Our allowance as a percent of loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.55%, which is still well above the 1.27%, which was the level as we begun 2020, following our day 1 adoption of CECL. And as a reminder, the mix of our loans has also changed since CECL day 1. To the extent the economic outlook and remaining uncertainties continue to improve, we expect our reserve levels could move lower.  Okay. On Slide 14, we show the credit quality metrics for both the consumer and commercial portfolios. There are a couple of points I would make here with respect to card losses.  Given the continued low level of late-stage delinquencies in the 180-day pipeline, we would expect card losses to decline again in Q3. For at least the next couple of quarters, I would expect total net charge-offs to moderate around the current level, with lower card losses, partially offset by lower net recoveries and other products. With respect to commercials, metrics, reservable criticized exposure, and NPL, both declined in the quarter.  Turning to the business segments, and starting with consumer on Slide 15. Consumer Banking produced another good quarter with strong customer deposits and investment flows, and the return of card loan growth.  This reflects the strength of our brand, our digital innovations, and the deployment of specialist in our centers, all of which enabled us to capture more than our fair share of the increase in customer liquidity. As Brian said earlier, this was a quarter of reopening where both our high-tech and high-touch capabilities delivered growth in client activity. Given vaccination progress, we've re-opened certain financial centers. More of our associates were at their posts in our financial centers and customer traffic was up.  All of the above drove higher sales in our centers. At the same time, we also saw increased sales through digital channels, which suggest increases in digital engagement are here to stay. The segment earned 3 billion in Q2, 13% higher than Q1 as revenue, expense, and credit costs all showed improvement. Revenue improved 1%, reflecting higher card income on increased purchase volumes and modestly higher account service charges on ATM usage. Expenses moved lower versus Q1, given the absence of the Q1 real estate impairment costs and seasonal higher payroll tax expense.  We also saw some modest improvement in COVID costs, as some of the elevated pandemic related associated costs began to wind down. Our cost of deposits this quarter improved to an impressive 118 basis points. The team has done a great job servicing more and more deposits while maintaining a strong cost discipline aided by digital engagement. Looking back at Q2 '19, we have added 38% more deposits, while expenses have only increased a little more than 3% annually in support of all that new activity, even with COVID.  On Slide 16, you can see the significant increase in consumer deposits and investments. Average deposits of 979 billion are up 55 billion linked-quarter and nearly 170 billion from Q2 '20, with more than 60% of that growth in checking. Rate paid is down 2 basis points, as 56% of the deposits are low-interest checking. We covered loans earlier, but we'll just note that while average loans are down linked-quarter, period end loans are up modestly excluding PPP, as growth in-card balances and vehicle lending outpaced a small decline in mortgages. With respect to investment balances, we reached a new record of 346 billion growing 40% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering.  On Slide 17 I'll highlight a couple of points regarding the continued improvement in engagement. After crossing 40 million digital users in Q1, we added another quarter million users in Q2. This quarter 70% of our consumer households used some part of our digital platform. We also reached 2.6 billion log-ins from customers in the last 90 days. And while you will note the tremendous Erica and Zelle usage, what I would draw your attention to is the digital sales growth, which is up 26% year-over-year. 85% of booked mortgages in the quarter were done digitally, while 77% of direct vehicle loans were digital.  Turning to Wealth Management. The continued economic reopening and strong market conditions led to records in average deposits, loans, investment balances, and asset management fees in Q2. Both Merrill and the Private Bank contributed to this improvement. Growth in gross new households at Merrill continued and the average size of the new households is larger this year than last year. And at the same time, net new households grew, but at a slower pace given expensive competitive hiring practice across the industry. We remain committed to organic growth in our advisors and private client sales force, as a stronger, more sustainable, long term strategy.  Net income of nearly 1 billion improved 12% from Q1, as we saw improvement in both revenue and expense. With respect to revenue, the record AUM fees complemented higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses dropped as the absence of seasonally elevated payroll tax in Q1 was partially offset by higher revenue-related costs. Client balances rose to a record of $3.7 trillion up $725 billion year-over-year, driven by higher market levels, as well as strong client flows.  Let's skip to Slide 20, which highlights our progress to digitally engage wealth management clients. In both Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank, we are focused on 3 pillars for digital engagement: 1, digital adoption and deeper engagement, 2, modernizing our platform for advisors and clients, and 3, secure an easy collaboration with clients.  We've provided stats on Slide 20 that show record levels of digital engagements improved further in Q2. These are some of the highest levels of digital activity across our customers. More and more clients are logging in to easily trade, check balances, and originate loans, all through one simplified sign-off. 70% of checks deposited by the Private Bank clients and more than half of checks from Merrill clients are being deposited digitally now.  And through leveraging Erica-based AI capabilities and through use of WebEx meetings and secure text messaging, we are making it easy and more efficient for clients to do business with us wherever and however they choose. This creates additional capacity for our advisors to spend more time with existing and potential clients. Moving to Global Banking on Slide 21. The business earned $2.4 billion in Q2, improving $251 million for Q1. Strong revenue growth and lower expenses were mitigated by a lower provision benefits in Q1.  Deposit growth maintained or remained strong and increased $20 billion to a new record. Outside of PPP loan forgiveness, we saw modest growth across the platform as discussed earlier. Revenue growth reflected the absence of the prior quarter impairment on some energy investments, as well as increased ESG investments. Revenue also included strong firm-wide IB fees of 2.1 billion, down only modestly from the record Q1 level. This performance resulted in an improvement to a Number 3 ranking in overall fees with a pipeline that remains strong. Strong debt issuance was more than offset by lower equity underwriting fees. We had a provision benefit driven by a reserve release of 834 million in Q2, which was $328 million lower than the Q1 release.  Net charge-offs were near zero, reflecting both low charge-offs and a notable recovery in the quarter. Noninterest expense declined 7% from Q1, reflecting lower compensation partially offset by other costs. We've already covered much of the balance sheet on Slide 22, so let's skip to Digital Trends on Slide 23. We continued our investments in digital solutions that deliver efficiencies for both clients and our employees. The solutions for clients have a compounded effect since they invariably need less manual intervention by the bank, enhancing both efficiency and satisfaction.  Enhanced banking solutions are helping us capture greater market share, as wholesale clients do more with their banking partners -- do more with banking partners that are stable and secure, and that have the capability to invest in new technologies that will provide better data and global integrated solutions. Digitization, and in particular, artificial intelligence, is helping us streamline processes and respond to clients more quickly and efficiently.  As an example, our bankers are using technology powered by Erica to not only better manage credit exposure, but also identify and win new business. We present some wholesale digital highlights on Slide 23. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 24, results reflect solid but lower sales and trading activity as noted earlier. While down from the more elevated pandemic periods, trading revenue is still 10% or so higher from Q2 '19. As I usually do, I will talk about results excluding DVA.  This quarter net DVA was negligible, but the year-ago quarter had a $261 million loss. Global Markets produced 934 million of earnings in Q2, down more than 1.1 billion compared to either Q1 for the year-ago quarter. Focusing on the year-over-year, revenue was down 15%, driven by the reduction in sales and trading. The year-over-year expense increase was driven by higher costs associated with processing unemployment claims and the activity-related sales and trading costs. Compared to Q1 expense, the higher unemployment processing costs were mostly offset by lower compensation. Sales and trading contributed $3.6 billion to revenue, declining 19% year-over-year.  FICC declined 38% while equities improved 33%, recording one of the strongest equity performances in our history. FICC results reflected a much more robust trading environment in the year-ago period, particularly for macro products. Q2 '21 saw credits tightened and agency mortgages endured a difficult trading environment given the volatility breaks. The strength in equities was driven by a strong trading performance in derivatives and increased client activity, notably in derivatives and in Asia.  On Slide 25, we note half-year revenue trends across the last few years. As you can see, while the pandemic elevated results in 2020, 2021 remained well above the prior years presented, driven by continued client activity and volatility in the market. Finally on Slide 26, we show All Other, which reported profit of 1.9 billion. The $2 billion tax adjustment benefit of results. Absent this benefit, we would've reported a $137 million loss, which is a decline of 239 from Q1 '21 driven by lower revenue. Revenue declined $545 million, reflecting two impacts. First, higher partnership losses on ESG -- on increased ESG investments.  As you know, we record grossed up revenue from these investments on an FTE basis in Global Banking, pay the full tax there, and then back out those entries in all other. You can also see the increase in ESG investments in Q2 in other income on our consolidated income statement where partnership losses are booked. While this loss impacts revenue, it is more than made up for on the tax line. We expect our tax credit and associated losses in consolidated other income to increase by at least 100 million in Q3.  And keep in mind, Q4 is normally even higher, reflecting seasonal activity. Revenue in all other was also impacted by some refinancing activity, recalled and refinanced higher-cost structured notes, which puts some AOCI back through the income statement. Our effective tax rate this quarter, excluding the $2 billion tax adjustments, was 10.7%. And further excluding tax credits driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been 25%.

I think if you look across all the businesses, on an end of period basis, have loan growth, which bodes well. The usage online is still low. And so that is still running in the low 30s, which is about a 1,000 basis points on average lower in the banking segment. But what you see underneath that is that even business banking, which is the segment from 5 million to50 million, is net growing finally, and it was the most affected by the PPP runoff. And the runoff in PPP in the quarter was about $6 billion, $7 billion or something like that. We impulse basically flat average balances, that included. We overcame that.  So we feel good as you look across the things. So what you really see is your net card production back to pre-pandemic, you see gross card production basically about 90% of pre-pandemic. You see autos, which will pick back up as inventories become available. And the real driver on the consumer side is mortgages. We've basically been holding our own right now. And that was different than, frankly, on the refi side, we lost some balances through the last several quarters. And on the commercial side, it's really line usage, honestly can't go any lower. Maybe can, but theoretically you can't because it's been stuck here for a good four or five quarters with the activity.  But the auto dealer line usage, which is net side the house, for example, is very low than it traditionally is. So we expect those to pick back up, but the key is we're actually producing more customers and more clients even at a low usage and the loans are starting to grow.",289.0,134.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.014925373134328358,0.007462686567164179,0.007462686567164179,0.0,0.0,0.007462686567164179

We're not providing specific '22 expense outlook, but I will offer the following thoughts which I think answer your question.

Remember, if we do nothing, cost would grow by 3% or 4%, but we're driving that lower every year and quarter through OpEx, [SIM] (ph) and other initiatives.  But if you take the 4Q expense, you have the higher seasonal payroll tax, at 1%, that's a good base, I think.

It's sort of that question, which is the consumer side doesn't get the advantage until you get the summary structure on the short end, especially.

There's $25 billion less balances, which people didn't get any different. They just have more cash. And so they paid off the credit cards, which is a completely responsible thing for them to do.

This quarter, the economy continued to make solid progress and our clients continued to perform well, having adjusted to the operating environment. Many companies are making healthy profits and our research team expects another strong quarter of profits by American businesses. We reported $7.7 billion in net income or $0.85 per diluted share in the third quarter, up significantly from the year-ago period. We've now earned over $25 billion for the first 9 months of the year. This quarter's strong results include some themes I want to highlight ahead of Paul (ph) going through the details on the quarter. Prior to the pandemic, Bank of America was growing and creating operating leverage quarter after quarter after quarter. As I said last quarter, the pre-pandemic organic growth machine has kicked back in. You see that this quarter, and is evident across all our lines of businesses. In addition, this quarter, we saw the return of operating leverage. We also saw another quarter of solid loan growth. The good news is that the nature of this growth has broadened in the third quarter, even as commercial banking utilization rates have improved somewhat. NII has improved significantly, reflecting the many quarters of growth in deposits and now loans. That also reflects the steady management of the interest rate risk and deployment of cash from our core deposit growth. At the same time, we still have a high level of asset sensitivity. We invest in our core deposits and that's supported stability in NII over the last year as rates and loans declined. What that did is bridge us to where we are now. This quarter where growth in loans and other factors that lead to an improvement in NII and a NIM. Strong free growth has complemented that NII improvement. And with expenses moving sharply lower, we saw notable return of operating leverage. Year-over-year, our revenue is up 12% and the expenses were flat. Our efficiency ratio is approved to 63%. As I've done in the past, I want to spend a moment on what we see in our consumer data. Let me hit a few slides beginning first on slide 3. The improvement in the vaccination and hospitalizations, all the things you know about, have seen the U.S. economy continue its reopening trajectory following a modest slowdown from the surge in cases caused by the Delta variant. There's been some discussion around the slowdown, I'll just note that the U.S. economy is now as large as it was in the pre-pandemic. Our own research team, not being in  at all, expects the U.S. economy to grow 5.5%+ this year and 5.2% next year. These growth rates are more than twice the growth rates that occurred in the pre-pandemic decade or longer. Unemployment rates continue to fall back to pre-pandemic levels. While the U.S. still has issues around labor supply, and supply chains of materials, the economy is moving along. Looking at our own customer base and consumer spending, I'd offer you a few insights. Third-quarter, total Bank of America consumer spending you can see it on the lower left-hand part of the slide. Payments were robust. They reached 937 billion up 23% over 2019 for the quarter and a similar percent of growth over 2020. September was the best month of the year, and we've seen that spending rates continue through the first part of October. Combined spend on total -- on debit and credit cards, which is a subset of this total, about 25% of it in that retailers and services remains strong. In third-quarter '21, we continue to see spending shift toward travel and in-person entertainment as well as fuel driven by both increased use in higher fuel prices. Year-to-date as you can see in the chart, our total payments of $2.8 trillion by our consumers are 22% ahead at the 2019 levels. In the chart on the right, you can see how fast the growth rates occur this year. And that's another economic sign -- signpost to the steady recovery. Now as we turn to loan growth on Slide 4, you can see this chart that we've been presenting to you for last several quarters. Why do we show you this? We wanted to show you that as we hit the bottom, the inflection point, and what happened a couple of quarters ago. And this chart gives you a sense of the daily progression across those quarters. As you can see, every loan category is thought to see an improvement. And if I showed you this by our lines of business, you would see similar progress across each one of them. Overall, ending loans, excluding PPP loans, which are in a forgiveness process, as you well know. Overall, those loans increased $16 billion linked-quarter. And if you look at the commercial portfolio, they grew $11 billion quarter-over-quarter. Compared to growth in Q2, growth this quarter was broad-based across global banking and global markets in the commercial space. C and I growth was driven in part by improved calling efforts from commercial Relations Manager that we deployed across the world, including in addition to a growing demand for credit. As you might note, we've invested in hundreds of relationship managers in our commercial lines of business, and you know, those investments are now bearing fruit. Loans with our wealth management clients continue to grow this quarter. As these customers borrow for the reasons they borrow for liquidity and asset purchases and other things. Interesting in our small business area, we're seeing the business have stabilize and start to grow. One of the areas is our Practice Solutions Group. What that group does is lend to -- lend to medical, dental, and veterinary practices. They've continued to see momentum and are on the pace for the best years they've ever had. Now, turning to consumer loans, the American consumer continues to borrow from Bank of America. Card loans grew 7% annualized from quarter two levels with increased spending. And as you well know, repayment rates trends remain high. All products on the consumer side except the home equity balances had higher balances for the quarter. The decline in home equity balance is understandable given the prepayments in mortgage loans, et cetera. But still we saw 1.5 billion in originations this quarter, up more than 50% from last year's third quarter. Now, turn your attention to slide in appendix not to cover it now, but you should take a look there and you'll see the true loan lining business on a bottom left-hand side that slide. And you'll see without the volatile PPP in and out that's occurred because the program design, the loans this year in those lines of businesses are basically within 1% of where they were last year, and we can grow out from here. Moving to slide 5, we want to show the continued reemerged the pre-pandemic growth machine of Bank of America. We give you a few highlights. Our Depo -- under the deposit side, we grew net consumer checking accounts, which are the primary transaction accounts for our consumers, 93% being primarily for the 11th consecutive quarter. This drove the continued growth in deposits in our leadership position in U.S. retail deposit market share reaching $1 trillion of deposits in our consumer segment alone. On credit cards to cross back over a million new card production. That's the same levels we were pre-pandemic. New investment accounts have increased 9% during the pandemic. Digital progress has occurred across every business and you'll see that in Paul 's slides later. And that's increased sales of products and high use of digital platforms. This bodes well for future sales levels and for future efficiency. Sales of banking products in Merrill Lynch and the private bank have remained strong and with the return to in-person meetings we should them even see them grow stronger. We have seen year-to-date assets under management flows grow and then nearly tripled compared to year-to-date '19. In markets and banking we had a near-record quarter  investment banking and equity trading revenue. So these are just a few examples of the customer growth we're seeing. A point or two on capital. This quarter's level of profits, coupled with our excess capital, allowed us not only to pay higher dividends to shareholders, but also to buyback $10 billion in shares. In total, we returned $12 billion to you our shareholders through these actions, proving that we can support our customers in a growing economy, support our teammates with great pay and benefits, and support our community sales I'll describe in a minute. But above all, and return capital to you our shareholders and drive good returns for you. Going to Slide 6. With regard to how the teams are delivering more broadly in our communities, we gave you in Slide 6 an update on our $1.25 billion commitment. To date, we have directly funded nearly $400 million, about 1/3 of that commitment. This includes $36 million in completed in equity investments in MDI and CDFIs. $300 million in equity investment commitments to minority-focused funds to support minority and women entrepreneurs and businesses. And $70 million have directed it philanthropic giving, directed at the priority shown on the slide, in addition to the amount we usually give on a yearly basis. Now it's worth noting that in addition to the equity investments, we have $2.1 billion in deposits in CDFIs and MDI, the largest in U.S. doing that. If you go to the next slide, slide 7, this is what we're doing with our customers to help them with their financial lives even better. It highlights the products and services starting with financial well-being of our retail clients, particularly in the low-to-moderate income areas we serve. This includes our commitment to our pathways program, where we hire team mates from our local communities to serve our communities and be successful in our Company as a Company of opportunity for them. We recently had to hire another 10,000 teammates from those communities -- from our communities over the next 5 years. That's because we completed the first 10,000 a year early. The unified ways in which our teammates and local markets do a spectacular job of approaching both banking from a global scale and both banking from a local community is unique and delivers every day for us. It's been a great job by our team this quarter, and I want to thank them. Now I'm going to turn it over to Paul. But as you know, Paul has been our CFO since 2015, has done a spectacular job with our Company. He's going off to help us do some interesting things in the Company, and I just want to congratulate and thank Paul for his support. I'll now turn it over to him to take you through his last earnings call.

BAC,2021-10-14,2021-10-14,,2021-10-14,2021-10-14T09:00:00-04:00,0,2021-10-14,qa,qna_heading,Paul Donofrio,"Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I will start on Slide 8 by adding a couple of comments on revenue and returns. On a year-over-year basis, revenue rose 12%. The improvement was driven by a nearly $1 billion increase in NII, and a nearly $1.5 billion increase in non-interest income. By the way, every business segment produced year-over-year improvement in non-interest income. Expenses declined from Q2 and were flat with Q3 20 despite the year-over-year improvement in revenue and related cost. Solid revenue growth while holding expense is flat, created 1,200 basis points of operating leverage and resulted in 8.3 billion of pretax, pre-provision income up 40% year-over-year. With respect to returns, our return on tangible common equity was 16% and ROE was 99 basis points, both of which improved nicely from the year-ago period. Moving to slide 9, the balance sheet expanded modestly versus Q2 to a little more than 3 trillion. After funding 9 billion of loan growth, deposit growth of 56 billion generated excess liquidity that was placed in a mixture of securities and cash. Our liquidity portfolio grew to 1.1 trillion or 1/3 of the balance sheet. Shareholders equity declined 4.7 billion from Q2 as capital distributions outpaced earnings this quarter. With respect to regulatory ratios, CET1 under standardize approach was 11.140 basis points lower than Q2, driven primarily by a reduction in excess capital through share repurchases and to a lesser degree, higher RWA as a result of commercial lending growth. The ratio was a 160 basis points above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, which translates into $26 billion capital cushion. Given our deposit growth, our supplementary leverage ratio declined to 5.6% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves plenty of capacity for Balance Sheet growth. Our T-LAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements. Turning to slide 10, I will focus on average loan balances because they are more closely linked to NII. Note that loan growth over the past 2 quarters has begun to show signs of improved demand, and I will refer to quarter-over-quarter improvements on an annualized basis. Also note that these charts include PPP loans, which have been moving lower, driven by forgiveness. The footnotes detailed the change in PPP loans. From a peak of $25 billion last year. PPP loans have declined through forgiveness to a little more than 8 billion on an ending basis. Focusing on the link quarter change in loans and excluding PPP loans, total consumer and commercial loans grew on an annualized basis by 9% with commercial growing at 11% and consumer improving 6%.  continued to benefit from security-based lending, as well as custom lending, while mortgage continued to perform solidly and global markets, we again look ed for investment-grade opportunities with clients as a good use of liquidity. In Global Banking, we saw utilization move past stabilization this quarter. But utilization rates are still 700 basis points lower than 2019, representing a $30 billion GAAP from current loan levels. In consumer, we saw credit card grow as new accounts continued to build across the quarters and credit spending continued to rebound. And importantly in mortgage, as Brian noted, we saw growth as prepayment volumes slowed. With respect to deposits on slide 11, we continued to see significant growth across the client base, adding accounts across all with deposit-taking businesses. Combining both consumer and wealth management, customer balances, I would highlight that retail deposits grew 28 billion from Q2. These deposits -- these clients now entrust us to manage more than 1.3 trillion in deposits, which is more retail deposits than any other U.S. bank. We also saw strong growth of 28 billion with our commercial clients. And remember, the deposits we are focused on and gathering are the operational deposits of our customers in both consumer and wholesale. Turning to slide 12 and net interest income. On a GAAP non - FTE basis, NII in Q3 was 11.1 billion, 11.2 billion on an FTE basis. Net interest income increased 965 million from Q3 '20, driven by deposit growth and related investing of liquidity, as well as PPP loan activity. These drivers were partially offset by lower loan levels. NII versus Q2 '21 was up 861 million. There were several positive contributors to the quarter-over-quarter growth. First, we had an additional day of interest. We also benefited from the continued deployment and growth of liquidity. Average loan growth also contributed to NII again this quarter. And we experienced an acceleration in the forgiveness of PPP loans, which improved NII quarter-over-quarter by a couple of 100 million. Last but not least, we had lower bond premium amortization expense, which declined from 1.6 billion to a little more than 1.4 billion. With respect to PPP loan forgiveness, I will emphasize that this was an acceleration or pull-forward of NII into Q3 from future periods. And as a side note, I would point out that the revenue from the PPP program has helped to defray some of the enormous cost of administering this assistance program on behalf of the government. Our net interest yield improved 7 basis points from Q2 to 1.68% driven by the improvement in NII. Importantly, given continued deposit growth and low interest rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains significant, highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships. As we move to Q4 and assuming no significant interest rate changes, we expect benefits from expected loan growth, liquidity deployment, and lower premium amortization expense to more than offset the expected reduction in PPP revenue I mentioned. Assuming the forward curve materializes and given Q3 NII growth, as well as expectations for Q4 and assuming we see any loan and deposit growth next year, we would expect NII in full-year 2022 to be well above full-year 2021. Turning to slide 13, on expenses. Q3 expenses were 14.4 billion, an improvement of more than 600 million versus Q2. Higher revenue related costs were more than offset by the absence of the prior quarters' contribution to our charitable foundation, as well as lower costs of unemployment claims processing. Compared to the year-ago period, expenses were flat as improvements in net COVID costs, the absence of elevated litigation in Q3 '20, as well as digitalization benefits and other initiative savings were offset by higher revenue-related and other costs. As we look forward, we continue to see investment in technology and people at a high rate across the businesses. And we are adding new financial centers in certain growth markets. Turning to asset quality on Slide 14. As I've reported for several quarters, the picture is very good here. Net charge-offs this quarter fell again to 463 million orC 20 basis points of average loans. This is the lowest loss rate in 50 years. Net charge-offs were 22% lower than Q2 and more than 42% below the same quarter in 2019. Our credit card loss rate was 1.7% and several loan product categories were still in recovery position this quarter. Provision was a $624 million net benefit-driven primarily by asset quality improvement as delinquencies and reservable criticized commercial loans continued to move lower. We had to reserve the lease of 1.1 billion split roughly 80% in commercial and 20% in consumer. Our allowance as a percentage of loans and leases ended the quarter at 1.43%, which is still well above the level following our day one adoption of , especially considering the mix of loans today versus then. To the extent, the macroeconomic environment and asset quality improves further and remaining uncertainties dissipate, we expect our reserve levels could move lower. On Slide 15, we show the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. The only point I would make here is just to note the continued low level of late-stage  loans, which drives expectation that card losses could decline yet again in Q4 before leveling off. Turning to the business segments, and starting with consumer on Slide 16. Before I touch on the financials, I want to highlight what a great job this team has done in turning this business around since the pandemic. All of our businesses -- of all our businesses, Consumer Banking was the most heavily impacted by the pandemic, which at its worst, drove quarterly profits to a very narrow level before rebounding. We incurred heavy cost to protect the health of our associates and customers, and we added contractors and other resources to support the government in our own customer assistance programs. We added billions to credit reserves, depressing profits, as  mounted with respect to potential credit losses. Net interest income declined as interest rates fell quickly and significantly. Fast-forward to this quarter, and the segment's rebound has accelerated as earnings rebounded to more than 3 billion. Net charge-offs are at historic Lows and NII has rebounded, reflecting not only deposit growth, but also the value of their deposits and customer relationships. The business alone has now crossed over 1 trillion in deposits, up 16% year-over-year. Our point here is that years of investing and operating under responsible growth, positioned us to not only deliver for everyone during the pandemic, but also rebound quickly to organic growth and operating leverage. We were never down and we never stopped investing. And while this is true of every segment, the rebound in our Consumer Banking earnings is just a great illustration of the resilience of our business and our people. The segment earned 3 billion in Q3, 48% higher year-over-year as revenue, expense, and credit cost all showed improvement. Revenue improved 10%, reflecting higher card income on increased purchase volumes and higher service charges due to client activity. Net checking accounts grew more than 700,000 year-to-date, and 93% of our consumer checking accounts are primary accounts with an average checking account balance of more than 10, 000. Expenses moved lower by 6% as a result of a continued reduction in COVID costs mitigated by higher costs for minimum wage increases and other operating costs. On credit, We had a $242 million reserve release this quarter. However, the more direct indicator of improved asset quality is the decline in net charge-offs. Net charge-offs of 489 million were down 26% year-over-year and 22% lower quarter-over-quarter. Our credit card net loss rate for the quarter was 1.7% pre-pandemic, it was over 3%. On Slide 17, you can see the increase in consumer deposits, loans and investments. We covered loans and deposit growth earlier with respect to investment balances, we reached a new record of 353 billion, growing 32% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering. Yes, balance grew as market values increased, but we also saw 21 billion of client flows. An important element of this growth has been the 9% growth in the number of accounts over the past year to more than 3 million. On slide 18, let me highlight a couple of points regarding the continued improvement in digital engagement. As all of you know, enrollment is important, but usage is key. We now have nearly 41 million customers actively using our industry-leading digital platform. This quarter, 70% of households used some part of our digital platform within the past 90 days, logging in more than 2.6 billion times. And while Erica and Zelle usage has been tremendous, what I would draw your attention to is the digital sales growth, which is up 27% year-over-year. Lastly, will not reflect on the slide, I would just add digital engagement has become foundational to maintaining our customer satisfaction at historic levels. Turning to Wealth Management, the continued economic reopening, client flows, and strong market conditions once again led to not only record investment balances and asset management fees, but also record levels of loan and deposits all contributing to a record pretax margin in Q3. In fact, this is the 46th consecutive quarter of average loan growth in this business. Both Merrill Lynch and the private bank contributed to the improvement and are driving digital engagement to deliver products and services to the clients. You can expect this to continue as we drive towards a modern Merrill, which is advisor-led, powered by digital. Growth in our new households at Merrill and at the private bank continued as we continue to build pipelines and move back towards pre-pandemic -- our pre-pandemic pace. Net income of 1.2 billion improved 64% year-over-year driven by the strong revenue performance. With respect to revenue  AUM fees, which grew 19% year-over-year, complemented higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses increased in alignment with higher revenue. Client balances rose to 3.7 trillion, up 20% year-over-year, driven by higher market levels, as well as strong flows of 91 billion. Let's skip to Slide 21 to highlight our progress in digitally engaging wealth management clients. The clients of this business continued to lead the franchise on digital adoption, utilizing not only digital tools to access their investments, but also other banking needs like mobile check deposit and lending. More and more clients logged in to easily trade, check balances, and originate loans all through one simplified sign-on. And through leveraging, Erica-based AI capabilities, and through use of WebEx meetings and secured text messaging, We are making it easier and more efficient for clients to do business with us wherever and however they choose. This creates additional capacity for our teams to spend more time advising existing and potential clients. Moving to Global Banking on slide 22, the segment had very strong performance with near-record investment banking fees, another solid quarter of deposit growth, and an uptake in loan demand. Strong deposit growth helped to improve NII, which complemented the continued strength in investment banking. The business earned 2.5 billion, improving 1.6 billion year-over-year, driven by both higher revenue and lower provision costs. Provision expense reflected a reserve release compared to builds in the year-ago quarter. Revenue grew 16% and included an 8% improvement in NII while firm-wide investment banking fees were up 23% to 2.2 billion down only modestly from the Q1 record level. This IB performance resulted in a number for ranking and overall fees with a pipeline that remains strong. We rank number 1 in leveraged finance and investment-grade with strong market share improvement compared to the year-ago period. We also had record M&A results. It is worth noting that we continued to see strong momentum in investment banking with our middle-market clients. As many of you know, we have been investing in our investment banking capabilities with middle-market clients for a few years now. Over that time, we have executed transactions for nearly 300 first-time IB clients, and we now have investment bankers in 23 cities across the U.S. Non-interest expense increased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher revenue-related costs and continued investment in the franchise. We've already covered much of the balance sheet on slide 23, so let's skip to digital trends on 24. Digital investments, strategies, and tactics are an enterprise effort, with earnings in one segment benefiting in another. That has been particularly true in global banking. And as we continue to invest -- we continue our investments in digital solutions, our client adoption and usage continues to grow. Enhanced Banking Solutions have helped us capture greater market share as wholesale clients do more with banking partners that are the most stable and secure and have the capability to invest in new technology that will provide better data and global integrated solutions. Switching to global markets on slide 25, results reflect solid sales and trading activity led by our equity's business. As I usually do, I will talk about the segment results, excluding DVA, this quarter net DVA was a modest loss, but the year-ago quarter had a higher $160 million loss. Global markets produced 4 -- excuse me. Global markets produced 941 million in earnings on par with the year-ago quarter. Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was up 3% driven by sales and trading. Sales and trading contributed 3.6. billion to total revenue, improving 9% year-over-year. FICC declined 5%, while equities improved 33%, recording one of its stronger -- strongest performances ever. FICC results reflected a flat yield curve and range-bound interest rates for much of the quarter with continued tight credit spreads. With interest rates moving late in the quarter, we saw an improvement in activity in revenue opportunities. The strength in equities was driven by growth and our client financing business, as well as a strong trading performance and increased client activity in both cash and derivatives. The increase in expense year-over-year was driven by increased activity-related sales and trading costs. On slide 26, we note year-to-date revenue trends across the last few years. As you can see, while our performance was elevated in 2020 during the pandemic, 2021 remains well above the pre-pandemic years presented, driven by continued elevation of client activity and volatility in the market, as well as investments made to extend more balance sheet to clients. Finally, on Slide 27, we show All Other, which reported a small net loss. Revenue declined by 109 million year-over-year, reflecting higher partnership losses on ESG investments. Expense was lower year-over-year, driven by the absence of litigation accruals in the prior period. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 14%. Excluding the tax credits driven by our portfolio of ESG investments, our tax rate would have been roughly 25%. We would expect the tax rate in Q4 to be between 10% and 12%, absent any tax law changes or unusual items. With that, we can go to Q&A.",2880.0,1629.0,68.0,33.0,14.0,5.0,4.0,10.0,6.0,13.0,0.041743400859422956,0.020257826887661142,0.008594229588704727,0.003069367710251688,0.0024554941682013503,0.021485573971761818

And then we'd expect them to grow, you have a 3% inflationary between raises and leave aside that the market's going up as you said, and could drive a moment in time and et cetera, but if you have 3% sort of embedded in CPI type of increases in merit and rents and things like that, and what we said is through our efficiency, we could -- when we got to the floor, which was the '19 year, the idea was then to manage that to 1% net growth, and we've been able to keep working at that. With the PPP and with the COVID-related costs and stuff, it's kind of threw it all around for the last 12 months, but you'll see that start to emerge coming out the other side. So the idea would be to grow revenues faster than the economy and grow expenses at a rate of net 1%, maybe 2% if the revenue growth is stronger. And, you know, that's the operating model. And you saw that come on quarter-after-quarter of operating leverage, I think for basically three years plus 14 quarters or something like, then the pandemic pushed that around. And as we stabilize after the pandemic a couple of quarters ago, you are seeing a comeback to the system.",256.0,106.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.04716981132075472,0.0,0.03773584905660377,0.0,0.0,0.04716981132075472

This is 48th quarterly earnings conference call, so it's been a long time but -- and I would rather never have to have senior leaders move because -- but they have a choice in life and when they retire, we have to adjust to it. But what we tried to accomplish if you go back to last summer, we put a lot of senior executives onto the management team.  What has happened now with Andrew's retirement -- Tom's retirement and Andrew's retirement is those executives now are reporting directly to me. And that's really the efforts. So we were a younger, more diverse, three women, running the eight lines of business same philosophy how we run the Company.  And now with a group of people, we have your 5-10 years ahead of them and then we have two international colleagues on the management team for the first time. And Bernie (ph) and Kathy. Kathy is needed to help us in the European context as Brexit came through, it's different and that -- so she is going to go help us in that and be a great help to as Bernie has international -- does a great job for us.  But the idea was to elevate people who -- and also focused on people who are thinking 10 years out as opposed to 1 or 2 and retirement and so that's really genesis of it. You know, if people retire and we make reactions and, you know, Tom and Anne (ph) and Andrew have tremendous teammates. But the best thing they did for us, they developed a bench behind them that is extremely strong that can step into the jobs.

The primary keeps going up. It actually went from 92 to 93% over last year of primarily accounts. So the production hit this quarter was I think a 10-year high in terms of net accounts. And that's coming both from the digital 30% of sales round numbers.  And we now have, to your point over the last three years, developed full digital execution in terms of account opening for core accounts in terms of auto purchases, in terms of mortgage origination, etc, which now allow the fully digital practice to take place. Half the sales are digital, the good news honestly is that as the branches reopened over the last -- and people -- the business went up, you saw the count sold rise because it takes both high-tech, high-touch and high-tech to be successful.  So the percentage of sales that digital came down, but that's because overall sales jumped up and obviously there are more brands dominate. But you got it exactly right. We think that is a more efficient method of accumulating customers. We think we have about 17% market share in the Gen-Z area that is heavily digitally originated. A lot of college, a lot of other things going on. But the key is to realize the net balances per account have gone from 7,000 to 10,000 over the last couple of years.  So you're seeing a bigger and bigger core position. When you go with -- and that's one thing to keep it in mind is when we give you our 40 digital customers, these customers are core customers with big balances. Merrill Lynch, for example. I think we're up to 70,000 or something average balance per account, not 3,000 or 4,000. But anyway, just on the cloud. The cloud is a complex question.  As you are well aware, over the last 8, 10 years, Kathy and the team led an effort to internalize our cloud, which made us a lot more efficient. And so we look at -- we run -- percentage of our business outside due to certain executions and things like that. We have 500 different software programs that run in a FA -- the SaaS basis, which is the question cloud can be misleading is can you get to the -- all the product types or capability types?  You can get out there because of the new companies that develop them on the cloud-based systems and we can get to them all. The IBM's efforts to internalize a Cloud that we can use the financial service industry and IBM is working on that. But these things have to be done carefully for purposes of security and trust and understanding our businesses.  And so far, we've come to the judgment that we're continuing to internalize and saving a lot of money and we continue to add modest amount to the cloud.

When looking at the consumer deposit base, sometimes, I think it's deja vu all over again, it's a classic statement, because in '15, '16, '17 it was all about the Fed's going to normalize rates and you're going to have to raise prices, and we didn't have to because we -- the reason why we don't have to is, these are core transaction accounts, in a large part, non-interest bearing. And so you'll see some of that same dynamic apply again as the rates normalize and the monetary supply has changed, but in the consumer business, 56% of the balances are checking, so that would say those are core transaction accounts, money moving in and out, very little CDs, I think 50, 60 billion bucks or something like that. So the $1 trillion is all basically in checking and money market. Can it move around?  Yes. If you look, one of the things that bodes and -- well for the economy is that if you look at a checking customer that has made $2,000 or $3,000 in balances with us, either sitting with 3 to 4 times -- 3 times what they had before the crisis. That's good news. They will spend some of that, I assume.  But interestingly enough, that's been growing month over month for the last few months. It's not going down, even though the stimulus payments to customers in large part other than the childcare stops. So one thing is it bodes well for the economy. And this isn't trying to  you to -- some viewpoint about it is there's consumers still have a lot of money in their accounts and are going to spend it.  Going back to your deposit question, could that mean those balances come down a little bit. But it would be overcome by the new accounts coming on at a million a year that carried $10,000 average balance, etc. We feel good about long-term deposit growth, and it's all -- it's driven by the check-in core transactions.  Loan-to-deposit ratio, it's our customers driving, so when the usage by the auto dealer lines was down to 25% of what it was because inventories being down, of course, we -- they want to borrow, we want to lend to them because that means they have the inventory to sell to the consumer. So this is a customer-driven business and so 900 billion  of loans against 2 trillion of deposits is largely driven by the customer activity.  The good news is you can see in those charts that I call the smile charts on the loan growth page there that the other half to smile is coming up, meaning that the customers are starting to draw on credit and use it. And that above well for the customer growing their businesses and stuff.  But importantly, thinking about just the economy generally. One of the things I just want to remind you, Gerard, is we breakout consumer and  and a lot of people talk about retail deposits. That is 1.4 trillion when -- 1.3 trillion when you combine them together. So it is a big machine and it's all transactional and we just don't think that moves as much on monetary supply questions as obviously institutional side.",546.0,230.0,3.0,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.013043478260869565,0.02608695652173913,0.013043478260869565,0.0,0.0,-0.013043478260869565

And you're seeing net new customers in the business banking, small business segments and stuff growing.  You see that in the wealth management business.

Everywhere else that's going to follow the customer, but it's the core customer growth and that's why you put those statistics and that you see.

I do think it's important to remind everybody. I know, you know it, but I'll remind everybody that these partnership losses are booked in other income.  But they are more than offset in the tax line. So as we grow these activities in the future, there will be a small headwind to revenue growth, but not to net income growth given the tax benefits of these investments. As you think about modeling, everybody out there, we expect the fourth-quarter loss to be 800 million on the other income line from these tax investments, or even perhaps a little higher, reflecting both that typical seasonal increase in the fourth quarter and partnership investments, as well as there were a few deals in the third quarter that got delayed because of all the logistical stuff.

Well, look, in card income, just a couple of points to make just so no one's confused, when you look at our sort of Consumer Banking card income fees, they were up very nicely year-over-year at about 8% driven, as you said, by the purchase volume increases despite the fact that payment rates are still relatively high.  But when you look at the consolidated line, you're not going to see that. That's up only slightly versus Q3 '20 because of the decline in card income associated with processing unemployment claims, which sits in global markets. Just for some clarification there. In terms of balances, look, we're expecting card balances to continue to improve.  The balances grew 7% quarter-over-quarter on an annualized basis, including some small growth and revolving balances. And we opened over a million new accounts, which now matches pre-pandemic levels. I think balanced growth reflected higher spend and the reinitiated marketing efforts that we've talked about, including promo offers.  While again, payment rates remained elevated. We expect higher Q4 seasonal purchase volume, and that's going to drive additional balances in cards.",192.0,105.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.01904761904761905,0.0380952380952381,0.009523809523809525,0.009523809523809525,0.0,-0.01904761904761905

You got the balance question on cards, but you do always have to look at the spending side of it. And we said -- debit and credit cards are only about 20% of the way consumers spend money out of their accounts. Cash, all the ATMs, checks written. Zelle is taking off and becoming a meaningful amount of the payments.  I think in -- but cards are an easy form of payment. We're already seeing  tap cards or things at 12% of the spend, 12% of the penetration already, but the good news is, no matter how you cut it and how you look at it, two good messages, card balances are growing, but there's still tremendous capacity for the consumers to borrow if they want to, to do things.",135.0,61.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.06557377049180328,0.03278688524590164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03278688524590164

In an economy in the U.S. which is led by the American consumer, that is a tremendous amount of spending that's going on, and it's accelerating, even as the stimulus is not in the rearview mirror by quite a -- many months. So as people get back to work and higher wages and things, there's just more money to spend.  So I think the focus on card as a spending vehicle versus a borrowing vehicle,  something we look at, but if we like the business, we continue to generate a million new cards as Paul talked about, and it will break down about who needs to borrow and what, and the asset quality is unbelievable.

The second quarter we said -- in the second-half quarter especially we saw growth.  All that loan stayed on the books plus we grew it on top of that, as we said earlier, at $60 billion excluding the PPP. That's what's going to build into the NII projections going forward because that's 250, 300 basis points spread stuff. And remember, we're funding with 0 cost deposits to the tune of 2 or $300 billion up year-over-year.  So that's what drives -- that's what will drive it long-term.

I hope all of you continue to manage safely through the new variant. First, I'd like to start this call by recognizing that Paul, our CFO for many years, has now moved on to help us with our efforts helping our customers make a just transition to a low-carbon footprint, and I want to thank him for his many years of service. And welcome Alastair to the call, our new CFO has been in that role since November 1st, and he's off to a great start, and you're going to hear from him in a minute. So just stepping back on the cover slide. Today, we reported $7 billion in after-tax net income or $0.82 per diluted share. That's up significantly from the year-ago period. This quarter was a repeat of the themes we discussed with you in the last few quarters, the pre-pandemic organic growth engine that is Bank of America is fully back in place and producing success. We had strong organic and responsible growth across all our businesses. We grew revenue and produced positive operating leverage. We continue to see very strong asset quality metrics. We support our clients and their need for capital. And we made further progress in support of local community efforts across all our markets. I want to congratulate importantly and thank our 200,000 teammates around the globe for all the great work they did in 2021 that enable us to deliver for our clients, our team, our shareholders and our communities. Let's go to start on slide 2 and a few comments about our full year results. This quarter capped a record year of $32 billion in earnings for 2021 and represented significant growth in net income over 2020. We even saw a more significant growth in EPS as share count dropped. We generated more than $7 billion of earnings in every quarter in 2021. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year and activity gained momentum throughout the year. NII grew well in the second half of the year, which complemented fee growth, especially in our markets-related businesses. Wealth Management, investment banking and sales and trading revenues were all strong in '21.  NII, recall that in the first quarter 2021, we noted at the time that our expectation is that quarterly NII could progress, up by $1 billion per quarter as we entered the fourth quarter. And in fact, we have recorded fourth quarter NII that is $1.2 billion or 12% better than first quarter '21. Our teams managed well through the rate volatility, and we grew loans and deposits with our customers as the year progressed. That sets us up nicely for 2022, and Alastair is going to talk about that in a minute. Expense was well managed, but expense did go up as we continue to invest for growth. That's axiomatic. Our COVID-related costs remained elevated and revenue-related costs grew. So, while we do not see full year operating leverage, we did, however, return to strong operating leverage in each of the last two quarters of the year, restarting our streak that we had before the pandemic. Credit remains stellar through 2021. Charge-offs consistently improved each quarter. Our commitment to responsible growth remains well placed. We are growing faster than market and keeping credit costs in check. The economic improvement and our strong credit allowed us to release much of the reserves we built in 2020. When you look at the balance sheet, we grew deposits $270 billion in 2021. That was on top of the $360 billion of growth we had in 2020. Our loan growth accelerated throughout the year. Fourth quarter represented the strongest quarter of organic loan growth we have experienced at Bank of America. Now, of course, that's absent the first quarter of 2020 at the start of COVID, which had $70 billion of panic drawdowns in a few weeks. At the end of the day, we produced strong ROA and a 17% ROTCE for you, our shareholders, and we returned $32 billion in capital during the year. Let's go to slide 3. The best way to highlight the drivers behind the earnings success is to look at the momentum in client activity across the businesses. This shows organic growth engine is running hard. More and more of this client activity is powered by our digital transformation, which is foundational to everything we do. We are proud of our digital stats and continue to spotlight our results later in the materials as usual, see pages 24 to 28. But some key stats on this page. Consumers logged into our digital channels more than 2.7 billion times in the fourth quarter alone. Erica, our digital financial assistant, completed more than 400 million requests from our clients in the year 2021. Half our consumer sales were digital in the fourth quarter. 86% of all the check deposit transactions are now digital. Customers used Zelle to transfer $65 billion in the most recent quarter. The number of Zelle transactions now surpasses the checks written by our consumers. Cash flow approvals by our commercial and corporate clients to move money grew 240% since the pandemic. So the digital journey continues, and that supercharges our relationship manager-driven model. And together, that has driven the growth in loans and deposits and fees. Net new checking accounts have grown in each of the past 12 quarters. This contributes to the continued growth in our core deposits. This also demonstrates the extent of our leadership position with U.S. consumers and deposits. We have $1.4 trillion in deposits from all American consumers. On credit cards at roughly 1 million new accounts in the fourth quarter alone, that's now operating at the same level of new card production as it was pre-pandemic. We're going to continue to drive that opportunity. When you think about consumer investments, Merrill Edge, as we call it, we opened 525,000 new accounts in the year 2021. Those accounts carried -- new at opening, $70,000 in balances for each of those accounts. This demonstrates the deep penetration of the mass affluent customer base of America. Sales of bank products in both Merrill and our Private Bank teams have remained strong. Now when you combine Merrill, the Private Bank and consumer investments, they produced more than $170 billion in net client flows in 2021. In Global Banking, we had record years of investment banking fees combined with strong GTS results. In Global Markets, we saw record equity sales and trading revenue. These are just a few examples of the types of client activity that are driving market share gains for our company. As I've done in the past, I want to spend a few minutes on the broader economy, and I use our own customer data to make a few points. Let's go to slide 4. First, on consumer spending, I'd offer a few thoughts. We are a provider of choice for individuals and businesses when paying for goods and services. Our award winning and easy-use capabilities across all forms help clients budget, save, spend and borrow carefully and confidently. We look at all forms of consumer spending, including ACH, wires bill pay, P2P, cash and checks. Many firms and many people discuss credit and debit spending, but as you look at the chart on the lower left-hand side of page 4, you can see that 80% of the money moves in other form. So, what happened in 2021? Well, consumers spent record amounts in context on comparing '21 against the pre-pandemic period of '19. And you can see that in the upper charts on both sides of the page. Bank of America's 67 million clients made $3.8 trillion in total payments during 2021. That was an increase of 24% over pre-pandemic levels, an all-time high. Fourth quarter and December payments also reached record highs. Fourth quarter payments were up 28% over 2019. And December payments were up 30% over 2019. These are the dollar volume payments, but likewise, the numbers of payments were up double digits also and showing more work and more activity. Just focusing on debit and credit spending, for the holiday period of November and December, spending was up 26% over 2019. This data confirms that consumers continue to spend into the holiday season. And so far this year, that strength continues. For all the spending of all types through January 17, 2022, we have seen it up over 11% versus the start of '21, which is well up over '20 and '19. That bodes well for the rest of the year and quarter. Focusing on the channels of payment, in the lower right-hand chart, as you'd expect cash and check volumes are down 24% for 2021 compared to '19. This simply means more and more customers are using our digital capabilities to achieve their goals each year. Now importantly, though, this allows us to grow our consumer business with lower cost. We believe there's lots of potential spending capacity left as average deposit balances continue to move up to the end of the year, despite the heavy spending you see. We had one segment, one cohort of deposits that dipped for one month out of the last part of the year. In November, we had a small dip in customers who had $2,000 or less in their balances pre-pandemic. They dipped by 1%. Other than that every cohort from June, July, August, September, October, November and December all grew every month. And what's striking is that the balances for people had less than $2,000 average balances before the pandemic, they're now sitting with 5 times the balances they had pre-pandemic. For those customers at $10,000 in accounts before the pandemic, they're now sitting with 2 times in their accounts. The teams track this data carefully and it shows the spending power left in the American consumer. Another economic signpost worth noting with our customer activity was acceleration of loan growth in the fourth quarter. Earlier this year, we -- earlier last year, we talked about the green shoots of loan growth we saw in the first quarter, and we saw that turn into growth as we move through the quarters, culminating with $50 billion in record loan growth this quarter. We note these borrowers, both consumer and commercial, have strong capacity to continue to borrow if they so desire as lines across the border and low-usage status. We provide slide 5 to show you the daily outstanding loans again this quarter, which gives you a sense of progression across time. Every loan category saw improvement this quarter except for home equity. But I would draw your attention to on slide 5 is the addition of the pre-pandemic starting point to give you some reference. Well, some of the growth this quarter was in Global Markets, and that business ebbs and flows with the market activity. $35 billion of that $50 billion was in the core consumer and commercial books. So far in January, the businesses other than Global Markets continue to show growth over the end of the year. So, let's start and talk about the commercial portfolio where we have moved above the pre-pandemic level for the most recent growth. Commercial loans, excluding PPP, grew $43 billion or 9% linked quarter. Compared to quarter three, growth this quarter was broad-based across all segments of commercial lending. We saw improvement in both new loans as well as improving utilization from existing clients. This reflects the intense relationship manager effort our teams have done and -- across the last couple of years and adding more and more relationship managers. Commercial loans of Wealth Management clients extended their growth trend this quarter as these customers barred for various liquidity needs for asset purchases. In small business lending, the all-important small business segment, lending activity is running consistently above pre-pandemic levels. And especially in our Practice Solutions Group that supports medical dental and veterinary practices, we continue to see continued momentum and finished one of the best years across all small business with our Business Advantage rewards cards. Turning to consumer loans. Card loans grew $4.6 billion or 6% from quarter three levels. This occurred as spending increased and even occurred as payment rates paying off the card completely trended higher for the quarter. Card balances still remain well below the pre-pandemic levels of $95 billion, and we continue to push that opportunity. Mortgage loan levels grew 2% linked quarter as origination remained at high levels and paydown slowed down. On the next, slide 6, I would like -- I would say that while we delivered capital back to our shareholders, $32 billion, and we invested in our teammates, we also continue to invest in our communities through our local teams across the country focused on our markets. I call out the reference in the bottom of the slide, middle -- bottom middle of slide 6 to the sweeping changes we announced last week in our NSF policies. These updates continue the work we began over a decade ago to simplify our product set and allow a great experience for our clients and an efficient capability for our operations. Eliminating NSF fees and reducing the overdraft charge per occurrence from $35 to $10 and the other changes we're making is a big win for our clients. It's going to have an obvious impact on those fees, which have fallen dramatically since 2009 and 2010, but currently run about $1 billion in '21, and we'd expect them to drop by 75% over the next year or so. With that, let me turn it over to Alastair.",2226.0,1144.0,40.0,7.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.03496503496503497,0.006118881118881119,0.004370629370629371,0.0,0.0008741258741258741,0.028846153846153848
BAC,2022-01-19,2022-01-19,,2022-01-19,2022-01-19T11:00:00-05:00,0,2022-01-19,qa,qna_heading,Alastair Borthwick,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take us to our fourth quarter results on slide 7, focusing on comparisons against the prior year quarter. And I'll also talk through the high-level commentary on slide 8. As Brian noted, we produced $7 billion in net income, which grew 28% from fourth quarter '20, while earnings per share of $0.82 improved at a faster 39% pace due to our share repurchases. Looking at our top line improvement on a year-over-year basis, revenue rose 10%. The improvement was driven by a $1.2 billion increase in NII and a little more than $800 million increase in noninterest income. Each business segment produced strong noninterest income results. And as you look at significant components of revenue, it was pretty consistent through the quarters in 2021. One important aspect of responsible growth has been to grow consistently and sustainably. And I think we executed on that in 2021 with investment banking over $2 billion each quarter; sales and training -- trading near or above $3 billion each quarter; investment and brokerage services revenue over $4 billion each quarter. With regard to expenses, our revenue-related costs increased, and we continue to make investments in our people and our capabilities to grow the franchise. At the same time, lower COVID costs and further digital engagement have helped to offset some of those increases. In the fourth quarter, revenue growth outpaced expense growth on a year-over-year basis, which produced operating leverage of 400 basis points and a 19% year-over-year improvement in pretax pre-provision income to $7.3 billion. With regard to returns, our ROTCE was 15%, ROA was 88 basis points, both of which improved nicely over the year. Moving to slide 9. During the quarter, the balance sheet grew $85 billion to a little less than $3.2 trillion, and this reflected the $100 billion of growth in deposits. These deposits funded $51 billion of loans growth. And we also added $14 billion in securities, and so our cash increased by $68 billion. Partially offsetting these increases were typical year-end moves in our Global Markets balance sheet. Our liquidity portfolio grew to $1.2 trillion or a little more than a third of our balance sheet and shareholders' equity declined $2.4 billion from Q3, driven by the $8.9 billion of capital distributions, which once again outpaced earnings in the fourth quarter as it did in Q3. With regard to our regulatory ratios, CET1 under the standardized approach was 10.6% and remains well above our 9.5% minimum requirement. The CET1 ratio declined 50 basis points from Q3, driven by excess capital reduction as well as an increase in our RWA due to the strong loans growth. And we're happy to see that capital usage increasingly needed to support customers and to fuel their growth, while still producing plenty of capital to return to our shareholders. Earnings alone in the most recent quarter contributed 45 basis points to our CET1 ratio before the other capital impacts of share repurchase. Given our deposit growth, our supplemental leverage ratio declined to 5.5% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which still leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. And our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements. Turning to slide 10. We included the schedule on average loan balances, but in the interest of time, I don't have anything to add beyond what Brian noted earlier. Moving to deposits on slide 11. We continue to see significant growth across the client base as we deepened relationships and added net new accounts across our deposit-taking businesses. Combining both consumer and Wealth Management customer balances, I would highlight that retail deposits grew $48 billion from Q3. Our retail deposits have now grown to nearly $1.4 trillion, and we lead our competitors. We also saw continued strong growth with our commercial clients. And remember, the deposits we're focused on and are gathering are the operational deposits of our customers in both consumer and wholesale. Turning to slide 12 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $11.4 billion. But I know, as investors, you tend to focus on the FTE NII number, which was $11.5 billion. So, focusing on the change on an FTE basis, net interest income increased $1.2 billion from Q4 '20 or 11%, driven by deposit growth and related investing of liquidity. NII versus Q3 of '21 was up $319 million, driven by deposit growth and then higher securities levels as well as loans growth. Premium amortization declined roughly $100 million to $1.3 billion in Q4, and the positive NII impact of lower premium amortization offset lower PPP fees. Given continued deposit growth and low rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains significant. It's modestly lower quarter-over-quarter as long-end rates moved higher, and we recognized some of that sensitivity in our now higher reported level of NII. So, I'd like to give you a couple of thoughts on NII expectations for 2022. First, I want to start by reiterating Paul's comment last quarter that we expect to see robust NII growth in 2022 compared to 2021. That assumes we see continued loans growth and the rising rate expectations embedded in the forward curve. And in the first quarter specifically, we expect two headwinds. First, there are two less interest accrual days in the quarter. And as a reminder, we picked those back up in the subsequent two quarters. Second, we expect less PPP fee benefits. Combined, those two headwinds add to about $250 million. Despite those headwinds, we would still expect Q1 to be up about a couple of hundred million from Q4 and should grow nicely each subsequent quarter in 2022. Again, that's of course dependent upon the realization of the forward curve and some loans growth. Lastly, as we see the forward curve now expecting a new rate hiking cycle to begin, we added slide 13, as we thought it might be helpful from a historical context to see the trend of NII across the years since the last rate hike cycle. And what I draw your attention to is the stark difference in the size of our balance sheet today. And because of that balance sheet differential, today's NII is already at the NII level we saw when we were well into the middle of the last rate cycle. And importantly, our short-end asset sensitivity today is twice what it was in the third quarter of 2015 as that cycle began. Okay. Let's turn to costs, and we'll use slide 14 for that discussion. Our Q4 expenses were $14.7 billion, an increase of $291 million from Q3. Higher revenue-related costs, and to a lesser degree, seasonally higher marketing costs drove the increase. As Brian noted at the mid-quarter conference, our Q4 expenses were a bit higher than we anticipated when we ended the last quarter. Revenue continued to hold up well, and the company had a good year, both resulting then in higher incentive costs. Compared to the year-ago period, expense growth was driven by incentive costs associated with all of our markets-related improvements. As we look forward, we continue to invest in technology and people at a high rate across our businesses, and we continue to add new financial centers in expansion and growth markets. So, let me say two things about 2022 expenses. First, relative to Q4 expense, we expect Q1 to include two elements of seasonality. We typically experience seasonally higher payroll tax expense, and that was about $400 million in 2021. Also, Q1 is typically our best period of sales and trading revenue which results in modestly higher associated costs. Second, with regard to full year 2022, our best expectation currently is we can hold expenses flat compared to 2021, which finished just below $60 billion. This guidance incorporates our expected continuing investments, strong revenue performance and the inflationary costs we experienced in the second half of 2021. It also relies upon our continued expense discipline, operational excellence improvements and the benefits of digital transformation to deliver the operating leverage we seek. Turning to asset quality on slide 15. The asset quality of our customers remains very healthy and net charge-offs this quarter fell to a historical low of $362 million or 15 basis points of average loans. They continued a steady decline through the quarters of 2021, with Q4 down $100 million from Q3 and down more than $500 million from Q4 last year. Our credit card loss rate was 1.42%, and that's less than half of the pre-pandemic rate. It improved each quarter during the year. Several other loan product categories have been in recovery positions throughout the year. Provision was a $489 million net benefit in Q4, driven primarily by asset quality, and macroeconomic improvement and was partially offset by loans growth. This included a reserve release of $850 million, primarily in our commercial portfolio. And on slide 16, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Turning to the business segments. Let's start with Consumer Banking on slide 17. I'll start by acknowledging what a strong year the Consumer Bank has had as they generated nearly $12 billion of earnings, which is 37% of record year results for the company. Consumer opened over 900,000 net new checking accounts. And in fact, this quarter represents their 12th consecutive quarter of net new consumer checking account growth. And in turn, consumer grew deposits by more than $140 billion. They opened 3.6 million credit cards and grew card accounts in 2021 by more than any of the past four years. This helped card balances grow in Q4, despite payments remaining high. They also opened 525,000 new consumer investment accounts. And that helped us to reach a new record for investment balances of $369 billion, growing 20% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering. Yes, market valuations grew balances, and we also saw $23 billion of client flows since Q4 '20. So, Q4 was a strong finish to these results. And in the quarter, the business produced $3.1 billion of earnings off $8.9 billion of revenue and manage costs well. Our 8% revenue growth was led by NII improvement as we continue to recognize more of the value of our deposit book. And while revenue grew, expense declined by 1% year-over-year, generating over 900 basis points of operating leverage. Lower COVID costs and increased digital adoption by clients more than offset our continued investments in people and our franchise. This expense discipline has now driven our cost of deposits to an industry-leading 111 basis points. Net charge-offs declined and we had $380 million of reserve release in the quarter. And as you can see, and as I already noted, deposits continued to grow strongly both year-over-year as well as linked quarter. Importantly, our rate paid remained low and stable. Turning to the Wealth Management business. Bank of America continued to deliver Wealth Management at scale across a full range of client segments. The continued economic progress, strong market conditions and the efforts of our advisors contributed to strong client flows and net new household growth. This allowed Wealth Management to generate more than $4 billion in earnings in 2021, up more than 40% from 2020. In Q4, this powerful combination of Merrill Lynch and our Private Bank produced records for revenue, earnings, investment balances and asset management fees as well as record levels of loans and deposits. In fact, with regard to loans, this is the 47th consecutive quarter of average loans growth in the business. It's consistent and it's sustained. Q4 net income was $1.2 billion, improving 47% year-over-year and driven by strong revenue growth, good expense controls and lower credit costs. Revenue growth of 16% was led by strong improvements in both, AUM and brokerage fees as well as higher NII on the back of solid loan and deposit increases. Expenses increased 8% in alignment with the higher revenue and resulted in 800 basis points of operating leverage. Client balances of $3.8 trillion rose $491 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by higher market levels as well as very strong net client flows of $149 billion. Within these flows, deposits grew $68 billion year-over-year to $390 billion, and loans grew $21 billion year-over-year to $212 billion. And that loan and deposit growth is further evidence that more and more Merrill and Private Bank clients are using the bank's products broadly. Net new household generation is getting closer to pre-pandemic levels as advisors are meeting in person more with clients and are building their pipelines back following the shutdown during the pandemic. This quarter, Merrill Lynch net new households of 6,700 and Private Banking relationships net new of 500 were both up more than 30% from the year-ago period. The clients of this business continue to lead our franchise in digital adoption, utilizing digital tools to access their investments and also for other banking needs like mobile check deposits and lending. The evolution is forming a modern Merrill, which is advisor-led and powered by digital. Moving to Global Banking on slide 19. The business momentum through the back half of the year was strong. Net interest income grew on the back of accelerating loans growth. Investment banking fees reached record levels and deposits continue to grow as clients navigated the pandemic. We also saw strong demand from our clients around ESG investments driving improvements in bottom line results. Net income for the full year was a record $9.8 billion or 31% of the company's overall net income. The business earned $2.7 billion in Q4, improving nearly $1 billion year-over-year, driven by higher revenue and lower provision costs, partially offset by higher expenses. Revenue improvement of 24% year-over-year reflected more than 30% growth in investment banking fees in this segment, and net interest income increased 18%. This investment banking performance allowed us to gain market share and record number 3 ranking in overall fees in what was a very strong Q4 market. We ranked number 1 in investment grade and number 2 in leverage finance with market share improvement compared to the year-ago period. And we also saw another record M&A period. And most importantly, our investment banking pipeline remains quite healthy. Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $435 million, compared to a $266 million release in the year-ago period. And what I draw your attention to here is the reduction in net charge-offs year-over-year from $314 million in Q4 of '20 to small recoveries in Q4 '21. That year-ago period included some losses from clients in those industries that were heavily impacted by COVID. Finally, given the strength of revenue we saw expenses increase by 12%, which is still only half of our increase in revenue. Switching to Global Markets on slide 20. Full year net income of $4.6 billion reflects another solid year of sales and trading revenue. This included a record year for equities, up 19% versus 2020. Investments made in this part of the business are seeing good results as our financing clients are doing more business with our company. As we usually do, I'll talk about the segment results, excluding DVA, even though net DVA was negligible in both Q4 '21 and Q4 '20. In Q4, Global Markets produced $667 million in earnings, $167 million lower than the year-ago quarter. Focusing on year-over-year, revenue was modestly down, driven by sales and trading. Sales and trading contributed $2.9 billion to revenue, a decline of 4% year-over-year. FICC, down 10%, while equities improved 3%. FICC results reflect a weaker credit trading environment in Q4 '20, and the strength in equities was driven by growth in client financing activities and the multiplier effect. Year-over-year expense move was driven by investments in revenue-related sales and trading costs, partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the realignment of liquidating business activity to the all other units in Q4. Finally, on slide 21, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $673 million, which declined a little more than $250 million from the year-ago period. Revenue declined as a result of higher volume of deals, particularly solar, and partnership losses on ESG investments. That's offset by the tax impact in this reporting unit. Expense increased as a result of costs now recorded here after the fourth quarter realignment out of Global Markets, which was partially offset by a decrease in various other expenses in the segment. That realignment obviously had no bottom line impact on our company, overall. As a reminder, for the financial statement presentation in this release, the business segments are all taxed on the standard fully taxable equivalent basis. And in All Other, we incorporate the impact of our ESG tax credits and any other unusual items. For the full year, the effective tax rate was 6%. And excluding the second quarter '21 positive tax adjustment triggered by the UK tax law change and other discrete items, the tax rate would have been 14%. Further adjusting for ESG tax credits, our tax rate would have been 25%. And looking forward, we would expect our effective tax rate in 2022 to be between 10% and 12%, absent any tax law changes or unusual items. And with that, I think I'll stop, and we'll open it up for Q&A.",2812.0,1560.0,49.0,19.0,10.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,8.0,0.03141025641025641,0.01217948717948718,0.00641025641025641,0.0019230769230769232,0.002564102564102564,0.019230769230769232

I'll try to ask this as easy as possible, but in the wave of a couple of other companies in the space talking a lot about comp inflation and stepped-up investments, I think a lot of shareholders love to see and hear your comments about, all else equal, flattish expenses in '22. And so, the simple enough question is what -- how do people take comfort to know that you're making all the right investments to continue to compete and take share and migrate digitally, like you have been doing but we're seeing so much competition across all your business lines.

You just said we're taking market share. So, I'd say, we've sustained our technology investments all the way through the pandemic. We've sustained our financial center renovations. We've sustained our marketing. We've sustained our investment in relationship managers. And the result of that is, in many cases, record client experience. And you can see, I think, in our numbers that we're doing more business with our existing clients. We're adding net new clients and we're growing market share, and we're getting the third-party recognition as well. So, I think it’s results is how you will judge us on the technology, but we're obviously very competitive in that regard.",133.0,63.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

One, obviously, it's axiomatic that revenue from markets-related business, whether it's in wealth manager or investment banking teammates or it's in the markets business. So Jimmy DeMare and Matthew Koder and Andy and Katy have done great jobs and that's just -- that's a given, they're going to go up. And you see that. Those numbers are up dramatically over the last couple of years as markets have raised, but you invest a lot of ways. So, we'll never have the temerity to say that we know every possible competitive thing could happen over the next decade in this company. But if you look across history, which is what Alastair's referring to, we've invested new technology development, $3 billion to $3.5 billion year after year after year, and we tend to invest in things that work and then drive them and scale them. And so, you see that if you look at pages 24, 25, 26, 27 and just start to think about what we said earlier, Zelle is more transaction count than checks written. Think about that change. Think about the change in the branches that basically in our expense guidance, we'll open 100 new branches this year on top of the 200 and some of what we've opened in the last three years. But importantly, we shifted from other places in that we brought branch count overall down as we've been doing that. That means we're opening up new markets, gaining market share, as Alastair said, and using the expense base and others. So, whether -- and then in our broad-based teammates, we basically have gone to $21 an hour. Our attrition rates are similar to where they were in '19, which was a 10-year low. So, think about -- we've invested heavily, we've invested broad-based, but you're seeing the activities going. And if you start to think about the retail deposits per branch or multiples of other people, so you think about the -- we have 4,100 branches, we have $1 trillion in consumer deposits and $400 billion of wealth management. So, that operating leverage is what we do. So we're an operating leverage company. We're not a cost takeout company anymore, we haven't been. But we see the path forward of flat expenses next year. And frankly, there was a lot of onetime stuff that went through the last couple of years that is coming to an end. And that we'll reposition that to help pay for the types of things, revenue-related growth and investments that we think are important. But just look at those stats and see what we've done, and I think that that's where we get the confidence.",464.0,203.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0049261083743842365,0.0049261083743842365,0.009852216748768473,0.0,0.0,0.0

You can see on slide 5, just the consistency, that's daily. You can see the consistency of the growth, it's broad-based across all the businesses, as Brian noted. And obviously, it's accelerated recently. The thing I find interesting about slide 5 is you've really got to adjust for the size of the economy today relative to where our loans were in 2019 pre pandemic. So, we know there's some potential for catch-up there. And we can see that in our data too, John, our revolver utilization rates are still lower than historic levels. So, we feel like there's some potential there. And in things like card, payment rates are still elevated. So, there's a variety of things there that make us feel good about loans growth, certainly more bullish than we might have been in a pre-pandemic GDP-type 2% to 3% kind of an environment. So, we're pretty optimistic on loans. I think, you need to think about that in the sort of high single digits. And then, when it comes to -- you can see when we put forth our asset sensitivity numbers, that $6.5 billion for a parallel shock is meant to give you an idea of how we believe we're levered to rates.

We're $6.5 billion of rate sensitivity to 100 basis-point increase, as we said. So, we'll let you figure out when those rate changes come through. But backing up to your broader point, Mike, at the end of the day, in the consumer business, what drives our capabilities there is the preferred group of customers that are 80% plus the balances and retention rate through preferred rewards and the millions of people we have in it is 99% plus. And those customers have tremendous relationship with us. And we invest across whether it's the -- but for rewards, as you know, go across the whole business and not just by products. So, those customers get rewards in credit cards, they pay for by giving us deposits.

And even as we enter new markets where we didn't have banking capabilities, Columbus, Ohio, for example, there was robust Merrill capabilities we're building underneath. So, that relationship. And as you move to the commercial side, it's the same thing. So, our deposits in commercial are strong. They are all operating deposits, the lion's share of them. They're part of what we core do, but they build off the back, so that great relationship management practice and the GTS capabilities, of which we invested billions of dollars in across the last things. And what sails that altogether is not that these are resilient group of enterprises that I'll go off and operate is the common things that they have together, which are things like the digital capabilities, which we give you the capabilities that that backbone goes across all our customer sets, and that enables us to drive it and also how they work together in the markets. We will set a record -- in '21, we ended up getting back to where we were referrals from one business to the other in every market. And those are important ways that we cement the relationship. Our Commercial Banking Investments group, as we call it, has millions of customers through our corporate relationships that have priority access. So, it is about how you build the franchise and concentrating on eight lines of business and how they work together.

So we're training -- we had two training programs running and et cetera. We combine all that. And so that now has sort of stabilized. And so, you'd expect us to see slow growth out.

So, people can pay us cash fees or they can pay us with balances at which we get the earnings rate and we get them a credit, as you all know.

It's obviously -- we've come off a period where we didn't see that loans growth. So with the excess liquidity, we were in a position where we were looking primarily in first securities. Now we're moving more towards loans. So, if you looked at our last -- this last quarter, we added $51 billion loans. We added $14 billion in securities. Now, we're obviously going to be careful with respect to the OCI impact. And when you look at our balance sheet, you'll see most of the securities available for sale, our treasury swap to floating. So, that's going to have obviously a pretty substantial offsetting effect to anything that happens with higher rates. And then, I'm not sure we're going to necessarily change our duration profile around the securities portfolio. Remember, we have a lot of that rolling off every quarter, and then we tend to just book more back in the stack over time. So, with any luck, we'll continue to see the loans growth.

And then, Brian, I know we talked a lot about reinvestment in the franchise and the platform, I wanted to ask that question for a slightly different angle. We get -- obviously, we're all very well aware of fintech competition and what's going on technologically speaking, that enables not only competitors in the banking space, but nonbanking space to be more active in finance. When you think about your current platform, is it at the end state that you want, or is there more to do with regard to leveraging cloud and AI to enhance the efficiency of the organization overall, or maybe that's not even a potential outcome of shifting the technology? Maybe there's something else I'm not thinking about?",134.0,57.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.017543859649122806,0.03508771929824561,0.0,0.0,0.03508771929824561

The cloud -- our internal cloud is what we do with external has largely do with cost flexibility, security, who -- what program -- what apps, applications that we're running and how do we do that. But security and the ability to integrate it and ability to be never down and things like that are high on our minds. So I put that aside, the ability to continue to improve our platform is infinite. And you see it. I mean, you could have asked me this question two quarters ago, and you would have had -- if you look at the pages in 24 to 27, look at the statistics from two quarters ago. And what drives these changes is things like Erica going from 17 million users to 24 million users and 30 million interactions to 120 million fourth quarter last year to fourth quarter this year is because of the feature functionality and capabilities of it go up. Our life plans, 7 million people I think are using them. They have 20%, 25% more balances because of what they're doing. So, we'll never be at end state. I mean -- and that's where we continue to drive investment. Digital sales capabilities. We're only starting to be able to take full advantage of it, frankly, across the platform because you had to get end to end, you had to get it all knocked together and then -- and it's kind of interesting because it's growing quickly now. So, small business capabilities, the whole merchant services, we finally got a new platform out of a cost of $300 million. It's now being sold. Those are major investments. So, the question is do we appeal? We open twice the population rate for young -- for people between the ages of 18 and 24 in terms of new accounts. We seem to be gaining share in that segment and the usage by segment is high. And so, we feel very good that our platforms appeal to -- obviously appeal to every cohort of age and experience, and that's what driving that. And then, look at Merrill Edge, 500,000 new accounts, $70,000 average balance. Those are deep clients with real money put into work. And so, are we satisfied? Yes, we can look at and look at all the awards and the growth and feel good -- and feel spectacularly good about it. But you can be satisfied that way, but that would be dangerous. So, we continue to invest, and you can see the numbers of patents we get, we see everything, we will continue to invest heavily in this platform.

And so, some of them don't go well, some of the renewable things don't work the way people want them to. So, it's a good -- and you got Bruce Thompson, the team in credit and Geoff Green and his team in risk, I think our track record of underwriting credit is strong. And so there's a business plan and our investments are to help our clients make the transition. We already invest $80 billion to $100 billion, and this is a step-up from that as we move forward into 2021, it's a step-up. So, it's not some, we've got to go out and do things we haven't been doing. We have to just do more of what we've been doing. Each individual deal is underwritten. So, what's the risk? The risk on the renewable side doesn't work and the risk on the other side is the value of assets comes down because the cash flows start to get impaired by regulation, customer change and things like that. And so, as we go forward, an additional consideration of the business plan of a heavily emitting industry will be -- will its business model sustain in change in customer behavior and use of things. In the near term, demand for all energy is going up. And the challenge for society is how we meet the needs to have a just transition occur for everyone while changing the emission structure. But over time, business plans of both the emitter side and the renewable side will come cleaner based on customer behavior. People like ourselves, reducing our demand for energy, it impacts our power companies and how they supply and our demands of our power companies do more renewables, that's going to reverberate to our 30,000 middle market clients and our millions of small businesses piece by piece by piece. So, I don't know if that's entirely where you're going, Gerard, but it's going to come down to good core underwriting, given the circumstances of the individual company, its business and its plans and what its transition plans are and the disclosures they make to us the underwriting process. But we've done a great job in commercial underwriting. You'd have to agree with that over the decade.

We first -- this is a prioritization. We first looked at the largest markets that we weren't and said why aren't we there, because we're a nationwide brand and capabilities. And by the way, in a lot of those markets, we had Wealth Management clients. So we started in '14, it's been a long effort. So we did Denver starting in '14 and Minneapolis, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake, Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and now Lexington. So there's a list of other markets that we continue to go down, largely starting -- originally the key was to close the top 30 markets, which we weren't in 7, if I remember, Gerard, at the time, and we're now in all those. So there's really -- think of the next several years as being -- going down to the top 50 markets, which starts to cover a substantial part of the population where you aren't. But also even within those markets, take Grand Rapids, Michigan, we're not to the level we want to be there. And by the way, in a place like Columbus, we're now number 5 in the market. We grew at 9%. We only have 12 financial centers and state will be another 8, 10 type of number. And so, we're still building out in these markets, and it's working. I mean, it works because of the way we do it. So, that will all be a move. But expect us to keep working down by population markets, but think about 2 dimensions. One is more markets. And the second is also making sure every market -- what we do is we look at the -- we look at like markets and compare them, same size, capabilities. And we expect every market will get to the seventy-fifth  percentile of Bank of America business comparative. So why is that? So that means like even in Los Angeles, we're a 4% or 5% Wealth Management share, if I remember right, versus D.C., where we have equal representation in consumer, D.C. were 15%, 20% market share in Wealth Management. That means we should be 15% in L.A. That's a heck of a lot of work that Andy and Katy and team have to do. So we look at this that way in terms of trying to drive our market share by market. Sometimes it's people, sometimes it's branches, sometimes it's advertising, sometimes it's charitable work, sometimes community work, all the above.

Before I turn the call over to Brian, just let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and the assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and our SEC filings that are available on the website. Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to US GAAP, can also be found in the earnings materials that are available on the website. So with that, take it away, Brian.",209.0,101.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.009900990099009901,0.0,0.0594059405940594,0.0,0.0,0.009900990099009901
BAC,2022-04-18,2022-04-18,,2022-04-18,2022-04-18T08:30:00-04:00,0,2022-04-18,prepared,,Brian Moynihan,"Thank you, Lee, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us. As we open our earnings call this quarter, we want to acknowledge that there's -- the humanitarian crisis continue to take place in Ukraine and remain watchful and have provided assistance from our company to the Ukranian citizens and staying ready to help further where we can. Before we get into some discussion on the current outlook and activity, I want to step back and focus on the big picture about Bank of America this quarter. In a quarter that had a lot of variables show up, we delivered responsible growth again. We reported $7.1 billion in net income or $0.80 per diluted share. We grew revenue, we reduced costs, and we delivered our third straight quarter of operating leverage coming out of pandemic. Net interest income grew 13% and is expected to grow significantly from here. We saw a strong loan growth. We grew deposits. We saw a strong investment flows. We made trading profits every day during the quarter. We grew pretax pre-provision income by 8%. We had a return on tangible common equity of 15.5%. All this came in that quarter that saw geopolitical conflict, rising interest rates, a pandemic, rising inflation concerns and much, much more. I want to thank our team for delivering on responsible growth once again. So if you look at the statistics on slide two, you can see some of those highlights. You can see the organic growth engine that our company is delivering once again. In our banking business, you can see the strong loan and deposit growth. We grew and expanded customer relationships across every business. In fact, we grew net new checking accounts by more than 220,000 this quarter alone. We opened new financial centers, and we renovated many others. We added more digital capabilities and crossed 50% in digital sales. In our Wealth Management businesses, you can see over $160 billion of client flows over the year and more than $4 trillion in client balances, including Merrill Edge. We saw both strong investment flow performance in addition to banking flows. Over the past year, we brought on a significant number of net new households, 24,000 in Merrill; and then the 2,000 in the private bank. Across the combination of our Consumer and Wealth businesses, we saw more than $90 billion of investment flows. We now have managed client balances, including deposits loan investments of more than $5 trillion with us. In Global Markets, Jim DeMare and his team had a solid quarter of sales and trading results, which included a record quarter for equities. Despite the market turmoil, we had zero days of trading losses. And while the investment banking fee line was down from the record quarters of the past year, Matthew Koder and his team produced solid results with a strong forward pipeline, and we gained market share in several areas, including moving to number two in the mid-cap investment banking. From a broader enterprise perspective, part of managing costs while it comes from the drive we have in the company to provide enhanced digital capabilities to our customers, which in turn drives adoption for the digital engagement and lower costs. If you look at Slide 23 and beyond, you can see we are now selling more digitally than we are in person. It takes both to be successful. What makes them even more impressive is all the financial centers are now open and back to operating at their usual great capacity. So adding the digital capacity clearly increases our total production capabilities. You can also see our digital sales are now twice the pre-pandemic level just three years ago. Even more impressive, look at Zelle and Erica volumes, up more than four times in pre-pandemic levels. We're now processing more outgoing Zelle transactions than checks. In our cash pro mobile app with our commercial clients, we see many $5 billion usage days. There are a lot more stats on the slide showing strong digital growth. I commend to you to see how a high touch, hi-tech innovative company drives organic growth. This quarter, our resilience was tested. And once again, we maintained a focus on what we control and grew responsibly, earned our way through the turmoil. So as we talked to you during the quarter, many of you expressed questions about the impact of the macro environment and changes in our company. So the lingering impact of the pandemic on supply chains and business opportunity, inflation and Fed reduction of monetary combination, the impacts of Russian-Ukraine war, both on the first order effect and second order effects. We do remain mindful of all these. So could a slowdown in the economy happen? Perhaps. But right now, the size of the economy is bigger than pre-pandemic levels. Consumer spending remains strong, unemployment is low and wages are rising. Company earnings are also generally strong. Credit is widely available. And our customers' usage of their lines of credit is still low, i.e., they have capacity to borrow more. We are all focused on the ability of Fed to use their tools to reduce inflation. We know that will take interest rates with rate hikes and a reduction in the balance sheet. We predict it will slow the economy from 3% growth in 2022 to a little below 2% in 2024 – 2023, excuse me. That is back to trend. So the interest rate hikes comes better NII. Could the Fed had to push harder to sell inflation? Perhaps. That is why we run stress test each quarters to look at scenarios to see what would happen in a highly inflationary environment. If rates been put fast though by the implication of capital? For sure, as you saw some in this quarter. But in the context of the capital build, those impacts are manageable. The impact increases earnings also. And then over time, the bonds pull back to par. All that results in a rebuild of the capital quite quickly. But for some short period of time, that capital usage, along with customer usage, might slow share repurchase a little bit, but it will be temporary. What if we're wrong and things do get tougher? We already know what that looks like in 2020, as we built significant reserves, we also built 90 basis points of capital during the economic shutdown period. Rates moved against us and earnings fell. So we have already proven resilient. We continue to focus on responsive growth and things we control. If you go to slide three, I want to mention to show some of the strengths we see in our US consumer base. Bank of America consumers spent at the highest-ever quarter one level, which is a double-digit percentage increase over the 2021 level that you can see in the upper left. From our card spend to date, we have seen a strong recovery in travel, entertain, restaurant spending. In the upper right, you can see that. By the way, even with the fuel costs up 40% and more from last year, fuel represents about 6% of overall debit and credit card spending and a lot less of overall spending as car as you can see in the lower left is 21% of all spending. Importantly, despite March of last year, including stimulus bonus, we saw the spending in the month of March 2022 on a comparable basis to 2021, 13% higher by dollar volume and we saw a 7.4% increase in the number of transactions. So, both dollar volumes and numbers of transactions rose nicely. And as you expect, the message by which people spend continues to shift away from cash and checks to replace with digital alternatives. And you can see that follow. Our data showed continued growth in the average deposit balance across all customer levels, which suggests capacity for strong spending continue. On an aggregated basis, average deposit balances were up 47% from pre-pandemic levels and 15% higher than 2021. And the momentum continued through quarter one, particularly in the low balance accounts, which grew in February to March, continuing a streak since mid-last year. Now a couple of examples so you can see how this works. We looked at the pre-pandemic customers who had $1,000 to $2,000 of clear balances BAC. Today, we have a -- at that time, pre-pandemic had an average balance of 1.4 -- or $1,400. You take that same cohort of customers with -- the same customers in 2022 versus 2019, and they have an average clear balance of now of $7,400. So, they increased from $1,400 to $7,400. If you go to the next cohort up, those with $2,000 to $5,000 of cleared balances in the pre-pandemic, their average was $3,250. Now those same customers today have an average cleared balance of $12,500. What does that tell us? The consumers are sitting on lots of cash. Why this is true while you know, high wage growth, high savings by limited enabled spending. But what it means is a long tail to consumer spend growth. And in April through the first two spending is growing and as fast at 18% over April 2021. Another economic sign posted a continuation of loan growth. A year ago, we highlighted the green shoots of our loan growth. We then delivered a growth in quarter two and quarter three and quarter four despite PPP runoff and the change in economic conditions. To convey where we are today, we focus on ending loans to give you a progression through the quarter. If you go to slide four, you can see the highlights of that growth in the upper left of the slide. I would remind you that in quarter four, we highlighted to you that of the $55 billion of growth in that single quarter, $16 billion was Global Markets. So, we did not expect that to hold true for quarter one of 2022. So as we thought, Global Markets did come down $5 billion this quarter. Despite that, overall commercial loans grew $13 billion from quarter four, excluding PPP. That means commercial loans, excluding Global Markets, grew $17 billion. Every single customer group, global banking, large corporate, middle market, business banking crew as well as commercial loans and Wealth Management. That improvement came from both new loans as well as improving utilization rates from existing clients. You can see in the top chart, loans have moved back above our pre-pandemic levels on the right-hand side of the slide, and you can see it being led by commercial. Consumer loans continue to grow late quarter as well. This is despite typical seasonality and despite the continued suppressed credit card balance, as you can see on the lower left. Mortgage loans grew $4 billion, originations remained at high levels, and paydowns declined. Card loans declined $2 billion from quarter four, driven by the transfer of $1.6 billion affinity card loan portfolio to the held for sale category, absent that transfer, card loans would have declined very modestly, whereas, the previous quarter -- one quarter, they declined several billion. On slide 5, we provide data around consumer clients' leverage and asset quality as compared to pre-pandemic periods, which further supports our belief that consumers remain in good shape. On the upper left, we looked at our customers that have both a credit card and a deposit account with us. As you will note, the average card balance of our credit card customers that had deposit relationships are still 8% lower than they were pre-pandemic. They continue to pay down their balances on a monthly basis at a higher rate than pre-pandemic. And as you know, delinquency rates are significantly lower. Further, as you can see in my earlier point, these borrowing customers have built significant additional savings, and their average deposit balances were up 39%. So a lot of strength or dry powder is its goal. So what if we went to the modest FICO as more modest amount of low FICO customers you have at BAC. Looking at that small subset of our base, you can see a similar trend, even stronger on cash balances and lower debt levels. And you see in the bottom charts, we believe this is not just a phenomena at BAC as industry data points around debt service levels are hovering near historic lows and household deposit and cash levels are $3 trillion higher than we entered the crisis. Now a word on Russia. This is not an area of material direct exposure for Bank of America. More than a decade ago, we've reduced our exposure in Russia, and it's result in having 90% less before the most recent crisis. Our current very limited activities in Russia are focused on compliance with all sanctions and other legal and regulatory requirements. Our lending and counterparty exposure to companies based in Russia totals approximately $700 million and is limited to nine Russian-based borrowers. It's largely comprised of top-tier commodity exporters with a history of strong cash flows who continue to make payments. Prior to the Ukrainian invasion, these exposure were mostly investment grade, we report all of them on our reservable criticized. Our quarter one allowance includes increased reserves from this direct exposure. And I just note that even with the addition of these loans to reservable criticized, we still declined $1.7 billion in this category during the first quarter. We continue our daily monitoring with sanctions and interest payments might impact these loans. We also evaluate our portfolios and continue to do so considering second order impact to this crisis. Currently, we believe this to be modest and reflect our international strategy to focus on large multinational clients that have geographically diverse operations. Our quarter one allowance for credit losses reflects all of these things as well. On Russian counterparty risk, our teams have done a tremendous job from ending down our exposures. And at the end of the quarter, we have de minimis, meaning less than $20 million counterbalance exposures with a single Russian based counterparty. And very limited impacts from quarter -- and any of those impacts are in our trading results for this quarter. So responsible growth has served us well here. And as you might note, after the 2014 Crimea conflict, we intentionally reduced our exposure. And Russia has not been our top 20 country risk exposure table since 2015. So a few comments on NII. On NII, remember the rate increases came late in the quarter and had little first quarter 2022 NII impact. And there were two fewer days of interest in the quarter and decreased PPP fees hurt NII growth, yet we still grew NII by $200 million in-line with our guidance we gave you last quarter. Given the forward curve expectation for higher interest rates and our expectations of further loan growth, we expect significant NII improvement through the next several quarters. Alistair will expand on this point for you.  We have more than $2 trillion of deposits and $1.4 trillion of those are with our consumer wealth management clients with more than 40% of those and low to no interest checking. That is a franchise that isn't rivaled. We will benefit as the rates move off to 04s allowing us to earn more money on those check and deposits.  Deposits, I know some -- several of you are wondering if deposits can continue to grow as rates begin to rise. So, we went back and looked at the last rising cycle in the last decade. We pinpointed the peak rate paid to customers during the quarter reflected of this peak Fed tightening. We then went back and looked at the 12 months preceding growth rate in deposits. And in fact, during that 12 months preceding that peak, deposits grew 5%, driven by organic growth engine, our market share gains and overall economic growth.  If we go to Page – Slide 6, you can see that comment -- where we talked about capital. Just to start off, our capital remained strong with 10.4% CET1 ratio well above our 9.5% minimum requirement. As you can see $7 billion of earnings, net of preferred dividends, generated 41 basis points of capital. If you look on the right-hand side of the page, you can see that 14 basis points of that capital was used to support our customers' growth, that's a good thing. We also returned $4 billion to shareholders in common dividends and share repurchase, will represent about 27 basis points of use.  Despite the treasury and mortgage-backed securities rates caused the fair value of our AFS debt securities to decrease and lowered our CET1 by 21 basis points. That's the part that goes through the calculation of the capital. While one wouldn't expect this impact every quarter, we're well positioned -- we were well positioned for the spike. As you recall, we invested much of our securities books and held to maturity due to our huge excess and stable deposit base. We have $2 trillion of deposits and less than $1 trillion in loans.  In addition to be cautious, we hedge a large portion of securities in the AFS portfolio, protecting it from a much larger hit to AOCI. I remind you, as the securities mature, the AOCI reverses and higher rates result in higher NII over a relatively short period of time. That should result in higher earnings that will benefit CET1 ratios on an ongoing basis and more than offset the negative upfront AOCI impact.  Last thing I would note is our balance sheet growth to support our customer means our GSIB buffer will probably move higher by 50 basis points beginning in 2024, i.e., to 10% regulatory minimums. Well, this is nearly two years away, we continue to move towards it. Given this new higher minimum over the next couple of years, we'll look to gradually move to target CET1 range of 10.75% towards 11%. Importantly, while we grow into this range, we'll be able to support our clients, we'll be able to continue to increase our dividend, and we'll be able to continue to buyback stock.  With that, let me turn it over to Alastair.",2976.0,1546.0,44.0,33.0,27.0,4.0,2.0,11.0,9.0,9.0,0.028460543337645538,0.021345407503234153,0.017464424320827943,0.00258732212160414,0.00129366106080207,0.0071151358344113845
BAC,2022-04-18,2022-04-18,,2022-04-18,2022-04-18T08:30:00-04:00,0,2022-04-18,qa,qna_heading,Alastair Borthwick,"Thank you, Brian, and I'll start with the summary income statement on Slide 7, where you can see our comparisons illustrating 3% year-over-year operating leverage produced by growing revenue and managing our costs well. That was nearly enough to overcome the change in provision expense, driven by the $2.7 billion reserve release in the year-ago period compared to a $400 million released this quarter. On asset quality, more broadly, we continue to see very strong metrics. Net charge-offs remained low, and in fact, they're down more than 50% in just the past year. Consumer early and late-stage delinquencies are still below 2019 levels, and reservable criticized moved lower again in Q1. Looking ahead, we continue to feel good about the asset quality results of our consumer and commercial businesses near term, given our customers' high liquidity, low unemployment and rising wages. We produced good returns again this quarter with an ROTCE of nearly 16%, and we delivered $4.4 billion of capital back to shareholders, driving average shares lower by 6% year-over-year. Looking forward and with continued expectations of growing NII, combined with strong expense control, we expect to drive operating leverage and see our efficiency ratio work back towards 60%. So let's turn to slide eight and the balance sheet. And you can see during the quarter, our balance sheet grew $69 billion to a little more than $3.2 trillion. This reflected $14 billion of growth in loans and the growth of our Global Markets balance sheet, as customers increased their activity with us. Our decline in cash this quarter was associated bad growth in Global Markets. Our liquidity portfolio was stable compared to year-end. And at $1.1 trillion, it represents roughly a-third of the balance sheet. Shareholders' equity declined $3.4 billion from Q4 with a few different component side of note. Shareholders' equity benefited from net income after preferred dividends of $6.6 billion, as well as issuance of $2.4 billion in preferred stock. So that's $9 billion that flowed into equity in Q1. And we paid out $4.4 billion in common dividends and share repurchases. AOCI declined as a result of the spike in loan rates that Brian referenced, and we saw the impact in two waves. First, we had a reduction from a change in the value of our AFS debt securities, that was $3.4 billion. That's the piece that impacts CET1, as Brian noted. And second, rates also drove a $5.2 billion decline in AOCI from derivatives, but does not impact CET1. That reflects cash flow hedges against our variable rate ones, which provides some NII growth and protected CET1 at the same time. With regard to regulatory capital, since Brian already talked about CET1, I'd simply note that our supplemental leverage ratio was stable at 5.4% versus the minimum requirement of 5%, and still leaves us plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. And our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Turning to slide nine, we included the schedule on average loan balances. And in the interest of time, the only thing I would add to Brian's earlier comments, and for your perspective, is simply a reminder that PPP loans are down $19 billion year-over-year. There's just a few billion of those left. And excluding PPP, our total loans grew $89 billion or 10% compared to last year. Moving to deposits on Slide 10. First, let's look at year-over-year growth. And across the past 12 months, we saw solid growth across the client base as we deepened relationships and added net new accounts. Our year-over-year average deposits are up $240 billion or 13%. Retail deposits with our Consumer and Wealth Management businesses grew $190 million, and our retail deposits have now grown to more than $1.4 trillion, where we lead all competitors. Looking at linked-quarter growth from Q4 and combining Consumer and Wealth Management customer balances, our retail deposits grew $53 billion in just the past 90 days. With our commercial clients, they're up nicely year-over-year, and we simply note the Q1 decline, which is entirely consistent with previous year's seasonal trends. Turning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q1 was $11.6 billion. And the FTE NII number was $11.7 billion. So I'll focus on FTE, where net interest income has now increased $1.4 billion from the first quarter last year. As Brian noted, that's 13% increase driven by deposits growth and our related investment of liquidity. NII was up $200 million versus the fourth quarter as the benefits of lower premium amortization and loans growth more than offset the headwinds of two less days of interest accruals and lower PPP fees. So let's pause for a moment to discuss asset sensitivity because I want to make a couple of points as we begin what the Fed has said well to be a significant rate hike period. Remember, asset sensitivity is our measure of NII for the next 12 months above an expected baseline of NII, given changes in interest rates and other assumptions. In an environment of sharply rising rates each quarter, the baseline of NII -- actual NII increases and, therefore, the future sensitivity declines. Now we typically disclose our asset sensitivity based on a 100 basis point instantaneous parallel shock in rates above the forward curve. And on that basis, asset sensitivity at March 31 was $5.4 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months, and 90% of that sensitivity is driven by short rates. That $5.4 billion is down from $6.5 billion at year-end, largely because higher rates are now factored into and running through our actual or baseline NII. Well, you asked the question last quarter about the same sensitivity on a spot basis relative to our current curve. And given that the yield curve is projecting 125 basis points of rate hikes over the next three meetings, we thought it was appropriate to provide that disclosure. So in a 100 basis point shock to the current curve using spot rates, our sensitivity to that kind of move would be $6.8 billion or $1.4 billion higher than on a forward basis. So assuming rising rates as reflected in today's forward curve and if we see continued loans growth, I would just reiterate what we said last quarter that we expect to see robust NII growth in 2022 compared to 2021. We're not going to provide numerical guidance for the full year because the changes in interest rates have proven quite volatile in just the last 90 days, let alone a year. We do provide that asset sensitivity so that you can use it as guardrails to think about changes as you modify your own assumptions. I do, however, want to provide a near-term expectation and say that if loans grow and rates in the forward curve materialize, we would expect to see NII in Q2 increase by more than $650 million over the Q1 level and then grow again significantly on a sequential basis in each of the following two quarters. Okay. Let's turn to expenses, and we'll use slide 12 for that discussion. Our Q1 expenses were $15.3 billion, down a couple hundred million from the year-ago period. I'll focus my remarks on the more recent comparison versus Q4 where we're up $600 million. And as expected, and we conveyed to you last quarter, the Q1 increase was driven mostly by seasonality of payroll tax expense or roughly $400 million. We also experienced modestly higher wage and benefit costs. As we look forward, we continue to invest heavily in technology, people, and marketing across our lines of business, and we've continued to add new financial centers in expansion and growth markets. We modestly increased our full year new tech initiative budget for the year to $3.6 billion. And that's on top of -- that's on top of more than $35 billion that we put to work over the past 12 years to help us build powerful, more secure, and scalable technology platforms. This is the investment that allowed us to maintain a leadership position in patents among our peers. We had 512 of them granted in 2021 and we're maintaining in a similar pace this year. We think this is one of the things that's happened to protect our moat around leadership positions in places that matter most to customers. In addition to modestly higher marketing costs this year, our investments also include adding up to 100 new financial centers. And we also plan to renovate more than 800 more during the year. We will also continue our upward march on minimum hourly wage toward $25 by 2025. So, how do we pay for all that? Through continued work on operational excellence and digital engagement. And as we look to Q2, we expect our expenses to be down modestly from Q1, as much of the seasonal payroll tax expense abates and is somewhat offset by investment timing, inflation, and the cost of opening up more fully for travel and clone entertainment. Because it feels like we've got a lot of pent-up demand for face-to-face meetings by our clients and our people. So, let's turn to asset quality on slide 13. And as you can see, asset quality of our customers remains very healthy. Net charge-offs this quarter were better than our expectations once again and remained below $400 million, down 52% compared to Q1 2021. Provision expense was $30 million in Q1 as reserve release of $362 million closely matched net charge-offs in the quarter. And that reserve release was primarily in our consumer portfolios. On slide 14, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios, and I am happy to answer any questions later, but a couple of things are worth repeating. Consumer delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels. And despite reporting our commercial Russian lending exposure in reservable criticized, those levels still declined $1.7 billion from Q4. NPI saw modest increase and that simply reflects a small amount of consumer real estate deferrals expiring with the expiration of the CARES Act. Turning to the business segments. One thing we'd ask you just to keep in mind for each of the businesses is Q1 expense includes the seasonal payroll tax expense, which has negatively impacted efficiency ratios or profit margins in Q1. Also, and as usual, Q1 of every year includes segment capital level evaluation. And you'll note, we put additional capital against each of the businesses due to their growth. And as usual, we've tried to include business trends and digital stats for each segment. So let's start with Consumer Banking on slide 15, where you can see the Consumer Bank earned nearly $3 billion. That's 11% up over Q1 2021 as revenue growth more than offset the larger prior period reserve release. It's probably most easily identified by looking at pre-tax pre-provision earnings, which grew 32% year-over-year. Revenue grew 9% on NII improvement, and expense declined 4%, creating 13% operating leverage and the fourth consecutive quarter of operating leverage for our Consumer team. Notable customer activity highlights included our 228,000 net new checking accounts opened in Q1, which represents our 13th consecutive quarter of net new consumer checking account growth. Now this occurred as we began to implement our previously announced insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes, which lowered our service charges about $80 million. So during this time, we saw accounts grow and we saw expenses decline. We also grew investment accounts 7%, and we saw those balances grow 10% from Q1 '21 to $350 billion, and that included $20 billion of client flows. And once again, we opened nearly one million credit cards in the quarter and grew average active card accounts and saw growth in combined credit and debit spend of 15%. Our continued investment in digital capabilities drove activity with our customers as we crossed 50% in digital sales this quarter and we continued investment in our financial centers, opening another eight in the quarter. It's also worth noting that small business saw continued growth in loans, in deposits and in spending. Small business card spend was up 28% year-over-year. It gives you an idea of how small businesses are reopening for business. I'd also draw your attention to slide 22 in the appendix. We've shared this with you previously, and it simply highlights the origination strength and quality of our consumer underwriting. Throughout everything, our underwriting standards have remained consistent. Moving to slide 16. Wealth Management produced strong results earning $1.1 billion, and that represented 28% year-over-year growth, driven by strong revenue improvement, good expense management and low credit costs. Bank of America continues to deliver Wealth Management at scale across a full range of our client segments and with the best advisers in the industry according to Barron's rankings. That, coupled with our digital leadership, is delivering a modern Merrill and a modern Private Bank for clients through enterprise relationships and our clients and advisors have recognized the value in a holistic financial relationship that extends across investments, planning and banking. And that's what helped drive the $150 billion of clients' balance flows that you see here over the past 12 months.  Not only did we see strong investment flows of more than $70 billion, but deposits grew $59 billion, up 18%, and we added $22 billion in loans over the same period, marking our 48th consecutive quarter of average loans growth in the business, just consistent and sustained performance from the team.  Revenues grew 10% to a new record and were led by 25% growth in NII on the back of those solid deposit and loans increases, as well as a 9% improvement in asset management fees. Expenses increased 4%, driven by higher revenue-related costs and resulted in over 600 basis points of operating leverage. And we generated nearly 7,000 in net new households in Merrill and more than 800 in the private bank this quarter. Moving to Global Banking on Slide 17. The business momentum with our Commercial clients remained strong in the first quarter. The business earned $1.7 billion in Q1, down $450 million year-over-year, driven by the absence of a large prior period reserve release and lower investment banking revenue. Revenue improvement of 12% year-over-year reflected higher leasing-related revenue and NII growth, partially offset by those lower investment banking fees. Net interest income grew on the back of strong loans and deposits growth. And the leasing revenue improvement included more ESG-related investments, particularly in solar, as well as the absence of weather-related losses recorded last year. While the company's overall investment banking fees of $1.5 billion declined 35% year-over-year, we gained market share in some important areas and recorded a number three ranking in overall fees. And importantly, our investment banking pipeline remains quite healthy.  Provision expense reflected a reserve build of $177 million compared to a $1.2 billion release in the year-ago period, and this quarter's provision includes reserves taken for Russia exposure and other considerations for loans growth, offset by continued improvement in asset quality metrics. Finally, we saw expense decline by 4%, driving strong operating leverage.  Switching to Global Markets on Slide 18 and as we usually do, I will talk about the segment results, excluding DVA. Q1 net income of $1.5 billion reflects a solid quarter of sales and trading revenue and it includes a new record for equities. The business generated a 15% return in Q1 even with a 12% increase in the capital allocated to the business.  Our investments in this business saw good results as our financing clients continue to increase their activities with our company. Focusing on year-over-year, sales and trading contributed $4.7 billion to revenue. Versus Q4, that was a 58% improvement, a little higher than typical seasonality. And versus Q1 '21, we saw a decline of 8% as the prior year included higher commodities results due to weather-related events.  FICC declined 19%, while equities improved 9%. That FICC decline reflects the higher prior period commodities and a weaker credit trading environment. And it was partially offset by improved performance across our macro products, especially rates and foreign exchange. The strength in equities was driven by strong performance in derivatives. And year-over-year expense declined, reflecting the absence of costs associated with the realignment of a liquidating business activity to the all other unit, as well as some Q1 2021 accelerated cost for incentive changes. Absent those impacts, expenses were up modestly. Finally, on slide 19, we show all other, which reported a loss of $364 million, declining $620 million from the year-ago period. Revenue declined as a result of higher volume of deals, particularly solar, and therefore, higher partnership losses on ESG investments, and this is partially offset by the tax impact in this reporting unit. Expense increased as a result of costs now recorded here in this segment, following the Q4 realignment of that liquidating business out of Global Markets. And as a reminder, for the financial statement presentation in this release, the business segments are all taxed on a standard fully taxable equivalent basis. So in all other, we incorporate the impact of our ESG tax rates and any other unusual items. For the quarter for the company, our effective tax rate was 10%, benefiting from ESG investment tax credits. And excluding the tax credits, the tax rate would have been roughly 24%. We expect our effective tax rate in 2022 to be between 10% to 12%, absent any tax law changes or any unusual items.

So you're right to pick up on the commentary, because Brian's highlighted the strength of the consumer, which remains extraordinary.

Now, you're asking a question about, what does it look like in the future? And we're obviously aware of what the Fed is trying to engineer. So going through this every quarter, as we always do, we have an opportunity to think about how we look at our reserves. And this quarter, we took some of the upside height. We've got a little more weighting towards a baseline and a little more towards downside. So that's one thing we've done. Second thing we've done is we've upped our forecast for inflation. So we see that playing through. And those scenarios are a little more weighted towards inflationary. And third, we have adjusted GDP growth done, largely based on blue-chip consensus. So we, like you, are looking at two things. Number one, we're looking at what we're seeing in the actual results.

And our GDP assumptions, like  partner team, they are for the economy, the slowest growth rate from this year to next year. The question of great debate is a soft lining, hard lining, et cetera. But I think what's unusual this time is how much cash is sitting in the consumers' accounts. If you are sitting here when they start normalizing rates in the middle of the last decade, late to middle last decade, you wouldn't have seen the consumer balances sitting with those multiples I gave you earlier in their accounts and then having tremendous borrowing capacity left in terms of unused credit lines and the same on the commercial side Lines are bouncing along just above the low point. And so we continue to adjust our reserve levels to, as Alastair said, to factor in our base case includes higher inflation through the rest of the year. And next year, our seats reserves, set by that base case, which is a 40% weighting to adverse, frankly equal maybe 40% of the actual reserves we have, because the rest are judgmental and in precision and things like that. So we're very strong in reserve. And we're very mindful that I think it's very different to think about the situation where the consumers unemployment is already so low and the consumers are sitting with money. And I think that puts more attention on the Fed to how they architect a successful change, and they know that.

So, from the economic standpoint, your mark-to-market, your assets and your securities, you saw a swing to AOCI, but you don't mark-to-market that $1.4 billion of deposits. From a regulatory standpoint, AOCI causes you to slow buybacks, I believe, you said. but from an accounting or earnings standpoint, maybe you win in the end, maybe you don't. So, I know you're not giving specific guidance for NII.

So you pick up the $200 million this quarter, you put that in the bank, then you pick up another $600 million plus next quarter and then it grows with net out. So yes, that's tremendous operating leverage. And as we just said to John, expenses are flat. So that flows through the bottom line. All the different vagaries of not only regulatory accounting versus GAAP accounting, but also what cap, the comp and the capital ratio calculation versus not, at the end of the day, you said $1.4 trillion. It's $2 trillion of deposits, $1.4 trillion just on the consumer -- for people side of the business. And even on the business side, we only have operational deposits. And so the end of the day, those are very long deposits. We extract the value through investing, and that's why we put it in held the maturity. And the cash flow of that head to maturity portfolio is $20-odd billion a quarter even in a rate environment changes.

But let me flip to what you really said, which is, we weighted the adverse scenario factor at a 40% factor in our baseline reserve setting. That produced a formulaic reserve, which is around 40% of our total reserves. And so, we have reserves on top of that basis for tough times.

Well, Gerard, just to start, we -- basically, you know this as well as anybody having been around this industry for a number of years, let's just say. At the end of the day, the reason why we have securities investments is because we have $2 trillion of deposits and $1 trillion of loans. And so we got to do something with the money and that deposits are stable. They're core checking accounts. They're your core operating cash for commercial customers. So we put it to work to extract the value for the shareholders. And so, it's not that we lean the balance sheet. It's as we do all the work we do in the core franchise to grow the number of customers, 10% or 15% since pre-pandemic, and core consumer checking customers, to grow the commercial customer base, small business base, et cetera, that results in us having a balance sheet that is positioned to benefit in rising rates because we have so much zero cost deposits. And so we don't sit there and say, let's move the balance sheet. What we do is we try to protect in a cautious way all the risks. So we hedge the couple -- a year or so, 1.5 years ago. There were a lot of questions about, oh, my gosh, you're investing and rates are low. And we told people we hedge it, and now you're seeing the benefits of those hedges. That gave us NII from then until now to protect the capital, and that's what we did. So we're always trying to manage extracting the value deposits, give and then look to the other side and see the capital constraint question and the impact of capital, see other constraints on us. But it's really -- and we only invest in treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. We don't take a credit risk and materials in the treasury book for lack of a better term because we take enough of the end company. So I just don't -- we don't sit there and say, 'Let's move around.' It's just how do we invest this and we may move a little shorter or longer on what we invest in. But frankly, we swapped a lot of it to short just to protect ourselves so that we'd be able to redeploy to higher rates in the future.",407.0,175.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.017142857142857144,0.017142857142857144,0.022857142857142857,0.0,0.011428571428571429,0.0

We're growing through it because it has ways it's calculated that are not sensitive to our size, relative to the economy, stock price, all these kinds of things in it that move it around a little bit, but the reality is that wouldn't -- when we look at the core customer base, we wouldn't constrain core customer growth. We can always make efficiencies and move stuff around, and we saw -- believe it or not, as you can see in the other category of loans, which in that quarter, our franchise still left over, frankly, from 15, 17 years ago or have that was that we can let run off and stuff like that or sell out and stuff. But the reality is that the G-SIB buffer is growing because our customer franchise is getting bigger in a method of calculation does not adjust for business success, size of economy, stock market cap increase, all those things, which I think you have a pretty good favor of, Gerard. So we're going to have to retain 50 basis points more capital. So divide that 50 basis points by seven quarters and think about us pulling that through.

I think Brian's earlier answer got to the first part of it, which is we're not interest traders. We're interest rate managers to a cycle. We got to deliver for our shareholders in low rate environments, and we have to deliver for them in high rate environments. Those mortgages protected us in a low-rate environment. And now what protects us in a rising rate environment is precisely the asset sensitivity we still have left in the company.

So, it turns a little faster than people think because everybody takes to zero prepayments, but the cash flow off of it is fairly significant. So, we'll redeploy that and walk back up the ladder.

Thanks to a great team here at Bank of America. We reported $6.2 billion in net income or $0.73 per diluted share. We delivered on our fourth straight quarter of operating leverage. We grew revenue 6%, while expense rose 1.5% for 4.5% of operating leverage compared to quarter 2 2021. We also saw a 21% year-over-year improvement in NII. These earnings generated a return on tangible common equity of 14% and return on assets of 79 basis points. As a reminder, when comparing our earnings in the second quarter of '21 to the earnings this quarter, in the second quarter '21, we recorded 2 items of note. In that quarter, net income benefited by $2 billion from a tax adjustment for a UK tax law change, and that was worth $0.23 to EPS. We also released $2.2 billion in credit reserves during that quarter that benefit earnings by $1.7 billion or $0.19 in EPS. This would bring that quarter's reported EPS to $1.03, down in the low 60s, and that compares to this quarter's $0.73 per share. This gain is illustrated by the increase in pretax pre-provision income, which includes these 2 -- which would exclude those 2 impacts, and that was $7.4 billion this quarter, improving 15% in PPNR improvement from the second quarter of 2021. So let's go to Slide 3. Let's talk about some of the drivers of results. The organic growth engine at Bank of America that existed pre-pandemic is back in full place here. And you can see that in the second quarter of 2021. This reflects in net new checking account openings, net new consumer investment accounts, net new household growth in Wealth Management, very strong loan growth across all products and good performance by Global Markets and investment banking teams, even given a quarter with volatile capital markets. Our expense management continues strong, and it benefits by the best digital banking platform in the world. Once again, we drove more users, saw more log-ins and usage, and that generated 20% more sales from the platform compared to last year. Our asset quality remains very strong with net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2021 still 50% below pre-pandemic levels in late 2019 when credit was pretty good. Breaking down the performance by segment, I'd make a few comments. Our Consumer Banking segment continued to see good momentum as we grew loans at the fastest quarterly pace in nearly 3 years. We added more than 240,000 net new checking accounts in the quarter, in the second quarter alone. We opened new financial centers and renovated others and deepened digital engagement with both consumer and small business clients. And after considering the highly elevated consumer income tax outflows, payments of taxes is good for the government, we saw good deposit activity. In our Wealth Management segment, in a period of declining market values where stocks and bonds had the worst first half in 5 decades, revenues still grow in that business 7% year-over-year, and we expanded our pretax margin. Our banking business with clients overcame the market values and weakness. We added more than 5,100 net new households across Merrill and Private Bank. Across our entire Wealth platform, Merrill, the Private Bank; and our consumer investments team, Merrill Edge, client balances, including deposit investments and loans, totals $3.8 trillion at 6/ 30/2022, aided by nearly $150 billion of client inflows over the last year into those businesses. Our Global Banking team grew loans 5% linked quarter. That's 5% in a single quarter, 20% annualized. We also saw Global Treasury Services revenue as customers utilize our service to management quality stand up well in the quarter. Overall revenue in Global Banking was impacted by the weaker investment banking fees that were available in this volatile market; lower investment banking fees; and we also had marks, as previously discussed, our leveraged finance positions. Our NII improvement nearly offset all those impacts, leaving revenue only modestly down year-over-year. We maintained our #3 investment banking market share ranking. In Markets, we had a solid quarter of sales and trading results, growing 11% from last year ex DVA. Our macro FICC business, where we have been investing over the last couple of years, performed well, as did the equity derivatives, while the FICC businesses felt the effects of spread widening and customers taking a more risk-off position. From a broader enterprise, our P&L perspective, quarter 2 expense was down modestly from quarter 1, consistent with what we told you on our last call. It is notable that we achieved that even as quarter 2 included approximately $425 million in regulatory matters that Alastair will discuss in a few minutes. As I said earlier, one of the reasons we continue to have good expense results and continued progress on digital engagement across the businesses. I commend you to look at slides 22, 27, 29 in our appendix where we set forth our digital operating results by lines of business. Overall, digital sales continue to grow, up 20%. Digital choice for payments continue to grow. Sale transactions continue to outdistance checks written, crossing of the last year, and the gap continues to widen. Erica is approaching 1 billion interactions since we started with it. Clients have filled out 8 million life plans, enhancing our asset growth and account retention. That's one of the fastest-growing product implementations we've had. It is also worth noting the strong credit quality. Most all of asset quality metrics improved again this quarter. You will note, however, the charge-offs rose in quarter 2, but this increase was largely due to some loan sale accounting and some other credit decisions due to the past pandemic issues. As I've done for several quarters, I want to make a few points about customer activity. Let's go to Slide 4. Buyer data crossed the 35 million core checking households plus we have in 60 million consumers in America. U.S. consumers remain quite resilient. I would offer a few thoughts as you look at Slide 4. In addition, I'll give you where we see -- what we see so far in July in a moment. First, customers -- consumers continue to spend at a healthy pace even as quite some time has passed since the receipt of any stimulus. Second, the overall average deposit balances for most cohorts are higher than they were both last quarter and even rose in June versus May. They remain at multiples above the pre-pandemic levels. And importantly, we're seeing no deterioration in our customers' asset quality, and they have the capability to borrow. Our customer data shows Bank of America customers spent the highest quarterly period on record in quarter 2 at $1.1 trillion in total spending. That's up 12% year-over-year. This quarter also was the highest debit-spending period on record for us. But as you think about more recently, just to give you the more recent statistics, in June 2022, spending was up 11.3% over June 2021. Transactions also rose more than 6%. For the first 2 weeks of July, the spending is up 10% plus in transactions, again, rising 6% plus. This is strong consumer resilience. We continue to see shifts in what people are spending on as the quarter took place more on experiences, travel and things like that and a bit more on fuel due to increased prices and less on retail stores. In quarter 2, we saw that higher gas spend as well as the continued recovery in the travel categories and a continued recovery in restaurant spending. In the lower right-hand chart, you'll note the continued shift in how people spend money. The check and cash volumes continue to come down and are replaced by digital alternatives. This continues to help on our cost structure. Regarding our customer liquidity, average deposit balance of our customers remained at high levels relative to the year ago in pre-pandemic periods. The larger change for the mass market customers, they rose about 1% over June from May. The only area where we had any change to the negative was a small dip, 1%, for the most affluent segments of those customers. That reflects the tax payments made in April and the build back coming more slowly for those customers. In addition to this data, I would refer you to Slides 24 and 25, which completes the resiliency picture. That shows you strong asset quality across our consumers. Also look at elevated payment rates on credit cards. That means people paying off their debt at a good clip. There's no real differentiation across the trends in customer cohorts, even for the very small portion of our card book that is in lower credit quality. So while all this is good news, it clearly makes the Fed's job tougher when you take these statistics and this activity and combine it with a low unemployment rate. I want to switch gears now and talk a little bit more about credit. We provided more information on credit this quarter as would be obvious, given the debate about a future recession. Whether it's debate and discuss this potential outcome, we just continue to drive responsible growth at our company, and so we're prepared. So as you look at Slide 5, you can see how much the loan book has changed under more than a decade of responsible growth. As you can see on the top left chart, our loan book is quite well balanced now between consumer and commercial loans. Focusing on the top right chart, note that the consumer portfolio is even more collateralized with a greater mix of mortgage and less card. In addition, much less second mortgage, and obviously, second mortgage as they underwritten clearly differently than they were in the mid-2000 to 2010 decade in all consumer portfolios have much higher FICOs. In the bottom left chart, you'll note that more diversified commercial mix as well. And if you look at the lower right chart, you can see our results on the stress test and how they fared time and time again. When you go to Slide 6, we gave you a little detail on what we look like in the high the last crisis compared to where we are now. You can see the loan portfolio in 2009 when risk were at the peak for Bank of America. Because this was after we closed the Merrill and the countrywide transactions and the company was all put together. We give you those metrics, what they look like pre-pandemic at the end of 2019 and what they look like today. On the right are the changes we've made under that decade-plus of responsible growth. Given all these changes, 92% of our commercial loan book today is either investment-grade or secured. And while there is not much difference in something like commercial real estate book, you have to look underlying to see the changes. For instance, the land development loans increased -- have decreased from $5 billion in '09 to $200 million currently, and secured residential exposure decreased from $11 billion to $150 million now. We've also included a few slides in our appendix, Pages 23 to 25, to highlight the consumer resilience and delinquency points as well as our consumer lending statistics, highlighting this continued strong quality of all our originations. Take note of the FICOs on the newly originated activity there. So in the end, despite the worries of a slower economy and other global issues, client activity remained good this quarter, NII has improved quickly, and our customers' resilience and health remains strong. We recognized some expense from regulatory matters and still managed to keep expenses flat to the first quarter and in line with what we told you. We continue to drive strong operating leverage in a weaker capital markets environment. These earnings are delivering strong returns and delivering capital back to shareholders. And thinking about capital, remember, first, we use our capital to support customers and related loans, and we continue to invest in the franchise. Second, we are delivering capital back to you, shareholders. We announced our intent to increase our dividend in quarter 3, which we have our dividend 22% higher than it was just 12 months ago. In addition, we retired shares this quarter. Third, we're going to be building capital given the new higher amounts received during the stress test. It will make our balance sheet even stronger. Along the way, we believe our expected earnings generation over the next 18 months will provide an ample amount of capital, which allows us to support customer growth, pay dividends and use the rest to allocate between buying back shares and growing into our new capital requirement. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alastair.",2092.0,1127.0,35.0,18.0,12.0,3.0,1.0,9.0,5.0,7.0,0.031055900621118012,0.015971606033717833,0.01064773735581189,0.0026619343389529724,0.0008873114463176575,0.015084294587400177

And since Brian hit the highlights of the income statement, I just want to reiterate, we saw good returns in the quarter with a return on tangible common equity of 14% and return on assets of 79 basis points. So I'm going to begin my comments on Slide 7 and the balance sheet. And as you can see, during the quarter, the balance sheet declined $127 billion to a little more than $3.1 trillion, and that reflected an $88 billion decline in deposits and a decrease in our Global Markets balance sheet. We utilized a combination of cash and some rotation from securities this quarter to fund our loans growth given the decline in deposits. Our average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter, reflecting a drop in deposits and lower securities valuation, and it remains very elevated at nearly $1 trillion. For reference, that was $576 billion pre-pandemic, just to give you an idea of how much liquidity has increased over the period. Shareholders' equity increased to $2.5 billion from Q1 with a few different components we should note. Shareholders' equity benefited from net income after preferred dividends of $5.9 billion and the issuance of $2 billion in preferred stock. So that's $7.9 billion flowing into equity. We paid out $2.2 billion in common dividends and net share repurchases. AOCI declined as a result of the increase in loan rates. And we saw that impact in 2 ways. First, we had a reduction from a change in the value of our available-for-sale debt securities of $1.8 billion, and that impacts CET1. Second, rates also drove a $2 billion decline in AOCI from derivatives that does not impact CET1, and that reflects cash flow hedges mostly put in place last year against some of our variable rate loans, and that provided some NII growth and also protected CET1 at the same time. With that equity growth, we saw book value increase in the quarter. With regard to regulatory capital, our supplemental leverage ratio increased 10 basis points to 5.5% versus our minimum requirement of 5%, leaving plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. And our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Okay. Let's turn to Slide 8, and we'll talk about CET1, where our capital levels remain very strong. We have $172 billion of CET1 and a 10.5% CET1 ratio, which increased from the first quarter and remains well above our second quarter 9.5% minimum requirement. That 10.5% CET1 ratio is also expected to be just above our new 10.4% requirement from CCAR when it's confirmed by regulators at the end of August. And that new level will be effective for us on October 1. I'll walk through the drivers of the CET1 ratio this quarter. First, $5.9 billion of earnings, net of preferred dividends, which generated 36 basis points of capital. And looking at the chart, you can see how we use that. We grew loans by $38 billion. And with a decline in our Global Markets balance sheet and some loan sales and other balance sheet initiatives, we were able to hold RWA flat this quarter. Second, we returned $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders, representing 16 basis points. Third, this quarter, the movement in treasury and mortgage-backed securities rates caused a decline in the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities, and that lowered our CET1 ratio by 11 basis points. And we remained well positioned for that rate movement as our hedge of a large portion of this portfolio continue to protect it from AOCI movements. So we ended the quarter above our expected minimum of 10.4% required October 1, and we expect to build some additional buffer on top of that in Q3. Moving beyond the third quarter, we should just remind you, our balance sheet growth last year means our G-SIB surcharge and CET1 requirement will move higher by 50 basis points beginning in 2024. And I just want to make sure we repeat that for clarity, it's 2024 because I know others have different time lines for their requirements. Given our additional higher G-SIB minimum over the next 6 quarters, we'll work to move above that expected CET1 minimum of 10. 9% by January 1, 2024, and we'll look to exceed that with another 50 basis points of internal management buffer on top of that requirement. Okay. So now let's talk about the biggest use of CET1 this quarter, and I'm referring to loans on Slide 9. As you review the average loan data, we just want to remind you that our discipline around responsible growth has remained tight. Average loans have climbed back over $1 trillion. They're up 12% compared to Q2 '21, led by commercial growth of 15% and complemented by consumer growth of 8%. Each line of business and product segment reflected good growth, and geographic and industry participation within that growth has also broadened over the past several quarters. As we turn to linked quarter comparisons, I'll use ending balances. And the $25 billion linked quarter commercial improvement came mostly from new loans and also included some improved utilization from existing clients. From an asset quality standpoint, 98% of the commercial loan growth was either investment-grade or secured. Consumer loans grew $10 billion linked quarter, led by both credit card and mortgage and also increases in auto and securities-based lending. And for the first time in years, home equity balances increased modestly. Card loans grew $5 billion from Q1, reflecting healthy spend levels even as payments rates remain elevated. Within our growth, our average FICO was 771, as you can see on Slide 23 in the appendix. And as we've done in the past, in the appendix on Slide 32, we've provided that daily ending loan chart that shows trends through the quarter, and you can see both commercial and consumer loans balances are now back to pre-pandemic periods with really only credit cards still remaining 15% to 20% below that period. Moving to deposits on Slide 10. Across our past 12 months, we've seen solid growth across the client base as we've deepened relationships and added new accounts. Some of the year-over-year growth was impacted by a higher level of tax payments across consumer and GWIM clients and businesses in Q2 of this year. Those elevated tax payments drove the decline in deposits from Q1. Year-over-year average deposits are up $123 billion or 7%. And retail deposits with our Consumer and Wealth Management clients grew $129 billion, and we believe our retail deposits of $1.4 trillion continue to lead all competitors. Within the consumer balances, I'd just like to point out that small business deposits of $177 billion grew 14% year-over-year, and that reflects continued reopening of small businesses across America and the consumer spending supporting their growth. The average balance of these accounts is more than $40,000. On Wealth Management, we saw clients paying higher tax bills this year, and we saw some move deposits to market-based funds, much of which remained in our own complex. With our commercial clients, deposits were up modestly year-over-year, even as customer tax payments are higher this year. And some have recently begun to seek higher yields and use cash strategically for acquisitions and other operational activities. Turning to Slide 9 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q2 was $12.4 billion, and the FTE net interest income number was $12.5 billion. Focusing on FTE, NII increased $2.2 billion from the second quarter of last year or 21%, and that's driven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization and loans growth. NII compared to the first quarter rose $870 million, and that came in a good bit higher than the $650 million plus that we signaled on our last earnings call. The benefits of higher rates, lower premium amortization, loans growth and the additional day of interest, more than offset the impact of lower securities balances. Our net interest yield was 1.86%, improving 17 basis points from Q1 and benefited from the rise in rates, loans growth funded with cash and a 4 basis point improvement from lower premium amortization on securities. Looking forward, we want to provide the following NII guidance, and we just have to provide a few caveats. First, we based the guidance on interest rates and the forward curve materializing, and I'm referring to the curve on July 15th. Second, we assume modest growth in loans and deposits. And third, we assume deposit betas reflecting disciplined pricing to achieve our growth. If those assumptions hold true, we can see NII in Q3 increase by at least $900 million, possibly $1 billion, versus Q2. And then we expect it to grow again at a faster pace on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. And the way we think about those NII increases, given the expense discipline that we have, is we expect the majority of that to fall to the bottom line for shareholders. Focusing on asset sensitivity for a moment. As you know, we typically disclose our asset sensitivity based on a 100 basis point instantaneous parallel shock in rates above the forward curve. And on that forward basis, asset sensitivity at June 30 was $5 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months. More than 90% of that is driven by short rates. That's down from $5.4 billion at March 31, largely because the benefit of higher rates is now already factored into our baseline of actual NII after we grew the $870 million. Now given that the yield curve is projecting 125 basis points of rate hikes over the next couple of meetings, we thought it was also appropriate to provide the disclosure again regarding asset sensitivity on a spot basis. And on a spot basis, our sensitivity to a 100 basis point instantaneous rate hike would be $5.8 billion or $800 million higher than the forward basis at June 30. Okay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 12. Our expenses were $15.3 billion, up a couple of hundred million or 1.5% from the year-ago period and down modestly compared to the first quarter. I want to focus on the more recent comparison versus the first quarter. We had higher expense for regulatory matters related to certain issues, and those offset the seasonal decline from the first quarter elevated payroll taxes and revenue-related incentive costs. Let me pause for a moment on the $425 million expense we've recognized for regulatory matters in the second quarter. A little more than half of the amount relates to fines to resolve regulatory investigations relating to our administration of prepaid unemployment benefit card programs in certain states and that we announced last week. The balance of the expense relates to an industry-wide issue, and it concerns the use of unapproved personal devices, and that has not yet been fully resolved. As we look forward, more broadly on expenses, we continue to invest heavily in technology, in people and in marketing across the businesses, and we continue to add new financial centers and renovated old ones in expansion and new growth markets. To help pay for those investments, we continued to look for opportunities to simplify our processes and reduce work, driving our costs lower to self-fund our new investments. Our headcount this quarter includes roughly 2,300 summer interns, and we hope they will consider us to be a great place to work and join us full time next year. This is the most diverse group of talent we've seen yet. Absent the addition of those interns, our headcount was down a little more than 700 associates. And we, like many other companies, are doing many things to tackle challenging labor market conditions, and we're meeting that challenge pretty well so far. Turning to asset quality on Slide 13. I want to repeat what we've said now for many, many quarters. The asset quality of our customers remains very healthy, and that's true in both consumer and commercial. So net charge-offs of $571 million increased $179 million from Q1, driven by loan sales and some other credit decisions that we made as opposed to core credit deterioration. Absent those losses, net charge-offs were down modestly compared to the year-ago period and up slightly from Q1. Provision expense was $523 million in Q2, driven by the charge-offs as we had a small reserve release of $48 million. Now that release includes builds for loan growth. It includes builds for a dampened macroeconomic outlook in the future. And the builds were offset by continued asset quality improvement and the effect of reduced pandemic uncertainty. On Slide 14, we're highlighting the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios and a couple of things are worth repeating again this quarter. Consumer delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels, and you can see the decline in reservable criticized. And NPLs saw a modest decrease, driven both by the loan sales mentioned earlier and other improvement across commercial. Turning to the business segments. Let's start with Consumer Banking on Slide 15. And the Consumer Bank earned $2.9 billion on good organic growth, delivering its fifth consecutive quarter of operating leverage. Strong top line growth of 12%, driven by net interest income improvement, was more than offset by increase in provision expense resulting from the prior year's much larger reserve release. And while reported earnings were down, pretax pre-provision earnings for Consumer grew 26% year-over-year, which highlights the earnings improvement without the impact of that reserve action. Card revenue was solid and increased modestly year-over-year as spending benefits were mostly offset by higher rewards costs. Service charges were down nearly $200 million year-over-year as our previously announced insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect by June. The third quarter will reflect the full run rate going forward, and we believe these changes are helping to improve overall customer satisfaction and further lower customer attrition. Expense increased 2%, as much of our increased salary and wage moves in the quarter impact Consumer Banking the most. And as revenue grew, we improved the efficiency ratio to 54%. Reduced costs associated with continued shifts in client behavior to digital engagement is also allowing us to invest in higher marketing, more technology and higher wages for our people. We also continued our investment in financial centers, opening another 19 in the quarter while we renovated 157 more. Notable customer activity highlights included 240,000 net new checking accounts opened in the second quarter and marking the 14th consecutive quarter of net new consumer checking account growth. This led to a record 35 million consumer checking accounts with 92% of them considered to be their primary account. Additionally, small business accounts are enjoying the features of their business Advantage Rewards and showed growth of 5% from last year. We also grew investment account 6% year-over-year. And not surprisingly, the market impacted customer balances negatively on the investment side. At the same time, over the past 12 months, we've seen 21 billion of positive client inflows. Lastly, once again, we opened over 1 million credit cards in the quarter, and we grew average active card accounts and saw combined credit and debit card spend up 10%. And as you saw earlier, we had solid lending activity with continued low loss rates. Our 43 million active digital users signed on this quarter a record 2.8 billion times, with our Erica users up 30% year-over-year, and we captured over 123 million total client interactions in the second quarter alone. You can see all the other digital metrics and trends on Slide 26. Turning to Wealth Management on Slide 16. You can see we produced strong results, earning $1.2 billion and producing 16% year-over-year growth. Revenue growth was 7% as NII generated through our banking assistance for these clients more than offset modest declines in assets under management fees from market impacts during a challenging quarter. Clients and advisers recognize this value of a holistic financial relationship across investments and banking. And doing that at Bank of America differentiates both Merrill and the Private Bank, and it helps to diversify and differentiate our earnings in this business compared to other brokers. Our talented group of financial advisers, coupled with powerful digital capabilities, allowed modern Merrill to gain nearly 4,500 net new households. We also gained 650 more in the Private Bank this quarter. And that's a very solid showing by both, given the complexities of serving our clients in challenging market conditions over the past 90 days. We added $25 billion of loans over the last year, growing 13% and marking 49 consecutive quarters of loans growth in the business, and that is consistent and sustained performance. Assets under management flows and deposit growth were a little more muted this quarter as clients paid taxes impacting the quarter-to-quarter comparison. Year-over-year, our deposits were up $17 billion, and overall investment flows were $78 billion over the past 4 quarters with total flows of $110 billion. Expenses increased 2%, driven by higher employee-related costs and resulted in operating leverage of 6%. Turning to Slide 17 and Global Banking. You'll see the business earned $1.5 billion in the second quarter, down $918 million year-over-year and driven the absence of a large prior period reserve release and lower investment banking revenue. As you know, it was a tough comparative quarter for the business as the industry investment banking fee pool declined 50%. And while we acknowledge that's a big drop, we just want to remind you that before the pandemic, our quarterly average for investment banking fees was in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion compared to the $1.1 billion we put up in the second quarter. So we view this level as temporary, and we believe it can rise back to more normal levels in the next few quarters when economic uncertainty becomes more muted. While the company's overall investment banking fees declined, we held on to our #3 ranking in overall fees, and we maintained our market share through the first half of the year compared to 2021. At the same time, we saw very strong loans growth. Ending loans grew $18 billion linked quarter and are up $62 billion or 19% year-over-year. That loans growth and higher rates drove net interest income growth, which was able to offset the drop in investment banking fees, leaving revenues in the business fairly flat year-over-year. Also impacting revenue was half of the firm's $300 million leveraged finance valuation marks. The market turmoil and abrupt slowdown in the second quarter sparked a downturn in the leveraged finance markets, causing a number of the deals across various market participants to get marked down. Some of those deals have been funded, and we're working through any remaining exposure to get them through the market. The provision expense increase reflects a reserve build of $143 million in Q2 compared to an $834 million release in the year-ago period. And finally, we saw expenses increase by 8%, driven by higher personnel costs and a share of the noted expenses for regulatory matters. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 18. And as we usually do, we'll talk about the segment results, excluding DVA. Second quarter net income of $900 million reflects a solid quarter of sales and trading revenue. It was another quarter that favored macro trading, while the credit trading business has faced a more challenging market environment with widening spreads in the face of increased inflation fears and recession beliefs. Focusing on year-over-year, Sales and trading contributed $4 billion to revenue, improving 11%. FICC was up 19%, while equities was up 2%. That FICC improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products, while credit-traded products were down. We've been investing heavily over the past year in several of the macro businesses identified as opportunities for us, and we were rewarded for that this quarter. Our strength in equities was driven by good performance in derivatives and offset by a weaker trading performance in cash. Lastly, also impacting revenue was the other half of the firm's $300 million in leveraged finance markdowns. Year-over-year expense declined, reflecting the absence of costs associated with the realignment of a liquidating business activity, partially offset by that share of the regulatory costs. Absent these impacts, expense was relatively unchanged. And the business generated an 8% return in Q2, impacted by both the elevated leveraged finance marks and regulatory matter expense. Finally, on Slide 19, we show All Other which reported a loss of $318 million, declining from the year-ago period, driven by the prior period $2 billion tax benefit from that UK tax law change. Revenue is roughly a couple of hundred million higher than Q2 '21 due to the absence of some prior period structured note losses. Expense increased as a result of the regulatory matters and the realignment of liquidating activity last year to All Other. And as a reminder, for the financial statement presentation in this release, the business segments all are taxed on the standard fully taxable equivalent basis. And in All Other, we incorporate the impact of our ESG tax credits and any other unusual items. For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 9%. That benefited from 2 things: First, ESG investment tax credits; and second, roughly $300 million of discrete tax benefits that applied to this quarter. Excluding those tax credits and discrete items, our tax rate would have been 26%. And with that, we'll jump into Q&A, please.

But my question is, how do you balance making sure that you're not looking too much in the back, the rearview mirror and see where we came from versus what we're going towards and people's obvious concerns about the go forward and the economy. And maybe within that, let's just talk about what leading indicators you'd look at that drive, say, if you thought about putting up a CECL reserve on the go forward?

And our core scenario is weighted part of the baseline, part of the adverse and ends up, just to give you a sense with unemployment rate this year in the actual reserve setting scenario, not an adverse case. But the actual, when we set the reserves was with 5% employment within the next 5 months, so 3.6% to 5%. So it's a -- there's a conservative aspect of how the reserves are set. And so basically, the high quality of the loan book is not only what we talk about and show you all the stats and you can assess and look at, but also, you can look at the stress test results on a relative 10% unemployment overnight, yada, yada, yada, and you see all the different statistics there. And you see that page on Page 5 or 6 or whatever is in a slide, you can see us lower than everybody else's, that's because many, many years of responsible growth and while we showed you those pages comparing the different points in time. And so I think you said something, our reserve is not set looking backwards, it's set looking forward based on the books, based on the CECL methodology. We even do a comparison to where CECL day 1, as we call it, what happened then, and it's consistent. It's consistent.

And we've gone through this discussion a lot a few years ago. And so they're very intensive rates only because the money is always moving, and it's just the average collective balances in these households as opposed to money that's for investment purposes, which will move. And you saw it move a little bit in the Wealth Management business this quarter, and some of the corporates will continue to position them for more investment-oriented cash for lack of a better term. And so we'd expect that to occur. But I think history is some guide here, but also at the end of the day, we've grown 1 million new checking accounts year-over-year.

We haven't seen any great shift yet in deposits. This second quarter was largely just a return to the normal second quarter seasonality we see. We didn't see the last 2 years because there was pandemic cash inflow, fiscal monetary stimulus. And this quarter, it was probably a little more elevated. You saw the headlines talking about tax receipts this year were bigger than normal. So we felt that. But we haven't seen a great deal of impact from QT just yet. And it feels like our customers still want to hold a pretty healthy deposit balance. So I think it's natural to think about -- go back to Q4 '19, you think about the fact that the economy is bigger.

So you got to kind of not only put your normal growth rate, which you mentioned, but you also got to add to that sort of the size of the economy and our market share because DDR deposits reflect the economy moving in and out of the system and across different -- as you have money movement from consumers to businesses, businesses consumers as paychecks and stuff. So I think I'd be careful just saying, ""Oh, let's go back to normalized growth rate off that, you have 2% GDP and 2%, 3% because you're missing that there's a step up in size that we picked up and kept and we grew market share.""

But we have a deposit business that generates deposits from customers, not from pricing and not from going into sort of broker deposits or secondary markets. These are all core deposits coming in from core customers. So that dictates our overall size. Then we turn around and make loans to the customers based on the credit standards and capabilities we have in their demand for credit, and that turns into $1 trillion of loans. And so it's not a number Alastair or I or others at the top of the house, say, if that number is 62, it's good and the 50, it's bad. It's just it is a result of running the customer franchise. The amount of liquidity we have, that is much more planned, obviously, and planned by the microsecond every day. And you can see that our ratios and stuff over the course of time far in excess of what we need. And that will come back down. That's probably going to be more apt to come down as part of the monetary tightening process and things like that.

I want to start by sending our thoughts to the impacted areas from the devastation of the recent storms, especially our impacted teammates and their families. Our teams remain busy assisting those clients and associates in the impacted areas. So we're going to start on Slide 2 of the earnings materials. This quarter, Bank of America reported $7.1 billion in net income or $0.81 per diluted share. We grew revenue 8% year-over-year. We delivered our fifth straight quarter of operating leverage. Every business segment delivered operating leverage. This takes us back to our five-year run before the pandemic. The highlights this quarter were also once again marked by good organic customer activity. This was coupled with a significant increase in net interest income.  In addition, the teams adapted well to our new capital requirements. And as a result, our common equity tier 1 ratio or CET1 ratio improved by nearly 50 basis points to 11%, moving 60 basis points above its current minimums. The decline from prior year reported net income and EPS comparisons reflect a reserve build versus a reserve release last year. At the same time, however, our asset quality remains strong as net charge-offs and several other metrics, in fact, improved from the second quarter 2022. Pretax pre-provision income grew 10% year-over-year. From a return perspective, we produced a 15% ROTCE and a 90 basis point ROA. Our efficiency ratio this quarter dropped to 62%. Taking out the litigation, it would have been 61%. So even while investing in marketing and people and technology and physical plan, the team continues to drive operational excellence. An easy way to think about this is we currently operate Bank of America with less people than we had in 2015, seven years ago. Let's go to Slide 3. Those continued investments over the past several years in our people, tools and resources for our customers and teammates, as well as our new and renovated financial centers have allowed us to continually enhance the customer experience and fuel organic growth as we drive responsible growth. In the third quarter alone, we added more than 400,000 plus net new consumer checking accounts. We added 1.3 million new credit card accounts. We added 100,000 new funded investment accounts in our Consumer business. Customers are finding an increasingly convenient access to us. Digital users grew to 56 million. Logins by those users cleared 3 billion in the past quarter, 1 billion per month. Erica surpassed 1 billion interactions since it was introduced four years ago this quarter. It has become a primary interaction method for our clients with more than 130 million interactions this quarter alone. When you look at our sales, 48% of third quarter sales were digital, a 36% year-over-year increase. This occurred even as we fully reopened our financial centers and had our teammates also selling. Now once again, you can find all these digital statistics and more in the appendix of our earnings material as usual. I encourage you look at those statistics for every one of lines of business, not just Consumer. They compare favorably to the competitive measures that we see because when we see people actually publish their numbers. At the same time, 27 million customers visit our financial center in the quarter. This highlights the importance of having both high-touch and high-tech approach.  In the wealth management business, we added 400 advisors this quarter. Our advisors added nearly 6,000 new households in the Merrill and Private Bank areas. We saw solid net flows despite the turbulence of markets. 80% of our GWIM customers are digitally active. 30% of the new Merrill accounts are open digitally. That combined with our consumer investments business has seen more than $100 billion of net client flows year-to-date. We continue to see increased activity both in investments as well as the banking products in this area. This quarter, GWIM opened a record number of bank accounts. GWIM also saw its 50th consecutive quarter of average loan growth. The banking capabilities and success differentiates our platform. The business grew revenue, delivered operating leverage and saw a record pretax pre-provision growth, even in choppy markets. As we turn to Global Banking, ending loan balances were down linked quarter. However, we did see solid production in this area, and that was offset by client paydowns, decreasing the value of foreign denominated loans and loans sold to manage our risk-weighted assets, which helped us build the capital levels I talked about earlier.  As we look at Global Markets, the team had a strong third quarter in sales and trading performance. In fact, in the third quarter of 2022 was the strongest since the third quarter of 2010. It grew 13% from last year. It was led by strong performance in our macro FICC business, which has benefited by investments made over the past year. We had no trading loss days this quarter.  Let me also make a few points using the customer activity highlighted on the continued resilience of Bank of America's broad customer base. So if you look at Slide 4, you can see some points about the overall health that demonstrate what's going on in the customer base. Let me make a couple of key points. First, consumers continue to spend at strong levels. Second, Consumer customer average deposit levels for September 2022 remain at multiples of the pre-pandemic levels. You can see that in the lower right. Third, there's plenty of capacity for borrowing as credit and card balances of BAC are still 12% both pre-pandemic levels, and the payment rates on those credit cards are 1,000 basis points over pre-pandemic levels. So in spending, a couple of thoughts. A perspicacious analyst might wonder whether talk of inflation, recession and other factors would fructify in a slower spending growth. We just don't see here at Bank of America. Year-to-date spending of $3.1 trillion through September is up 12% compared to last year. Second, as you look across the period, you can see in the trend of year-over-year spending. As we entered the pandemic, we saw spending decline and click or recover and grow across the quarters. And while still strong in September 10%, spending growth has slowed just a bit from the 12% year-to-date pace, which shows you that early in the year was a faster year-over-year growth rate, but still strong. And the first two weeks of October show that strength is still growing at 10%. It’s notable that isn't just inflation that is driving spending as transactions are up single digits year-over-year pretty consistently. You'll also note on the bottom left, the continued growth in goods and services, particularly retail toward experiences of travel and entertainment. While fuel price volatility continues, it is not currently impacting the spend levels in this quarter as prices stabilize. On a level of customer liquidity -- the level of customer liquidity remains strong. Average deposit balances of our Consumer customer remained at high levels relative to a year ago. These balances are still multiples of the pre-pandemic periods, and they were largely unchanged at these elevated amounts for the month of September. These deposit levels suggest continued capacity to strengthen at healthy levels.  On Slide 5, we show you as we did last quarter, some other stats about resiliency. As you can see, whether you look at early or late-stage card delinquencies, they all remain well below our pre-pandemic levels. These are decades-old lows, and we're just now seeing gradual move off these lows and early-stage delinquencies. Late-stage delinquencies are still 40% below pre-pandemic levels. Keep in mind, asset quality metrics were strong even before the pandemic.  On this page, what you see is a 30 to 90 day card delinquencies. If you compare them against the average for the past five years leading up to the pandemic, a period of growth and unemployment falling, those averages were 183 basis points and 91 basis points, respectively. So the current ratio of delinquencies have to be worse than 30% or more to even approach that five-year pre-pandemic average at a time of economic growth and falling unemployment. So consumers remain resilient.  Let me take a couple of minutes to talk to you quickly about the balance sheet, and I'll turn it over to Alastair. As you think about loan and deposit base balances in general, we're seeing what we expected, as monetary policy tightens. On deposits, we see clients with excess liquidity looking for yield without being the global banking movements you can see from moving from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing accounts. Or in our Wealth Management business, where we saw clients shift out of brokerage sweeps into preferred deposits or other investment products like treasuries that we offer. But if you look at our core customer base, where the transactional balances drive the outcome, we are seeing steady balances driven by new account activity and a good value proposition we have for our customers. When you think about loans, consumer loan balance growth was led by card and reflects increased market and continued reopening of financial centers, building high levels of new customer relationships. On commercial, the average loans rose $16 billion linked quarter or 12% annualized. We did see a modest and balanced decline as good loan production was offset by the sale or syndication of $3 billion of loans and also by $4 billion in negative foreign currency impacts. We obviously took activity on balance sheet optimization, which helped our RWA -- discussion -- helped our RWAs and led to the capital levels I talked about earlier. We have provided an update in the appendix as to the credit transformation of our loan portfolio and a few other consumer credit slides to help illustrate the quality of our portfolio under years of responsible growth. We updated those slides again this quarter to show you them and you can find in the appendix, and I recommend them to you. So in summary, client activity remains good. NII has improved quickly and the customers' resilience and health remains strong. We've also managed our expenses very well. We drove our operating leverage. The team managed the balance sheet well and improved capital, either increased our dividend and bought back a modest amount of shares. We call that responsible growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Alastair.",1723.0,958.0,32.0,22.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,0.033402922755741124,0.022964509394572025,0.007306889352818371,0.0010438413361169101,0.0010438413361169101,0.010438413361169102

And I'll start by adding a little more detail on the income statement and refer you to Slide 6 highlights. You can see here revenue of $24.5 billion grew 8% and with NII improving 24% year-over-year, while our fees declined 8%. And I'll cover the NII improvement in just a moment.  On noninterest income, the volatility and the levels of market activity drove a year-over-year decline in investment banking and asset management fees, while still some trading benefited from investments made in the business and the volatile market conditions. Additionally, service charges moved lower for two reasons. First, in Consumer, we completed the sweeping changes around insufficient funds and overdraft in June, marking a 90% reduction from June of 2021. Second, our corporate service charges declined as earned credit rates increased for clients and that overwhelmed organic growth in the gross fees associated with treasury management services performed for our clients. Expenses this quarter were $15.3 billion, and they included the settlement of our last large remaining legacy monoline insurance litigation. As you likely saw on October 7, we filed the 8-K announcing a settlement that resolved all of the outstanding litigation with Ambac and that dates all the way back to the 2008 financial crisis. We recorded $354 million in litigation expense this quarter above previous accruals for payment of the settlement. And without that litigation cost, our expense would have been just below the $15 billion mark.  Okay. Let's move to the balance sheet and we'll look at Slide 7, where you can see during the quarter, the balance sheet declined $38 billion to $3.07 trillion. That was driven by a $46 billion decline in deposits and coupled with a $53 billion decline in securities. Our average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter reflecting the decrease in deposits and security levels. At $941 billion, our liquidity still remains $365 billion above pre-pandemic levels, just to give you an idea of just how much our liquidity has increased.  Shareholders' equity was stable with the second quarter at $270 billion as earnings were offset by capital distributed to shareholders and the change in AOCI from rate moves. We paid out $1.8 billion in common dividends. We bought back $450 million in gross share repurchases, and that covered our employee issuances in the quarter, leaving no dilutive impact for shareholders.  AOCI declined $4.4 billion as a result of the increase in loan rates, and we saw the impact primarily in two ways. First, we had a reduction from a change in the value of our AFS debt securities. That was 1.1 billion, and that impacted CET1. Second, rates also drove a $3.7 billion decline in AOCI from derivatives, and that does not impact CET1. That reflects cash flow hedges mostly put in place last year against some of our variable rate loans, and that protected us against CET1. With regard to regulatory capital, our supplemental leverage ratio increased to 5.8% versus our minimum requirement of 5%, which still leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth and our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Okay. Let's go to CET1 waterfall on Slide 8, and we can talk about that. As you'll recall back in -- last quarter, we talked about our June CCAR results, where our stress capital buffer increased from 2.5% to 3.4%. And that increased our overall CET1 ratio minimum requirement from 9.5 to 10.4 as of the beginning of the fourth quarter. Our capital levels today remain strong with $176 billion of CET1. And through the good work of our teams, we improved our CET1 ratio by 49 basis points compared to June 30, taking us to 11%. That leaves us well above our new 10.4% minimum requirement. So we'll walk through the drivers this quarter. First, it's $6.6 billion of earnings, net of preferred dividends and that generated 40 basis points of capital. And then also importantly, through optimization of the balance sheet, we managed our RWA balances down and that added 26 basis points more of capital ratio improvement. Dividends used 11 basis points of capital. And this quarter, the movement in treasury and mortgage-backed securities rates caused the fair value of our AFS debt securities to decrease, and that lowered our CET1 ratio by 7 basis points.  We remain well positioned for the rate movement because of the hedge of a large portion of this portfolio continuing to protect us from AOCI movements while benefiting NII since float -- since swap to floating. So we feel like our teams rose to the challenge well this quarter in terms of increased capital requirements.  On Slide 9, we've laid out average loans. And looking at those loans and providing a bit more detail on a year-over-year basis, you can see 12% average growth as commercial loans grew 17% and consumer loans grew 7%. Within Consumer, credit card grew 12%. Focusing on more near-term growth versus the second quarter of '22, our average total loans grew 8% on an annualized basis, led by 12% annualized commercial loan growth and 21% annualized credit card growth, while other consumer loans were relatively flat linked quarter. This slower loan quarter growth included two notable impacts that Brian mentioned. We saw good commercial loan demand, and we also saw FX valuations adjustments as a result of the strong dollar and then some loan sales and syndications that lowered our RWAs. Partially offsetting some of the strong card growth in consumer loans, we sold about $1 billion of residential mortgage loans. Adjusting for the FX impact and loan sales, loan growth from Q2 was closer to the industry's growth rate. Let's focus now on deposits use on Slide 10. And you can see there that our average deposits year-over-year are up 1% at $1.96 trillion. The noninterest-bearing deposits are down 3%, while the interest-bearing are up 4%. So overall, we grew our deposits. And as you would expect in a rising rate environment, we've seen some shifts from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing, and it's important to understand the makeup of these moves.  In Consumer, our total deposits are up 7% year-over-year. These are core and foundational elements of the customers' financial activities. And we've seen growth in both noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing balances and we remain very disciplined on $1.1 trillion of total consumer deposits while Fed funds is now at 3.25. So customers see the value in their total relationship with us through their personalized client engagement and our industry-leading digital capabilities and rewards. We expect that to continue.  Do we expect deposit rates to increase? Yes, of course, and we will remain both disciplined and competitive, and that is built into our asset sensitivity. On a linked quarter basis, our consumer deposits moved lower by less than 1%.  In Wealth Management, total deposits are flat year-over-year. And again, it's important to understand that as expected, these are the clients who generally have more excess liquidity and have historically saw higher rates, both in deposit accounts as well as movements outside of deposits where we offer alternatives for those clients. While flat year-over-year, within that, we saw a $12 billion decline in year-over-year average deposits on our brokerage platform with some shifts from sweeps to preferred deposits within the platform. Meanwhile, Merrill Bank deposits and deposits with Private Bank have grown $12 billion. The higher-tiered preferred deposit products represent a little more than 20% of the mix of deposits and they're moving largely in line with short-term rates, while the other 80% or so deposit products are paying much lower rates. On a linked quarter basis, we saw total GWIM deposits decline by 7%, further highlighting these trends.  In Global Banking, we hold about $500 billion in customer deposits, and we saw a 7% year-over-year decline. In a rising rate environment, where excess balances can be more expensive, we typically see some runoff, particularly in high liquidity environments as clients both use cash for inventory build and begin to manage their cash for yield. And we've seen the mix of interest-bearing deposits move from 30% a year ago to nearly 35%, and we're paying an increased rate on those interest-bearing deposits. Pricing is largely customer-by-customer based on the depth of relationship and many other factors. And again, we're not really seeing anything unexpected here.  Betas at this point are still favorable to the last cycle. And as we would just note, relative to the last cycle, the Fed increases have been pretty rapid, and we'd expect to pay higher rates as we continue to move through this rate cycle. It's probably too early to say right now if at the end of that cycle, the percentage of those rate pass-throughs will be similar to the last cycle. Turning to Slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $13.8 billion, and the FTE NII number is $13.9 million. Focusing on FTE, net interest income increased $2.7 billion from Q3 '21 or 24%, and that's driven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization and from loan growth. Versus the second quarter, NII is up $1.3 billion, driven largely by the same factors, plus an additional day of interest in the quarter. Year-over-year now, average short-term interest rates have increased 200-plus basis points, driving up the interest earned on our variable rate assets while we've maintained discipline on our deposit pricing, and that has driven nearly $1 billion of improvement. Long-term interest rates on mortgages have increased even more than short-term rates, and that's improving fixed rate asset replacement and driving down refinancing of mortgage assets, therefore, slowing the recognition of premium amortization recognized in our securities portfolio. Year-over-year, that premium amortization has improved $1 billion. And additionally, lower securities balances over the past six months modestly offset the benefits of year-over-year loan growth.  The net interest yield was 2.06% and that improved 38 basis points from the third quarter of '21. 20 basis points of that improvement occurred in the most recent quarter. And as you will note, excluding Global Markets activities, our net interest yield was 2.51% this quarter.  Looking forward, as it relates to NII guidance, I'd like to make a couple of comments. And first, I need to make a couple of caveats. Our guidance is going to assume interest rates in the most recent forward curve and that they materialize, that we see modest loan growth and modest deposit balance changes with market-based deposit pricing increasing baked in. With that said, we expect NII in Q4 to be at least $1.25 billion higher than Q3. So last quarter when we were together, we told you we expected to see consecutive NII increases of about $1 billion in Q3 and another $1 billion in Q4. And that would make a total of $2 billion in Q3 and Q4, given we just put up $1.3 billion in Q3 and that outperformance, and refreshing our expectation for Q4 at $1.25 billion. We're now saying that aggregate quarterly improvement won't be the $2 billion we initially thought, it's increased to around $2.6 billion or more.  Turning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield basis. At September 30, declined $0.7 billion to $4.2 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months, with now roughly 95% of the sensitivity driven by short rates. And on a spot basis, our sensitivity to 100 basis point instantaneous rate hike would be $5.3 billion. Okay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 12 for the discussion. Third quarter expenses were $15.3 billion and were flat with the second quarter as litigation costs for our settlement in Q3 nearly offset the fines agreed to last quarter on a comparative basis. And it's nice to bring resolution to these matters. Without the costs associated with the resolutions in both periods, expenses would have been just less than $15 billion. We continue to make steady investments in our people, technology, marketing and financial centers. And what allows us to help pay for these investments are the operational process improvements we've talked about and the increased digital adoption rates by our customers and by our bankers. Our headcount this quarter increased by 3,500. And if we adjust for the release of our summer interns, our headcount is actually up by closer to 5,500. We welcomed 1,800 new full-time associates from college campuses around the world into our company this quarter and we hired another 3,800 net new people on top of that. That included just less than 3,000 across our various lines of business and another 1,000 in staff and support and technology positions to support those lines of business. And with all the great benefits and talented people already at this company and with our great brand, it highlights that Bank of America is a great place to work. As we look forward, we'd expect our fourth quarter expenses will land our full year reported expense at approximately $61 billion. That obviously includes the cost noted for resolving the second quarter and third quarter regulatory and litigation matters. So without that, our expenses are expected to be a little more than the $60 billion level we talked about earlier in the year. And we're proud of our team's discipline around expense particularly in this inflationary environment, while at the same time, we're modestly increasing our level of investment in the company's future and our growth.  Turning to asset quality on Slide 13, and I want to start by saying just as Brian did that asset quality of our customers remains very healthy. The net charge-offs of $520 million declined $51 million from the second quarter. That decline was driven by prior period charge-offs associated with the sale of some noncore mortgage loans we discussed last quarter. Absent those losses, net charge-offs were relatively stable with the prior period. Provision expense was $898 million in the third quarter, and that was $375 million higher than the second quarter. And we built $378 million of reserve in the period compared to a modest release in Q2. The reserve build in the quarter primarily reflects good credit card loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook. Even as we build our reserves for the future, this quarter, we saw many of our asset quality metrics continue to show modest improvement as NPLs and reservable criticized both declined from Q2, and you can see that in the supplement.  On Slide 14, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios. And there's only one point I want to make, looking at this slide and that is delinquencies because our consumer delinquencies remain well below pre-pandemic levels. And as Brian noted earlier, we're watching closely the early-stage card delinquencies as they begin to increase modestly.  Lastly, the recent Hurricane Ian impacted some areas where we have strong market shares for many of our businesses, and our teams have spent the past days assessing the damages and insurance coverage down to the loan level. And we've already incorporated that analysis into our reserves for the quarter. We compared our analysis to other large storms in recent years like Sandy, Harvey and Irma where we incurred just a small amount of financial losses.  Turning to the business segments, let's start with Consumer Banking on Slide 15. And Brian shared earlier, we've got organic growth across the checking accounts, the card accounts and investments picking up this quarter, not necessarily because of anything we're doing differently in the past 90 days, but as a result of many years of retooling and continuously investing in the business. We have the leading retail deposit market share. We have leadership positions among all of the important products. We're the leading digital bank with tremendous convenience capabilities for consumer and small business clients. We've got a leading online consumer investment platform and the best small business platform offering for our clients. So as a result, customer satisfaction is now at all-time highs, and that is helping us to drive strong financial results. The Consumer Bank earned $3.1 billion on good organic growth and delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of operating leverage while we continued heavy investments for the future. The impact of strong year-over-year revenue growth of 12% was partially offset by an increase in provision expense. And the provision increase reflected reserve builds this period, mostly for card growth versus a reserve release in the third quarter of '21. Our net charge-offs remain low and stable. While our reported earnings were only modestly up year-over-year, pretax pre-provision income grew 12% year-over-year which highlights the earnings improvement coming through without the impact of the reserve actions. Card revenue was solid and increased modestly year-over-year as spending benefits were mostly offset by higher rewards costs. Service charges were down $338 million year-over-year as our insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect now by the end of Q2. And because of the scale of the business and the diverse revenue, we fully absorbed that revenue impact and are now more benefiting from the benefits of overall customer satisfaction, lower attrition in our client base and lower cost associated with fewer customer complaint calls associated with less nuisance fees. Expense increased 11% from business investments for growth, including people, digital and marketing along with costs related to opening the business to fuller capacity. Much of the company's increased salary and wage moves in the quarter impact Consumer Banking the most. We also continued our investment in financial centers, opening another 16 in the quarter while we renovated nearly 200 more. Both digital banking and operational process improvements are helping to pay for those investments. And as revenue grew, we've improved the efficiency ratio to 51%.  Moving to Slide 16. Wealth Management produced strong results, earning $1.2 billion, and that's a particularly strong result given both equity and bond market levels. If they remain unchanged for the rest of the year, this would be only the first time since 1976 that both equity and bond markets were down for the year. Now the volatility and generally lower market levels have put pressure on revenue in this business. And what's helping to differentiate Merrill and Private Bank right now is a strong banking business; in this case, to the tune of $339 billion of deposits and $224 billion of loans. So while many of our brokerage peers faced declines in revenue and margin, we've seen year-over-year revenue growth of 2% and a margin of 29%, driving the sixth straight quarter of operating leverage. And we saw enough revenue growth from banking products in Q3 that more than offset declines in assets under management and brokerage fees.  Our talented group of financial advisors, coupled with our powerful digital capabilities, allowed modern Merrill to gain 5,200 net new households and the Private Bank gained 550 more in the quarter, both up nicely from net household generation in 2021. We added $24 billion of loans since Q3 of '21, growing 12% and this marked our 50th consecutive quarter of average loans growth in the business, consistent and sustained performance. Assets under management flows were $4 billion in the quarter and $42 billion since this time last year. Expenses increased 2%, driven by continued client facing hiring and higher other employee-related costs as our advisors are increasing their in-person engagement with clients, and that's partially offset by lower revenue-related incentives. On Slide 17, you'll see our Global Banking results, where we earned $2 billion in Q3 on strong revenue growth as higher NII more than offset lower noninterest income. Earnings were down year-over-year, driven in large part by the absence of a prior period reserve release. Our 7% revenue growth is quite healthy given the more than 40% decline in investment banking fees, coupled with lower leasing revenue. While the company's overall investment banking fees declined $1 billion year-over-year in a continued tough market, investment banking fees did improve modestly from Q2 and the teams did a nice job of holding on to our number three ranking in overall fees in a tough environment. Otherwise, in fees, we saw a decline in corporate service charges as enterprise credit rates rose with increased rates, and that outpaced the growth in gross treasury service fees generated from new and existing clients. I'd also remind you that GTS benefits greatly from the NII off of deposits that more than offsets this. So our year-over-year total GTS revenue was up 44%. We also had lower leasing related revenue comparatively. The provision expense increase reflected a reserve build of $144 million in Q3 '22 compared to a $789 million release in the year ago period. And with regard to expenses, they increased 5% year-over-year, driven by continued investments in the business. For example, in Commercial Banking, our strategic hiring over the years has just continued to increase our quality and prospect [calling] efforts.  Switching to Global Markets on Slide 18. And as we usually do, we'll talk about segment results, excluding DVA. Inflation, continued geopolitical tensions and the changing monetary policies of central banks around the world continue to drive volatility in both the bond and equity markets. As a result, it's another quarter that favored macro trading while credit trading businesses faced the continued challenging market environment with wider spreads and recession concerns. So the third quarter net income of $1.1 billion reflects a good quarter of sales and trading revenue. Focusing on year-over-year, sales and trading contributed $4.1 billion to revenue, improving 13%. FICC improved 27% while equities declined 4%. The FICC improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products, while our credit traded products were down. And we've been investing heavily over the past year in several macro businesses that we identified as opportunities for us, and we were rewarded this quarter. The decline in equities was driven by lower client activity in Asia and a weaker performance in cash, partially offset by good performance in derivatives where we saw increased client activity. Year-over-year expense declined, reflecting the absence of costs associated with the realignment of liquidating business activity that we took in the fourth quarter of '21, and the business generated a 10% return in the third quarter. Finally, on Slide 19, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $281 million, declining from the year ago period, driven by the litigation settlement that I noted earlier and higher tax expense. On income tax expense, I just want to mention one thing that made our tax rate a little higher this quarter, and that is with the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Among other things it incorporated, there is a change that allowed solar energy investments to elect production tax credits versus upfront investment tax credits. And those production tax credits have the potential to earn more credits over the expected life of the production facility. So as a result, our third quarter tax expense is approximately $150 million higher due to the net reversal of tax credits accrued for 2022 solar deals taken in the first half of 2022 that were recognized under initial investment tax credits at the time and we were placed with production tax credits. So a little impact this quarter but net benefit to the shareholder over time. This drove the effective tax rate a little higher this quarter to more than 14%, still obviously benefiting from our ESG investment tax credits. And excluding the impact of ESG tax credits, tax rate would have been approximately 24%. Given the change noted for solar investments, we expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be similar to the third quarter tax rate and we’ll examine the further effects of these changes and how they impact full year 2023 and report on that next quarter.  And with that, I'm going to stop there and open it for Q&A.",3954.0,2153.0,59.0,67.0,17.0,14.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,16.0,0.02740362285183465,0.031119368323269857,0.007895959126799815,0.006502554575011612,0.0023223409196470044,-0.0037157454714352067

And so -- but yes, through the core operational excellence, discipline this company has and has shown, as I said earlier, seven years later, we have the same number of people. The company is a lot bigger than it was in 2015. And so we continue to reposition money from things we can eliminate the work by the engineering and work and the technology investments that we make enabling the customer uses that technology and pile back into the production side of the company. And so we don't -- I think if you think about just this year's third quarter '22 versus third quarter '21, if you take out the litigation, there's about $600 million increase in expenses year-over-year, $100 million of that is marketing. Another chunk is -- another couple of hundred million dollars is technology. This is quarterly, not annually, quarterly numbers. And then on top of that, the amount of physical plant change in that time is huge, not only in our branches, but all over our company.  So we feel strong. We continue to increase investments, technology will go up 15% this year versus being '23 versus '20 and those expense numbers we're giving you, but we pay for it by not investing and hoping something happens. We expect the things to fructify in near term and bring forward the fruit and drive the expense efficiencies and effectiveness.

Let me first talk about the leverage financing. That we just marked through our numbers. It's in the numbers. We pushed it to do it every week. So that's included. When you look at those Global Markets or investment banking results, they include anything we are doing in investment banking. I don't think that's what Brian was referring to. What Brian was referring to is the RWA optimization that we're doing as a company to make sure that we're in a great place to serve our customers and to be in a position to have the flexibility for buybacks in the future. So a couple of things that we did there. We did sell some loans. You saw that in prior quarters in All Other. You can see some of the legacy loans were able to sell in prior quarters. This quarter, we sold $1 billion of loans in consumer and wealth and maybe $1 billion in Global Banking. So it's not big, but it's important for us just to make progress in different areas. And then most of the RWA optimization plan that we've been doing is pretty quiet. It's taking the securities that are 20% risk-weighted asset. And as they roll off -- and remember, there's like $15 billion of them roll off every quarter, we can replace those with treasuries at a higher yield. So we're getting more yield and we're reducing the RWAs with that.  And then the other thing I'd just say on RWA optimization is we probably tapped the brakes a little bit on loan production this quarter in a couple of places. And we did a little bit of CDS hedging here and there. And you'll see -- if you look at our numbers, you'll also see the Global Markets, just the way that the customers are demanding balance sheet, the balance sheet is still growing, but the RWAs are a little bit lower. So there's a lot that goes into RWAs, but it's a $1 billion here, $1 billion there.

Candice and her team have negative growth this quarter, but the fourth quarter and the first couple of quarters next year, obviously negative growth. You're not going to change your portfolio overnight. So then the question is how do you manage it, right? So we have limits across all the different categories. You can see the spread of risk in the supplemental book. You can see that nobody is a big part of it. Then we look customer-by-customer and anticipate who is going to be needing money in terms of refinancing, but also in terms of just operating like we did during the pandemic in with every single loan, a company with $5 million of revenue more in our company on a quarterly basis for what I'm sure we had it. So we worked the construct of the book who we underwrite client selection, the structures of the deals, et cetera, in the spread of diversity among industries and U.S. versus non-U.S., et cetera. But then on top of that, we always work in the book hard, and our ratings integrity is very high. We can see it as measured in the [SNCs] and other things against a third party is very -- relatively have much to do than anything we have rated and we make sure we test that continuously with our credit review team under Christine Katziff and Geoff Greener's team because that, at the end of the day, make sure we're not fooling ourselves. And we continue to look at that. And frankly, I think this quarter, we still had upgrades exceeded downgrades. If you look at NPLs and reservable criticized, they both went down this quarter again. And so we're seeing improvement in the credit book even though all of the trade horribles that you’ve sort of alluded to, and it wouldn't take a perspicacious person to lead to see that because it's in the paper every day.

Start with the last. There is no terminal efficiency ratio. Our idea is when you work on expenses, you're not working on the ratio, it ends up in a ratio. We work on the actual dollar spend and so we can keep working on investing heavily to drive that. And the digitization of all the operational process in the company is what you see on Slide 22 on the Consumer side. And you've seen it in the other slides on some of the wealth management and commercial operations still a lot of paper in the GTS business that we continue to take out. So that's what we're trying to do. But interesting enough, what's driving the near-term growth in employees has -- there's obviously financial advisor growth, you saw the $400 million this quarter that's investing in the training programs and hiring some people into the office, especially outside our footprint to get them grow. And again, there's investment in consumer -- commercial bankers. Those are not huge numbers, a big investment in the GCIB platform over the last year, I think 1,000 teammates the last couple of years. And so those investments come in, but also we're investing to drive the operational excellence platform and actually ensuring that we've got great customer service, dealing with all the things that go on. But a major part of it, frankly, is getting -- even though we have less branches year-over-year, less numbers of units, we have more people in them because we continue to build out the relationship management capabilities at branches. As you said on Page 22, the work goes out of the branches from a day-to-day sort of service things. We're putting more and more into relationship management. And that's why you see 400,000-plus net new checking households this quarter, which is a record for us going back to pre-financial crisis. We don't know how far back it is. If you look at small business originations are going up. If you look at merchant services sales, which -- that was an investment in sales force there, an investment. So it's just a combination of driving that. And the continued digitization allows us to continue to be efficient, effective and frankly, plow the money saved back in the marketing back into more technology to make us even more effective and then into people where we need them.

Service charges, most importantly, on the consumer side, all the [NSS FOD], we're now at the steady-state run rate. So that won't be hurting us again from this point forward. The commercial part you're right to highlight, the commercial business, the GTS business is adding clients. We're doing more with clients. So that's adding gross fees. Many of the clients prefer that earnings credit adjustment as the way that they essentially pay interest, receive interest and then pay fees. So that came down probably $150 million this quarter. I think you should expect that come down again next quarter just with the way rates are going. And then the other fees are probably pretty straightforward. Wealth will be all about market levels with a 1-month lag based on where the markets are. Investment banking kind of flattish I would think, maybe hoping for a little bit of positive at some point but not necessarily this quarter.

Of the interchange goes back to the customer base in terms of rewards products, either directly through our own rewards programs or through some affinity group programs. So obviously, as charges go up a fair amount of that goes back. Now what does that produce in value? It produces incredible value. So a lot of that in our preferred rewards fee structure, which reward structure, which goes across all products in our company, if you even just look at the preferred segment and why deposit pricing and the stability of our accounts is different than peers in the last cycle, most of what happens at this time is that, that reward structure cements the customer relationship. And so that then has a 99% retention rate plus of those preferred customers that have about 80% of the deposits on the Consumer segment. And they are very stable and important customer base all our customer bases are. So you have to think through on those fees.

We've got this inflation rate that's obviously seems higher for longer and while we expect it comes down over the next 12 months? You're going into the year with it at a pretty high level and social security is even going up like 8% as we all know. So wondering how you think about that.

We did our usual merit. We did a 3, 5 and 7 merit increase for everybody under $100,000 in compensation based on years of service. We went -- we accelerated $22 starting rate, which $40,000-odd a year now. And we'll continue those patterns. And the good news is we're seeing the attrition rate move. Start to move back. There was 12% drop to 6%, moved back up to 15-ish and has now dropped down the low 14s and each month starts to drop even more. So we feel that we've got the right mix, and we all look at benefits continuously. We continue to -- they didn't vary any benefits during that we would increase our childcare benefit to $275 per month per child, increased our tuition reimbursement and did it in advance. And so it's a complex package, but we should have -- we've been able to absorb all that and keep expenses down to 15.3% a quarter for the last three or four quarters, and we'll continue to do that.

So even though we're picking back up, the word normalization, ask people to be careful because we're moving back to what was all-time lows, and we're not there. So I think if you look at the auto business, the number of repossessions and stuff was down half on a monthly basis. So we built -- under responsible growth, we built a book on the consumer side that we knew would be durable through different modeled outcomes, which is what we do in the stress testing and what we do in a reserve setting process and stuff, but also to actual outcomes and what you're seeing is it's weathering any notion of issues in the economy well.

I am starting on slide 2 of the earnings presentation. During the fourth quarter of 2022, our team once again delivered responsible growth for our shareholders. We reported $7.1 billion in net income after tax or $0.85 per diluted share. We grew revenue 11% year-over-year and delivered our sixth straight quarter of operating leverage. And again, we delivered a strong 16% return on tangible common equity. If you move to slide 3, we list the highlights of the quarter, which have been pretty consistent throughout the year. We drove good organic customer activity and saw significant increases in net interest income, which all helped drive operating leverage. Revenue increased year-over-year 11%. It was led by a 29% improvement in net interest income, coupled with a strong 27% growth in sales and trading results by Jimmy DeMare and the team. This growth will exceed the impacts of lower investment banking fees and the impact of bond and equity market valuations on asset management fees in our wealth management business. The positive contributions of NII and sales and trading were also enough to overcome a decline in service charges driven by the fully implemented changes in NSF and overdraft fees in our consumer business. Importantly, we improved our common equity Tier 1 ratio by 25 basis in quarter four to 11.2%, and we achieved that without changing our business strategies. We’re well above our both -- our current 10.4% minimum CET1 requirement and above the requirement that we’ll have beginning next year in January of 10.9%. We added to our buffer while both growing loans and reducing outstanding shares in the quarter. On a year-over-year comparative basis, both net income and EPS are up modestly with strong operating leverage more than offsetting higher provision expense. The higher provision expense is driven primarily by reserve builds this quarter, a result of loan growth in our portfolios and also our conservative weighting in our reserve setting methodology, which I’ll touch on later. Last year, we had large reserve releases. Net charge-offs increased this quarter, but asset quality remains strong. Charge-offs are well below both the beginning of the pandemic as well as longer-term historical levels. And again, I’ll touch on this in a few pages. All that being said, the simple way to think about it is pretax pre-provision income, which neutralize these reserve actions grew 23% year-over-year. Let’s turn to slide 4. Slide 4 shows the year-over-year annualized results. And quarter four results were a nice finish to a successful year in which we produced $27.5 billion in net income on 7% revenue growth and a 4% operating leverage. While the year was strong, full year earnings declined as a result of loan loss reserve actions. For the full year of 2022, again, we built about $370 million reserves. And by contrast, last year, in ‘21, we released $6.8 billion of reserves. Isolating those changes, again, you’ll see that PPNR grew a strong 14% over 2021. As I said earlier, the themes were characterized by good organic customer activity, strong NII and always helped by years of responsible growth. Slide 5 highlights some of the attributes of organic growth for the quarter and the year. This plus the slides that we include each earnings materials in our appendix, which show digital trends and organic growth highlights across all the businesses. Our investments over the past several years in our people, tools and resources for our customers and our teammates as well as renovating our facilities have allowed us to continue to enhance the customer experience to record high levels and fuel organic growth. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we added 195,000 net new checking accounts, bringing the total for the year to more than 1 million. This is twice the rate of addition that we had in 2019 in periods before the pandemic. This net growth has led to 10% increase in our customer checking accounts since the pandemic, while keeping that 92% of our accounts are primary checking accounts of the household and the average opening balance, not the average balance, but the average opening balance of these new accounts is over $5,000. We also produced more than 1 million new credit cards, the sixth consecutive quarter of doing that, bringing us back to levels that we generated pre-pandemic. Credit quality you can see on Appendix slides 28 for consumer remains very high in new originations. Verified digital users grew to $56 million with 73% of our consumer households fully digitally active. We have more than 1 billion logins to our digital platforms each month, and that’s been going on for some time now. Digital sales are also growing, and they now represent half of our sales in the consumer business. Erica, our virtual digital assistant is now handling 145 million interactions this past quarter and has passed 1 billion interactions since its introduction just a few years ago. This saves a lot of work for our team. When you move to the GWIM business, the wealth management business, our advisers grew by 800 in the second half of the year. Our team added 28,000 net new households across Merrill and the Private Bank in 2022. We experienced solid net flows despite the turbulence of markets. By the way, during 2022, our average Merrill household opened with the balances of $1.6 million, we get very high-quality account openings. On flows, when combined across all our investment platforms in our consumer wealth management business, we saw $125 billion of net client flows this year. Additionally, we continue to see increased activity around both investments and our GWIM business and our banking products. Diversified bank element is a strong differentiator for us as a company. It also supports the healthy pretax margin. This helped the GWIM business deliver strong operating leverage for the year, and they grew revenue and net income to records. In our Global Banking business, we saw solid loan production and growing use of our digital platforms throughout the year and added new clients to our portfolio. As you well know, the overall investment banking fee pool was down. However, we continue to deepen and expand client relationships with our build-out of commercial bankers. Our global treasury services business also grew revenue 38% year-over-year as a result of both rates as well as fees for service on cash management. In global markets, we had our highest fourth quarter sales and trading performance on record, growing 27% from last year ex-DVA. This was led by a strong performance in our macro FICC businesses, where we made continuous investments over the past 18 months. Equities had a record quarter four performance as well. Let’s move to slide 6 and talk about operating leverage. As I’ve said to you for many years, one of the primary goals of this company which is an important part of our shareholder return model, has been to drive operating leverage. Those efforts, including investments made for the future, coupled with revenue growth produced 18 straight quarters of operating leverage, as you can see, leading up to the pandemic. Beginning last year, in the third quarter of ‘21 -- 2021, I told you that we now started achieving operating leverage and got back on streak, 6 -- and we’re 6 quarters of operating leverage despite all the things that are going on out there, and the team continues to drive towards that for 2023. So, I thought I’d spend a few minutes on a discussion of topics that’s been important as we’ve talked about investors over the last couple of months, deposits and credit. So let’s go to slide 7. First, on deposits. There are several factors impacting deposits as our industry works through and the economy works through an impressive period, a surge in deposits from the pandemic-related stimulus, the impact of monetary -- unprecedented monetary easing, impact of high inflation and then the reversal of that with unprecedented pace and size of rate hikes and monetary tightening. But on a year-on-year basis, average deposits of $1.93 trillion are down 5%. This reflects the market trends and in fact, it reflects high tax payments to the governments in quarter -- 2022. In addition, as we move forward through 2022, customers with excess cash, investment-oriented cash saw yield as rates increase for money market funds, direct treasuries and other products. It’s probably more relevant to discuss the more near-term trends comparing third quarter of ‘22 to fourth quarter of ‘22, average deposits were down 1.9%. Noninterest-bearing deposits are down 8%, low interest-bearing deposits are up 2%. The mix shift is especially pronounced in treasury services in the global banking business. Corporate treasurers manage $500 billion of deposits they have with us. The impact of their activities has a change in the mix. On the personal side, you can see the checking account balances floating down a little bit from core expenses and spending while more affluent customers put money into higher-yielding deposits in the market. We do manage all these products differentially. And the discussion of these deposits by business segment you can see on slide 8, and we’ll talk through that. So this breaks down our deposits in a more near-term trend. In the upper left, you can see the full year across -- for the whole company going across the page and upper to the left-hand chart. We also put in the rate hikes that you can see. On the chart, you can see the heavy tax payment outflows in the second quarter. Then we saw the acceleration of rate hikes and deposits to move to products seeking yield in certain customer segments. But in large part, what you’ve seen over the course of the quarter four has been stabilization and more normal client activity. Simply put, we ended quarter four of ‘22 with $1.93 trillion in deposits, roughly the overall level as we added in quarter three ending deposit balances. So, let’s look at those differentiated by business. In consumer, looking at the upper right chart, we show the difference between the movement through the quarter between the balance of low to no interest checking accounts to somewhat higher yielding non-checking accounts, money market and saving accounts and a limited portion of CDs. Across the quarter, we saw a $24 billion decline in total, down 2%. We have seen small declines in customers continued higher levels of spending, pay down debt and also move money to the brokerage accounts even in this business. Higher wages have offset this. We saw a decline in quarter four deposits in consumer. Correspondingly, we also saw brokerage levels of consumer investments increased $11 billion, capturing a good portion of those deposits. In general, think of these consumer deposits are being very sticky of $1 trillion. That stickiness, along with net checking account growth reflect the recognition in the value proposition of a relationship transactional account with our company. It also has -- it reflects industry-leading digital capabilities we offer, and the convenience of a nationwide franchise. It also reflects that the customers in our mass market segments have fewer excess cash investment style cash balances. 56% of the $1 trillion in consumer deposits remain in low and no interest checking accounts. And because of all that, overall rate paid in this segment remains low at 6 basis points. In wealth management, which you can see at the bottom left of the chart, more than $300 billion of deposits became more stable across the fourth quarter. They also -- here, you also witness a shift to higher-yielding preferred deposits, as you can see on the label from lower-yielding transaction deposits as these customers have more excess cash and move them to seek higher yields. Early in the quarter, we saw modest declines in balances, but November’s rate hikes began to slow and the probability of future rate hikes became less. People had moved their money, and we saw an uptick in balances as we move through the quarter. This reflects the seasonal inflows that happened in the fourth quarter for wealth management clients. At the bottom right chart, you can see the most dynamic part of this equation. Our global banking deposit movement -- moves across $500 billion in customer deposits. The shift here is what drives the mix total for the company. It’s pretty typical with the exception that it happened very quickly in quarter four, driven by the pace of rate hikes. In a rising rate environment, where a company’s operational funds are more expensive, we anticipate these changes, particularly in the high liquidity environments as clients use both cash inventory yield, pay down debt or manage their cash for investment yield. We have seen the mix of global banking interest-bearing deposits move from 35% last quarter to 45% in quarter four. And obviously, we’re paying higher rates on those deposits to retain them. Customer pricing here is -- on a customer to customer basis based on the depth of relationship, the product usage and many other factors. So, overall deposit rates paid as a percent of Fed funds increases are still very favorable to last cycle, even as rates are rising much faster than last cycle. I would note, about to the last cycle that the Fed increases have been rapid and we’d expect to pay higher rates as we continue to move through the end of the interest rate cycle. So just remember, while we’re paying more for deposits, we also get that on our asset side. That is simply why the NII is -- net interest income is up 29% from quarter four 2022 versus quarter four 2021. Now let’s move to the second topic I want to touch on specifically, which is credit. And this begins on slide 9. First, it is an intellectible truth that our asset quality of our customers remains very healthy. On the other hand, it’s impossible to gainsay that the net charge-offs are moving to pre-pandemic levels. So, in the fourth quarter, we saw net charge-offs of $689 million, increased $169 million from quarter three. The increase was driven by both higher commercial and credit card losses. As these charts show, they’re still very low in the overall context. In commercial, we had a few of older company-specific loans, but not related, not predictive of any broader trends in the portfolio. These were already reserved for in prior periods and based on our methodologies, went through charge-off in quarter four. Credit card charge-offs increased in quarter four as a result of the flow-through of modest increase in last quarter’s late-stage delinquencies. This should continue as we transition off the historic lows and delinquencies to still very low pre-pandemic levels. Provision expense was $1.1 billion in quarter four. In addition to our charge-off provision included roughly $400 million reserve build. This was higher than quarter three, reflecting good credit card and other loan growth combined with the reserve setting scenario. So, let’s just stop on the reserve setting scenario. Our scenario -- our baseline scenario contemplates a mild recession. That’s the base case of the economic assumptions in the blue chip and other methods we use. But we also add to that a downside scenario. And what this results in is 95% of our reserve methodologies weighted towards a recessionary environment in 2023. That includes higher expectations of inflation leading to depressed GDP and higher unemployment expectations. This scenario is more conservative than last quarter scenario. Now to be clear, just to give you a sense of how that scenario plays out, it contemplates a rapid rise in unemployment to peak at 5.5% early this year in 2023 and remain at 5% or above all the way through the end of ‘24, obviously, much more conservative than the economic estimates that are out there. We included again the updated slides in the appendix, pages 36 and 37 to highlight differences in our credit portfolios between pre-financial pre-pandemic and current status. We also, again, gave you the new origination statistics for consumer credit on page 28. The work the team has done on responsible growth continues to show strong results. From an outsider’s view, you don’t have to look any further in the Fed stress test results. We’ve had the lowest net charge-offs for peer banks in 10 of the last 11 stress tests. On slides 10 to 12, we included some longer-term perspective. We showed long-term trends for commercial net charge-offs, total consumer charge-off rates and more specifically, credit card charge-off rates. This compares those ratios to pre-financial crisis, during the recovery after the financial crisis, pre-pandemic and then through the pandemic. So that gives you a long-term perspective, which I think keeps in context the idea that we’re moving off the bottom in credit cost towards a level which is normalizing to pre-pandemic, but that level was very low in the grand context of banking. So before I move it to Alastair, I want to just update a few comments on our consumer behavior. Consumer deposit balances continue to show strong liquidity with the lower cohorts of our consumers continue to hold several multiples of balance that they have as a pandemic began. These balances are drifting down, but they still have plenty of cushion left. And while their spending remains healthy, we continue to see the pace of that year-over-year growth slow. In the aggregate, in 2022, our consumer spent $4.2 trillion, which outpaced 2021 by 10%. You can see that on slide 35. Two things to note on that consumer spending pace. There continues to be a slowdown. Year-over-year growth percentage earlier this -- earlier in 2022 were 14% year-over-year. They’ve now moved to 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So, what does this mean, with that level of growth in year-over-year spending is consistent with the low inflation, 2% growth economy we saw pre-pandemic. They’re also moving from services from goods to service and experience and spend more money on travel vacations and eating out and things like that. That is a good for unemployment, but continues to maintain service side inflation pressure. With that, let me pass the mic over to Alastair to go through the rest of the quarter.

BAC,2023-01-13,2023-01-13,,2023-01-13,2023-01-13T09:30:00-05:00,0,2023-01-13,qa,qna_heading,Alastair Borthwick,"Okay. Thanks, Brian. And let me start with the balance sheet, and I’ll use slide 13 for this. During the quarter, our balance sheet declined $23 billion to $3.05 trillion, driven by modestly lower global markets balances. Our average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter, reflecting the decrease in deposits and securities levels. And that $868 billion, it still remains $300 billion above our pre-pandemic levels. Shareholders’ equity increased $3.7 billion from the third quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital we distributed to shareholders and roughly $700 million in redemption of some preferred securities. We paid out $1.8 billion in common dividends. And we bought back $1 billion of shares, which was $600 million above those issued for employees in the quarter. AOCI was little changed in the quarter as a small benefit from lower mortgage rates was more than offset by a change in our annual pension revaluation. With regard to regulatory capital, our supplementary leverage ratio increased to 5.9% versus our minimum requirement of 5%. And that obviously leaves capacity for balance sheet growth and our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Okay. Let’s turn to slide 14 and talk about CET1, where, as you can see, our capital remains strong as our CET1 level improved to $180 billion and our CET1 ratio improved 25 basis points to 11.2%. That means in the past two quarters, we’ve improved our CET1 ratio by 74 basis points as we’ve added to our management buffer on top of both our current and 2024 requirements. So, we can walk through the drivers of the CET1 ratio this quarter, and you can see earnings net of preferred dividends generated 43 basis points, common dividends used 11 basis points, and gross share repurchases usage 6 basis points. And while the balance sheet was down, loan growth drove a modest increase in RWA using 3 basis points of CET1. So, we were able to support our loan growth and return capital and add to our capital buffer in the same quarter. Let’s spend a minute on the loan growth by focusing on average loans on slide 15. And here, you can see average loans grew 10% year-over-year, driven by credit card and commercial loan improvement. On a more near-term linked-quarter basis, loans grew at a slower 2% annualized pace just driven by credit card. The credit card growth reflects increased marketing, enhanced offers and reopening of our financial centers, delivering higher levels of account openings. Mortgage balances were up modestly year-over-year, and linked quarter were driven by slower prepayments. Commercial growth reflects a good balance of global markets lending as well as commercial real estate and to a lesser degree, custom lending in our private bank and Merrill businesses. Turning to slide 16 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q4 was $14.7 billion, and the FTE NII number was $14.8 billion. Focusing on FTE, net interest income increased $3.3 billion from Q4 of ‘21 or 29%, driven by a few notable components. First, nearly $3.6 billion of the year-over-year improvement in NII was driven by interest rates. Year-over-year, the average Fed funds rates has increased 359 basis points, driving up the interest earned on our variable rate assets. Relative to that Fed funds move, the rate paid on our total deposits increased 59 basis points to 62. And focusing just on interest-bearing deposit rates paid, the increase is 91. So, even while Fed funds rates have increased 140 basis points more than the last cycle, at this point, our cumulative pass-through percentage rates still remain lower in this cycle. That includes an increase in the pass-through rates in the past 90 days due to the unprecedented period of rate hikes. Included in the rate benefit was $1 billion improvement in the quarterly securities premium amortization. Long-term interest rates on mortgages have increased 345 basis points from the fourth quarter of ‘21, which has driven down refinancing of mortgage assets and therefore, slowed the recognition of pre-amortization expense recognized in our securities portfolio. The second contributor is loan growth. Net of securities paydowns, and that’s added nearly $400 million to the year-over-year improvement. And lastly, partially offsetting the banking book NII growth just described was higher funding costs for our global markets inventory. Now, that is passed on to clients through our noninterest market-making line, so it’s revenue neutral to both sales and trading and to total revenue. And as you can see in our material, Global Markets NII is down $660 million year-over-year. Okay. Turning to a linked quarter discussion. NII is up $933 million from the third quarter, driven largely by interest rates. That $933 million increase included a $372 million decline in our global markets NII. The net interest yield was 2.2%, and that improved 55 basis points from the fourth quarter of ‘21. Nearly 30% of that improvement occurred in the most recent quarter with the primary driver being the benefit from higher interest rates, which includes a 13 basis-point benefit from lower premium amortization. As you will note, excluding global markets, our net interest yield was up 89 basis points to 2.81%. Looking forward, I would make a couple of comments. As I do every quarter, let me provide the important caveats regarding our NII guidance. Our caveats include assumptions that interest rates in the forward curve materialize, and we anticipate card loans will decline seasonally from holiday spend paydowns, and otherwise, we expect modest loan growth. We expect a seasonal decline in global banking deposits and that the other deposit mix shifts experienced in Q4 may continue into the first quarter in the face of more rate hikes. We also expect the funding cost for global markets to continue to increase based on higher rates. And as noted, the impact of that is recognized and offset in noninterest income, so it’s revenue neutral. So, starting with the fourth quarter NII of $14.8 billion, and assuming a decline of roughly $300 million of global markets NII in Q1, which would be similar to the fourth quarter decline. That would get us to a Q1 number around $14.5 billion. In addition, we have to factor in two less days of interest, which is about $250 million. So, that would lower our starting point to $14.25 billion. We believe the core banking book will continue to show the benefit of rates and other elements and can offset most of the day count. So, we’re expecting Q1 NII to be somewhere around $14.4 billion. Beyond Q1, with increases in rates slowing and if balances continue their recent stabilization trends expect less variability in NII for the balance of 2023. Okay. Let’s turn to expense, and we’ll use slide 17 for the discussion. Q4 expenses were $15.5 billion, and they were up $240 million from Q3, driven by an increase in our people and technology costs. In addition, we also saw higher costs from our continued return to work and travel and cost of client engagement. We’ve seen pent-up demand for our teams gathering back together in person to drive collaboration and to spend more time with our clients. Inflationary pressures continued but our operational excellence improvements as well as the benefits of a more digitized customer base helped offset those pressures. Our headcount this quarter increased by 3,600 from Q3. And as we faced increased attrition in 2022, our teams were quite successful in their hiring efforts to continue to support customers. As the attrition slowed in the fall, our accelerated pace of hiring outpaced attrition, leaving us with growth in our headcount. As we look forward to next quarter, I would just remind everyone that Q1 typically includes $400 million to $500 million in seasonally elevated payroll taxes. And Q1 will also be the first quarter to include the costs of the late October announcement by regulators of higher FDIC insurance costs. And as a result of holding the leadership share in U.S. retail deposits, that will add $125 million to each of our quarterly costs or total of $500 million for the year. We expect these things will put expenses around $16 billion in the first quarter before expectations that they should trend back down again over the course of 2023. On asset quality, we highlight credit quality metrics on slide 18 for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. And since Brian already covered much of the topics on asset quality, I’m going to move to a discussion of our line of business results, starting with consumer on slide 19. Brian noted the earlier organic growth across checking accounts, card accounts and investments were strong again this quarter, and that’s as a result of many years of retooling and continuous investments in the business. So, let me offer some highlights. At this point, we have the leading retail deposit market share. We have leadership positions among the most important products for consumers, and we’re the leading digital bank with convenient capabilities for consumer and small business clients. We also have a leading online consumer investment platform and a great small business platform offering for our clients. And importantly, when you combine all these capabilities with improved service, at this point, customer satisfaction is now at all-time highs. And we produced another strong quarter of results in consumer banking that resulted in $12.5 billion in net income in 2022. For the quarter, consumer banking earned $3.6 billion on good organic growth and delivered its seventh consecutive quarter of operating leverage, while we continue to invest for the future. Note that our top line grew 21%, while expense grew 8%. The earnings impact of 21% year-over-year revenue growth was partially offset by an increase in provision expense, and that provision increase reflects reserve builds this period compared to a reserve release in the fourth quarter of 2021. Net charge-offs increased as a result of the card charge-offs that Brian noted earlier. While this quarter’s reported earnings were up 15% year-over-year, pretax pre-provision income grew an even stronger 36% year-over-year. So that highlights the earnings improvement without the impact of the reserve actions. Revenue improvement reflects the fuller value of our deposit base as well as deepening with our deposit relationships. I’d note the growth also includes a decline in service charges of $335 million year-over-year as our insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect by the end of Q2 of this year. And as a result of those policy changes, we continue to benefit from the better overall customer satisfaction and the corresponding lower attrition and the lower costs associated with fewer customer complaint calls, obviously, as a result of fewer fees. The 8% increase in expenses reflects business investments for growth, including people and technology, along with costs related to reopening the business to fuller capacity. And remember, much of the Company’s minimum wage hikes and quarter two increased salary and wage moves impacts consumer banking the most of our lines of business and therefore, impacts most the year-over-year comparisons. We also continued our investment in financial centers. For the year, we opened 58 and we renovated 784 more. And against all of that, both digital banking and operational excellence helped us to pay for investments and that allowed us to improve the efficiency ratio to 47%, an impressive 600 basis-point improvement over the year-ago period. Before moving away from consumer banking, I want to note some differences to highlight just how much more effectively and efficiently this business is running since even just before the pandemic. It’s easy to lose sight of how well this business is operating from an already strong position in 2019. And you can see some of the stats on slide 17 in the appendix. We can best summarize by noting we’ve got $318 billion more in deposits, 10% more checking customers, 92% of whom are primary, 28% more investment accounts. And absent the card divestitures, we’ve increased the amount of new card accounts by 4%, and our payment volumes are 36% higher. We’re servicing those customers with 387 fewer financial centers because of our digital capabilities, and it’s allowed us to need 10% fewer people to run the business. Our combined credit and debit spend was up 35%. Digital sales increased 77%, and we sent and received 3 times the number of Zelle transactions. All of this allowed us to run the business with fewer employees and lower our cost of deposits ratio below 120 basis points. Moving to slide 20. Wealth management produced strong results, earning $1.2 billion on good revenue and 29% profit margin. This led to full year records for both revenue and net income of $21.7 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. This was an especially good result given the nearly unprecedented negative returns of both, the equity and the bond markets at the same time this year. The volatility and generally lower market levels put pressure on certain revenues in this business again in Q4, but what helps differentiate Merrill and the private bank is a strong banking business at scale with $324 billion of deposits and $224 billion of loans. So, despite a 14% decline in asset under management and brokerage fees year-over-year, we saw revenues hold flat with the fourth quarter of ‘21. Our talented group of wealth advisers, coupled with powerful digital capabilities, generated 8,500 net new households in Merrill in the fourth quarter, while the private bank gained an impressive 550 net new high net worth relationships in the quarter, both were up nicely from net household generation in 2021. We added $20 billion of loans in this business since Q4 of ‘21, growing 10% and marking the 51st consecutive quarter of average loan growth in the business despite securities-based lending reductions related to the current market environment. That’s consistent and sustained performance by the teams. Our expenses declined 1%, driven by lower revenue-related incentives, partially offset by investments in our business. Moving to global banking on slide 21. And you can see the business earned $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter on record revenues of $6.4 billion, pretty remarkable given the decline in investment banking fees during this year. Lower investment banking fees, higher credit costs and a modest increase in expenses were mostly offset by stronger NII and other fees. So overall, revenue grew 9%, reflecting the value of our global transaction service business to our clients and our associated revenue growth, while investment banking fees declined a little more than 50%. The company’s overall investment banking fees were $1.1 billion in Q4, declining $1.3 billion year-over-year in a continued tough market. Still, we increased our ranking in overall fees for the full year 2022 to number three as we’ve continued to invest in the business. The $612 million increase in provision expense reflected a modest reserve build of $37 million in the fourth quarter compared to a $435 million release in the year ago period and pretax pre-provision income grew 13% year-over-year. Expense increased 4% year-over-year, and that was driven by strategic investments in the business, including hiring and technology. Switching to global markets on slide 22. And as we usually do, I’ll talk about the segment results, excluding DVA. You can see our fourth quarter record results were a very strong finish to a good year. The continued themes of inflation, geopolitical tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe continue to drive volatility in both bond and equity markets and repositioning from our clients. And as a result, it was another quarter that favored macro trading, while our credit trading businesses improved also spreads fared better than the prior year. Our fourth quarter net income of $650 million reflects a good quarter of sales and trading revenue, partially offset by lower shares of investment banking revenue. And it’s worth noting that this net income excludes $193 million of DVA losses this quarter as a result of our own credit spread movements. Reported net income was $504 million. Focusing on year-over-year, sales and trading contributed $3.7 billion to revenue, and that improved 27%. That’s a new fourth quarter record for this business, vesting the previous one by 21%. And at $16.5 billion in sales and trading for the year, it marked the best in more than a decade. FICC improved 49%, while equities was up 1% compared to the quarter a year ago. And the FICC improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products, while credit products also improved from a weaker Q4 ‘21 environment. We’ve been investing continuously over the past year in our macro businesses. We’ve identified those as opportunities for us. And again, we’ve been rewarded for that this quarter. Year-over-year expense increased about 10%, primarily driven by investments in the business. Finally, on slide 23, we show all other, which reported a loss of $689 million, and that was consistent with the year ago period. For the quarter, the effective tax rate was approximately 10%, benefiting from ESG investment tax credits and certain discrete tax benefits. Excluding those discrete items, our tax rate would have been 12.5%. And further adjusting for the tax credits, it would have been 25%. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 11%, and we would not expect 2023 to be a lot different. So with that, we’ll stop here, and we’ll open it up please for Q&A.",2838.0,1572.0,65.0,33.0,17.0,2.0,3.0,8.0,5.0,13.0,0.041348600508905854,0.02099236641221374,0.010814249363867684,0.001272264631043257,0.0019083969465648854,0.020356234096692113

Need a little more help, you gave a lot, but I need a little more help on NII for 2023. You walked us to the $14.4 billion on starting point on the quarter and your words were less variability in NII for the rest of ‘23. So, I guess, my question is, you got a lot of loan growth, you have a few more rate hikes hopefully coming through, and I understand the opposite. The flip side of that is deposit migration, some outflows and betas. But could you fill in those blanks? Because I think -- I won’t speak for everybody. I know I am -- we’re still expecting some growth in NII for the calendar year.

We’re coming off a period with historic inflows for pandemic deposits. And now in Q4, we’re beginning to see the impact of quantitative tightening and a number of sharp rate rises. So, that obviously creates some uncertainty. We don’t necessarily have a playbook for that. We just got to see how actual balances perform, and we’ve got to see how the rotation and the rate paid develop. So, it’s dynamic. It’s evolving, and we manage and we forecast that weekly. So, when we lay out for you the actuals on page 7 and 8 of the earnings presentation, we’re trying to show you what we’re seeing in real time around balances and mix. So, what we’ve said with respect to this quarter coming up is we got to adjust for the day count as we would every year. That’s timing, and we’ll get that back, obviously, in Q2 and Q3. And then we highlighted the global markets NII impact. It’s always been there. The last couple of quarters, it’s been around $300 million. It is revenue neutral to shareholders as we point, because we pass that along to clients and we capture elsewhere in sales and trading, but it does obviously impact the NII. That’s why we’re highlighting it. But as it relates to the forecast, look, we feel like the modest balance declines are kind of in there that may continue. And this continued rotation from some of the noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing. We got some pricing and rate pressure. So, that’s in the back of our mind, too. And the only final thing I’ll just say is, we’re reluctant to go a whole lot further out. Last year, we declined to give a full year guide. This year, we feel that way in particular because it’s just a much more sensitive environment when we’re modeling when interest rates are at 5% than when they were at 50 basis points. So, for all those reasons. Now, I will say this, that’s the final point. We just got -- I think we got to stay patient because we got to see how rates and balances and rotation shake out. And as rates return to more normal and as customer behavior and you can sort of see it, it’s behaving and maybe a little more normally than we should be able to resume our upward path over time. But we’ve got to see how this shakes out, and that’s why we don’t want to go out beyond Q1 at this stage.",452.0,189.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.005291005291005291,0.021164021164021163,0.015873015873015872,0.0,0.0,-0.015873015873015872

And that sort of investment cash, Gerard, as we call it, moves, the checking accounts don’t move. The difference, frankly, is that there was a lot of stimulus that was in addition to the earnings power of consumers. So, we’ve never had that in history, but -- and so that amount of stimulus. The question is, will they spend it down or will they keep storing it up? And they’ve been spending it down very modestly across sort of medium income households or so and the general consumer business. Give you an example, the cohort that was $2,000 to $5,000 in average balances pre-pandemic at $3,400, they’re still sitting at $12,800, but they peaked early in ‘22 at $13,400. So, they’re drifting down, but it’s still multiples. The big question was, will they end up spending that down? If they’re employed, probably not. But if they’re -- if unemployment rate changes -- and our models assume the unemployment rate changes. So I think we’re at 6 basis points now in total consumer rate paid. The rate structure is very high. And we are 11 basis points, it was -- where we got to, we have very low CD volumes and things that have a fair amount of money markets, but most of it’s checking. That’s why we showed you the differential in checking. So, is it different? Yes, probably in the mass consumer business just because they are sitting on more cash and may use that cash, in certain scenarios, but the rest of the behavior is largely the same, including in the corporate business where people can have less balances and the effective credit rate generates a bigger number to cover their fees, so they tend to pull the balances out.",330.0,142.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.028169014084507043,0.028169014084507043,0.0,0.0,-0.028169014084507043

If you go the page that’s in the report where we sort of say, look at the difference between the consumer business in ‘19 and now. And it’s something to be excited about because we have -- during a period of time where we were completely shut down in branches like 2,000, open back up. We actually went down from 4,300 branches to 3,900 branches. We built out in a lot of new cities. We still have work. We have 10% more checking accounts. The customer favorability is an all-time high. Our small business part of that business is the biggest in the country and growing. And you look at that, and that provides a great anchor, which provides that great stable deposit base, we show you on the slide where we show that base. It also provides a lot of very low-cost deposits. And as rates rise and materialize that. And then if you think what happened last cycle, for a year when rates did not move up, we continue to grow deposits in the consumer business in the mid-single-digits, which just is infinite leverage. And so, that’s something to be excited about from not only a customer side, where we’re digitized and Zelle usage is going up. Erica usage is going up -- Erica, meaning our Erica, not you, Erika. But the -- and the balance of the consumer investments open up 7% more accounts in a year where investment world was choppy. And then you pair that into the wealth management business, same thing, one of the biggest deposit franchise in the country, biggest -- 3-point-something trillion high, $3 trillion of assets, growing net households at the fastest rate it’s grown in a long, long time, maybe history, growing advisers. Those are things to get excited. That’s the organic growth engine in the company. You got to put that against the backdrop of a plateauing of NII, which is basically what Alastair said sort of think about less variability around the $14.4 billion starting number, which might be annualized and did math. And so, did the math and made it out, but that provides us a good base of which to drive forward. And so, you really got to get through the economic uncertainty and then all those things will start to bear. Meanwhile, the trading business, which we invested in a couple of years ago now at its best fourth quarter ever and Jimmy and the team are doing a good shape. And so, I -- we just feel good about the overall franchise, more customers, more of each customer, and then that provides a big stable base, which is rate increases slow down, the marginal impact of it will slow down until we see the good core loan and deposit growth, which you saw after rate -- the last rate rising increase stopped and produced the 20 quarters of operating leverage or -- and things like that. So, that’s pretty good to be excited about.

That’s different than what you saw when they had to cut rates for the pandemic or after the financial crisis and left in there for years to get the engine of the United States economy restarted.

Have you kind of thought about how to better insulate yourself against potentially lower rates and not just kind of a little bit of a decline, but if we get something unusual and rates drop a lot. I know it’s easier for some of the smaller banks to do it, but we have seen some regional banks essentially trying to lock in a corridor of the NIM, so that kind of medium term it’s more about growing the balance sheet versus the rate moves up and down.

So, I don’t know that we’ve thought about it in terms of like a corridor of NIM, but we definitely think about balancing earnings and capital and liquidity through the cycle. So, I don’t see us making significant changes to our core. We’re trying to make sure that we operate and deliver in all rate environments that can be high or two years ago can be zero rate environment. So the changes -- you can start to see our changes at the margin. You can see we’re taking securities out and replacing them with loans, and you can see everything restriking higher. So, we’ve got a smaller, more efficient balance sheet. We, at the margin may consider fixing some rates here depending on how things develop over the quarter. But it’s -- we’ve had a pretty, I’d say, good strategy that’s allowed us to drive net interest yields. You can see those on page 16. They’re up 46% over the course of the past year and drive the NII.

If you look in the fourth quarter, you can see the cards come up, which is seasonal, and that’s going to come down, and that’s one of the things that people tend to pay those down. The usage of those cards frankly, are still at low levels, the pay rate, the way to think about that still in the 30s. So, that’s sort of one thing that’s been kind of consistent through the pandemic. The customers are paying down the card balances. And you expect at some point, those will get back to more normalized paydown rate in the mid-20s. The second is line usage, frankly, has also come back down. It’s not gotten ever back to where it was pre-pandemic, and it moved up and it dropped by 100 or so basis points, which across a lot of lines is a fair amount of loan. So, that you saw. And so, how corporates manage their borrowing and cash and demand cycle seems to be flattening out a little bit. Then obviously, acquisitions and things are way slowed down, so there wasn’t much activity there. So, I think you put it together, then you have in the securities-based business, customers took down leverage, paid off a fair amount of loans in the wealth management business, even though they’ve grown, I think, for 50 some quarters in a row now or something like that in loan balances, it happens, mortgages, obviously, are low. So -- but what we think is as the rate environment settles in, you’ll see that normalize and that we’ll get -- we’ll be back on the mid-single digits. We just won’t have the 10% loan growth year-over-year because that is faster in economy and faster we do. We have not changed credit underwriting standards. And you can see that in the consistency of the origination standards back in pages of the appendix where we show sort of our cars and home equity and things like that.

And then you have the general just efficiency movements in the house that we’ve been pretty good at. And then, you have to remember, we try to get people to go off of nominal expense to operating leverage. And so, we have six quarters of operating leverage. As the NII growth slows down, we have to manage a company to produce operating leverage. And so, we’d expect that fees might stabilize and absorb the $1 billion downdraft in quarterly investment banking fees and start to work up from there and other types of things. So, I think we feel very good about the ability to find ways to manage expenses, always have. We slowed down hiring as we came into the fourth quarter, not because, frankly, we were hired -- we’ve gotten our hiring to match the great resignation earlier in the year, and it was sort of overachieving. So, we slowed that down, and that will allow us to get back in the line and start to bring the headcount back down to where we want it to be. But those are, frankly, positions that are relatively -- have a relatively high movement rate and only because of the nature of the job. So we feel good about between very rate compensation, between continue to reduce headcount for efficiency and frankly, just activity levels, in a down scenario we’ll be able to pull the expenses down. But yes, meanwhile, we we’re going to invest $3.7 billion in technology development in ‘23 versus $3.4 billion in ‘22. We continue to add bankers. We had 800 wealth management advisers in the second half of last year, where our training program for those across wealth manage -- all of our wealth management businesses and other trading programs. We continue to hire young talented people. So we’re trying to maintain that balance of continuing to invest in the growth opening in new cities. We’re averaging -- these branches we’re opening are extremely successful when you look at the size of them relative to anybody else’s opening practice. And so, why would you stop that. And yet the total number of branches comes down because we’re managing the expense side. So, we’re paying for this stuff as we go.

That has no impact on it that you saw over the last few quarters have impact. So, less variability. All the things you cited are the reasons why we tend to say you have to be careful about saying what’s going to happen in the fourth quarter ‘23 with great clarity. What we did say is if at this level with less variability, you’ll have nice growth over this year to next year. But I think everything you point out, whether it’s whether it’s rates going up faster than people think because inflation doesn’t going to roll or come down because people think that they’ve done a good job and they want to get behind the economy. We base our modeling on the blue chip economic assumptions out there and then looking at our balances and stuff. And so, I think that’s a reluctance. So all your points are great points, and they’re all why we are reluctant to say. I can tell you to the 3 decimal places where it’s going to be three quarters out because it can move around on you.

If you go to Slide 2 of the materials, Bank of America delivered strong earnings, growing EPS 18% over first quarter '22. Every business segment performed well. We grew clients and accounts organically and at a strong pace. We delivered our seventh straight quarter of operating leverage, led by a 13% year-over-year revenue growth. We further strengthened our balance sheet, with our CET1 ratio increasing to 11.4%. Regulatory capital ended at the highest nominal level in our history at $184 billion. We maintained strong liquidity. We ended the quarter with more than $900 billion in Global Liquidity Sources. We are in good returns for you as our shareholders, with a return on tangible common equity of 17%, a 107 basis points return on average assets. Tangible book value per share grew 9% year-over-year. We did this as the economy slowed. And, remember, our research team continues to predict a shallow recession that will occur beginning in the quarter three of 2023. It's interesting, when we look at our consumer behavior, payments by consumer continued to drive the U.S. economy. We've seen debit and credit card spending at about 6% year-over-year growth pace, a little slower but still healthy. But, remember, card spending represents less than a quarter of how consumers pay for things out of their accounts at Bank of America. Overall payments from our customers' accounts across all sources were up 9% year-over-year for March as a month. Year-to-date, they were up about 8% for the quarter. After slowing in the back half of 2022 a bit, we saw the payments -- pace of payments picked back up in quarter one, especially in the latter parts of the quarter. Consumers' financial positions remains generally healthy. They're employed with generally higher wages, continue to have strong account balances, and have good access to credit. As you think through all the tightening actions of the Fed, the flows to alternative yielding assets, investments and the disruption the past quarter, our deposits continued to perform well, ending the quarter at $1.91 trillion. If you think about it, that's about the same balance that we had in mid-October of 2022. So, we've seen these balances stabilize and remain 34% above they were in prior to the pandemic. The team has managed well during these periods by remaining focused on the things we can control to drive value through our franchise. I thank them for a very strong quarter, near-record earnings with strong returns. Let me turn the call over to Alastair to walk through the details of the quarter.",531.0,278.0,14.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.050359712230215826,0.025179856115107913,0.0035971223021582736,0.0035971223021582736,0.0,0.025179856115107913

And I'll pick up on Slide 3, where we list some of the more detailed highlights of the quarter. And then, on Slide 4, we present the summary income statement. So, I'm going to refer to both of these together. As Brian mentioned, for the quarter, we generated $8.2 billion of net income, and that resulted in $0.94 per diluted share. Our revenue grew 13%, and that was led by a 25% improvement in net interest income, coupled with strong 9% growth in sales and trading results, excluding DVA. Our non-interest revenue was strong, despite three headwinds: First, we had lower service charges as commercial clients paid lower fees for treasury services, since they now receive higher earned rates on balances. And, obviously, that allows us to invest those funds to earn NII. On consumer, we had lower NSF insufficient funds and overdraft fees as a result of our policy changes announced in late 2021. Second, with lower asset management fees and that just reflects the lower equity market levels and fixed-income market levels. And, third, investment banking fees were lower, just reflecting the continuation of sluggish industry activity and reduced fee pools. Now, all that said, despite these headwinds, each of the three categories saw modest improvement from the fourth quarter levels. Asset quality remained strong, and provision expense for the quarter was $931 million. That consisted of $807 million of net charge-offs and $124 million of reserve build. And that reserve build compares to a reserve release in the first quarter 2022 of $362 million. Our charge-off rate was 32 basis points and still well below the fourth quarter of '19 when our pre-pandemic rate was 39 basis points. And, remember, 2019 was a multi-decade low. So, credit, obviously, remains quite strong. I want to make one other point on Slide 4 and that is simply to note that pre-tax pre-provision income grew 27% year-over-year compared to reported net income growth of 15%. So, let's turn to the balance sheet that starts on Slide 5. And you can see, during the quarter, our balance sheet increased $144 billion to $3.195 trillion. Brian noted our liquidity levels at the end of the period, those rose to more than $900 billion from December 31. That's $23 billion higher and it remains $324 billion above our pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter of '19. Shareholders' equity increased $7 billion from the fourth quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders, and we saw an improvement in AOCI of $3 billion due to lower long-term interest rates. The AOCI included more than $0.5 billion increase from improved valuations of AFS debt securities and that flows through CET1. And the remaining $2.5 billion due to changes in cash flow hedges doesn't impact regulatory capital. During the quarter, we paid $1.8 billion in common dividends and we bought back $2.2 billion in shares. Turning to regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $184 billion since December 31 and our CET1 ratio improved 14 basis points to 11.4%, once again, adding to our buffer over our 10.4% current minimum requirement as well as the 10.9% minimum requirement that we'll see on January 1st of 2024. That means, in the past 12 months, we've improved our CET1 ratio by 100 basis points, and we've supported our clients and we've returned $12 billion in capital to shareholders. CET1 capital improved $4 billion, and that reflects the benefit of earnings and the AOCI improvement, partially offset by the capital we've returned to shareholders. Our risk-weighted assets increased modestly and that partially offset the benefit to the CET1 ratio of the higher capital we generated. And then, our supplemental leverage ratio increased to 6%. That compares to a minimum requirement of 5% and leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth, and our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. So, let's spend a minute on loan growth, and we'll do that by turning to Slide 6, where you can see the average loans grew 7% year-over-year, driven by commercial loans and credit card growth. The credit card growth reflects increased marketing, it reflects enhanced offers and higher levels of card account openings. The commercial growth across the past year reflects the diversity of commercial activity across global banking and global markets and, to some degree, global wealth. And on a more near-term linked-quarter basis, loans grew at a much slower pace, partly driven by seasonal credit card paydowns after the fourth quarter holiday spending, and then commercial demand slowed in Q1 and we saw some paydowns by our wealth management clients as they lowered leverage as rates rose. So, let's turn to deposits and there's obviously been a lot of additional focus this quarter, so I want to spend extra time here and I'm going to start with Slide 7 and talk about average deposits. Just a few points we need to make before focusing on a more detailed discussion of the recent trends. Average total deposits for the first quarter were $1.89 trillion, that is down 2% linked-quarter and down 7% year-over-year. Our deposits peaked in the fourth quarter of 2021. And even as the Fed has continued to withdraw money supply, our deposits have held around $1.9 trillion, because there's a lot more industry deposits today in a much bigger economy today compared to pre-pandemic. Our average deposits were up 34% compared to our pre-pandemic Q4 '19 balance and the industry's deposits were up 31% to $17.4 trillion. So, we've obviously fared a little bit better than the industry. We put our pre-pandemic deposits for each line of business on the slide, so you can compare our balances then and now. I want to highlight consumer checking balances, which remained 53% higher than pre-pandemic. And as I think all of us would expect, GWIM combined client deposits are up a lesser 23%, as those are the clients that generally move their excess cash into other off-balance sheet products. And in global banking, you can see the rotation to interest-bearing across time as rates rose. So, let's get a little more granular and a little more near-term and we'll use Slide 8 for that, where you can see the breakout of deposit trends on a weekly ending basis across the last two quarters. You can also see that we plotted the timeline of Fed target and rate hikes on the top-left chart, just for comparison through time. In the upper left, you can see the trend of our total deposits. We ended Q1 '23 at $1.91 trillion, that's down 1%. And, as Brian mentioned, over the course of the past six months, those balances have been relatively stable. In consumer, looking at the top-right chart, we show the difference here in the movement through the quarter between the balances of low to no interest checking accounts, and the higher-yielding non-checking accounts and, across the entire quarter, we saw a modest $4 billion decline in total. Checking balances, obviously, have some variability around pay days in particular, but note the relative stability of checking deposits, because these are the operational accounts with money and motion to pay the bills and everyday living costs for families. I'd also point out that our checking balances were modestly growing even ahead of March 9th upheaval and continue to move higher through the quarter on the back of disruption. Lower non-checking balances mostly reflect money moved out of deposits and into brokerage accounts where we earn a small fee. Rate paid increased 6 basis points from the fourth quarter to 12 basis points on this [trillion dollars] (ph) of total consumer deposits and remains low, because of the 52% mix that is checking. Lastly, I just note that the rate movements in this business are concentrated in the small CDs and consumer investment deposits, which together represent about 5% of the deposits. In wealth management, as you would expect, it shows the most relative decline, and you can see the continued trend of clients moving money from lower-yielding sweep accounts into higher-yielding preferred deposits and off-balance sheet to other investment alternatives. Now, if we went back further, you'd see that roughly $90 billion has moved out of sweeps in the past year, which leaves $80 billion in these accounts. So, you can see how with the pace and size of rate hikes slowing, we expect the declines in balances to lessen from here. At the bottom-right, note the global banking deposit movement, where we hold about $500 billion in customer deposits. These are generally operational deposits of our commercial customers and they use that to manage their cash flows through the course of the year. Those were down $3 billion from the fourth quarter. And what's interesting to note is that, our total deposits in this segment have been stable at around $500 billion for the past six months and this business just continues to see rotation into interest-bearing. The mix of interest-bearing deposits on an ending basis moved from 49% last quarter to 55% in Q1. And, obviously, we pay increased rates on those interest-bearing deposits. And it's this rotation in global banking that's driving the rotational shift of the total company, and it's pretty typical and to be expected in this environment. So, in summary, our deposits continued to behave as we would expect. The cash transactional balances have shown some recent stabilization. And for investment cash, we've seen deposits moved to brokerage and other platforms for direct holdings of money market, mutual funds, treasuries, and we are capturing many of those flows as you see in our numbers, it's just we expect that to slow going forward. So, now that we've examined trends for the different lines of business, I want to make some important points about the characteristics of our deposit franchise using Slide 9, and this will just help reinforce for shareholders who own Bank of America that they're investing in one of the world's great deposit franchises, all of it based off of relationships we have with our customers and the value they place on the award-winning capabilities and convenience they have access to. So, starting from the top, focus first on consumer. You can see that more than 80% of deposits have been with us for more than five years, and more than two-thirds of our consumer deposits are balances with customers who have had relationships with the bank for more than 10 years. Also, more than three-quarters of these customers are very highly engaged in their activities with us. They are also, geographically, dispersed across the United States given our presence in 83 of the top 100 markets. Lastly, whether you look at consumers or small business, the value proposition is what's driving the same result. We've got long-tenured customers with deep relationships that are highly engaged. Turning to wealth management, you can see a similar story around long tenure and quite active relationships. The average relationship of our GWIM clients is around 14 years. And, again, these clients are very geographically diverse, they're also very digitally engaged, and we continue to see deepening around banking solutions and products of all types. There's lots of options for these clients that extend from their operational checking accounts all the way up through preferred deposit options, and then we also benefit from having great alternatives for them within our investment platform. On global banking, note that 80% of our U.S. deposit balances are held by clients who have had an account with us for at least 10 years. Furthermore, as we measure the number of solutions that clients have with us, we know that 73% of balances are held by clients that have at least five products on us and, just like the other businesses, they are highly diversified by industry and geography. So, those are some of the things that make our quality deposit base stable. So, now that we've walked through both loans and deposits, I want to transition a bit to make some points on balance sheet management and to focus on the liquidity we enjoy by having a surplus of customer deposits that far exceeds the loan demand of our clients today and far exceeded the loan demand of our clients pre-pandemic. Having the deposits alone doesn't pay the expenses to support these great customer bases and it doesn't mean much to our shareholders, unless we put them to work to extract the value of those deposits. So, that's what we're trying to illustrate and we want to show you how we do them. You can see that on Slide 10, where you note we had significant excess deposits over loans pre-pandemic. And during the pandemic, that increased -- that amount increased significantly. Before the pandemic, we had $0.5 trillion more in deposits than loans and that peaked in late 2021 at more than $1.1 trillion and it remains high at roughly $900 billion still today. That's the context as we talk about how we manage excess cash. So, let's turn to Slide 11. And here we're going to focus on the banking book, because our global markets' balance sheet has remained largely market funded. And just follow the graph from left to right. At the top of the slide, you note trend of cash and cash equivalents and the two components of the debt securities balances: available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. And you can see the trend of the overall combined cash and securities balance movement and it closely mirrors the previous slide's excess deposit trends, as you would expect. In 2020, deposits grew, while loans declined and that was pandemic borrowing from our commercial clients stopping and then quickly paying it off. Throughout 2020, as we put deposits to work, we took a number of actions to protect our capital and that included a buildup in hold-to-maturity, better aligning our capital treatment with our intent to hold those securities to maturity. We also hedged rate risk in the available-for-sale book using pay-fixed, receive-variable swaps. So, these securities acted like cash and they earned higher yields and guarded against capital volatility. As we entered the middle of 2021, it became more clearer that the stimulus payment would likely be the last one and, therefore, we believed deposits would be peaking. As a result, we stopped adding to our hold-to-maturity securities book. That book peaked in the third quarter of 2021 at $683 billion, $562 billion were mortgage backs, and the rest were treasuries. And all that's happened is that notional balances have declined in each of the past six quarters, ending the quarter at $625 billion. And within that, the mortgage-backed portfolio was down $67 billion to $495 billion. As rates began to rise quickly throughout 2022, the value of our deposits rose. And, at the same time, the disclosed market value of the hold-to-maturity securities has declined, resulting in a negative market valuation on those bonds. That negative market valuation peaked in the third quarter, came down in the fourth quarter, and it's come down another $10 billion in the first quarter. In our 10-K disclosure, we included a chart which shows the maturity distribution of our securities portfolio. And, I'd remind you, this is based on the maturity dates of those originations, i.e., the date of the last contractual payment. When we look at the actual cash flows of those bonds over time, it results in an average weighted life of the hold-to-maturity securities book of a little more than eight years. And as you can see, since the third quarter of 2021, we've continued to see increases in the overall yield on the balances due to both the maturity and reinvestment of lower-yielding securities as well as remix into higher-yielding cash. And, as you can see, with deposits paying 92 basis points, that compares to our blend of cash and government-guaranteed securities, which pays 290 basis points. So, we continue to benefit NII and yield. And, finally, one very important last point I want to make, which is on the improved NII of our banking book. Because, remember, we manage the entirety of our balance sheet. That includes our deposits and that's where you see the net interest income has improved significantly. NII, excluding global markets, which we disclose each quarter, troughed in the third quarter of 2020 at $9.1 billion, and it's now $5.4 billion higher on a quarterly basis at $14.5 billion in the first quarter of '23, and that's the acid test of managing the entire balance sheet. So, let's turn now to Slide 12 and focus on net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in the first quarter was $14.4 billion and the FTE NII number was $14.6 billion. Focusing on FTE, net interest income increased $2.9 billion from the first quarter of 2022 or 25%, while our net interest yield improved 51 basis points to 2.2%. The improvement was driven by rates, and that includes reductions in securities premium amortization. Average Fed fund rates are up 440 basis points year-over-year. Relative to that increase in Fed funds, which has benefited all of our variable rate assets, the rate paid on our total deposits rose 89 basis points and the rate paid today on interest-bearing deposits is up 133 basis points. Average loan growth of $64 billion also aided the year-over-year NII improvement. Turning to a linked-quarter discussion, NII of $14.6 billion is down $222 million from Q4, and that's primarily driven by the continued impact of lower deposit balances and the mix shift into interest-bearing. It's also influenced by lower global markets NII, which, remember, still gets passed through to clients via higher non-interest income as part of the trading revenue. Excluding the $262 million decline in global markets' NII, the banking book NII of $14.5 billion, that was modestly higher as the benefit of increased short interest rates, some modest loan growth and some deposit favorability was offset by two less days of interest in the quarter. Turning to asset sensitivity on a forward basis, the plus 100 basis point parallel shift at March 31st stands at $3.3 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months from our banking book. 96% of that sensitivity is driven by short rates. Summary, the first quarter NII was $14.6 billion in this quarter on an FTE basis and that was a little better than our $14.4 billion expectation as we began the quarter since deposits and rate pass-throughs were both modestly better. Looking forward, based on everything we know about interest rates and customer behavior, we expect second quarter NII on an FTE basis to be around 2% lower compared to Q1. So, think about that NII as about $14.3 billion FTE, plus or minus, driven by expected deposit movements as well as lower global markets' NII, which again is offset in the trading revenue. So, let me remind you of some of the caveats when it comes to that NII guidance. First, importantly, it assumes that interest rates in the forward curve materialize and that includes one more hike and then a couple of cuts in 2023. We also expect funding costs for global markets client activity to continue to increase based on those high rates. And, as noted, the impact of that is still offset in non-interest income, and that obviously assumes our current client positioning and the forward rate expectations. We continue to expect modest loan growth. So, that's in our NII expectation as well, and it's driven by credit card and, to a lesser degree, commercial. And then, finally, we just expect lower deposits and rotational shifts towards interest-bearing, really for three reasons. First, we expect further Fed balance sheet reductions to continue to reduce deposits for the industry. Second, we anticipate lower wealth management deposits in the second quarter. That's pretty typical due to the seasonal impact of clients paying income taxes and, to a lesser degree now, a continuation of balance movement seeking better yields off-balance sheet. And, third, we just continue to expect some of the rotation of commercial deposits towards interest-bearing. Okay. Let's go to Slide 13, we'll talk about expense. And here what you can see is, in the first quarter, our expenses were $16.2 billion, that's up $700 million from the fourth quarter and it's driven by seasonal elevation from payroll taxes, mostly at $450 million, a little bit from higher FDIC insurance expense, that was another $100 million this quarter, and the cost of adding people, call that another $100 million. We ended the first quarter with a little more than 217,000 people at the company, that was 260 people more than year-end. During the quarter, we welcomed 3,000 additional people into the company in January, that's due to outstanding offers that we extended in the fourth quarter. That meant that our headcount peaked in January. That's a little more than 218,000. And, at the end of last week, we were down to 216,000. We continue to expect that to move lower over time and we expect, by the end of the second quarter, our full-time equivalent headcount will be roughly 213,000, excluding our summer interns. As we look forward to the next quarter then, we would expect Q2 expense to benefit from the reduction of the seasonal elevation of payroll tax in Q1, and we would also expect to see expense reductions coming from headcount reductions through attrition over time and our operational excellence work. So, we expect expense in Q2 to be around $400 million or $500 million lower than Q1, so think of that as around $15.8 billion, plus or minus, in Q2. And then further, we just expect continued sequential expense declines in the third quarter and then again in the fourth quarter as we benefit from continued headcount discipline and attrition through time. Now turn to asset quality on Slide 14, and I want to start the credit discussion by saying, once again, asset quality of our customers remains healthy and net charge-offs continue to rise from their near historic lows. Net charge-offs of $807 million increased $118 million from the fourth quarter. That increase was driven by credit card losses as higher late-stage delinquencies flowed through to charge-offs. For context, the credit card net charge-off rate was 2.21% in this first quarter and that compares to 3.03% in the fourth quarter of '19 pre-pandemic. Provision expense was $931 million in Q1, and that included a $124 million reserve build. That's obviously less than the $403 million build we took in the fourth quarter, and it reflects modest loan growth and an ever so slightly improved macroeconomic outlook that, on a weighted basis, continues to include an unemployment rate still north of 5% as we end 2023. We included a slide in the appendix this quarter that highlights the mix and credit metrics of our commercial real estate exposure. And I just wanted to remind everyone here, we've been very intentional around our client selection, very intentional around portfolio concentration, and deal structure over many years and, as a result, we've seen NPLs and realized losses that remain quite low for this portfolio. We had a total of $66 million of commercial real estate losses in 2022. 70% of that was in office loans and that resulted in an annualized loss rate of 26 basis points. In the first quarter, to give some perspective, our office loan losses were $15 million. We have roughly $73 billion in commercial real estate loans outstanding, that's less than 7% of our loan book. It's highly diversified by geography, and no part of the country represents more than 22% of the book. It's also very diversified across property type. Within property type, our office portfolio was $19 billion, it's about 2% of our total loans. The portfolio is roughly 75% Class A properties. And when we originate, they are typically around 55% loan-to-value. Even though we've seen some property value declines, this exposure still remain well secured. $3.6 billion is classified as reservable criticized. And even on the most recent refreshes on our toughest loans, we still have 75% LTVs. In our office book, $4 billion is scheduled to mature this year, another $6 billion in 2024, with the remainder spread over the following years. So, we continue to feel that the portfolio is well-positioned and adequately reserved given the current conditions. On Slide 15, for completeness, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. And, with that, I'm going to turn it back to Brian to talk about the lines of business.",4087.0,2103.0,37.0,36.0,17.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,16.0,0.01759391345696624,0.017118402282453638,0.008083689966714217,0.0014265335235378032,0.0019020446980504042,0.00047551117451260106
BAC,2023-04-18,2023-04-18,,2023-04-18,2023-04-18T14:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-18,qa,qna_heading,Brian Moynihan,"Thank you, Alastair. And we're going to begin on Slide 16. So, I want to bring us back to the things that drive the long-term value of this franchise and the value for you, our shareholders. Every business segment grew customers and accounts organically in the quarter and use digital tools and capabilities to drive engagement even deeper and also to drive customer satisfaction to industry-leading levels. On Slide 16, we've highlighted some of the important elements of organic growth. I won't go through all the line items here, but, in consumer, we saw -- we opened 130,000 net new checking accounts, 1.3 million credit card accounts, and 9% more investment accounts, that aided to record quarter one consumer investment flows. Consumer also has now -- have -- has had 17 quarters of positive net new checking accounts. In global wealth, we had a record quarter, adding 14,500 net new wealth relationships. In global banking, we had our clients increase the number of products per relationship. In global markets, as we said earlier, Jim DeMare and team had one of the highest quarters of sales and trading. The other elements of earnings the management team remains focused on throughout this inflationary environment is our expense management efforts and -- but, even given those, we continue to make investments in the future. We continue to streak up operating leverage in our account and you can see that on Slide 17 -- in our company and you can see that on Slide 17. We now had seven quarters of operating leverage. The efficiency ratio went to 62%, and the nominal dollars of expenses we have today are similar to what we had 10 -- eight, nine, 10 years ago. As we go to Slide 18, let's talk about individual businesses, and consumer banking first. For the quarter, consumer banking earned 31 -- $3.1 billion on good organic revenue growth and delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of strong operating leverage, while we continue to invest in future. Top-line revenue grew 21%. Expenses rose 11%. These results demonstrate the true value of the $1 trillion deposit franchise and the deep relationship we have with the clients in that business. The business continues to have $700 billion in excess deposits over its loan balances. And, as we said earlier, we grew checking accounts $2.5 million -- 2.5 million new checking accounts, since the pandemic started. Solid earnings growth of 4% understates the success of this business as prior year included reserve releases, while we built reserves this quarter. On a pre-tax pre-provision basis PPNR grew 34% year-over-year. I'll also note that the revenue growth overcame a decline in service charges as a result of us lowering our NSFOD charges for customers several quarters ago. The expense in the consumers reflect the continued business investments for growth, including adding relationship associates, further develop increases in the cost of technology and implementation of new tools. As you think about this business, remember, much of the company's minimum wage hikes during 2022, the ones we made mid-year in addition to our March of $25 an hour, impact this business more than any other business. However, it has helped drive the attrition in this business in half compared to last year this quarter. On Slide 19, you can see some of the digital statistics around consumer. We believe that those digital tools, our customers have access to it, are the key to growing and retaining customer relationships. These tools also help us deliver more efficiently. We now have 45 million users actively engaged with our digital properties. They login 1 billion times a month. Erica, our artificial intelligence-driven personal assistant, saw usage rise 35% just in the past year. The number of our customers using Zelle grew 21% in the past year. Remember, these aren't new functionalities just being put in place, these are growing off a high scale and showed the Bank of America impact on these products. On Zelle, remember, back in mid-2021, Zelle transactions crossed the number of checks written for our clients. Now, at 60% higher, less than two years later. And you can see the growth in digital sales that continues. We remained focused on growing the customer base and delivering the best-in-class tools and service that make us more efficient and more important to our clients in the consumer business, and Dean Athanasia and team continue to do a good job with respect to those goals. On Slide 20, we move to wealth management. We had good results, earning about a little over $900 million after tax for the quarter. These results were down from last year, as Alastair said, as asset management fees fell with the negative market levels in equity and fixed income. Those fees were mitigated by the beneficial impact of revenue from the sizable banking business within this line of business for us. As I noted a moment ago, both Merrill and the Private Bank saw organic revenue growth and provided solid client flows at $25 billion in the quarter. Our assets under management flows of $15 billion reflects some of the movement in deposits noted earlier, but we also saw a $33 billion of brokerage flows. Expenses reflects lower revenue related incentives, but also reflects continued investments in the business as we continue to add financial advisors. We've added more than 650 wealth advisors in the past year alone. As we move forward, we are excited to have Eric Schimpf and Lindsay Hans lead this business. They work closely with Katy Knox to drive our global wealth and investment management business across the company. As we go to global wealth and investment management digital on Slide 21, you can see the statistics here. Just as with the consumer business, these clients become more and more digital engaged across time. Our advisors have led the way in driving a personal-driven advice model, supplemented by our digital tools. On Slide 21, you can see the client digital adoption rate of 84% with Merrill and the Private Bank is over 90%. More than 75% embrace digital delivery of their statements, which, as a key tool of their service, providing more convenience for them and our advisor. Erica and Zelle interactions continue to grow here also, even among these wealthy clients. On Slide 22, you see the global banking results. This business produced very strong results, growing revenue 19% year-to-year to $6.2 billion. The business earned $2.6 billion after tax. While investment banking remained sluggish, our global treasury services business has been robust, leading to strong revenue performance. Loan activity has been good across this business also. As noted earlier, the deposit flows appear to have stabilized in March and we benefitted from some customer flows during the flight to safety during the quarter. The company's overall investment banking fees were $1.2 billion in quarter one. And while down from quarter one '22, we saw a modest improvement from quarter four of '22. Provision expense declined year-over-year as prior year's reserve builds compared to release in the current period. Credit quality of this business, again, remains very strong. Expense increased 10% year-over-year, driven by strategic investments in the business, including relationship manager hiring and technology costs. Digital engagement, as shown on Slide 23, with our global banking customers. These commercial customers continue to grow in importance as treasuries and others appreciate the ease of doing business with us through these tools. While the volume of transactions in sheer numbers [aren't] (ph) the same as consumer, the volume of money moved is tremendous. Next business, we'll go towards our global markets business on Slide 24. Jim DeMare and the team had another strong quarter of results, growing year-over-year earnings to nearly $1.7 billion after tax. The continued themes of inflation due to political tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe drove volatility in the bond and equity markets, which his team did a good job of managing. As a result, this quarter, we saw a strong performance in our credit trading business, particularly in mortgages and muni trading and macro trading again fared well buoyed by strong client activity and secured financing. Investments made in this business over the last few years continued to produce favorable results. Just to focus on the sales and trading numbers alone, ex-DVA, revenue improved 9% year-over-year to $5.1 billion. FICC improved 29%, while equities were down 19% compared to quarter one of 2022. Year-over-year expense increased 8%, primarily driven by continued investments as stated in this business. Finally, on [Slide 5] (ph), you can see the all other shows a modest loss, which includes the $220 million losses in securities sold, as Alastair mentioned earlier. And last, I would note our 10% effective tax rate this quarter continues to benefit us from a strong business with clients, supporting environmental investments, in-housing investments to produce tax benefits. Excluding those and the other discrete tax benefits, our tax rate would have been 26%. So, in summary, a strong quarter by our team delivered for you, our shareholders, operating leverage, organic growth, strong credit, capital return, and strong ROTCE.

And we felt like, in particular, we could continue to grow our macro businesses, which we've done, and that's what has done a really good job until this quarter.

I think, Ken, we think this -- everybody thinks this as a big bulk thing, Bank of America, but it's really -- and then looks at broad categories of interest-bearing and non-interest bearing accounts and treasury. You have to really think about customer bases and what they do with their money. And so, there is transactional cash, whether that's for consumer running their household day-to-day or a wealthy consumer running their household day-to-day, which may have different level of expenses. And then, the commercial customers, who run their business day-to-day and then have excess cash from that if they are successful, and then how they all play that through. So I think -- we think, transactional cash and investment cash. You've seen a lot of investment cash as -- so to speak. As Alastair mentioned earlier, we price competitively for that, that moves around. But the good news is, we have a massive investment platform where we put that money to work for our customers if they don't need to manage their day-to-day household. So, in our NII estimates, our view of what happens in the future, I think, the key for the consumer business is to remember that, they've got $700 billion of excess deposits over its loans. It's generating a lot of excess deposits that grew $300-odd billion from pre-pandemic, it has been stable. The checking balances, if you look at those charts we gave you, they show you the near-term movement are stable. That generates at a total all-in cost of 10 basis points to 15 basis points, a lot of the value in our franchise, and meaning -- including interest-bearing part of that franchise when you think about deposits across time and in like businesses. So, you'd expect some of those trends to continue in terms of customers have excess cash, putting it to work differently. Here, we expect the deposit rates to move to continue to match the market. But the broad value of this deposit franchises driven by the money people leave us, because it's transactional cash, which is a motion, and we don't pay interest on, and that is both the consumers, wealthy customers and businesses. So, it's hard.

And the other question is just then, Alastair you walked through how you've been changing the composition of the securities portfolio and still benefiting from those variable rate swaps. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand what happens from here in terms of -- or should you continue to get benefits from those variable rate swaps?

So, Ken, think about -- I mean, the easiest way to think about those treasuries, they're swapped to floating, so they're essentially cash. And, actually, this quarter, we ended up converting some of them into cash, just because it's simpler, it's simpler for everyone to understand, and this is, obviously, a pretty good bid for treasuries this quarter. So, we just converted them into cash. That's what accounted for some of the securities loss there, it was a couple hundred million. But I think the way to think about it is, as the overall securities portfolio -- remember, we've got cash, we've got available-for-sale, you can always think about that as enhanced cash, and we've got hold-to-maturity, as that continues to pay down, we're just sweeping it right now into cash. That's something I've talked about in the last couple of quarters.

So, Erica, obviously, the basic concept was built for us a number of years -- four or five, six, seven years ago starting and came out -- came into the business. It is a predictive language type of program, where you put in question and then it answers it, but we had to do a special language to make sure it would work with our business, it wasn't a general. So, we did that. Then put us in a condition to start to deploy to our customers, because it's captive to our data, where it's just looking our systems, finding information and giving to clients is really a service capability. And what we've seen is that increase is a clear indicator of how valuable these types of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, predictive technologies can be for customer service and things like that. We've also taken Erica internally and applied it to help us do work and we've seen it have those benefits. Ultimately, we think this has extreme benefits for our company. We think it has a lot -- and you've seen this written about in the computer coding areas. In other words, it could speed up the process of what they used to be called object programing. That goes on. We think it has a lot to do in terms of allowing teammates to work much more quickly and efficiently with our systems and get information out and can make, even someone like me, the ability to do analytics, that I could -- I'd have to send to somebody and have them put, key it in the systems. So there's a lot of value to this. The key question will be, when can you use it without the fear of -- with the -- the reason why a lot of it stopped in our industry and other industries was, it wasn't clear how it worked. It was your data and the outside world's data and how it would interact and pull stuff out and we have to be careful with that. And then, secondly, we have to understand how the decisions are made, being able to stand up to the -- to our customers' demand for us to be fair and, frankly, follow the laws and rules and regulations on lending. So, I think, all that is good, strong -- it's really important thing. So, we're not a neophyte in this sense, actually operating out there, we understand the value of it, but we will carefully apply it and we see a great value. I don't think it's a great value in the next month, but in the overall sense, it will help us continue to manage the headcount down, which we've been doing this quarter. And, remember, we started this company -- management team started with this company in 2010 with 285,000 and 300,000 people working here and we're running the same size company with 216,000 people or bigger company doing more stuff and so all that's been aided by digitization of which is a potential step function change.",518.0,218.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.022935779816513763,0.01834862385321101,0.01834862385321101,0.009174311926605505,0.0,0.0045871559633027525

So, we aren't expecting -- we're expecting to get scale and operating leverage across activity taking less dollars to do it in the OpEx and the work we do. We had built-up more people, largely because the fear of last year of the turnover rate that is now gone in half in a year, requires us to be hiring a lot to stay ahead of it and then when it slowed down, we built-up people and we're bringing that back down in line. But there is no -- the expenses frankly are just managing the headcount carefully, because that's two-thirds of the expense base and getting more leverage out of the activities. But there's no -- yeah, we'll have more checking accounts, we will have more credit card accounts, we'll do more wires on a given day, we'll do more trades on a given day, and that can ebb and flow, but, overall, we're expecting activity continue to rise. Now, well, loan demand, i.e., people want to borrow another $10 versus the $10 ahead, that's what we say slows down.

So I think, in the end of the day, we don't see activity on the consumer side slowing at a pace that would indicate that, but we see, commercial customers are being more careful and things like that. But everything points to relatively mild recession, given the amount of stimulus that was put -- that was paid the people and the money they have leftover, the fact that unemployment is still at 3.5% -- full employment plus. And then the wage growth is slowing in tipping over, so the size of inflation are tipping down but, they're still there, but that translates into good -- relatively good activity.

I'm starting on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation. This morning, Bank of America reported one of the best quarters and one of the best first halves net income in the company's history. Our results this quarter once again include solid performance on things we can control by delivering organic growth and operating leverage. We did that in economy that remains healthy that had a slowing rate of growth. It was also a quarter that included volatility from the debate about the debt ceiling, continuation of central bank monetary tightening actions and a slowing in consumer spending and the slowing inflation. As you look at it now, our customer spending patterns now are more consistent with the pre-pandemic, lower growth, lower inflation economy. Before Alastair takes to details, let me summarize Bank of America's quarter two performance. On Slide 2, you can see the highlights. We earned $7.4 billion after tax, and grew earnings per share of 21% over the second quarter of 2022. All business segments performed well, and I want to thank all my teammates for doing so. We grew clients and accounts organically and at a strong pace. We delivered 8th straight quarter of operating leverage, led by 11% year-over-year revenue growth. We further strengthened our balance sheet, improving our common equity Tier 1 ratio more than 110 basis points year-over-year to 11.6%, and we have $867 billion in Global Liquidity Sources. We also produced strong returns for our shareholders with a return on tangible common equity of 15.5%, continuing a streak of many quarters at that level or above. While our business has performed well this quarter, I would particularly highlight our global markets and sales and trading team, and our investment banking teams. Both have appeared to outperform the industry peers, investments made over the past couple of years and global markets capabilities under Jim DeMare's leadership, as well as Matthew Koder's leadership in the global corporate investment banking area allowed us to improve our market shares for both of these people. I'd also note the strong contribution by our middle-market clients and our teammates there led by Wendy Stewart. I'd also like to touch a few additional points before turning the call over to Alastair. These points will help illustrate continued investment in the franchise and work we do to drive growth. Let's start with the organic growth slide on Page 3. On that page, we highlight some of the important elements of organic growth. You can see evidence in every business segment as you look at the page. In consumer, in quarter two, we opened 157,000 net new checking accounts. Consumers now had 18 straight quarters of positive net new checking account growth. Now these are core primary checking accounts across the board, allowing our tremendous deposit franchise to continue to prosper and take market share. While the progress here made pier inch meal over the last three years, we've grown our core customers in consumer checking account customers from 33 million to 36 million. We opened another one million-plus credit card accounts this quarter, and have 10% more investment accounts this year than we did last year in the consumer business. Consumer investment business balances reached a new high of $387 billion aided by a 30% increase in new funded consumer investment accounts year-over-year, and frankly moving our money from our depositors into the market as they have done so. In Global Wealth, we added 12,000 net new relationships in Merrill and the Private Bank, and our advisors open more than 36,000 new banking relationships in the quarter, showing a strong differentiation of our model of fulfilling both investment in banking these for clients. In the past 90 days, we added 190 experienced advisors to our salesforce in addition to digital capabilities to help us deliver at scale. In Global Banking, we added clients and increased number of solutions per relationship. Over the past three years, we've added net new relationship managers and increased our client facing headcount by nearly 10%. We've also improved our tools for prospect colleagues through investments in technology, and it's benefiting our ability to add customers and improve our solutions per existing clients. Year-to-date, we've added over 1,000 new commercial and business banking clients across the United States, which is the same number we added in the full year of last year. Again, operationalizing that ability to do this at scale increases our speed of onboarding these clients. In our global markets area, we saw one of the highest second quarter for sales and trading in our history, so another quarter of good organic growth. To achieve that growth, we are managing our expense trajectory, which Alastair is going to cover, requires inherent efficiency progress from digital and other applied technology across all our units. Digital superiority is key to our operating dynamics. First, it produces a great customer experience resulting strong customer retention and strong customer scores. Second, it ensures our position as a lead transactional bank for our customers, whether they are consumers, companies or investors. Third, it preserves a strong deposit balance as a good price and do the core nature of transactional deposits. And last, but importantly not least, efficiency. So, how we're doing on digital progress? You can see that on Slide 4, first with the consumer. In consumer, we now have 46 million active users that are digitally engaged with our digital platform and are logging over 1 billion times a month. And even with this scale, the stage of maturity logins is up double digits from last year. Customer uses of Erica continues to be at expectations. This was an early application of natural language processing and artificial intelligence that we built in our company, and it continues to learn about with additional use. Interactions with Erica rose 35% in just the past year, and now it's crossed over 1.5 billion client interactions in the first five years of introduction. There's a lot of questions about our artificial intelligence out there, but one [indiscernible] together a series of systems. We have to build a system and it's highly regulated, high customer-focused business, and Erica is one such application you can see its impact. Likewise, Zelle hasn't slowed down either. The number of people using Zelle grew 19% this past year. Remember, these aren't new functionalities at this point, they've been around for years, but they continue to grow very strong growth rates, showing customer desire and acceptance of the activities. You can see the digital sales continue to growth. We continue to have both great high-tech and high-touch options. As part of that, we've added 310 new financial centers since 2019, and by the end of this year, we have refurbished every one of our existing centers in our company. We plan on opening 50 more centers a year for the next few years, which included an expansion in nine new markets we announced a few years ago - a few weeks ago, excuse me Our entrance into these markets is enhanced by digital and leads to strong early success. Just to give you a point of reference, for all the expansion markets over the last several years for branches opened a year or more in those expansion markets, our average deposit balances per those branch are $160 million in each branch. You go to the wealth management digital on Slide 5, you can see that they continue to be the most digitally engaged clients in our company. Our advisors have led the way in driving a personal driven advice model, supplemented by our digital tools. You can see the client adoption rate of 82% in Merrill and 92% in the private bank, 78% have embraced digital delivery as a tool service providing more convenience for them and our advisors. Erica and Zelle also continue expanding these client sets. A new program we announced just a few quarters ago has generated 20,000 digital leads to 7,000 advisors, it's called Advisor Match, matching our clients with advisors of their choice. On Slide 6, you can see the digital engagement of global banking area. Corporate treasury teams and our clients appreciate the ease of doing business with us digitally. CashPro App sign-ins are up nearly 60% from last year, where the value of payments through CashPro App are up 20%. As you can see, every line of business is delivering strong organic growth. Investments made in technology have enabled us to grow industry leading positions in digital tools, while enabling our clients to do great things and making us more efficient. This provides for a very satisfied, stable customer and client base with Bank of America's primary provider. And by doing with a digital application, that also produces operating leverage. On Slide 7, you can see our streak of operating leverage continued in the second quarter of 2023. We're now back in eight quarters in a row. The chart on Slide 7 covers the 8.5 years at 34 quarters, and all but eight of those quarters and you can see those identified. Six of which were in the heart of the pandemic, we've achieved operating leverage. Operating leverage is that simple task of growing revenue at a better growth rate and expense. As I said, Alastair's is going to discuss with you our good and declining expansion trajectory which sets us up to continue to provide operating leverage, even with the shift in economy. In sum, in the quarter, we delivered earnings that are 19% higher and a 15% return on tangible common equity that was driven by continued strong organic growth and operating leverage in a volatile economic environment. Alastair is going to talk to you about a bit more strength we see ahead in our net interest income for the balance of the year and that provides a better start as we think about 2024. You're going hear our expectations for the quarterly decline expenses in the following quarters for the rest of '23, even as we keep investing, and you hear about the resilience of credit and strong trajectory in capital, this all positions us well to continue both our streaks of organic growth and operating leverage. With that, let me turn it over to Alastair.",1710.0,904.0,48.0,10.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,9.0,0.05309734513274336,0.011061946902654867,0.0055309734513274336,0.0011061946902654867,0.0011061946902654867,0.0420353982300885

And on Slide 8, we list the more detailed highlights of the quarter, and then Slide 9 presents a summary income statement, so I'm going to refer to both of those. For the quarter, we generated $7.4 billion in net income, and that resulted in $0.88 per diluted share. A year-over-year revenue growth of 11% was led by a 14% improvement in net interest income, coupled with a strong 10% increase in sales and trading results ex-DVA. Revenue was strong, and it included a few headwinds, and I thought I'd go through those headwinds first. We had lower service charges from both higher earnings credit rates on deposits for commercial clients, and the policy changes we announced in late 2021 to lower our insufficient funds and overdraft fees for our consumer customers. The good news on the consumer piece is year-over-year comparisons get a bit easier starting next quarter, as the third quarter of '22 reflects the full first quarter of these changes. Second, we had lower asset management and brokerage fees as a result of the lower equity and fixed income market levels, and market uncertainty that impacted transactional volumes compared to a year ago quarter. Third, we have a net DVA loss of $102 million this quarter compared to a gain in DVA of $158 million in the second quarter a year ago. We also recorded roughly $200 million in securities losses as we closed out some available for sale security positions and their related hedges, and we put the proceeds and cash. Lastly, and just as a reminder, our tax-rate benefits from ESG investments, and those are somewhat offset by operating losses on the ESG investments which show up in other income. So, this quarter, our tax-rate is a little bit lower and the operating losses are a little bit higher from volume of these deals. So you have to be careful in analyzing the lower tax-rate without considering the operating losses, and that in-turn often offsets what would have been higher revenue elsewhere. Our tax-rate for the full year is expected to benefit by 15% as a result of the ESG investment tax credit deals, and absent of these credits, our effective tax-rate would still be roughly 25%, and we continue to expect a tax-rate of 10% to 11% for the rest of 2023. Expense for the quarter of $16 billion included roughly $276 million in litigation expense which was pushed higher this quarter by the agreements announced last week with the OCC and the CFPB on consumer matters. Asset quality remains solid and provision expense for the quarter was $1.1 billion consisting of $869 million in net charge-offs and $256 million in reserve built. The provision expense reflects the continued trend in charge-offs towards pre-pandemic levels, and it is still below historical levels. The charge-off rate was 33 basis points, and that's only 1 basis point higher than the first quarter and still remains well below the 39 basis points we last saw in Q4 of 2019, when remember, 2019 was a multi-decade low. I'd also use Slide 9 just to highlight returns, and you can see we generated 15.5% return on tangible common equity and 94 basis points return on assets. Let's turn to the balance sheet starting with Slide 10, and you can see our balance sheet ended the quarter at $3.1 trillion, declining $72 billion from the first quarter. A $33 billion or 1.7% reduction in deposits closely matched a $41 billion decline in securities balances through paydowns from the hold to maturity and sales of available for sale securities. Securities are now down $177 billion from a quarter to '22. Cash levels remained high at $374 billion and loans grew $5 billion. As Brian noted, our liquidity remains strong with $867 billion of liquidity, up modestly from the first quarter of '23, and still remains nearly $300 billion above our pre-pandemic fourth quarter '19 level. Shareholders' equity increased $3 billion from the first quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders. AOCI decreased by $2 billion, driven by derivatives valuation and AFS securities values were little changed. So, there is little change in the AOCI component that impacts regulatory capital. Tangible book-value is up 10% per share year-over-year. During the quarter, we also paid out $1.8 billion in common dividends, and we bought back $550 million in shares to offset our employee awards. And last week, we announced the intent to increase our dividend by 9%, beginning in the third quarter. Turning to regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $190 billion from March 31st, and the ratio of CET1 improved more than 20 basis points to 11.6%, once again, adding to the buffer over our 10.4% current requirement. While our risk-weighted assets increased modestly in the quarter. Also noteworthy, on July 3rd, we initiated dialog with the Fed to better understand our CCAR exam results, and we remain in discussions today with no news to update as of now. In the past 12 months, we've improved our CET1 ratio by more than 110 basis points, and we've done that while supporting claims for loan demand and returned $11.3 billion in dividends and share repurchases to shareholders. A supplemental leverage ratio was 6% versus our minimum requirement of 5%, and that leaves us plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. Finally, the TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. So, let's now focus on loans by looking at average balances, you can see those on Slide 11, and there you can see, average loans grew 3% year-over-year. The drivers of loan growth are much the same. Consumer credit card growth is strong, and then commercial loans grew 4%. The credit card growth reflects increased marketing, enhanced offers and higher levels of account openings over time. And in commercial, we saw a little bit of a slowdown this quarter, driven by higher paydowns from borrowers and weaker customer demand as opposed to any credit availability from us. We are still open for business for loans. While loan growth has slowed, it's generally remained still ahead of GDP and commercial client conversations remain solid as our clients seem to be waiting for some of the economic uncertainty to lift before borrowing further. Slide 12 shows the breakout of deposit trends that's on a weekly ending basis across the last two quarters, and it's the same chart that we provided last quarter. In the upper left, you see the trend of total deposits. We ended the second quarter at $1.88 trillion, down 1.7% with several elements of our deposits seeming to find stability. Given the normal tax seasonality impacts on deposit balances in Q2 and the monetary policy actions, we believe this is a good result. I want to use the other three charts on the page to illustrate the different trends across the last quarter, and more specifically in each line-of-business. In consumer, looking at the top right chart, you see the difference in the movement through the quarter between the balances of low to no interest checking accounts and the higher-yielding non-checking accounts. Here you can also see the low levels of our more rate-sensitive balances in consumer investments and CD balances. And they're both broken out here. In total, we've got still more than $1 trillion in high quality consumer deposits, which remains $274 billion, above pre-pandemic levels. In the second quarter that decline in consumer deposits was driven by higher debt payments, higher spend and seasonal tax activity. And some non-checking balances that rotated from deposits into brokerage accounts. We did see some competitive pressure this quarter within about roughly $40 billion of CD's, as some of the financial institutions pushed prices higher. And at this point with deposits, far exceeding our loans we've not yet felt the need to chase deposits with rate. Broadly speaking, average deposit balances of our consumers remain at multiples of their pre-pandemic level, especially in the lower end of our customer base. Total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter rose to 22 basis points, and remains low relative to Fed funds driven by the high mix of quality transactional accounts. Most of this quarter's 10 basis point rate increase remains concentrated in those CD's and consumer investment deposits and together, those represent only 11% of our consumer deposits. Turning to Wealth Management. This business is also impacted by tax payments and normally shows the most relative rate movement because these clients tend to have the most excess cash. The previous quarters trend of clients moving money from lower-yielding sweep accounts into higher-yielding preferred deposits. And moving off-balance sheet on to other parts of the platform seem to stabilize this quarter, and our sweep balances were more modestly down $72 billion. At the bottom right, note the global banking deposits stability. We ended the second quarter at $493 billion down $3 billion from the first quarter. We've now been in this $490 billion to $500 billion range for the past several quarters. And these are generally the transactional deposits of our commercial customers that they use to manage their cash flows. And while the overall balances have been stable, we've continued to see shift towards interest-bearing as the Fed raised rates one more time during the quarter before pausing in June. Non-interest-bearing deposits were 40% of their deposits at the end of the quarter. Focusing for a moment, on average deposits using Slide 13, I really only have one additional point to make. While you've seen the modest downtick in deposits for the past several quarters, as the Fed has removed some accommodation, we just want to note that deposits remain 33% above the fourth quarter 2019 pre-pandemic period. And as you look at the page every segment relative to pre-pandemic is up at least 15%, consumer is up 40%, consumer checking is up more than 50%, and as noted global banking has been right around $500 billion for the past five quarters, and it remains 31%, above pre-pandemic. So let's move to Slide 14. And we'll continue the conversation that we began last quarter around management of excess deposits above loans. In the top left, note the balances in the second-quarter of each year since the pandemic began. The excess of deposits needed to fund loans increased from $500 billion pre-pandemic to a peak of $1.1 trillion in the fall of 2021. And as you can see it remains high at the end of June at $826 billion. In the top right, note that the amount of cash and securities held has increased across time, in-line with the excess deposit trend. And you will also note the mix shift over time. This excess of deposits over loans has been held in a balanced manner across the period shown with roughly 50% fixed longer dated held-to-maturity securities and the rest has been held in shorter dated available-for-sale securities and cash. Cash and the shorter day-to-day FS securities combined was $516 billion at the end of the quarter. And cash of $375 billion is more than twice what we held pre-pandemic and you should expect to see that come down over time. We made these investments, given the mix and transactional nature of our customers deposits, particularly given the excess deposits built. Note also in the bottom left chart, the combined cash and securities yields continue to expand this quarter and remain meaningfully wider than the overall deposit rate paid that's a result of two things. Securities book has seen a steady decline since the fall of 2021, when we stopped adding to it. With less loan funding needs, proceeds from security pay-downs have been deployed into higher-yielding cash and through this action, and the increased cash rates, the combined cash and securities yield has risen further and faster than deposit rates. Deposits at the end of the quarter were paying 124 basis points while our blend of cash and securities has increased to 319 basis points. So, over the past year the deposit cost has risen by 118 basis points, and the cash and securities yield has improved by 164 basis points. And as a reminder, this slide focuses on the banking book because our global markets balance sheet has remained largely market funded. Finally, one very last - one last very important point that I want to make is on the improved NII of our banking book. The NII excluding global markets which we disclose each quarter troughed in the third quarter of 2020 at $9.1 billion, and that compares to $14 billion in the second quarter of 2023, so almost $5 billion higher on a quarter basis, $20 billion per year. That's led to a stronger capital position even as we returned capital to shareholders and supplied capital to our customers in the form of loans and other financing capital. And then more specifically on the hold-to-maturity book, the balance of that portfolio declined again $10 billion from the first quarter, it's down $69 billion since we stopped adding to the book in the third quarter of '21. The market valuation on our hold-to-maturity book, which is in a negative position, worsened $7 billion since March 31, 2023, driven by a 54 basis point increase in mortgage rates. The OCI impact from the valuation of our hedged AFS book modestly improved this quarter. Let's turn to Slide 15, and we can focus on net interest income. On a GAAP or non-FTE basis, NII in the second quarter was $14.2 billion, and the fully tax equivalent NII number was $14.3 billion. So, I'm going to focus on that fully tax equivalent. Here NII increased $1.7 billion from the second quarter of '22 or 14%, while our net interest yield improved 20 basis points to 2.06%. This improvement has been driven by rates which includes securities premium amortization, partially offset by global markets activity, and $137 billion of lower average deposit balances. Average loan growth during the period of $32 billion also aided the year-over-year NII improvement. Turning to a linked quarter discussion, NII of $14.3 billion is down $289 million or 2% from the first quarter, and that's driven primarily by the continued impact of lower deposit balances and mix shift into interest bearing, partially offset by one additional day of interest in the period. Global markets NII increased during the quarter. The net interest yield fell 14 basis points in the quarter, driven by a larger average balance sheet due to the cash positioning we chose and some higher funding costs. This quarter's compression, we believe, was just a little anomalous, driven by our decision late first quarter to position the balance sheet around higher cash levels. Turning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield curve basis, the plus 100 basis point parallel shift at June 30 was unchanged from March 31, '23, at $3.3 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months in our banking book, and that assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline forecast, and 95% of the sensitivity remains driven by short rates. A 100 basis point down-rate scenario was unchanged at negative $3.6 billion. Let me give you a few thoughts on NII as we look forward. We still believe NII for the full year will be a little above $57 billion, which would be up more than 8% from full year 2022, and this could include third quarter at approximately the same level as second quarter, so think $14.2 billion, $14.3 billion. And then fourth quarter, somewhere around $14 billion. That's a slightly better viewpoint than we had last quarter for the third and fourth quarter, with a little more stability closer to the second quarter level, and therefore provides a better start point for 2024. So, let's talk through the caveats around our NII comments. First, it assumes that interest rates in the forward curve materialized, and an expectation of modest loan growth driven by credit card. On deposits, we are expecting modestly lower balances led by consumer, and we expect continued modest deposit mix shifts from global banking deposits into interest bearing. The past few months have provided us a little more positive outlook around NII, given the apparent stabilization of some elements of deposits as well as better pricing, and now we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. Okay, let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 16 for that discussion. Second quarter expenses were $16 billion, that was down $200 million from the first quarter. And as I mentioned, the second quarter included $276 million of litigation expense. In addition, we also saw a little higher revenue related expense driven by our sales and trading results. Those higher costs were more than offset by the absence of the first quarter seasonal elevation of payroll taxes and savings from a reduction in overall full-time headcount. Now, excluding the 2,500 or so summer interns that we welcomed into our offices over the summer months, our full-time head count was down roughly 4,000 from the first quarter start point to 213,000. That's some good work after peaking at 218,000 in January. Our summer interns will leave us in the third quarter, and hopefully many will return as full-time associates next summer. And at the same time in Q3, we welcomed back about 2,600 new full-time hires as college grads, many of whom interned with us last summer. And that's a very diverse class of associates who are excited to join the company. As we look forward to next quarter, we would expect the third quarter expense to more fully benefit from the second quarter head count reduction, even as we remain in a mode of modest hiring for client-facing positions. Additionally, the proposed notice of special assessment from the FDIC to recover losses from the failures of Silicon Valley and signature banks could add $1.9 billion expense for us, $1.5 billion after tax, and we just remain unsure at this point of timing to record that expense. Let's now move to credit, and we'll turn to Slide 17. Net charge-offs of $869 million increased $62 million from the first quarter, and the increase was driven by credit card losses as higher late-stage delinquencies flowed through to charge-offs. For context, the credit card net charge-off rate was 2.6% in Q2, and remains well below the 3.03% pre-pandemic rate in the fourth quarter of '19. Provision expense was $1.1 billion in Q2, and that included a $256 million further reserve build, that's driven by loan growth, particularly in credit card, and it reflects a macroeconomic outlook that on a weighted basis continues to include an unemployment rate that rises to north of 5% in 2024. On Slide 18, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. On consumer, we note we continue to see asset quality metrics come off the bottom, and they remain below historical averages. Overall commercial net charge-offs were flat from first quarter. And within commercial we saw a decrease in C&I losses that was offset by an increase in charge-offs related to commercial real estate office exposures. As a reminder, commercial real estate office credit exposure represents less than 2% of our total loans, and this is an area where we've been quite intentional around our client selection, portfolio concentration, and deal structure over many years, and as a result, we've seen NPLs and realized losses that are quite low for this portfolio. In the second quarter we experienced $70 million in charge-offs on office exposure, to write down a handful of properties where the LTV has deteriorated. Our charge-offs on office exposures were $15 million in the first quarter. We pulled forward some of the office portfolio stats provided last quarter in a slide in our appendix for you. Now, we continue to believe that the portfolio is well positioned and adequately reserved against the current conditions. Moving to the various lines of business and their results, starting on Slide 19 with consumer banking, for the quarter, consumer earned $2.9 billion on good organic revenue growth and delivered its 9th consecutive quarter of strong operating leverage, while we continue to invest in our future. Note that top-line revenue grew 15% while expense rose 10%. These segment results include the bulk of the impact of the costs of the regulator agreements from last week. While reported earnings were strong in both periods at $2.9 billion, it understates the success of the business because the prior year included reserve leases while we built reserves this quarter for card growth. EPNR grew 21% year-over-year even with the added cost of the agreements. And the revenue growth overcame a decline in service charges that I noted earlier. Much of this success is driven by the pace of organic growth of checking and card accounts as well as investment accounts and balances, as Brian noted earlier In addition to the litigation noted, expense reflects the continued business investments for growth, and as you think about this business, remember much of the company's minimum wage hikes and the mid-year increased salary in wage moves in 2022 impact consumer banking the most, and that, therefore, impacts the year-over-year comparisons. Moving to wealth management on Slide 20, we produced good results earning a little less than $1 billion. These results were down from last year as asset management and brokerage fees felt the negative impact of lower equity, lower fixed income markets, and some market uncertainty, impacting transactional volume. Those fees were complemented by the revenue from a sizeable banking business, and that remains an advantage for us. As Brian noted earlier, both Merrill and the private bank continued to see strong organic growth and produce solid client flows of $83 billion since the third - since the second quarter '22. Our assets under management flows of $14 billion reflect a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting money to work. Expenses reflect lower revenue-related incentives and also reflect continued investments in the business as we add financial advisers. On Slide 21, you see the global banking results, and this business produced very strong results with earnings of $2.7 billion, driven by 29% growth in revenue to $6.5 billion. Coupled with good expense management, this business produced strong operating leverage. Our global transaction services business has been robust. We've also seen a higher volume of solar and wind investment projects this quarter, and our investment banking business is performing well in a sluggish environment. Year-over-year revenue growth also benefited from the absence of marks taken on leveraged loans in the prior-year period. We saw modest loan growth on average year-over-year and link quarter, the utilization rates declined, and more generally, we saw lower levels of demand. As we noted earlier, the deposit flows have stabilized in the $490 billion to $500 billion range over the past several quarters, reflecting the benefits of our strong client relationships. The company's overall investment banking fees were $1.2 billion in the second quarter, growing 7% over the prior year and 4% linked quarter, a good performance in a sluggish environment that saw fee pools down 20% year-over-year. Provision expense declined year-over-year as we built more reserve in the prior year. Expense was held relatively flat year-over-year even as we drove strategic investments in the business, including a relationship management hiring and technology costs, and additionally comparisons benefit from the absence of elevated expense for some regulatory matters in the second quarter of '22. Switching to global markets on Slide 22, we had another strong quarter with earnings growing to $1.2 billion driven by revenue growth of 14% and I'm referring to results excluding DVA as we normally do. The continued themes of inflation, geopolitical tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe. Along with this quarter's debt ceiling concerns, continued to impact both the bond and equity markets. As a result, it was a quarter where we saw a strong performance in both our macro and micro trading businesses. The investments made in the business over the past two years continued to produce favorable results. Year-over-year revenue growth benefited from strong sales and trading results and the absence of marks on leverage finance positions last year. Focusing on-sales and trading ex-DVA revenue improved 10% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. FICC improved 18% while equities was down 2% compared to the second quarter of '22. Year-over-year expense increased 8%, primarily driven by investments in the business and revenue-related costs, partially offset by the absence of regulatory matters in the second quarter of '22. Finally on Slide 23, all other shows a loss of $182 million. Revenue included a $197 million of losses on securities sales and increased volume of solar and wind investment operating losses that create the tax credits for the company. As a result of the increased solar and wind tax deal volume, and their associated related operating losses our effective tax-rate in the quarter was lower at 8%, but excluding ESG and any other discrete tax benefits our tax-rate would have been 26%. So with that, let's stop there and we'll open it up for Q&A.",4154.0,2298.0,57.0,54.0,29.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,17.0,0.024804177545691905,0.02349869451697128,0.012619669277632724,0.0039164490861618795,0.0013054830287206266,0.0013054830287206266

Brian, can you give us a view from your standpoint of the - and the new proposal I should say new but the speech by Vice-Chair Barr about the likelihood of capital ratios going up for large banks, like your own and then second, there was a report today, Bloomberg that the capital requirements for holding residential mortgages may go up meaningfully.

And I think there has been a desire to finish up the Basel 3 those rules will come out we think in a few weeks, and like anything else, we'll deal with and we have 11.6% CET1 ratio. Our requirements currently at 10.4% and so we got plenty of capital, and it's built up. So I think from a global competitive standpoint, we've got to be careful here, because the U.S. industry is the best industry in the world and actually does a lot of good for all the countries, including the U.S. and, and frankly the rules applied tend to be more favorable to those outside our country. As we got to be careful to maintain a competitive parity, but in the end of the day, Gerard, you need to finish this and get this behind us and the industry will adopt and move forward and, but they've got to think through the downside of some of these rules and that they could push up outside the industry to non-banks that have the asset classes across the board and non-banks, including mortgage-lending which you referenced, half of it goes through non-banks. And those the resilience those institutions, it's interesting to watch recycles. And then the second thing have to worry about competitiveness overall. But and then also just slowing down economy, 10% increase in our capital levels, would this enable us for making about $150 billion of loans at the margin, and you want our banks to support the economy like we do.

I think you said 100 basis point increase, it wouldn't lead to over $3 billion in net interest revenue growth over the next 12 months. And 100 basis point decrease would lead to a decline of just over $3 billion in revenue.

We've talked about the fact that for us, it's this idea of balance that's key. And if you look at our disclosures around interest-rate risk over the course of the past couple of years, you'll see it's more balanced both upside and downside and it's a narrower corridor over time. So we're trying to sustain NII at a higher level for longer, that's what we're trying to engineer. So, I think going-forward, there won't be a lot of change to our philosophy in that regard. We feel like we're in a pretty good position in terms of balance, will be tweaking at the margin. But what will largely drive things from here is just normalization of deposits and good old fashioned loan growth.",147.0,68.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.014705882352941176,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353

I heard all the reasons why a lot of investment, FDIC charges coming, but I just wanted to make sure did anything change over the last like decade or so, you've been basically flat for life?

So, Glenn, I think Alastair gave you a trajectory which if you look at it from fourth quarter last year to the fourth quarter this year, it gets you relatively flat year-over-year, and as your revenues flatten out because interest-rate movements flatten out, you'll see that as we decline in the quarters, that'll be strong. So, as we think about it - as we think about the forward, we think about the ability to control headcount and have expenses continue to come down, but they're going to stay at a level that's relatively consistent where we are now over time, and the goal is then to grow revenue faster than expense. We've been doing it for many decades, you can see that in our data. And - but the way we do it differs from five years ago to 10 years ago to last year, and that the ability to move the branch configuration around when we had 6,000 branches down to 4,000, or 3,900, 3,800, now it is different from 3,800 to where it might end up. And so, you should expect us to continue to engineer by applying massive amounts of technology. Erica saves a lot of transactional activity, Zelle saves a lot of transactional activity deposits by mobile phone saves a lot of activity. All that goes on, and then what we're offsetting with that is from the decade you talk about we probably went from $2.5 billion of technology initiatives a year to $3.8 billion, and we went - we have a lot more revenue that is compensated for, thinking about in the wealth management business, and those are things we fight all the time. So, we expect to manage expenses in-line with revenue. As we got to '19, we told you that we're going to have to start growing expenses at a modest growth rate relative to the revenue growth rate will outgrow the economy on revenue expense and grow a couple 100 basis points lower, it kind of going to be back in that mode frankly, it just with inflation they kicked up and now we have flattened them back out, and then we'll get back in sync as we move to '24 and beyond.",370.0,159.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.006289308176100629,0.006289308176100629,0.018867924528301886,0.0,0.0,0.0

We put up 16.2 in the first quarter, we were 16-ish this quarter obviously. We kind of feel like next quarter just with all the work that we've done around headcount and getting the firm in the place that we want now, we feel like we are well positioned to deliver 15.8 this quarter. If and when we keep going, we think we're going to be somewhere around 15.6 or so in Q4. So, to Brian's point, number one, we like the trajectory now. We've shaped the headcount over time to get to the place where we want to be.

So, I don't think consensus has you, with a [positive outcome] over the third and fourth quarter, and I just want to make sure I heard you correctly, Brian, in your opening remark, is you expect that eight quarter of consecutive positive operating leverage to continue, so you expect nine quarters or ten quarters or as long as you can, and, you know, the one reason is you'll see NII headwinds, you said it should be kind of flattish in the third quarter and then down some in the fourth quarter, and you said the commercial loan demand is a little bit less and utilization is less. And you did just give some specific expense numbers and maybe I guess the specific question is how long these sectors [indiscernible] quarter slides are we done with that expect that to go.

And Mike, you point out that the toughest times when you have sort of a twist in the interest-rate environment and you can see that at the end of '19 and we got right back into it right after the environment stabilize, but just thinking about the question you asked me a few years ago Mike was - when NII is coming in are going to let it fall the bottom-line, you going to spend it at about 80% plus of it is falling to the bottom-line, which shows you how we position the franchise from the second quarter of '21 until now as we went through the interest-rate - the fast interest-rate raising. So we gave you the specific as you said, the specific expense guidance by quarter. We'd expect that should produce operating leverage that will be it gets tougher and then it will get easier as we start to see the stabilization of deposits and loans and loan growth, you sort of routinely come through in the economy frankly, shaking through whether we're going to have a recession or not. And so we feel good about what we've done, that's why I tried to give that longer period of time that people have the context, it's very different environments how you've achieved at sometimes revenue fell and expense fell faster, sometimes revenue grew and expense grew, but slower and all the different ways.

We think about what do they have cashless for that, cash transact and to have cash-in-excess of that. And what happens is, depending on the customer segment that cash moves to the market that excess cash moves the market. But the transactional cash is all with us, that transactional cash far exceeds for us our loan balances. So we have excess transactional cash, in a lot of it is low-interest checking, no interest checking, even if it's a money markets that sort of cushion that you have consumers as a wealthy people, while the consumers and an average consumers maintain to pay their bills and unexpected expenses. So that's what you've seen in that producers, the cost to deposits of $1.24, which is far different than we see other people have and that that's just happens. In other questions how much moves and as Alastair said earlier, we're after tax time now where we have a big wealth management pay-out to the - to tap into the taxes. We also passed the point where people have way passed the point last payments where people will have to that money has been and accounts and still is in their accounts to a large degree as we look at them and they're paying that down slowly. So the average balance in our checking accounts has gone from a high of 11,000, the peak the 10,600 and 10,500 something like that. So all that dynamic, but you got to go back and say, it's the mix of interest-bearing and non-interest bearing is actually a little bit of a misnomer because it's really what the customer uses it the cash for, and they use it to transact and run their household. That's a very stable base and that's what this data shows across time and it's fundamentally a lot higher than pre-pandemic, so consumer $700 billion pre-pandemic $1 trillion now. Checking that if you look on the pages in the deposit descriptions, you'll see those numbers are Page 13, I think it is, those numbers will show you how much is stayed in checking, that's because we have more customers, but more importantly, the average consumer through inflation stuff has more money around.

I mean, in the past, when you had the record number of consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage, it seemed like it was being driven primarily [technical difficulty] a lot of inputs, but 1 of the big drivers was consolidation of branches. And now it's an investment spend environment in branches. So I'm just wondering if there is - if you would agree with that. And if there's a different way that you're going to be delivering this positive operating leverage as you're increasing investment spend in one of the core platforms of the company.",113.0,52.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It's been gotten by different ways in different periods of time. But even in the last year, the numbers of branches, I think dropped about from 3,900 to 3,800 and change. And so even as we deployed new ones. And so you're consolidating branches in markets you've been in a long time with lots of branches. The ATM count continues to drift down. But importantly, if you go to the digital pages and look at the activity levels by customers - and you're speaking mostly the consumer business, but affects all customer bases. And you see things like Zelle transactions far exceeding checks. Remember that - what that means is that we don't have to process a check on the back end of that. And so, and then your process it, push it through. So all that continues to grow very quickly and continues to change the overall operating costs in our consumer business. Our cost of operating plus the cost of pays and deposits is still 130-odd basis points or whatever, it's very strong. If you go where the big moves are coming as what we're doing in the markets business, for example, in terms of deeper, deeper digitization, it was always - equity trading was already digitized, but the operational process behind that the throughput of the amount of stuff that's going straight through. And then what's behind that also on the wealth management to customers getting their statements and statements not being delivered to customers' home, but delivered that kind is of $0.5 billion annual benefit that's accumulated over time. And so if there were some magic thing you could pull, you'd pull it, but these are a whole bunch of operational excellence ideas, it seems [indiscernible] to the general public, but it just is a constant improvement of the platform, allows us to constantly manage people down as a percentage of work done by people always comes down. And then now with artificial intelligence and all enthusiasm, we decided that's in the future, the way we've applied it so far has enabled us to do things like our business bankers are more efficient at culling because we use artificial intelligence and programs to tell them which prospects they go to, not to tell - they know their clients and they run it, but which prospects they should approach first so they're more efficient or the adviser match, which has an intelligence base built into it to match a client to an adviser that's - you saw the statistics about the number of leads, 20,000 leads. All this is adding efficiency. So yes, the brand system has got - it's come down a slope and that slope is starting to flatten out. But in that slope is a massive reinvestment in rehabs and a massive opening.

On the net interest income trajectory, Alastair, clearly a big focus for your shareholders. You mentioned when you were responding to Gerard's first question that you narrowed the volatility of net interest income. And I think that investors I'm sure are going to start asking you guys and us about the starting point of $14 billion for NII next year. I guess we're wondering, if the Fed stays higher for longer, doesn't move, how does that impact that $14 billion run rate? Does that $14 billion capture a cumulative deposit beta that would sort of fully reflect what you would expect to experience through the cycle?

How much of that - given that you have exposure to the shape of the curve, not just the short end of the curve because of your securities book, how much of that is short rates versus long rates in terms of that drop? I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, if I simply divide $3 billion by 4, right, that would get me a run rate of $13.25 billion on a quarterly basis.

And I guess where I get to is certainly, you're signaling that trend should be good for revenue versus expense or at least you're trying to have that. But I still look at the efficiency ratio of expenses to revenues of 64% or 62%, and then you compare that to the levels from 2018 and 2019 when it was 57% and 58%. So I guess the question is, you've got all these digital initiatives and progress - and again, I appreciate the disclosure on these slides but it would be great to have more of your peers disclose that, all that progress.

The efficiency ratio for us is as a plain element, which is the wealth management business is a big part of our revenue base and has a different operating dynamic because of how it's reported. As you well know, that the revenue has the cost of compensation as a percent of revenue is high. And we basically make 50 cents on the dollar for every dollar past the revenue takeout, which - the adviser compensation level. And we're continuing to try to improve that and make the adviser more efficient and things like that, but that's a major change. We improved year-over-year. And frankly, we're still cleaning out some pandemic-related costs and things like that. So we'll continue to drive that down. And as net interest income has come up and more important part of the business that helps push that efficiency ratio back down. And that's the goal. I mean, you're describing what we go to work and do every day. And the way we do it is - the application of technology across the board. And then removing work in the system and bringing that out and bringing it to the bottom line and then making the investments we did to make it happen again. So we'll continue to do that.

So if you think about from '19 to now, Mike, remember, the number of customers who do their core checking list is up 10%. So it's not a - and that is a lot of people. It's 3 million more customers doing 20, 30 transactions a month, and all that's going through on a relatively flat expense base. And we've been - we've had - with inflation and wages and things, we've absorbed all that as part of the thing, and that's why the costs have changed. But the reality is we flatten that back out, and then we'll keep driving it back down. And that - if you look at the cost of deposits, which is the cost of running all that as a percentage of deposits, you can see that on the consumer page, it still maintains a nice break against the rate they would receive for the deposit balances. So we're working at it. Simply put, we had 100,000 people in the consumer business a decade-plus ago. We now have 16 going - and it comes down a little bit every quarter. Even though we're putting new branches with an average of 5 to 10 people and depending on the location and things like that going on. And so that just keeps going in the right direction. Now if you take that across other things, in our operations group, the team there continues to have flat headcount, down headcount, and we invest that back in the technology side for more developers, 20-odd thousand on our payroll plus another 10,000 or 15,000 of third parties that go through, frankly, the top lines.

Our third quarter here at Bank of America was another strong quarter as we delivered $7.8 billion in net income. That is a 10% growth over the year-ago third quarter. And for the first nine months of the year, we have earned $23.4 billion, an increase of 15% over 2022. We grew clients and accounts organically and at a strong pace across all our businesses. Our operating leverage was about flat. We improved our common equity Tier 1 ratio by nearly 30 basis points in the quarter to a level of 11.9% against a current minimum of 9.5%. We saw an increase in our deposits and we maintained our strong pricing discipline. We continue to maintain $859 billion in global liquidity sources. We also deliver a good return for you, our shareholders, with a return on tangible common equity of over 15% and a 1% return on assets. Just a quick note of what we see in the economy. Our team of economists predicts a soft landing with a trough in the middle of next year. We see that in our customer data, our 37 million checking customers, we see their spending slowing down. You can see that on Slide 34. The third quarter was up about 4% over last year's third quarter. Earlier this year, that would have been more of a 10% increase year-over-year. And for the entire year of 2022, it increased 10% [round numbers over ‘21] (ph). This 4% level is consistent with the spending we saw in the pre-pandemic period from 2016 to 2019. That is consistent with a low-inflation, lower-growth economy. As we move into October, the spending is holding at that 4% level. So growing, but growing at a basis more consistent with low growth, low inflation economy. With that, let me turn to Slide 3. We provide various highlights, and Al's just going to cover a lot of this. Our team continues to focus on driving organic growth, driving digital progress, and operational excellence, which keeps us focused on operating leverage. A few words on organic growth as we flip to Slide 4. Every business segment had organic growth. In Consumer, in quarter three, we opened more than 200,000 net new checking accounts this quarter alone. We also opened another 1 million credit card accounts. We have 10% more investment accounts this year, third quarter, than we did last year. In Small Business, we have seen 35 straight quarters of net new checking account growth. We've also seen good small business loan growth, and our loans are up 14% from last year. That was -- in this quarter, our Small Business teammates extended $2.8 billion in credit to small business in America alone. In Global Wealth, we added nearly 7,000 net new relationships to the Merrill and Private Bank franchises. And our advisors opened more than 35,000 new bank accounts for the third consecutive quarter, fulfilling both investing and banking needs for those clients. We also increased our number of advisors. In the past year, across our wealth spectrum, in GWIM and in consumer investments, they have combined to gather $87 billion in total net flows. In our Global Banking team, we added clients and increased the number of products per relationship. Year-to-date, we've added 1,900 new commercial and business banking clients. That is more than we added in the full year last year. Even while activity is low, the investment banking team continues to hold us number three position. In the Global Markets, we continue to see performance establish new records for our firm. I'm going to cover that in a little more detail in a moment. As you can move to Slide 5, you can see the digital adoption engagement and volumes continue to increase. We lead the industry in digital banking and continue to provide the best-in-class disclosures. You can find those disclosures by line of business in the appendix on slides 26, 29, and 31. We also continue to receive top accolades from third parties around these capabilities. Most important, these capabilities are valued by our clients and customers and allow us to grow with great expense leverage. Let me give you a few examples. Our Consumer and Merrill clients logged into our consumer banking app a record 3.2 billion times this quarter. Even at this scale and stage of maturity of this operation, logins are up double digits from the year prior. Customer use of Erica continued to beat our expectations with almost 19 million users, up 16% in the past 12 months. CashPro App sign-ins with our business clients are up more than 40%. And we recently added the Erica functionality to CashPro to help corporate clients benefit from that artificial intelligence. Likewise, Zelle users continues to grow. Zelle transaction levels are up more than 25% from last year. And Zelle is becoming a meaningful way our customers move money. In fact, customers now send money with Zelle at twice the rate they write checks. We're nearing a period where the Zelle transactions sent will exceed the combination of checks written and ATM withdrawal transactions. As you move across the lines of business on the slide, the story is the same. All these capabilities help us deliver faster, safer, and more efficiently. And all of it gets strong customer and client feedback. When you put that together, that helps us drive operating leverage, and you can see it on Slide 6. We have a strong record of driving operating leverage in our company. We drove operating leverage every quarter for nearly five years before the pandemic. And then again, more recently, we've had an eight-quarter streak leading to this quarter. We acknowledged to you this last quarter that our operating leverage is going to be tough for a few quarters as we navigate through the trough of net interest income. But as you can see on Slide 6, we managed to grow revenue year-over-year faster than expense in dollar terms this quarter, even though the percentage change was basically flat. Now, in January, we told you we'd manage our head countdown to help make sure we got our expenses in line. Over the course of 2023 we've seen moving from 2022's great resignation to our current level of a record low attrition in our company. All that meant the team had to work harder to manage that headcount down. And they did it. Our headcount is now down over 7,000 FTEs [from a] (ph) peak in January, even with the addition of 2,500 college grads this fall. As a result, you've seen expense decline from $16.2 billion in quarter one to $16 billion in quarter two to $15.8 billion this quarter. By the way, we've done this without special charges or large layoffs. Expense will decline again in the fourth quarter, excluding any FDIC special assessment, of course. We expect to report $15.6 billion in expenses in 4Q. Now interestingly, the debt is up only around 1% from fourth quarter of last year. This is stronger expense guidance than we thought we could do earlier in the year and sets us up nicely for next year. Shifting gears, let's focus on the balance sheet. Slide 7 shows the breakout of deposit trends on a weekly basis -- ending basis across the third quarter. We gave you this chart last quarter also. In the upper left-hand, you can see the trend of total deposits. We ended quarter three at $1.88 trillion, up from quarter two and better than industry results. What you should also note is the cost of these deposits. Our team has rewarded customers with higher rates for their investment [or in cash] (ph), re-initiated deposit growth and grown share with always superior mix in cost. You will note we're now paying 155 basis points all in for deposits, which is up 31 basis points from last quarter. I ask that you remember two things when you think about the deposits. The rate remains low relative to many because of the transactional nature of deposit relationships with $565 billion in non-interest-bearing deposits. And you can see in the upper right alone, in low interest and no interest checking, there's $504 billion in Consumer. Secondly, remember the importance of the spread against the quarter's average Fed funds rate. This position is very advantageous compared to past cycles because the transactional counts in the current cycle are a much higher mix of Bank of America's deposits. I would also add that while we maintain discipline in deposit price and we pay competitive rates to customers with excess cash seeing higher yields across all the businesses, if rates fall, those particular products will see the rates come down also. Dropping into the business trends. In Consumer, if you look at the top right chart, you saw a $22 billion decline. Note, the difference in the movement through the quarter between the balance of low to no-interest checking accounts and higher-yielding non-checking accounts. You could also see the low levels of our more rate-sensitive balance in consumer investments and CD balances broken out. In total, we have $982 billion in consumer deposits. In Consumer alone, this is $250 billion more than we had pre-pandemic. The total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter was 34 basis points. This remains very low, driven by the high percentage of transactional -- high-quality transaction accounts. Most of the quarter's rate increase is concentrated in CDs and consumer investment deposits where about -- which are about 13% of the deposits. Turning to Wealth Management, balances were flat. We saw a slowing in the previous quarterly trend of clients moving money from lower-yielding sweep accounts into higher-yielding preferred deposits and off-balance sheet products ones. Sweep balances were down by $7 billion and were replaced by new account generation and deepening. At the bottom right, note the Global Banking deposits grew $2 billion and have hovered around $500 million for the past six quarters. These are generally the transaction deposits of our commercial customers used to manage their cash flows. Noninterest-bearing deposits were 37% of deposits at the end of the quarter. Sticking with the balance sheet but moving to capital, let me give you a few thoughts on the proposed capital rules. As you are well aware, our banking industry in the United States is the most highly capitalized the most profitable banking group in the world. It's a source of strength for our country and its economy. The annual stress tests over -- are now over a dozen years old, using ever-increasing harsher test scenarios have proven that capital is sufficient. Banks have proven to be a part of the solution during the more recent COVID pandemic and the banking disruption in March this year. We add to our capital and reduce our lending capacity to American business consumers, and those trade-offs are being debated. But as far as the rules are concerned, there are many parts of the rules that our industry doesn't agree with because of double accounts or increased trading and market risk. And we're talking to those proposals and working, and we're hopeful they'll change. But in any event, they may not. If they don't, how will they affect us? If you go to Slide 8, you can show the expected impact as we interpret those proposed rules. This assumes that they're proposed today without any changes. The proposed rules would inflate our risk-weighted assets by about 20%. So if I apply the inflation against this quarter's RWA of $1.63 trillion, that means, if nothing else changed in the rules, we'd end up with about $320 billion more risk-weighted assets. The biggest increase in RWA would be a couple hundred billion dollars in operational RWA. The next biggest category would be driven by a four-fold increase in the RWA against non-publicly traded equity exposures. In our case, that really is mostly about the tax-advantaged investments in solar and wind. Looking at the capital to be held against the inflated RWA on the right side of the slide, I'd remind you today that our minimum capital requirement is to hold 9.5% in on Common Equity Tier 1. But based on our G-SIB charges, that going to come in effect on January 1, 2024, we moved to 10%. So I'm going to use that as a requirement. Holding 10% today means $163 billion, that we finished the third quarter with $194 billion. So today, we have more than $30 billion excess capital. Now, let's assume the proposed change is going through in full. The proposed changes are phased in from '25 -- the middle '25 to '28 under the current proposal. When those are fully phased in, as we used to call Basel fully phased in, if you remember, we would have a need for $195 billion of total capital. Now if you look on the upper right-hand side of the page, you'll see that we're today, we're at $194 billion. So we hold the required capital today. And of course, we'd have to build a buffer to that throughout the implementation period. But if you look at the bottom of the page, you see just in the last nine quarters the kind of capital generation this company has. Once we understand the rules, we'll of course have a bit -- a chance to optimize our balance sheet and appropriately price assets to improve the return on tangible common equity. Now, before I turn it over to Alastair, I just wanted to highlight one of the businesses that we talked about over the many years. That's our Global Markets business. Global Markets represent 17% of the company's year-to-date earnings and it's one of the top capital markets platforms in world. It's one 'of a handful of firms that can do what is due, providing advice and execution in every major market around the world. Jimmy DeMare and the team who run the business asked us for additional investment around four years ago, and they've grown this business with an intensity that clients are appreciative and reward us with more of their business. This has produced strong revenue growth. We've grown the balance sheet here but have done it efficiently. That's allowed us to grow sales and trading revenue over the past 12 months consistently, and now stands 32% higher than the average of the five years leading into the pandemic in the investment in the business. And through effective cost management, we also generated 11% to 12% returns on capital in this business. This exceeds our cost of capital even as we continue to allocate more capital to the business. Returns are even larger if you combine it with the Global Banking business, that many show the businesses combined and take -- because our corporate clients also take advantage of these industry-leading capabilities.

I'm not going to spend a lot of time here because Brian touched on this and the highlights that we show on Slide 3. For the quarter, we generated $7.8 billion in net income, resulting in $0.90 per diluted share. Both of those are up the double digits from the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year revenue growth of 3% was led by improvement in net interest income, coupled with a strong 8% increase in sales and trading results, and that excludes DVA, and a 4% increase in investment in brokerage revenue driven by our Wealth Management businesses. Expense for the quarter of $15.8 billion included good discipline from our team, which allowed us to reduce costs from the second quarter, even as we continue our planned investments for marketing, technology and physical presence build-outs, including financial center openings and renovations. Asset quality remains stellar, and provision expense for the quarter was $1.2 billion. That consisted of $931 million of net charge-offs and $303 million of reserve build. The provision expense reflects the continued trend in charge-offs toward pre-pandemic levels and remains below historical levels. Our charge-off rate was 35 basis points, that's 2 basis points higher than the second quarter, and still below the 39 basis points we saw in the fourth quarter of '19. And as a reminder, that 2019 was a multi-decade low. 30-day delinquencies also remained below their fourth quarter '19 level. Lastly, our tax rate this quarter was 4%, driven mostly by higher-than-expected volume of investment tax credit, or ITC deals for the rest of the year. And we can expect other income in Q4 will reflect seasonally higher renewables investment losses when these projects get placed into service. Okay. Let's turn to the balance sheet that's on Slide 11. And you can see it ended the quarter at $3.2 trillion, up $31 billion from the second quarter. So not a lot to note here. The driver of the increase was a $34 billion increase in available for sales securities. With cash levels so high, we chose to reduce the cash and just put some of the money into short-term T-bills this quarter, and those earn essentially the same rate as cash. Our cash remains high at $352 billion. In addition to the cash level change, we saw another $11 billion decline in hold to maturity securities as those securities matured and paid down. And as Brian noted, global excess liquidity sources remain strong at $859 billion, that's down very modestly from the second quarter, and still remains approximately $280 billion above our pre-pandemic fourth quarter '19 level. Shareholders' equity increased $4 billion from the second quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders. During the quarter, we paid out $1.9 billion in common dividends and we bought back $1 billion in shares to offset our employee awards. AOCI was $1.1 billion lower, reflecting both a modest decline in the value of AFS securities, modestly impacting CET1 as well as a small change in cash flow hedges, which doesn't impact the regulatory capital. Tangible book value per share is up 12% year-over-year. Turning to regulatory capital. our CET1 level improved to $194 billion from June 30, and our CET1 ratio improved 30 basis points to 11.9%. It's now well above our current 9.5% requirement as Brian noted. Risk-weighted assets declined modestly as loans and Global Markets RWA both moved lower. Our supplemental leverage ratio was 62% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves capacity for balance sheet growth and our TLAC ratio remains well above our requirements. LCR ratios remain well above minimums for BAC metrics and stronger at the bank level. Let's now focus on loans by looking at average balances on Slide 12. And loan growth slowed this quarter as a decline in demand for commercial borrowing more than offset our credit card growth. So we saw that lower commercial demand in lower revolver utilization among higher funding costs. And commercial balances were also impacted by term loan repayments due to borrowers accessing other capital market solutions. Focusing for a moment on average deposits and using Slide 13. Given Brian's earlier comments, I'll just note the comparisons. Relative to pre-pandemic fourth quarter '19, average deposits are up 33%. Consumer is up 36%, with consumer checking up 45%. And you can see the other segment comparisons on the page. Turning to Slide 14. Let's extend the conversation we’ve been having over the course of the past couple of quarters around management of our excess liquidity. This slide serves as a reminder of the size of our high-quality deposit book, the magnitude of deposits we have in excess of those needed to fund loans and the way we've extracted the value of that excess to deliver value back to our shareholders. The excess of deposits needed to fund loans increased from $420 billion pre-pandemic to a peak of $1.1 trillion in the fall of 2021. And as you can see, it remains high at $835 billion today. That $1.1 trillion of excess liquidity has always included a balanced mix of cash, available for sale securities, and securities we hold to maturity. In late 2020 and into 2021, we concluded that additional stimulus was going to remain in client accounts for an extended period, and we increased the hold to maturity securities portion so we could lock in value from those deposits. And we made these investments given the core nature of our customers' deposits. Note, the split of the shorter-term investments in cash and available-for-sale securities, and then the term hold to maturity securities. And I just draw your attention to just how much cash we have above the actual level we need to run the company. On the available-for-sale, we would just note the duration is less than six months as it's mostly all short-term treasuries. And the combination of the cash and available-for-sale securities represents about 47% of the total noted on this page in the third quarter of '23 to give us the balance we're looking for. And if we look at the hold-to-maturity book, it had grown from $190 billion pre-pandemic, peaking two years ago, and now falling to just over $600 billion currently. That $600 billion consists of about $122 billion in treasuries. Those will mature in a little more than six years, and about $474 billion in mortgage-backed securities and a few billion other. Hold to maturity securities peaked at $683 billion, and we're now down $80 billion from the peak and $11 billion in last quarter. That $80 billion decline from peak was all driven by the reduction of mortgages from $555 billion to $474 billion. With less loan funding needs over the past several quarters, the proceeds from security paydowns have been deployed into higher-yielding cash, and this mix shift has been happening at about a 300 basis point spread benefit for these assets. Given the increased cash rates, the combined cash and security yield has risen now to more than 3%. It's up more than 200 basis points since the peak size of the portfolio in the third quarter of '21, and it's risen faster than the rate paid on deposits. In fact, today, it's 178 basis points above what we pay for deposits. And remember also, we have $1 trillion of loans that are largely in floating rate in addition. From a valuation perspective, we did experience a decline in the valuation of the hold-to-maturity book this quarter, and that's in the context of mortgage rates reaching a two-decade high. Comparing the valuation change to the year-ago period, it worsened $15 billion. And over that same time period, we grew regulatory capital by $19 billion and hold global liquidity sources in excess of $850 billion. And importantly, as we move to Slide 15, I'll make one final comment here, which is the improved NII over this investment period. The net interest income, excluding Global Markets, which we disclose each quarter, troughed in Q3 '20 at $9.1 billion, that compares to $13.9 billion in the third quarter of '23 or $4.7 billion higher every quarter on a quarterly basis, and that gives a sense of the entire balance sheet working together. Okay. Let's now turn our focus to NII performance over the past quarter, and we'll talk about the path forward, and I'm going to use Slide 15 for that. On last quarter's call, we guided to expect Q3 NII to be about $14.2 billion to $14.3 billion on an FTE basis. Our third quarter performance turned out to be better than our guidance. And on an FTE basis, NII was $14.5 billion this quarter. We expect Q4 will be around $14 billion fully taxable equivalent, and that increases our full year guidance for NII in 2023 versus 2022 to 9% growth per year. We believe NII will hover around this expected fourth quarter $14 billion level, plus or minus, in the first half of next year, and then we anticipate modest growth in the half of 2024. By the time we get to the fourth quarter of 2024, we believe we can see NII up low single digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The good news is we believe NII will likely trough around the fourth quarter level of $14 billion and begin to grow again in the middle of next year. I'd note a few caveats around that forward view I just provided. It includes an assumption that interest rates in the forward curve materialize and it includes rate cuts for the second half of 2024. It also includes an expectation of modest loan and deposit growth as we move into the second half of 2024. Focusing again on this quarter, $14.5 billion NII was an increase of nearly $700 million from the third quarter of '22, or 4%, while our net interest yield improved 5 basis points to 2.11%. The year-over-year improvement was driven by higher interest rates and partially offset by lower deposit balances. On a linked-quarter comparison, NII improved $239 million from Q2, and that comes from the benefit of an extra day of interest, a rate hike and higher global markets NII, partially offset by increased deposit pricing. And the net interest yield improved 5 basis points. Turning to asset sensitivity and focused on a forward yield curve basis, the plus 100 basis point parallel shift at September 30 was $3.1 billion of expected NII benefit over the next 12 months from our banking book. And that expects -- or that assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline forecast, and 95% of the sensitivity is driven by short rates. The 100 basis point down rate scenario was $3.3 billion. Okay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 16 for the discussion. Previously highlighted that we guided you to a trend of sequential declines in our expense each quarter this year, and we achieved that in Q3 with our expense down $200 million to $15.8 billion. Additionally, we expect the fourth quarter to go down another couple of hundred million to $15.6 billion, excluding any FDIC special assessment. That would mean our fourth quarter expense of $15.6 billion, compared to the fourth quarter of '22, would be up by only $100 million or less than 1%. And we're proud of that work by the team, especially considering our regular FDIC insurance expense alone increased by $125 million quarterly starting in the first quarter of this year. So without that, we would be flat year-over-year in Q4. The decline this quarter from the second was driven by the reduction in litigation expense and lower headcount, offset somewhat by investments in inflationary costs. Our headcount is down nearly 2,800 from the second quarter to 213,000. And that includes the addition of 2,500 or so full-time campus hires we brought into the company. So that's good work by the team after we peaked at 218,000 in January month-end. And you see the movement here across the past year at the bottom left of the slide. As we look forward to next quarter, we'd add $1.9 billion of expense for the proposed notice of special assessment from the FDIC as a possibility. Absent that, we'd expect our fourth quarter $15.6 billion expense target to more fully benefit from the third quarter headcount reductions, and that will allow expense to continue the decline experienced throughout the year so far. All of that is going to set us up well for next year. Let's now turn to credit, and we'll turn to Slide 17. Net charge-offs of $931 million increased $62 million from the second quarter. The increase is driven by credit card losses as higher late-stage delinquencies flow through to charge-offs. For context, the credit card net charge-off rate rose 12 basis points to 2.72% in Q3, and it remains below the 3.03% pre-pandemic rate in the fourth quarter of '19. Provision expense was $1.2 billion in Q3, and that included a $303 million reserve build. It reflects a macroeconomic outlook that on a weighted basis continues to include an unemployment rate that rises to north of 5% during 2024. On Slide 18, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and our Commercial portfolios. And on Consumer, we just note that we continue to see the asset quality metrics come off the bottom. And for the most part, they remain below historical averages. 30 and 90-day consumer delinquencies still remain below the fourth quarter of 2019 as an example. Commercial net charge-offs declined from the second quarter, driven mostly by a reduction in office write-downs. And as a reminder, our CRE credit exposure represents 7% of total loans, and that includes office exposure, which represents less than 2% of our loans. We've been very intentional around client selection and portfolio concentration and deal structure over many years, and that's helped us to mitigate risk in this portfolio. We continue to believe that the portfolio is well positioned and adequately reserved against the current conditions. And in the appendix, we've included a current view of our commercial real estate and office portfolio stats we provided last quarter. We've also included the historical perspective of our loan book de-risking and our net charge-offs, and you can see all of those on Slides 36, 37, 38 and 39. Okay. Let's move on to the various lines of business and their results. And I'm going to start on Slide 19 with Consumer Banking. For the quarter, Consumer earned $2.9 billion on good organic revenue growth and delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of operating leverage, while we continue to invest for the future. Note that the top-line revenue grew 6%, while expense rose 3%. Reported earnings declined 7% year-over-year given credit costs continue to return to pre-pandemic level. And we believe this understates the underlying success of the business in driving revenue and managing costs, because PPNR grew 9% year-over-year. Much of this success is driven by the pace of organic growth of checking and card accounts, as well as investment accounts and balances, as Brian noted earlier. And expense reflects the continued investments by the business for their future growth. Moving to Wealth Management on Slide 20. We produced good results, and we earned a little more than $1 billion. These results are down from last year, due to a decline in NII from higher deposit costs, which more than offset higher fees from asset management. While lower this quarter, NII of $1.8 billion derives from a world-class banking offering, and it provides good balance in our revenue stream and a competitive advantage in the business for us. As Brian noted, both Merrill and the Private Bank continued to see strong organic growth, and they produced solid assets under management flows of $44 billion since the third quarter of last year, reflecting good mix of new client money as well as our existing clients putting their money to work. Expense reflects continued investments in the business as we add financial advisers and capabilities from technology investments. On Slide 21, you see the Global Banking results. And this business produced very strong results with earnings of $2.6 billion, driven by 11% year-over-year growth in revenue to $6.2 billion. Coupled with good expense management, the business has produced solid operating leverage. Our GTS, or Global Treasury Services business has been robust. We've also seen a steady volume of solar and wind investment projects this quarter, and our investment banking business is performing well in a sluggish environment. Year-over-year revenue growth also benefited from the absence of marks taken on leverage loans in the prior year-ago period. The company's overall investment banking fees were $1.2 billion in Q3, growing modestly over the prior year, despite a pool that was down nearly 20%. And we held on to number three position given our performance. Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $139 million as certain troubled industries and credits outside of commercial real estate continue to have improved outlooks. Expense increased 6% year-over-year, reflecting our continued investments in this business. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 22. The team had another strong quarter, with earnings growing to $1.3 billion driven by revenue growth of 10%, and I'm referring to results excluding DVA as we normally do. The continued themes of inflation, geopolitical tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe have continued to impact both bond and equity markets. And as a result, it was a quarter where we saw strong performance in our FICC businesses, as well as a record third quarter in equities. Focusing on sales and trading, ex DVA, revenue improved 8% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. FICC improved 6% and equities improved 10% compared to the third quarter of last year. And at $1.7 billion, that's a record third quarter for our equities teammates. Year-over-year, expense increased 7%, primarily driven by investments for people and technology. Finally, on Slide 13, all other shows a profit of $89 million. So revenue improved from the second quarter, driven by the absence of prior period debt security sale losses and available-for-sale securities, and partially offset by higher operating losses on tax credit investments in wind, solar and affordable housing. As I mentioned earlier, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 4%, and that reflects a higher-than-expected volume of investment tax credits in which the value of the deals are recognized upfront. We also had a small discrete benefit to tax expense from a state tax law change. Excluding renewable investments and any other discrete tax benefits, our tax rate would have been 25%. And as we wrap up 2023, we expect our full year tax rate, excluding discrete and special items, such as the FDIC special assessment, we expect that full year tax rate should end up in the 9% to 10% range. So to summarize, we grew our earnings double digit year-over-year. We reported NII that was above our expectations, and we increased our full year expectations. We've managed costs aligned with our guidance and brought expenses down in every quarter so far this year, and we expect to do that again in the fourth quarter. We earned more than 15% return on tangible common equity. We returned $2.9 billion in capital back to shareholders, including a 9% dividend increase. And we built 30 basis points of CET1, positioning us well for the proposed capital rules. So all in all, it was a strong quarter. It was one where our teams executed well against responsible growth. And with that, David, I think we'll open it up for the Q&A session.",3229.0,1733.0,37.0,32.0,20.0,5.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,11.0,0.021350259665320254,0.018465089440276975,0.01154068090017311,0.0028851702250432777,0.0017311021350259665,0.0028851702250432777

You're talking about the consumer spending holding at 4% right now, obviously, down from the very strong levels of a year or two years ago. When you look out and you mentioned how you guys were thinking the economy troughs in the middle of next year, do you think you could hold that 4% consumer spend? Do you think your consumers will hold that 4% spending number or could it actually deteriorate from here?",80.0,39.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,0.05128205128205128,0.0,0.0,0.0

One is the -- there's obviously external events, which could change the situation in the globe dramatically. And so -- but given just the pathway that those -- that doesn't -- that kind of event doesn't take place, you think that the rate they're spending out now is consistent with a lower inflation. So embedded in our teams [indiscernible] team's economic projections is a return to inflation, the 2% target at the end of '25. The rate structure comes down beginning in the middle of next year, but still stays around 4% at the end of '25. And so given that the economy -- the inflation is coming down, the economies would still be growing then and getting back towards trend growth, I think it would hold steady. And so it's been pretty steady, the month of August into September into October, at this 4%, 4.5%, 5% level. And that's kind of just people get paid more, they spend a little bit more and pricing goes up. And then you have the ebbs and flows within it, what they spend on. And right now, you've kind of seen all the adjustments that came through the pandemic into the last couple of years sort of adjust out of the system. What I mean by is you had a lot of goods purchase, then you had a lot of travel. You had a lot of return-to-office spending. We can track that people buying stuff. All that's kind of leveled out of the system, including a drop in fuel prices and an increase -- and basically, it's relatively bounce around about the same and they're spending about the same amount of money on gas as they spent last year. So all that being said, in the big aggregate numbers, I think, yes, it can keep bumping along at that level, which is consistent of low inflation, low growth economy, and effectively shows the consumer has been brought more in line with the scenario of the Fed reaching their target. That's what we see. Now, we'll take some time for all that to work through the system and the retail sales number seems to be stronger today, but that will all shake through, but this is what they are doing at the moment.",388.0,166.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.006024096385542169,0.0,0.012048192771084338,0.0,0.0,0.006024096385542169

And then as a follow-up question, you guys gave us good detail on Slide 8 about the potential changes coming from Basel III end game, and you showed us, obviously, the organic capital generation. Can you share with us possibly some of the mitigation strategies you might use? And specifically, if you could touch upon these changes for the equity investments, particularly in the alternative energy space, I guess they're going up from 100% RWAs to 400%.

And there'll be very rigorous points about our views of the wisdom of the changes, the need that changes, the balance of the changes, the double accounting, all the things you've heard much about. That being said, it is a little puzzling that you see some of the RWA increases for mortgage loans or for these types of investments in the environmental and housing and other spaces, which sort of counter the policy that we want to do it. Now what would happen is we'd have to adjust the pricing and it would become more expensive. It's been a great business for us. We continue to drive it. But ultimately, it’d have to go through the market. You have the equity cost go up by a four-fold increase to get the returns. And so think about a pricing model, just increasing the amount of equity we have to dedicate, therefore, we have to get returns on that. And so that would happen. It just seems a little counterintuitive that people would be doing that on a set of rules that, basically, after the financial crisis, Dodd-Frank put in a set of rules and said here's how you count the RWA, without much evidence that this is an issue for companies because the Volcker Rule and all the stuff that are having issues of write-downs or changes here. And so the idea going up four times seems odd to us from a public policy standpoint, and also absent any evidence that this is an issue for the banking system.",326.0,128.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0078125,0.015625,0.0,0.0,-0.0078125

Alastair, at a conference a month ago, you noted that if the Fed is done, you think deposit pricing is close to its peak, and I think you kind of talked us through that a little bit today. Some of your peers have been more fearful of a potential future material repricing in consumer savings, for example, from greater competition or further outflows. So -- and to be fair, they're worried about that for a while and you've been more right.

I mean, Jim, one of the things that I think gives us some confidence around NII troughing and then growing in the back half of next year is if you think -- we've seen the last Fed hike or you believe that the last Fed hike is a month from now or two months from now. And at some point, deposit pricing is going to stop going up. And there'll be a natural lag to that, that's pretty normal. And then what you see, if you look forward into the forward curve is we've actually got Fed cuts, three of them, in the forward curve for next year. So, yes, we anticipate will be some lag. I don't think we're any different than anyone else in that regard. But we're just pointing out that as we get towards peak rates, we're getting closer now so we can begin to see the end of that in terms of the later innings at this point. And the other thing just -- we always have to remind everyone of this is, the deposits that we have are very relationship based. They're -- a lot of them are core operating deposits where we've got the checking, they're thinking about the way we serve them in terms of digital. We've got preferred reward program. And then on the Commercial side, very similar. We've got a lot of operating deposits all around the world. and they're using our world-class CashPro product. So there's a lot of relationship value here as well that we need to take into account. But fundamentally, we're just making a judgment that we're getting towards the top of the rate cycle here for Fed funds and then deposit pricing will sort out in the quarter or two following.",312.0,142.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.007042253521126761,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.0,0.0,-0.007042253521126761

So they are going to find a floor and at that point, they're going to start growing in the same way that Wealth has found the floor, and in the same way the Global Banking found a floor a while ago and is now beginning to grow. So we have a point of view that the Consumer side is going to find the floor. So that's one.

Alastair, if you could tell us sort of how much in cash flow do you forecast your HTM book will have in 2024 as you think about the moving pieces underneath your NII outlook? And for Brian, clearly, this held-to-maturity portfolio has been a thorn in the side of the stock. And so -- and no matter what we say to the investment community, the stock hasn't quite caught up. And I'm wondering, as you think about the statistics that you share with us every quarter, like net new checking ads, maybe give us a little more statistics in terms of the strength of that growth and the strength of that retention. Because I think that no matter what sort of print that you have on total deposits at the end of the quarter, there's always sort of pushback so long as the market is not yet confident that we've hit peak rates.

So as you've noted, if you look at what's driving our deposit base to be larger than the industry, i.e., outperforming the industry is, if you think from -- everybody compares against '19 to now and we're up $250 billion in Consumer deposit loan, but we also are up probably 10% in checking accounts, net checking accounts. Those are 92% core. The attrition rate and where all the deposit balances are in the preferred part of that segment is 99% -- the retention rate is 99% plus long-term customers, the preferred rewards program drives a basis. On cards, we're now getting the balances back up to where they pre-pandemic was even better credit quality than we had then. We got home equities hit a trough and are starting to work their way out. Auto loans are start -- it will continue to produce a lot. The market is not real strong, we continue to produce several billion a quarter. So all the organic growth engine in the Consumer business are very strong. When you go to Wealth Management, we're now producing that household growth at a faster rate than we produced in the prior years. If you go to the Commercial Banking businesses in the US, we noted that we produced more customers this year. And that deposit base in the business banking and middle market segments, those come with a big deposit franchise. And you see that those deposits have actually been stable and growing for last six months. So the organic growth engine is in fine shape and just powers through all this and is the strength of the $3 trillion plus balance sheet. And in fact, it is the reason that we have $1 trillion of -- $900 billion on a given day that we have to put to work because you're just having this great engine go on. And so whether it's investment accounts in Consumer, checking accounts in Consumer, cards in Consumer, home equity, all that has grown organically dramatically over the last four, five, 10 years. And frankly, the loan growth will continue to follow that as conditions improve. And then on the Commercial side, as people go back to regular line usage, we saw it deteriorate this quarter and it’s due to the demand side, and so we feel very good. And then you talked about the markets business, gave you detail there. And the investment banking team is gaining market share and actually [fought] (ph) to maintain relatively flat fees in a market that was down 20% or something. So we feel very good about the organic growth engine. That's what powers our company, and that delivered $7 billion plus in after-tax income for another quarter and 15% return on tangible common equity.",476.0,236.0,10.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0423728813559322,0.012711864406779662,0.00423728813559322,0.0,0.0,0.029661016949152543

One of the big differences between us and other companies you can compare us to is the size of our Wealth Management business relative to the size of the company is large. And as you know, that's a business which we continue to work to make more efficient, but is the least efficient business in the platform. So Lindsay and Eric continue to drive the efficiency there. So yes, we expect the efficiency ratio to continue to improve. And part of that will be as the net interest margin normalizes, we normalize the size of the balance sheet, given it's grossed up for a lot of reasons through the pandemic and stuff and you kind of fine-tune it, you'll get a little more effectiveness there. In the past, we ran up to [2.30%] (ph) in NIM in a sort of normalized sort of environment, and you'd expect us to keep moving up from there. Now it will be it'll be bouncing around here as we work through the trough in NII that we described, which is we're sort of in the middle of starting this quarter into the first half of next year. So, Mike, and as you know, it's all about management heads, and that's -- last year, at this time, we all talked about the great resignation or last year last summer and how we had to hire people, we over-hired because the issue was could you hire fast enough to get what you needed this year. We're able to bring that excess back out of the system and ended up kind of where we wanted to be at 212,000. As we think forward, we continue to reposition people around the company who are freed up because of that digital application to other things. So in a broad sense, our Consumer business is down from 100,000 people to 60,000 people and continues to drift down as we continue to use the -- that's the place of the most leverage in digital across the board, you continue to get less branches, less ATMs. You can see the statistics on the chart. More customer interactions and more customers, that's a pretty good trade, and we continue to drive that, including sales in digital that we disclosed in the back of things. You're running nearly half the sales and, frankly, with improvements on the checking account opening, we can drive another round of growth there. So that's what we're going to do.

So effectively, Erica is a form of that and now has 17 million customers working on it everything. And so think about that this quarter, I think there's [170] (ph) million interactions, whatever the number is, 180 million interactions, something like that. If you think about that, Mike, in the days gone by, every one of those would have been an e-mail, a text or a phone call. And so it's obviously tremendously more efficient. And we're continuing to prove we brought it out to the CashPro side, which is the Commercial side. So that helps.

We got a lot of inventors in this company. And so we feel good about our ability to compete against the types of people you said.

And some of the big tech companies are -- as you listen to them, they have -- it's a business for them to sell that AI capabilities to companies like ours to make us more efficient.

Second is we're sort of baking into it some continued normalization of Consumer balances. So that's just continuing to drift slowly lower. I think third, if we had hoped for loan growth in Q3, we just didn't see that. So that's going to flow through with lower loan growth balances in Q4. And then the only final thing I'd just say is the Global Markets NII may not repeat in quite the same way. Some of that depends on client behavior.

Most of the net charge-off increase over time has been really due to card and Consumer card. And the charge-offs at this point are still lower than they were in the fourth quarter of '19, which was a stellar period. And I'd anticipate in the short term that you'd see things begin to -- or just continue that trend. Because it normally follows 90 days past due delinquencies and those are up ever so slightly against quarter. So we're inching closer to the fourth quarter of '19. And at some point, that's going to begin to stabilize. From there, it's just a question of what does the economy do. So right now, as Brian has pointed out, we've had a slow growth economy in the plan. So I'd anticipate as we get back towards that kind of fourth quarter '19 number, it's going to normalize in there. But from that point, it will be very economic dependent. On the Commercial side, the asset quality has been excellent. The only place where we've got particular elevated concern is office, which is a very small part of our portfolio. It's less than 2% of our loans. But the Commercial side has been terrific. And again, that will depend on how the economy plays out, and whether we're talking about a soft landing, whether we're talking about a recession or whether we're talking about robust growth. So all of that is going to have to play itself out. With the Commercial numbers being so low, that one could bounce around a little bit, but it's only because it's coming off a base that's so low at this point.",307.0,126.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.015873015873015872,0.047619047619047616,0.03968253968253968,0.0,0.015873015873015872,-0.031746031746031744

Remember, we have a strong, disciplined ratings change, rating capability in this company. And so we are pushing through the reviews of the commercial real estate portfolio, et cetera. We put them on, criticized quickly. We had to deal with the charge-offs, and that's why you see them come back already in. And we're adjusting those activities as we show in the slides in the part of the deck, to current appraisals, under market conditions, under current rent rolls, et cetera. And so even though it's a very small part of our portfolio, frankly, a lot of the issues are through the system for us because the high ratings integrity and ratings conservatism we've had in this company for many, many years. And that holds us well. And I always -- if you think back like in the oil and gas thing in the end of '15, '16, we put up all of this reserve that was pre-CECL and then end up bringing it back in because the charge-offs were very modest. So I think we feel very good about the original underwriting, but you also have -- because of our ratings integrity on the office part of the portfolio, we pushed a fairly significant amount through reappraisal and relook, and we have the CECL reserves.

And that is -- you need about another, say, $10 billion to put a buffer on the end state need, $10 billion to $11 billion, $195 billion plus, 0.5% which is our normal buffer, without any mitigation. That would be a very modest increase of $10 billion over $200 billion, let's make it simple. And that would hit the ROTCE a bit. And I'm sure we can figure out ways to price to get that back. But remember, we're different than everybody else, John, because we're actually sitting on this amount of capital today. And so we are getting a 15% return on it. So I don't want to -- don’t take that as saying, I agree with the rules, but saying, we've got to deal with the cards that are dealt to us. The rules say that you have to have $195 billion plus about $10 billion cushion for, and maybe a little bit more cushion, but depending on, for 50 basis points or so. But, we're doing 15% today, so that'd be a slight dilution to that number, but not something we couldn't make up. And that's before any mitigation, honestly. And there's always mitigation. You know that. You've been around this industry for a long time. So there's always mitigation, how you construct things, what you'll do, what you'll not do. And I fully expect there'll be modifications in the rules, which ought to help also.

So my question was around deposit growth and what level of deposit growth you think you need from here. Should it be in line with loan growth? Or are you happy to let some of the more maybe non-transaction deposits run off? And the reason I ask is because as noted in some of the prior questions, some of our peers are saying that there's more room for Consumer deposits to reprice higher, especially core checking accounts. It sort of sounds like you disagree with that. So wanted to assess how much you might need to respond if competitors act differently.",106.0,50.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.04,0.06,0.04,0.0,0.0,-0.02

So we have a tremendously high deposit base. But also, if you think about, if you look at the Slide 5 or whatever, as we show the deposits by business, in the banking business, Global Banking, I think six quarters we've been relatively flat, so, and starting to grow off of that. That is fully priced at -- it's not like corporate treasurers wait around to talk to you about what you're paying and the noninterest-bearing percentage has drifted down. The amount they hold in excess of that, part of that to pay fees has been relatively stable. And so, we feel very good about that. Looking at Wealth Management, basically all the movement was made -- has been made pretty much to the higher rate environment, i.e. buying treasury securities directly. If you look in our Wealth Management business, the amount of short-term cash-oriented type investments, money market funds, et cetera, treasuries, et cetera, has gone from like $500 billion to $700 billion or $800 billion over the last several -- last couple of years. So that move has taken place. And so the rest of it is now in a relatively stable base. You can see those numbers flat. If you go to the consumer side, there's basically two or three things. One is, in the medium income households plus or minus, you're seeing the slow spend down even though they still have multiples of what they had pre-pandemic in their accounts. And even though that's a small part of the overall deposit base, there's still this low trend that where that's drifting down as all the things you read about go on. And the higher end part of that base, in a broad consumer base, they're actually below the pandemic by about 20%. And that's because they moved the money into the market. And you can see that in some of the preferred category of pricing. So where people think about checking and money markets and this, we think, I always have thought about it a little more straightforward, which is transactional cash and investment cash. The investment cash has largely been re-suited across the businesses. The transactional cash holds because it's money in motion moving every day. And for our Consumer business, that’s represented by the $0.5 trillion of checking account balance, as you can see on the page, with some modest amounts in money markets and stuff that are carried as the cushion people have. And if they've moved the money to market, they've moved it. And so we're watching Consumer because there's a little more drifting there, and it's up $250 billion since pre-pandemic. And you're saying you have the dynamics of loans, student loan repayment starting, that's a million of our customers pay student loans. You have the dynamics of interest rate impacts on cash carry of loan balance if that's higher. And that'll sort out, but just takes a lot longer. That's across 37 million people. So it’s a -- the impact takes a while to sort through. And so we feel good about it. But I think people look by category in this and that. You have to think about more how a customer, which a business or consumer, behaves. And what we've seen them is adjust their behavior based on their household circumstances, and largely through the system, and most of it coming a little bit slower in consumer, just because natural question is there, if there are a lot of stimulus went in those accounts, what do I do with it over time? And now they're doing something.",635.0,284.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.017605633802816902,0.01056338028169014,0.0,0.0035211267605633804,0.0,0.007042253521126761

Now, when you look at us with our supplemental leverage ratio, 100 plus basis points over the requirements, we have lots of room on the asset size if we want. And the return on equity -- the return on the risk in that business is very strong. So Jim and the team have done a good job and [indiscernible] equities side. And we continue to experience that there's plenty of room. And in fact, we have brought the balance sheet up by over $200 billion largely due to the financing side. A lot of that due to equities, and we can continue to do that if the clients need the capabilities in the product. So that's a simple answer. Yes, there's a lot of capacity, and it’s largely driven by our huge capital base and our effect on all the size measures were way over the requirements.

I'm starting on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation. Here at Bank of America, our teammates finished 2023 with a solid fourth quarter. Reported EPS was $0.35, but that included two notable items that Alastair will describe in more detail. Adjusted for those two items, net income was $5.9 billion after tax or $0.70 per share. Before Alastair covers quarter four results, I want to take a moment and briefly review the 2023 full year results. Our team at Bank of America delivered strong profits for shareholders across a challenging year, navigating a slowing economy, geopolitical tensions, bank failures, and the impact of a rate hike of historic speed. We began the year with a pretentious aura as economists predicted a mild recession within the year. Instead, 2023 showcased economic resilience led by US consumers despite higher interest rates. We ended 2023 with economists projecting the Fed has successfully steered the US economy to a soft landing. In regards to the economy, during 2023, we consistently made a few points regarding what we were seeing in our customer data here at Bank of America. First, the year-over-year growth rate in spending from the beginning of '23 started declining. And it went from, in the early part of '23 over the early part of '22 from a 9% to 10% growth rate to this quarter's 4% to 5% growth rate and that's where it stands here early in 2024. You can see that on Page -- Slide 29 in the appendix. That growth rate, 4% to 5%, is more consistent with a 2% GDP environment and a lower inflation environment. Second, the point we've made is that our consumer deposit balances at Bank of America remained 30% higher than pre-pandemic. We saw the deposit balance of consumer accounts move lower this quarter, but are now seeing more differentiation in behavior. In the lower average balance size accounts, the balances in there still remain at multiples of pre-pandemic levels, nearly three years past last stimulus. They are modestly declining. The deposit outflows you've seen in consumer have largely been driven by the higher-balance accounts who've moved their excess balances into the markets to seek higher yields. We capture those with our leading wealth platform. Third, the consumers of Bank of America have had access to credit and are borrowing responsibly. The balance sheets are generally in good shape. And while impacted by higher rates, remember, many of them have fixed-rate mortgages and remain employed. So they've shown great resilience. Let's move to discussion of full year 2023 earnings. We reported net income of $26.5 billion after tax, which includes $2.8 billion after tax for notable quarter four items. Adjusted for those items, adjusted net income was $29.3 billion after tax. Earnings per share were $3.42 and that grew 7% over 2022. On that adjusted basis, we generated a 90 basis point return on assets and a 15% return on tangible common equity. The year 2023 was characterized by a record organic customer activity, record digital customer engagement levels and satisfaction scores, strong but slowing NII during the course of the year, strong sales and trading up 7% year-over-year, operating leverage reflected good expense discipline, solid asset quality and a strong capital and liquidity position. All this was helped by the years of Bank of America's assiduous dedication to responsible growth. This helped us bring our headcount and expense down every quarter during 2023, in line with what we told you to expect early this year -- early last year. Adjusted full year revenue grew 5% on the back of 9% NII improvement and strong asset management fees and sales and trading results. We achieved 170 basis points of operating leverage in 2023 as heightened quarterly expense levels were driven lower throughout the year even as the investments in growth continued. Net charge-offs moved higher through the year off the historic lows, but they still compare very favorably against historic averages. One last point worth noting is the level of deposits. If you think back as we ended 2022 and entered 2023, the great debate was how much the pandemic surge in deposits would dissipate. But looking today, we ended 2023 with $1.924 trillion of deposits, only $7 billion less than we had at year-end '22 and 4% higher than the trough in May of this year. The total deposits -- the total average deposits in the fourth quarter remained 35% higher than they did in the quarter four of 2019. This has been tremendous works by our teams to drive our industry-leading market share, actually outperforming the industry across the four-year period, and again this year. While the economy appears to continue to normalize and rates continue to have some volatility, one thing that remains important is driving that organic growth. This client activity sticks to the ribs is what we want to spend a moment as I wrap up. On Slide 3, we highlight some of the successes in organic activity in our results for the year. Bank of America team is a powerful engine that's fueling results across all our businesses. I would note a couple of examples to try and connect the importance to our financials. It's easy to use the consumer business as an example. In consumer, we added 600,000 net new checking accounts during the year 2023. The fourth quarter of 2023 represents the 20th straight quarter of net addition of head -- of checking accounts. The quality is what drives the checking account balances. On average, 67% of the deposit balances have been with us for customers who have been with us for more than 10 years. 92% of the consumer checking accounts are primary, meaning they're the core client household account. 60% of our checking accounts use their debit card. They average 400 transactions per account each year, showing how engaged they are. They have traditionally opened savings accounts 20% to 25% of the time within a few months of opening their checking accounts. Thinking about those new accounts, at opening those new checking accounts opened last year, bring in about $4,000 of balances. Then they deepen over the next subsequent months to two times that amount. New saving accounts come with those accounts, starting with about $8,000 and doubling over time. From the total new checking accounts we opened just in 2023, those customers have opened nearly 0.5 million credit card accounts with us so far in 2023. Historically, we've seen on average these customers more than doubled those card balances within a year. Those card accounts on average have spent about $7,000 per year, of which a portion will carry a balance. Now, there's always additional opportunity to further serve our clients and to continue to meet them where they are. In addition to the industry-leading digital platforms that we have, we have opened 50 new financial centers in 2023. More than half of those were in our expansion markets. We've expanded our presence during 2023 to 10 markets, including our latest opening in Omaha. In our global wealth management team, we added more than 40,000 net new relationships across Merrill and the Private Bank. Our advisors opened 150,000 new banking accounts for wealth management clients, showing the completeness of the relationship approach. The average Merrill account is over $1 million at opening. The average private bank account is multiples of that. As you can see on the slide, we now manage $5.4 trillion of client balances across loans, deposits, investments of our consumer clients, both consumer and GWIM. We saw $84 billion of flows into those accounts last year. As we switch to Global Banking on the lower-left-hand side of the slide, we added clients to increase the number of products per relationship. Just like in consumer, we have seen good growth in customers seeking the benefits of our physical and digital capabilities, but most importantly, our talent relationship managers who provide financing solutions, treasury services, strategic advice for clients with local and global needs. We added roughly 2,500 new commercial and business banking clients this year. That is more than twice what we added in 2022. We look forward to continue to drive with those -- grow with those clients in '24 and add even more. This capitalized on a multi-year build of our relationship management team in the Global Banking businesses, especially in product expansion also, especially in the global transaction services area and mid-market investment bank. As we think about global markets, we continue to see strong performance from our team with 7% year-over-year revenue growth, the strongest we've had in many years. We see digital tools our customers have access to across the board, helping us enable this activity at lower costs. Our normal digital banking slides are once again included for your reference on Pages 21, 24 and 26. In summary, this was a good quarter. We delivered our third quarter of expense declines. We saw NII outperform what we expected when we talked to you on the last earnings call. We continue to manage well through the transition and the rate structure. We saw deposits grow this quarter. And we look forward with a strong capital base, strong liquidity and growing loans and deposits to a greet 2024. I want to thank my teammates for what they did for us in 2023, and we all know we're off to a nice start for '24. With that, I'll turn it over to Alastair.",1540.0,839.0,31.0,10.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,0.03694874851013111,0.011918951132300357,0.00834326579261025,0.0,0.0,0.025029797377830752

And I'm going to start on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation to provide just a little more context on the summary income statement and the highlights. For the fourth quarter, as Brian noted, we reported $3.1 billion in net income or $0.35 per diluted share. That GAAP net income number included two notable items. First, we recorded $2.1 billion of pretax expense, that's $0.20 after-tax earnings per share for the special assessment by the FDIC to recover losses from the failures of Silicon Valley and Signature Bank. Second, on November 15th 2023, Bloomberg announced that they would discontinue publishing the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index rate after November 15th 2024 and many commercial loans in the industry had BSBY as a reference rate prior to SOFR becoming industry-standard. As noted in an 8-K we filed earlier this week, we came to conclusion in early January that BSBY cessation would not get the same accounting treatment allowed under LIBOR cessation. And therefore cash-flow hedges of BSBY indexed products related to BSBY cash flows, forecast to occur after November 15th 2024, we need to be moved out of OCI into earnings in the fourth quarter of '23 financials. So as a result of the accounting interpretation, we recorded a negative pretax impact to our market making revenue of approximately $1.6 billion. I just want to reinforce that's an accounting impact. It's not an economic change to the contracts and we'll see an offset to this over time through higher NII mostly occurring in 2025 and 2026 after BSBY ceases in November 2024. The accounting lowered CET1 by 8 basis points during the quarter and we will recapture that in the next two or three years. Adjusted for the FDIC assessment and the BSBY cessation related impact, Q4 net income was $5.9 billion, or $0.70 per share. On Slide 5, we show the highlights of the quarter and we reported revenue of $22.1 billion on an FTE basis. And excluding the BSBY cessation impact, adjusted revenue was $23.7 billion and declined 4%, driven by net interest income. Fourth quarter revenue is a tough year-over-year comparison as NII peaked in the fourth quarter of '22 at $14.8 billion, before slowly moving lower over 2023. Outside of NII, we saw good growth in treasury service fees and wealth management fees and those were offset by higher tax-advantaged investment deal activity, creating higher operating losses and the more tax credits associated with them and recognized across periods. Expense for the quarter of $17.7 billion included the $2.1 billion FDIC charge. So excluding that charge, adjusted expense was $15.6 billion and consistent with our prior guidance. That allowed us to invest for growth, as well as use good expense discipline to eliminate work and reduce headcount. And on an adjusted basis, this then is the third quarter of sequential expense decline this year. Provision expense for the quarter was $1.1 billion, that consisted of $1.2 billion in net charge-offs and a modest reserve release, reflecting the improved macroeconomic outlook. Net charge-offs reflect the continued trend in consumer and commercial charge-offs towards more normalized levels as well as higher commercial real-estate office losses. Lastly, our income tax expense this quarter was a modest benefit as credits from tax-advantaged investment deals offset the tax expense on the lower earnings in Q4 driven by the notable charges. So let's review the balance sheet on Slide 6, and you'll see we ended the quarter at $3.2 trillion of total assets, up $27 billion from the third quarter. I'd highlight here, both the $39 billion growth in deposits and a decline in cash on balance sheet of $19 billion. Overall, you'll note the debt securities increased $92 billion. And that included a $9 billion decline in hold-to-maturity securities, and $100 billion increase in available-for-sale securities reflecting short term investment of liquidity from all of these activities. We continue to put money into very short-term T-bills and hedged treasury notes this quarter and those are essentially earning the same rate as cash. And you can see our absolute cash levels remain quite high. As Brian noted, liquidity remained strong with $897 billion of global excess liquidity sources. That was up $38 billion from the third quarter of '23 and it remained $321 billion above our pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter of '19. Shareholders' equity increased $5 billion from the third quarter as earnings and AOCI improvement were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders. The AOCI improved $4 billion, reflecting both the previously mentioned BSBY-related reclassification into fourth quarter earnings and other AOCI improvements. This included some improvements in other cash-flow hedges, which don't impact regulatory capital, driven by a decline in long-end rates. During the quarter, we paid out $1.9 billion in common dividends and we bought back $800 million in shares, which more than offset our employee awards. Tangible book value per share is up 3% linked-quarter and 12% year-over-year. Turning to the regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $195 billion from September 30th, while the CET1 ratio declined 9 basis points to 11.8% and remains well above our current 10% requirement as of January 1st '24. We also remained well-positioned against the proposed capital rules, as our current CET1 level matches our 10% minimum against anticipated RWA inflation from the proposed rules. Risk-weighted assets increased $19 billion on loan growth and growth in global markets, RWA, and our supplemental leverage ratio was 6.1% versus the minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth and our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above requirements. So let's focus on loans by looking at the average balances on Slide 7. And you can see loan growth improved this quarter as we saw improvement in both credit card and commercial borrowing, offset by declines in commercial real estate and securities-based lending. The commercial growth reflects good demand overall and was muted only at quarter-end by companies paying down commercial balances as they finalized their year-end financial positions. Lastly, on a positive note, we've seen loan spreads continue to widen, given some of the capital pressures from proposed rules on the banking industry, and this combined with investments in relationship managers we've added over the past few years, has positioned us to take market-share and improved spreads. Moving to deposits, I'll stay focused on averages on Slide 8, and the trends of ending balances saw growth in Global Banking and wealth management and declines in consumer. Relative to the pre-pandemic fourth quarter '19 period, average deposits are still up 35%. Every line of business remains well above their pre-pandemic levels. Consumer is up 33%, with checking up 40% driven by the net-new checking accounts added that Brian noted earlier. On a more recent performance basis, deposits grew $29 billion or 6% from Q3 on an annualized basis. The only business that saw a decline in deposits linked-quarter was consumer. And here we saw a decline of $21 billion. This linked-quarter decline slowed from the third quarter change. And in total, we have $959 billion in high-quality consumer deposits, which remains $239 billion above pre-pandemic levels. The total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter was 47 basis points and this remains very low, driven by the high mix of quality transactional accounts. Most of this quarter's rate increase remains concentrated in CDs and consumer investment deposits, which together only represent 15% of the consumer deposits. Turning to wealth management, balances on an end-of-period basis improved modestly, and we continued to experience a slowing in the trend of clients moving money from lower-yielding sweep accounts into higher-yielding preferred deposits and off-balance sheet. Our sweep balances were down $4 billion and were replaced by new account generation and deepening. Global Banking deposits grew $23 billion, moving nicely above the $500 billion level that we've experienced over the course of the past six quarters. These deposits are generally transactional deposits of our commercial customers. They are the ones that used to manage their cash flows. And noninterest-bearing deposits were about 33% of deposits at the end of that quarter. So when we turn to excess deposit levels on Slide 9, you can see deposit growth exceeded loan growth this quarter. And that expanded our excess of deposits above loans, from Q3 to about $0.9 trillion, which is well above the $0.5 trillion we had pre-pandemic. You can see that in the upper-left of Slide 9, which is where we've used and shown you how we think about managing excess liquidity. We continue to have a balanced mix of cash available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities. And this quarter, the combination of the cash and the AFS securities now represent 51% of the total $1.2 trillion noted on this page. You'll also notice the change in mix of the shorter-term portfolio as we began to lower cash and increase available-for-sale securities buying mostly short-dated T-Bills with similar yields. You can note also the hold-to-maturity book continued to decline from paydowns and maturities pulling to PAR. In total, the hold-to-maturity book moved below $600 billion this quarter. It's now down $89 billion from its peak and it consists of about $122 billion in treasuries and about $465 billion in mortgage-backed securities along with a few billion others. Also note that the blended cash and securities yield continued to rise and remained about 170 basis points above the rate we pay for deposits. The replacement of these lower earning assets into higher yielding assets continues to provide an ongoing benefit and support to NII. From a valuation perspective, given the reduced balance and the longer-term interest-rate reductions we've seen in the fourth quarter, we experienced an improvement of more than $30 billion in the valuation of the hold-to-maturity securities. So, let's turn our focus to NII performance using Slide 10. And a strong finish to the year helped us report $57.5 billion in NII on a fully tax-equivalent basis for the full year of 2023. That's up 9% compared to 2022. On an FTE basis, we reported $14.1 billion in NII, which was modestly better than we told you to expect last quarter driven by modestly better deposit growth. The $14.1 billion was a decline of $400 million from the third quarter, driven by the unfavorable impacts of deposits and related pricing and lower global markets NII, partially offset by higher rates benefiting asset yields. And as we look forward, given that we've got one less day of interest in the first quarter and that's worth about $125 million to $150 million, and given the rate curve shift, we believe the first quarter will be somewhere between $100 million and $200 million lower than the fourth quarter. It could move a touch lower in Q2 and then we believe it should begin to grow sequentially in the second half of 2024. So very consistent with our prior guidance. With regard to the forward view I just provided, let me note a few other caveats. It would include an assumption that interest rates in the forward curve materialize. And the forward curve today has six cuts compared to last quarter when we had three cuts in the 2024 curve. So it's bouncing around a little and shifted in the past quarter. Forward view also includes our expectation of low to mid-single-digit loan growth and some moderate growth in deposits as we move into the back half of 2024. Given our recent deposit and loan performance, we continue to feel good about these assumptions. Before moving away, it's worth noting our net interest yield declined 14 basis points to 197 basis points. And that's driven by the decline in NII, as well as higher average earning assets, reflecting prior period builds of cash and cash-like securities. Turning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield curve basis, the plus 100 basis point parallel shift at December 31st was $3.5 billion of expected NII over the next 12 months, coming from our banking book. And that assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline forecast, and 93% of that sensitivity is driven by short rates. The 100 basis point down scenario is $3.1 billion. Let's turn to expense and we'll use Slide 11 for the discussion. And we reported $15.6 billion in adjusted expense this quarter, which excludes the FDIC assessment. This was in line with our projection from last quarter and down $199 million from the third quarter, driven by reductions in headcount earlier in the year and seasonally lower revenue-related expense. These reductions outpace the continued investments that we're making to drive growth. Our average headcount was down from the third quarter to 213,000 people, and that's good work after peaking at 218,000 last January. We lowered our headcount through the year by 5,000 and did so without taking an outsized severance charge as we used attrition to lower our headcount along the way. One more point to acknowledge the good work of our teams on expense, Q4 '23 adjusted expense of $15.6 billion is only $94 million higher than the fourth quarter of '22. And just remember, we began 2023 with a $125 million lift in quarterly FDIC expense. So through some good operational excellence work and otherwise, we've managed through all of the additional costs of investments in new tech initiatives and merit and financial center openings, as well as some stronger revenue and higher marketing costs. As we look forward to next quarter, we expect to see the more typical Q1 seasonal elevation in expense of $700 million to $800 million compared to Q4. So we believe expense will be around $16.4 billion in the first quarter. That includes elevated payroll tax expense and the expected costs of higher revenue in both sales and trading and wealth management, as well as merit cost increases. And as we move through 2024, we expect the quarterly expense to decline from Q1, reflecting a drop in the elevated payroll tax expense and revenue changes, as well as some additional operational excellence initiative work. Continued digital transformation and adoption is also going to help us as we go through the year. Now turn to credit, and I'll use Slide 12 for that. Provision expense was $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter and it included an $88 million reserve release due to a modestly improved macroeconomic environment. On a weighted basis, we're reserved for an unemployment rate of nearly 5% by the end of 2024 compared to the most recent 3.7% rate reported. Net charge-offs of $1.2 billion increased $261 million from the third quarter, and the net charge-off ratio was 45 basis points, a 10 basis point increase from the third quarter. On Slide 13, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios, and the overall increase in net charge-offs was driven by three things. First, $104 million of the increase was driven by credit card losses, which continued to normalize as higher late-stage delinquencies flowed through to charge-offs. Second, $65 million of the increase was driven by a broad range of smaller commercial and industrial losses, which were mostly previously reserved and monitored for the past couple of quarters. And lastly, $76 million of the increase was driven by commercial real estate losses, primarily due to office, also mostly reserved. In the appendix, we've included a current view of our commercial real estate and office portfolio stats provided last quarter, and we've also included the historical perspective of our loan book de-risking and long term trend of our consumer and commercial net charge-offs, and you can see those on slides 30 to 33. Let's move on to the various lines of business and their results and I'll start on Slide 14 with Consumer Banking. For the quarter, consumer earned $2.8 billion on continued good organic growth and despite their good client activity, it's difficult to outrun the earnings impact of higher rates on deposit costs while the credit is also normalizing. The reported earnings declined 23% year-over-year as top line revenue declined 4% while expense rose 3% and the credit costs rose. Customer activity showed another strong quarter of net new checking growth, another strong period of card opening and investment balances for consumer clients which climbed $105 billion over the past year to a record $424 billion. Our full year flows were $49 billion as accounts grew 10% in the past 12 months. Loan growth was led by credit card and that broke above $100 billion this quarter. Deposit decline slowed in the quarter with continued strong discipline around pricing. And our expense reflects continued business investments for growth. And as you can also see on the appendix page 21, digital engagement continued to improve and showed good year-over-year improvement as customers enjoy the continuation of enhanced capabilities. Moving to Wealth Management on Slide 15. We produced good results, earning a little more than $1 billion after adding 40,000 net new relationships in Merrill and the private bank this year. These results were down from last year as a decline in NII from higher deposit costs still catching up from the interest rate hikes, more than offset higher fees from asset management, driven by higher market levels and assets under management flows. As Brian noted earlier, both Merrill and the private bank continued to see strong organic growth and produced solid assets under management flows of $52 billion since the fourth quarter of '22, which reflects a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting their money to the work. Expenses reflect continued investments in the business and revenue related costs. On Slide 16, you see the global banking results. The business produced strong results with earnings of $2.5 billion as a decline from peak levels of NII was offset by lower provision expense, leaving earnings down 3% year-over-year. Revenue declined 8%, driven by the NII. Our global treasury services business remained robust with strong business from existing clients as well as good new client generation. In addition, we continued to see a steady volume of solar and wind investment projects this quarter and our investment banking business continued to perform well in a sluggish environment. Year-over-year revenue growth also benefited from lower marks on leveraged loan positions. The company's overall investment banking fees were $1.1 billion in Q4. That grew 7% over the prior year despite a fee pool that was down 8%. And for the year we held on to the number three position overall, given that performance. In the component parts, we ended the year number one in investment grade, number two in leverage finance, number four in equity capital markets, and number four in mergers and acquisition. The diversification of the revenue across products and regions reflects the growing strength of our platform, and a good example of that is our focus on the equity capital markets blocks business, where we finished number one in the United States for the first time since 1998. And in EMEA, we were also number one for blocks. Provision expense reflected a reserve release of $399 million and that comes from an improved macroeconomic outlook as well as realized charge-offs better, as noted before. Expense decreased 2% year-over-year as continued investments in the business were more than offset by reductions in other operating costs. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 17, the team had another strong quarter, with earnings growing 13% year-over-year to $736 million, driven by revenue growth of 4% and we refer to results excluding DVA as we normally do. Good results in sales and trading and comparatively low remarks on leverage loan positions drove the year-over-year performance and focusing on the sales and trading ex-DVA, revenue improved 1% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, which is a new fourth quarter record for the firm. FICC was down 6% from a record quarter, while equities increased 12% compared to the fourth quarter of '22. And the FICC revenues were down versus that record fourth quarter level with higher revenues in mortgages and municipal trading. Equities was driven by improved trading performance in derivatives. And our expense was up 3% on continued investment in the business. Finally, on Slide 18, all other shows a loss of $3.8 billion, as the two notable items highlighted earlier negatively impacted net income by $2.8 billion in that segment. Revenue adjusted for the $1.6 billion BSBY cessation was flat year-over-year, and expense adjusted for the $2.1 billion FDIC assessment was down a couple hundred million, driven by lower litigation and lower unemployment processing costs. I noted earlier we reported a modest tax benefit this quarter. The tax credits from tax advantaged investment deals throughout the year, including their benefits in the fourth quarter, exceeded taxes on reported earnings because we had the two notable items that lowered results this quarter. For the full year, our tax rate was a little more than 6%. And excluding the impacts of BSBY cessation and FDIC and the other discrete tax benefits, that rate was 10%. And further excluding our investment tax credits, our tax rate would have been 25%. So thank you.

Alastair, maybe on the NII trajectory that you're talking about, sort of down a little bit in the first half and then start to stabilize in the second half, and you're building in six cuts, but a lot of those cuts are coming starting in sort of 2Q and beyond. And given your asset sensitivity, why would we expect NII to stabilize? Is that just sort of expected growth of deposits and loans?

Well, I think, Jim, going back to last quarter, I don't think our views have changed a great deal. So our guidance isn't changing much either in that regard, if anything, Q4 deposits were a little better than we expected. So I think, you see and -- we sort of thought this quarter might be around $14 billion. It was a little better than that. So that's obviously a good starting point. Now, when we look forward off of that slightly higher number, if you think about Q1, I'm thinking about it in terms of a date count, that might be $150 million, let's say.

That's a little bit of deposit seasonality in Q1 and a little bit of just catch up on rate paid and some rotation. But at that point, we see growing in the back half of the year, and that's largely, yes, deposits growing, it's loans growing a little bit, it's some restriking of the securities that come off the balance sheet, and it's restriking some of the loans that come off the balance sheet. So it's all of those things. You're right. When we got together last quarter, we thought there might be three rate cuts. Now it's up to six.

So that's it. As you see the customers today, as I said earlier, the year-to-year spending growth in the fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter, or in the first quarter so far, versus the first part of last year is a 4% to 5% rate in movement of money. And that was across $4 trillion plus out of the consumer accounts in Bank of America into the economy. That 4% to 5% is similar to what it was in '17, '18, '19 when the Fed rose -- took rates up, inflation was under control and economy was growing at 2% -- 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%. And so the spending level should sustain an economy, albeit our core prediction is it's slowing down from a higher growth rate in the third quarter, 4.5%, 5%, whatever it was, down to a percent or something like that in the first couple of quarters next year. But we see the consumer activity indicating that they're still in the game, they're still spending money. Where they spend, it's a little different, more in services and going out in restaurants and experiences and less on goods at retail. They're employed. If you look at the estimates by any of you -- any of your economists, the unemployment rate projected is really a modest deterioration from here, most of them in the core base case, our reserves actually set at almost a 5% unemployment rate by the end of this year, to give you a sense. So that's good news. They're using their credit responsibly. Much is made of higher credit card balances, but on the size of the economy, and the size -- people are forgetting that economy is a lot bigger than it was in '19 because of the inflation, everything. And as a percentage, we don't see any stress there. We see a normalization of that credit. So they're working. They're getting paid. They have balances in their accounts. They have access to credit. They've locked in good rates on their mortgages and they're employed. It's -- we feel it's good. So we think the soft landing is a core thesis.

Because you think of us as rolling that expense taken out back into good things. This year will be, I think, $3.8 billion on technology initiatives. That's up from '21 to '22 by $500 million or more and then sort of flattish '22 to '23. They're being applied in different ways. We added relationship managers across the board. We keep opening the branches. We're largely through the rehab of the branches that we're keeping. And these are all spending to grow. And that's what you're seeing. So net new checking account, 600,000 for the year. That's 20 straight quarters of net checking account growth. All good core accounts flows into the asset manager business, $80 billion or more.

And those customers, which is 300,000 to 400,000 customers added in the last 12 months, those customers bring an average opening balance of $80,000 to $100,000. To give you a sense, they're not small accounts, that's good. So we're just investing. But there's a thousand levers. None of them are simple.

And in that, we're rolling over teammates from one business to another business where we need help and retraining people and reskilling people. And as AI comes in and to the extent that we can deploy it, deploy it wisely, it'll allow us to redeploy people. And even with our very low turnover rate, which is 7% for year '23 and actually down from 12% in the year '22 and I think 6% in the fourth quarter, we still can manage headcount down just by not hiring people, because that gives us an opportunity.

I'm not sure of the media report, but in the end of the day, Jim DeMare and team have done a great job to deploying capital and growing market share in the sales and trading business. So they're up 7% year-over-year in revenue. FICC was up 11% for the year. Equity was down a little bit, down 1% or so. And they've done a great job. $17.6 billion of revenue, highest by a lot -- over the last few years. And think about it, in the '19 time frame, we were $13 billion in revenues. They fundamentally moved up. That was deploying more balance sheet, you got a little bit more capital but inherently, but not a lot. They're not taking a lot of risk. They made money every trading day in '23, again, I think. And so they do a great job of serving the clients. So don't think there's a big capital, a massive amount of capital. They get the capital they need. They have the balance sheet and the risk appetite they need. But we're continuing to put money towards that business because they've proven to be successful. We gave them the balance sheet a few years ago and they were able to deploy. More broadly, we pay out the dividend. We then have a bunch of capital. Today we meet the standards as best. As Alastair said, we could divine from the rule, and we'll see what the final rule looks like when it comes out. But right now, the $194 billion of CET1 is the level of notional CET1. We have to meet the RWA inflation. I'm not saying it's a good rule. I'm just saying we make the math work. And so from now on, we can basically deploy capital to the dividend payment, a couple of billion dollars a quarter, and then everything above that will go to support business growth if we have it, build a little bit of cushion, we need to build over some period of time to meet these new rules if they come through, and then share buybacks, which we bought $800 million or so last quarter, and you'd expect that to keep ticking up.

We typically are running about $1.5 billion before the added activity because of the rate falling and pandemic a quarter. We're now billion $1 billion, $1.2 billion. You expect it to move back in those levels. And we have actually been gaining share over the last few quarters as the markets gone down around as we held our relative position and grew it. So I think Matthew and the team is in good shape and this middle market execution has added a lot of throughput to the team and is building up over time.",164.0,75.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04

And I like the path that we've seen in terms of all the stimulus comes, all the deposits come in, you get some spending, you get some migration, you get some rich people buying treasuries. It's great. To see the stability in the fourth quarter and hear your comments about 2024 for deposits is a little encouraging. We'd always want more, but it's a little encouraging. But my question is, to be 35% higher in 4Q '19 is what I would call a lot more growth than a normal period of time would be with the up and down. So is that a good thing or is that a risk? And maybe the answer lies within how much of those excess deposits are sitting in all these new accounts that you've opened versus just cash from sitting around in existing clients that's maybe waiting to be deployed.

So, Glenn, you're making me have deja vu, because basically, I think you would have asked this question in the first quarter of '23 [too] (ph), on a theory that this was all going to run off. And so when we looked at it, we always said, we had grown sort of in the period up of time, the pandemic at sort of 4%, 5% a year in terms of deposit growth. If you strung that line out, that -- we're still above that line. Let's just say that. And now we're turning and growing. So as Alistair said, we troughed in the middle of the year. So we've outgrown what our sort of implied growth rate would have been against size, et cetera. So we feel good about that. It's all core. Now, if you look at the online dynamics, think about the different clients we have. If you start with the wealth management clients discreetly in GWIM, those balances came down and are bouncing around $300 billion -- $290 billion, $300 billion on a given day. And they've been relatively stable now for, I don't know, five, six months, I think. If you look at the wholesale banking, what's happened is they came -- they've shot up, came down after the pandemic, and then they've been growing back and they're actually stronger because just the activity is picked up and the stabilization of line usage has -- shows that the environment around their borrowing and cash is more consistent. So that's been good. And if you look at consumer, that's what we were saying earlier. If you think about consumer, where you see, if you take the people had accounts with this -- their balances in all their deposit accounts pre-pandemic to now, if you look at people had in consumer, not in wealth management, $50,000, $100,000, $250,000, $1 million in collected balances pre-pandemic, they are down 20%. They move the money, they're going to move. And so for wealth management and consumer, largely people who are going to move money out to get rates have done that and -- is there -- is it still bouncing around a little bit in consumer? Yeah, they're $950 billion more or less on a given day. But it's stabilized and been relatively consistent for the last four, six, eight weeks. But that's got to settle in and then you grow out from there. But that -- what that's really telling you is they've kind of moved the money they're going to move, mostly because they did it and you don't get that money twice. So you moved a chunk in these higher end consumer balances. They moved 20% of their balances over in to get in money market funds, which we captured into other things. And they don't have it to move again because that was accumulated balances that they had in a zero interest rate environment, pre-pandemic, plus whatever other things they got. So if you look at the Slide 8, you can see this deposit slides laid out by non-interest bearing and interest bearing. But the key is that consumer with [$700 billion going into the pandemic, sits at $950 billion] (ph) today. And if you look at the checking, it's still up $140 billion, and that's kind of bouncing around. You can see it's moved down a little bit, but that's really the high -- people with high end checking balances that have moved it into the market.",587.0,243.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.024691358024691357,0.00823045267489712,0.0,0.00411522633744856,0.0,0.01646090534979424

They're beginning to normalize. The whole -- this is a period of transition for the economy and it's a period of transition for our clients, too. A lot of them are dealing with higher interest rates and they're just beginning to moderate and change their spending behaviors. So we've seen a trend over the course of the past few quarters. It's pretty predictable around the consumer side. You can see that in our disclosures. I think it's slide 12 and 13, but that's going to bounce around over the course of the next couple of quarters. Now that we're back towards 2018-2019 levels, it's going to settle in, we think, in the first half of this year. And then on the commercial side, the asset quality remains really in a very good position. We happen to have a couple of names that popped up this quarter, but to your point, we were pretty fully reserved against them. That wasn't a surprise to us.

We've operated under for a few years, but this quarter we actually had commercial reserves come down to pay for the charge-off on a specifically prior period, reserved properties or loans, and that happened. And so you saw some of that. Be careful on the consumer side because basically the pay-as-you-go side, the consumer side is still building up to a nominal amount of charge-offs, consistent where it was in '18/'19. So if you look at card in '18/'19, the charge-off rate across the eight quarters ranged from a low of 2.90% to higher 3.26%. We're at 3.07% today, but we're $6 billion, $8 billion higher balances. So you got to be careful the nominal amount to get that right. If you go look at it more broadly, all -- the company, we had a 45 basis points this quarter, and the range in those eight quarters are [34 basis points to 43 basis points] (ph). But what's different is the CRE piece of that and a charge-off. So the reserve to loans and all the classic factors looked at are very strong. The reserve has set itself with basically half the reserve is driven by the adverse case scenario, to give you a sense, versus the base case, and then some judgmental on top of that. And so as it becomes clear that we're in a soft landing, to Alastair's point, there's less allocation to those scenarios. We always will make some. But when you put all that together and wait, it has unemployment pushing up in the high 4s, and you look at unemployment today, it's nowhere close to that, and there's no prediction to get there in a base case. So that's what will start to ease up on the general reserving. But remember, on card it's a bit of pay-as-you-go. And we were running around 6% reserves. We're up to 7% against card now. So there might be a little bit coming back, but not that -- I'd rather have the growth to sop that up down to 6% in cards than give them back to reserves.",393.0,165.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.006060606060606061,0.024242424242424242,0.012121212121212121,0.0,0.0,-0.01818181818181818

I'm not sure that there's a relevant comparison to blockchain, but let's just focus on AI. If you look at '21, you can see the digital movement. One of the things in the digital movement you see is Erica in the lower left-hand page -- lower left-hand chart on Page 21, Gerard, and you can see that in the fourth quarter, the 170 million interactions with Erica, where people effectively answered on question another 2 million people from last year to this year using it on a basis, 16 million up to 18 million people using it, unique users. And that's just an example. And that's AI in an early stage. We built that starting ten years ago. It operates on our data, use natural language processing. We have to keep updating that for the way people use words, that process. But think 170 million phone calls, walks into branches, emails, et cetera, where that inquiry had -- would have to go through another place and it's able our clients to do things and find them. So we think that there's vast promise for AI and we're deploying it in places, a lot of internal stuff. We help employees work better, work faster. We're doing it. We have it in our coding shop. There's coders using it to continue to improve their effectiveness in learning it. But it's still -- there's still the care that has to be taken on data and usage and models and accountability. It's -- all that stuff is still high. So we're using for things that are a little easier and we think it has great promise. It's just going to -- I'd say it's going to be more similar to digital. What the pace will be, it'll be a little bit of how far it can go before you start to run into difficulties, applying it effectively. But it plays off of the same thing that we've done in digital and Erica and other things. We brought Erica over to the commercial side now, so that -- CashPro uses Erica to answer questions and we're seeing the uses of that grow and you can see the customers can interface and be comfortable with it, and that's good. So it will have tremendous help as it's applied in more and more ways. We are still trying to hear and seeing if it really works, how much benefit it generates. Can it be controlled under the model outputs controlled, and also the things. But we've had algorithmic machine learning type models all over our company for years. And so the billions we've spent literally over the last ten years on data -- cleanliness data, or getting the data in the right place, making sure it's dependable, and the models [operate or either under] (ph) that aren't -- these open at -- open autonomous natural language models, but are models that are machine learning models. We've seen great promise. That's partly how we operate the company now, basically on the same dollar amount of expenses we had in 2015 or '16, to give you a sense. So yes, it's been digitization, but it's also been using more than that. So it's got -- we have high hopes for it.

And we can originate loans into their platforms and there are lots of things we can do. So we continue to work through that. I think to take it more broadly, my colleagues and I have made clear that the strictures around our industry, the methodology operating and the openness and ability to operate outside has led to the mortgage business largely being done outside the industry and most other asset classes for lack of better term. Being outside the industry and the private lending is just another case of that. And I think we're very competitive. We do a great job. We have a $0.5 trillion of consumer, excuse me, commercial loans outstanding. We have hundreds of billions of dollars of mid-sized companies, et cetera. So we think there's a way that we can do this with our clients and help them and help us. A lot of them are asking can you help us originate loans? I think there's still a question ahead of whether the policy of having more things going on the bank industry is a good policy. Of course, we in the banking industry don't think it's a good policy because the reality, I think, one inherent part of your question was when these companies bounce around because of economic stress or for them as an operator, the banking system has a workout methodology, not a liquidation methodology or trading methodology. And that served American enterprise very well. And so I think we have to be clear and see how it affects the economy that way. And those are issues that were true pre-pandemic and have become more acute. So we feel we'll be competitive no matter what. Nothing scares us. We've got a great team and they do a great job. But it's endemic of the issue that if you keep pushing too much capital regulation, stuff will find its way outside the system. And that doesn't mean the risk has changed, it just means it's moved from purview of the regulators and that's one of the points we make. But on the other hand, we are working with those enterprises to help us be a combined effective competitor.",392.0,170.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.01764705882352941,0.029411764705882353,0.0058823529411764705,0.011764705882352941,0.0,-0.011764705882352941

Thank you for all the time today and on a very busy day with lots of us reporting. As we summarized, fourth quarter was a good quarter and another strong year for our company driven by organic growth from all our customer segments. Our digital capabilities continue to grow, our deposits and loans grew, and that's good news. Our NII continues to exceed what we tell you each quarter in terms of what we think is going to happen, which is good news. We gave you new guidance which we plan to hit. Our capital markets activity remains good on both the investment banking side and the sales trading side. And importantly, to get the value of that revenue, we have to have good expense management. You saw us, during the course of year take headcount down from 218,000 to 212,900. You saw us take the expense down sequentially, sets us up good for next year. And with all that, our capital and asset quality remains strong, as does our liquidity.

I am starting on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation. We once again delivered a strong set of results in quarter one. We reported net income of $6.7 billion after tax and EPS of $0.76. This included the additional expense accrual for the industry special assessment by the FDIC to recover losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. This lowered our quarter one EPS by $0.07. Excluding that expense, net income was $7.2 billion and EPS was $0.83 per share in quarter one. Alastair is going to walk you through details of the quarter momentarily, but first let me give you a few thoughts on our performance. We delivered good improvement in our fee-based business, driven both by continued organic growth and good market conditions. Investment banking saw a nice rebound this quarter. We delivered nearly $1.6 billion in investment banking fees and grew 35% from the first quarter 2023. Matthew Koder and the team have done a great job delivering market share growth. In addition, our results reflect the benefits of investments made in our middle market investment banking teams and dual coverage teams. Matthew has utilized [indiscernible] power wisely to grow our middle market team from 15 bankers in 2018 across a dozen cities, to more than 200 bankers in twice as many cities today. Both groups work with our commercial bankers and wealth management advisors in those cities to deliver for our clients. Investment and brokerage services revenue across Merrill and the private bank grew 11% year-over-year in quarter one to nearly $3.6 billion. Continued investments in our advisor training programs and digital delivery for our clients as well as positive market helped us deliver strong revenue. Asset under management flows were $25 billion in the quarter. Sales and trading excluding DBA delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue improvement. At $5.2 billion, this is the highest first quarter result in over a decade. We have allocated more balance sheet invested in talent to build our [indiscernible] for the last five years in this business. Those investments plus the intensity of the teams under Jimmy DeMare’s leadership have resulted in good momentum and market share improvement. From a balance sheet perspective, we entered the quarter expecting modest moves in loan growth and a decline in deposits - those were our expectations. What we actually delivered was growth in ending deposits of more than $20 billion. Ending loans were down modestly due to the expected credit card seasonality, otherwise loans were pretty stable. This balance sheet performance along with our continued pricing discipline allowed us to deliver better than expected NII performance. We told you last quarter that we expected NII to decline from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024, a decline of about $100 million to $200 million. We actually reported today NII of $14.2 billion - that was $100 million higher than quarter four, exceeding our guidance. We continue to deliver strong expense management. Year-over-year expenses adjusted for the FDIC assessment was up a little less than 2% - that compares to the 4%-plus inflation rate. We also continued to invest in our company while managing those expenses. We had several categories with stronger fee-based revenue in the first quarter this year. This drove higher formulaic compensation and processing costs of the increased activity. Fees and commissions were up 10% year-over-year. We are happy to pay for that revenue and deliver more earnings to the bottom line because of it. How did we do all that and hold expenses under the inflation rate? Well, we remain focused on three primary drivers at Bank of America. First, our operational excellence platform continues to deliver and improve processes. These savings from that growth help fund the future growth in the company and lower the risk. Second, we managed headcount as we eliminated work. Recall, we noted an expectation in January of last year that our headcount would be down throughout the year. Our headcount at the end of first quarter 2024 was down by more than 4,700 people from the first quarter 2023. It declined 650 people just from the end of 2023. The digitization activity is also driving ongoing expense cost savings, customer retention and market share improvement, driving across all three factors. It also supports the ever-increasing volumes of client activity with little increased cost. I would highlight our continued capital strength with common equity Tier 1 capital of $197 billion. That amount of capital is $31 billion over the current regulatory minimums for our company. That capital has allowed us to both support our clients and return $4.4 billion to shareholders this quarter in share repurchases and dividends. Let me highlight a few points on our organic growth before I pass it over to Alastair. Now I’m turning to Slide 3. You can see on Slide 3 the highlights of quarter one successful organic activity across the businesses. We continue to invest and enhance our digital platforms. We provide our customers with convenient and secure banking experiences. By leveraging our technology and continuous investment in that technology and putting customers at the center of everything we do, we have successfully deepened our relationships and expanded our customer base across all our businesses. In consumer, we had added 245,000 net new checking accounts this quarter. This completes 21 straight quarters of net additions. Dean Athanasia, Aron Levine and Holly O’Neill helped drive that business for us and continue to perform well, driving strong performance across our consumer franchise. These checking balances continue to drive the performance of our consumer deposits. These checking additions are important for many other reasons. On average, 68% of our deposit balances have been with us for more than 10 years; 92% of the customer checking accounts are primary checking accounts in the household, meaning that they’re the core operating account for the household for their financial lives. When we on-board a client, we start a long-term valuable relationship. About 60% of our checking accounts customers use a debit card and on average they do about 400 transactions per year on that card. The new checking accounts have traditionally opened savings accounts, about 25% of the time within a few months of opening that checking account. Opening a new checking account on average brings about $4,000 in balances below our averages, but that continues to grow and within a year, it’s two times that amount. Likewise when we open a new savings account, it on average brings about $7,000 in balances. This also deepens by about two times during the year. Investment relationships and credit card account openings continued to be strong in the first quarter as well. While we believe some of these statistics are best in class, rest assured there are plenty opportunities for further growth in our franchise and our company. As we think about our global wealth team led by Eric Schimpf, Lindsay Hans and Katy Knox, that team added 7,300 net new wealth relationships with Merrill and the private bank. Our advisors opened 29,000 new bank accounts in the quarter with our customers, deepening their relationships. More than 60% are investing clients in Merrill and 90% of our private banking clients now have a core banking relationship with us. In addition, across our wealth spectrum we saw $60 billion in total flows over the last year. As you can see on this slide, we now manage more than $5.6 trillion in total client balances across loans, deposits and investments, and consumer and wealth management. When we move to global banking, we added more new relationships in this quarter than we did in last year’s first quarter. We also increased the number of solutions per relationship with preexisting clients. Just like in our consumer business, we have seen good growth in customers seeking the benefits of both our physical and our online capabilities and also the care of our talented relationship managers, who provide financing solutions and advice for our clients with global needs. A couple other points I’d make on our digital success. Erica, our virtual banking assistant, reached a key milestone of more than 2 billion interactions since its introduction about six years ago. It took four years to reach 1 billion interactions; it took just 18 months to reach the second billion. In August, we extended Erica’s reach and launched Erica in our global treasury services business and CashPro. Erica has resolved 43% of the CashPro chat inquiries automatedly, demonstrating more and more clients are able to self-solve. This is a great example of best practices being shared across the scale of our company. Second, as an example of our digital success, Zelle continues to grow. It wasn’t long ago that we noted that the number of Zelle transactions in a quarter had surpassed the number of checks written. Shortly after that, Zelle transactions reached two times the number of checks written. This quarter, Zelle transactions have now passed the combined number of checks written plus the amount of cash withdrawals from tellers and from ATMs. That is a rapid adoption and represents continued cost savings and convenience and security for the customers. These stats and others are included in our quarterly activity for our digital banking progress. That’s included in Slides 20, 22 and 24. I encourage you to read them. They show our market-leading efforts representing billions of dollars of our investment over the years, and we are continuing to drive growth with expense growth under control. The solid earnings results achieved this quarter are a testament to the dedication and talent of our 212,000 people who work here and deliver for our customers every day. I thank them for another great quarter. With that, I’ll turn it over to Alastair.",1607.0,866.0,40.0,7.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,0.046189376443418015,0.008083140877598153,0.004618937644341801,0.0011547344110854503,0.0,0.03810623556581986
BAC,2024-04-16,2024-04-16,,2024-04-16,2024-04-16T08:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-16,qa,qna_heading,Alastair Borthwick,"Thank you Brian. I’m going to start on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. Brian covered much of the income statement highlights and he noted the difference in our reported results and the results adjusted for the FDIC assessment, so I’m not going to repeat that; I’d just add that we delivered strong returns. On a reported basis, our return on average assets was 83 basis points, and return on tangible common equity was 12.7%. When adjusted for the FDIC assessment, our efficiency ratio was 64%, ROA at 89 basis points, and ROTCE at 14%. Let’s move to the balance sheet on Slide 5, where we ended the quarter at $3.27 trillion of total assets, up $94 billion from the fourth quarter, and the bulk of that increase was in global markets to support seasonally elevated levels of client activity. Outside of the global markets activity, we’d highlight both the $23 billion growth in deposits and the $20 billion decline in cash levels. With that increase in liquidity, you’ll also note that debt securities increased $39 billion, which included an $8 billion decline in hold-to-maturity securities and a $47 billion increase in AFS securities. Those are mostly hedged U.S. treasuries added with yields effectively at cash rates. At $313 billion, our absolute cash levels remain higher than required. Liquidity remains strong with $909 billion of global liquidity sources, and that’s up $12 billion from the fourth quarter and remains $333 billion above our pre-pandemic fourth quarter ’19 level. Shareholder equity increased $1.9 billion [indiscernible] earnings, as they were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders, and AOCI was little changed in the quarter. During the quarter, we paid out $1.9 billion in common dividends and we bought back $2.5 billion in shares, which more than offset our employee awards. As part of those share awards in the first quarter, we announced our seventh consecutive year of share and success compensation awards, covering more than 95% of our associates and further aligning their interests with shareholders. Tangible book value per share of $24.79 is up 9% year-over-year. Looking at regulatory capital, our CET-1 level improved to $197 billion from December 31, and the CET-1 ratio was stable at 11.8% and remained well above our current 10% requirement. We also remain quite well positioned against the current proposed capital rules as our CET-1 level is also above the 10% requirement even when we include estimated RWA inflation from those new proposed rules. Risk-weighted assets increased modestly, driven by client activity in global markets, and our supplemental leverage ratio was 6% compared to a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves capacity for balance sheet growth. At $475 billion of total loss absorbing capital, our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Let’s turn our balance sheet focus to loans by looking at the average balances in Slide 6. Average loans in the first quarter of $1.048 trillion were flat compared to the fourth quarter, and they improved 1% year-over-year as solid credit card growth was partially offset by declines in securities-based lending. Commercial loans grew modestly year-over-year. We experienced modest improvement in revolver utilization in commercial lending in the first quarter, and that’s being offset for the most part by pay downs as larger client financing solutions are being met through capital markets access. Lastly on a positive note, loan spreads continued to widen. Moving to deposits, we’ll stay focused on averages on Slide 7, and relative to pre-pandemic Q4 2019, average deposits are still up 35%. Every line of business remains well above their pre-pandemic levels and consumer is up 32%, with checking up 38% driven by net new checking accounts added, as Brian noted earlier. Linked quarter total average deposits remained steady at more than $1.9 trillion. The total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter was 55 basis points, and while the rate increased nine basis points from the fourth quarter, the pace of increases continues to slow. The mix of low rate and high quality transactional accounts keeps the rate paid low. Wealth management and global banking also saw a slowdown in the increases in their rate paid and slowdown in the rotation out of non-interest bearing accounts in the first quarter. Focusing for a moment on ending deposits and movement from the fourth quarter, this quarter we delivered good deposit growth. Total deposits grew $23 billion and are now $100 billion above their trough in mid-May of 2023. Consumer banking deposits saw growth in both consumer interest-bearing and non-interest bearing. Global banking continued their more normal pattern of deposits seen for the past five quarters and up more than $30 billion over the last year. Deposit growth exceeded loan growth for the third straight quarter and our excess of deposits over loans expanded to $897 billion, and that’s nearly two times the $450 billion we had pre-pandemic. You can see that on the upper left-hand side of Slide 8. We continue to have a mix of cash, available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities, and this quarter our combination of cash and AFS is now 52% of the total $1.2 trillion noted on this page. You’ll also notice the continued change in mix of the shorter term portfolio as we again lower cash and increase AFS securities that are mostly hedged and at similar yields to the cash. Note also the hold-to-maturity book continues to decline from pay downs. In total, the hold-to-maturity book is now down $96 billion from its peak and consists of about $122 billion in treasuries and about $458 billion in mortgage-backed securities, along with $7 billion of other securities. Lastly, a blended cash and securities yield of 360 basis points continued to rise and remained about 168 basis points above the rate we paid for deposits. The replacement of lower earning assets into higher yielding assets continues to provide an ongoing benefit to NII. Let’s turn our focus to NII performance using Slide 9, where you can see on a fully tax-equivalent basis NII was $14.2 billion. Good deposit growth provided a strong start to the year for NII, and as Brian noted, NII of $14.2 billion increased by $100 million from the fourth quarter. That compares to our expectation and guidance of a decline of $100 million to $200 million, and that would have resulted in NII this quarter of $13.9 billion to $14 billion, so we did quite a bit better than we had originally expected. The improvement in quarterly NII in Q1 compared to Q4 included the benefits of higher yielding assets and improvement in global markets NII, partially offset by higher deposit cots and one less day in Q1 than 4Q23. Deposit balance activity more generally also aided in the beat versus our expectations. As we look forward for Q2, we expect some modest impact of lower deposits in wealth management as client make their seasonal income tax payments, and we expect global markets NII to decline mostly seasonally a little bit as well, so we expect second quarter NII could approach $14 billion on an FTE basis. Further, we continue to expect that Q2 will be the low point for NII and we expect the back half of 2024 to grow. Compared to our guidance last quarter, we’re obviously growing off a larger base of NII after having outperformed in the first quarter. With regard to that forward view, let me just note a few other caveats. It includes our assumption that interest rates in the forward curve at the end of the quarter materialize, and at the end of first quarter there were still three cuts expected this year, starting in June. Our forward view also includes an expectation of low single-digit loan growth and some moderate growth in deposits as we move into the back half of 2024. Given our recent deposit and loan performance, we continue to feel good about these assumptions. Turning to asset sensitivity and focused on a forward yield curve basis, our sensitivity to the plus and minus-100 basis points parallel shift in the forward curve at March 31 remains well balance. Let’s turn to expense, and we’ll use Slide 10 for that discussion, where we reported $17.2 billion expense this quarter including the FDIC assessment. Adjusted for the assessment, expenses were $16.5 billion and the increase over the fourth quarter included a little more than $400 million in seasonal payroll tax expense, as well as higher revenue-related costs and, to a lesser extent, annual merit increases and other annual awards, like sharing success awards provided this quarter. $16.5 billion was just a little above our forecast for Q1 which we made last quarter, and the increase is driven by better than expected fee revenue across wealth management, investment banking, and sales and trading, and as Brian said, that’s a trade-off we’re more than happy to make, bringing more earnings to the bottom line. While expense is up almost 2% from last year, we simply remind you inflation is up by more than 4% and we’ve increased our investment, and we’re paying for the revenue growth, so we think it represents good work by our teams. As we look forward in Q2, we expect a decline from the Q1 level as we typically see about two-thirds of the Q1 elevate payroll tax expense come back out, and the remainder of the year expense is expected to trend down. Continued digital engagement savings and operational excellent initiatives should help us offset other cost increases for people and technology through the back half of the year. Turning to credit on Slide 11, provision expense was $1.3 billion in the first quarter, and that included $179 million of reserve release due to a modestly improved macro environment outlook as the baseline consensus expectations improved from the fourth quarter. On a weighted basis, we remain reserved for an unemployment rate of nearly 5% by the end of 2025 compared to the most recent actual 3.8% rate. Net charge-offs of $1.5 billion increased $306 million from the fourth quarter, driven by continued credit card seasoning and commercial real estate office exposures as swift revaluations from current appraisals and resolutions drove higher charge-offs. The net charge-off ratio was 58 basis points, a 13 basis point increase from the fourth quarter. On Slide 12, we show you the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs increased $150 million versus the fourth quarter from the flow-through of higher late stage credit card delinquencies. We included a credit card delinquency slide, No. 28 in our appendix, and we’re encouraged by the trend of delinquencies because the late stage increases slowed and early stage delinquencies improved as well, and that leads us to believe we should begin to see consumer net charge-offs start to level out over the next quarter or so. All of this is still well within our risk appetite and our expectations, and it’s consistent with the normalization of credit we discussed with you in prior calls. Commercial net charge-offs increased $191 million versus the fourth quarter, driven by commercial real estate losses and office exposures. On office losses this quarter, we recorded charge-offs on 16 office loans. Four were a result of sales activity, i.e. final resolution, seven were from losses that we expect on exposures that are in the process of expected resolution in the course of the next 90 days, and the rest we took as a result of refreshed valuations. We use a continuous and thorough loan-by-loan analysis and we’re quick to recognize impacts in the commercial real estate office space through our risk ratings, and that’s resulted in several downgrades in the last few quarters. As a result of these quick actions and our downgrades in categorization, we’ve also refreshed the valuation of our reservable criticized properties, and we’ve taken appropriate reserves and charge-offs in the process. Roughly one-third of our office exposure is now categorized as reservable criticized, and importantly the pace of the increase in reservable criticized exposures has slowed each quarter since the second quarter of last year, so we believe the losses on these office properties have been front-loaded and largely reserved. We expect the losses to move lower in the second quarter and we expect a notable decline in the second half of the year when compared to the first half of this year, absent any material change in expected real estate prices. In the appendix on Slide 29, we’ve included a current view of our commercial real estate and office portfolio metrics, as we usually do. Let’s turn to the various lines of business and offer some brief comments on their results, starting on Slide 13 with consumer banking. For the quarter, consumer banking earned $2.7 billion on continued strong organic growth. The reported earnings declined 15% year-over-year as revenue declined from lower deposit balances compared to the first quarter of ’23. Credit card loss normalization also caused year-over-year provision expense to increase. As Brian noted, customer activity showed another strong quarter of net new checking growth, another strong period of card openings, and investment balances for consumer clients which climbed 29% year-over-year to a record $456 billion. That included market appreciation and also very strong full-year flows of $44 billion. As noted earlier, loans grew nicely year-over-year from credit card as well as small business, where we remain the industry leader. Expenses were flat year-over-year, fighting off inflation, merit increases, higher minimum wages, and new and renovated financial centers and technology investments, so holding expense flat reflected very good work by the consumer team. As you can see on the appendix, Page 20, digital adoption and engagement continued to improve, reaching a record of $3.4 billion digital log-ins in the quarter, and it showed good year-over-year improvement. Customer satisfaction scores at near record levels illustrate the continued appreciation of the enhanced capabilities we provide. Moving to wealth management on Slide 14, we produced good results, and that included good organic client activity, market favorability and strong flows. Our comprehensive suite of investment and advisory services coupled with a commitment to personalized wealth management planning and solutions has enabled us to meet the diverse needs and aspirations of our clients. In first quarter, we reported record revenue of $5.6 billion and a little more than $1 billion in net income. That net income was 10% from the first quarter of ’23. The business generated positive operating leverage and grew revenue faster than expense, while improving the pre-tax margin year-over-year. While overall average loans were down year-over-year, driven by the securities-based lending, it’s worth noting the strong growth we’re seeing in custom lending, and ending loans in the wealth management custom loan book are up 6% year-over-year. As Brian noted earlier, both Merrill and the private bank continued to see strong organic growth and produce good assets under management flows of more than $60 billion since the first quarter of ’23, which reflects a good mix of new client money, as well as existing clients putting money to work. Expense growth here matched the revenue growth, otherwise fighting off higher investment costs and inflation. Let me also highlight the continued digital momentum here. As an example, Merrill has 86% of its clients now engaging with us digitally and 80% utilizing e-delivery. 76% of their eligible accounts are now opened digitally, so the cost for us to open is half and the customer cycle times are improved greatly. On Slide 15, you’ll see our global banking results, and the business produced earnings of just less than $2 billion, down 22% year-over-year as improved investment banking fees and treasury services revenue were overcome by lower net interest income and higher provision expense. Revenue declined 4% driven by the impact of interest rates and deposit rotation to interest-bearing, and that impacted NII. The diversification of our revenue across products and regions continues to reflect the strength in this platform, and GTS and investment banking fees are good examples. In our global treasury services business, some of the NII pressure from higher rates on deposits is offset by the fees paid for moving and managing the cash of clients, and that continues to grow with existing clients as well as with new client generation. As Brian noted, investment banking had a strong quarter, and at $1.6 billion in investment banking fees, this quarter was the strongest quarter in seven years, absent the pandemic 2020 and 2021 periods. An increase in provision expense included the commercial real estate net charge-offs I discussed earlier, as well as a larger reserve release in the prior year period. Expense increased 2% year-over-year, including the 35% lift in investment banking fees from the first quarter of ’23. Switching to global markets on Slide 16, we’ll focus our comments on results excluding DVA, as we normally do. The team had another terrific quarter with $1.8 billion in earnings, growing 7% year-over-year. Revenue improved 6% from the first quarter of ’23 and return on average allocated capital was 16%. Focusing on sales and trading ex-DVA, revenue improved 2% year-over-year to $5.2 billion, which is the highest first quarter result in over a decade. FICC was down 4% while equities increased 15% compared to the first quarter of ’23. The decline in the FICC revenues versus the first quarter was driven by a weaker macro trading quarter that was partially offset by better mortgage trading results. Equities was driven by strong trading results in derivatives, and year-over-year expenses were up 4% from continued investment in the business. Finally on Slide 17, all other shows a loss of $700 million driven by the FDIC assessment. Revenue declined year-over-year, reflecting higher investment tax credit yields, and expense adjusted for the FDIC assessment was down $133 million, driven by lower unemployment processing costs.

You can see that slowing now. The rest of our business, if you look at the exhibit we put together on deposits, if you look at that bottom left chart on wealth, you’ll see it slowed and grew this quarter.

As you also well know, when the revenue growth is coming through the wealth management business, which by definition because of the way the compensation process works, has a lowest efficiency ratio in the company, that’s a good thing because it grows and we get good profitability growth out of it. But we’re fighting that trend, and as one of the largest wealth management businesses in the world, if not--you know, it’s a higher percentage of our revenues in our expense base, and so we’re continuing to drive it down. We’re at 64, you’d expect that to improve as the deposit balance is stabilized for many quarters now and starting to grow. The rate paid has really flattened out sequentially by quarter, and the yield of the portfolio and the yield of the assets continues to grow, so we feel good about how it’s going.

Remember that one of the things we all have to be careful about is in the global banking area, the way the fees are paid and earnings credit, it messes up the simplicity of non-interest bearing and interest-bearing, so it’s complex. But if you look at the quarters coming across from the first quarter of ’23 through the first quarter of ’24, you can see that you’re seeing the rate of change slow dramatically and kind of settle in. A lot of the money has moved. If you look at the seven-day average for consumer, going all the way back to the early part of October, it’s been relatively stable at $950 billion, $960 billion, so we’re just getting through the tax season and the ins and outs in the wealth management business and consumer, people paying taxes out on the wealthier side and receiving benefits on the tax refund side, so as we stabilize in that, we expect it to grow. We don’t expect a massive change in how the deposits are structured from what’s in money markets, what’s in savings, what’s in checking and that. It’s really slowed down and been relatively stable, so things jump around but it’s all very good value. Even the highest paid balances in the wealth management business are good value for the company.

All in, that gives you want you see in consumer, which is at the end of the day a couple hundred million dollars above where it was pre-pandemic. But the people have moved, and you’re seeing it month to month relatively stable as we track that every month on both sides, frankly.

We’ve talked about the fact that the net interest yield, obviously, this quarter benefits from the NII growth, so you’re getting in the numerator; but we inflated the denominator in terms of the average earning assets last year as we just made the balance sheet more liquid, so that’s going to allow us to continue as deposits grow to grow the net interest income over time without necessarily growing the other earning assets. Q2, we’ll have a little more of a challenge, but going forward I expect all the NII improvement in Q3 and Q4 to drop into that net interest yield, and part of things supporting that, John, as you pointed out, is we do have loans re-pricing. Because we’ve got loans coming off the balance sheet, we’re booking new loans at higher rates, so that’s one element. The second element is we’ve got securities that we’re re-investing underneath all this too, so obviously we’re sweeping the hold-to-maturity pay downs and reinvesting those at much higher rates.

I think the important thing we’re trying to convey is because of the continued stability in pricing rotation and because of this continued stability in deposits, we feel like that extra couple hundred million in Q1 is something that should flow through in Q2, Q3 and Q4, and then there will be a second dynamic to watch for as well, Betsy, which is if we have less rate cuts, we’re going to benefit from that. We won’t necessarily benefit a lot in Q2 because there isn’t enough cuts or time in Q2, but I think by the time we get to Q3 and Q4, we’ll know more about the rate structure at that point and we’ll be able to tell you more about what we expect for the growth in the back half of the year, but we’re reasonably optimistic there.",202.0,77.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.06493506493506493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06493506493506493

But that’s not going to last forever because, as you point out, the economy powers through at 3%, 3.5%, whatever it end ups being, loan growth is going to catch up to that over time.

The question will become why are rates higher, like what’s going on in the economy? Are we talking about inflation, is it under control, is it coming down? Right now, that appears to be the case, so that’s obviously a good place. The Fed’s in a good place because they appear to have rates that are a real rate that is high enough to make sure that inflation stays in a good place. Things can change, Matt, so an awful lot will depend upon just the why for rates; but generally speaking, if it’s just because it’s taken a little while longer for the inflation to nudge down before the next set of cuts, that’s probably a good environment for us. I would expect us to perform relatively better than we’ve disclosed so far. Then you’re asking a second question, which is around what does the sensitivity look like to plus-100 or minus-100. We’ve tried to just make sure that we continue to stay balanced. If anything, that corridor of plus-100, minus-100 has gotten narrower and narrower over time as we’re trying to lock in NII that’s $4 billion or $5 billion higher per quarter today than it was three years ago, and just make sure that the shareholder benefits from that through the course of time. We’ll see how the environment plays out - it’s only been a quarter since we were last here talking about six cuts. Now it’s three, so we just have to watch this play out and stay patient.

As we moved through the post-financial crisis, we had--in terms of that chart, if you looked at it, you had a lot of loans that we’d ran off because they weren’t core loans anymore, and it kind of troughed out at the $900 billion level and then grew out from there. In 2015, that’s when we started driving responsible growth. It was a call to grow now that we’d pushed out a lot of stuff from the financial crisis and got it behind us. The loans then start picking up, but if you remember back then, I think we had almost $300 billion, if I remember right, and if you looked at the slide on loans and the non line of business loans, they were $200 billion or something like that, and it’s down to $10 billion, so think about that dimension. As we ran that down and could grow, we could overcome it, and so then on the growth on loan side, it’s driven by discipline, where we want to play, and the card business is getting it positioned right. Now we can start to push from there, whether it’s on home equity business, on the auto loan business. On the commercial side, it was--we had less issues after the financial crisis in commercial, but kind of getting through all that, it was getting to the credit quality we wanted. A source of great growth for us from 2010 and beyond has been we probably gone from, I don’t know, $20 billion, $30 billion of outstanding loans in the international part of Matthew’s business [indiscernible] to almost $100 billion type of number, so expansion of our international capabilities and downright great credit work by Jeff Green and the team and Bruce Thompson and the team, so put all that together, that’s the loan side. On the deposit side, it really started with a focus that began really prior to--in the middle of the financial crisis and beyond, where we said we’re going to go for core checking accounts in consumer, primary checking accounts, drive customer satisfaction, drive organic growth, and not care about the number of sales as much as the net growth in net sales. As the team, Dee and Thong over time in there, and then Holly now have continued to push that, adding a million-ish net new checking accounts all core, we’ve gone from 60% core to 92%. We’ve got customer satisfaction to the highest levels ever, in the mid-80s, top two [indiscernible], etc., attrition down to lowest ever, preferred rewards kicked in, and all that has led to higher and higher balance retention per account, and then also more accounts. We’ve probably grown in the consumer from, I think, around $300 billion at the beginning of 2010, 2011 to now $900 billion. Now, there’s economic growth and economy growth, but that’s way outsized, and that’s what’s driven the real value of the deposit franchise. Then wealth management - again, after Merrill putting it together and then driving the core aspects between the team there has kept us up to $300 billion, that’s from 200 and something pre-pandemic and probably less than that - I think it was 200 at the time of the merger, so all these things are just part of it, and the GTS business, investments in that have driven those products, so that spread is high and growing again, which is kind of counterintuitive to the narrative that even one of your colleagues mentioned earlier, which is leave aside all the quantitative tightening and all the interest rates and all the stuff that’s supposed to happen, quarter after quarter we’re now growing the amount of deposits over the top of the loans, and the loans hopefully will kick back in and grow a little faster. But they still won’t use a lot of those balances up, and so we feel very good about that position, and those deposits, as you can see on the bottom of Page 8 on the left-hand side, all-in cost is under 93 basis points against a Fed funds rate of 5.5, and the rate of change in those deposit prices has flattened out to be very modest quarter over quarter.

That is a multi-year process of building up not only the balance sheet and capital committed to the business, but importantly also the investments in systems and technology and risk management and those things, they continue to make money almost every trading day over the last several years, so that’s where we’d like to use it, supporting that business and supporting the loan business, supporting all the businesses. The reality is outside of the capital markets business, then you go to loan growth and the kind of loan growth in the mid single digits, that doesn’t eat a lot of the capital up, so then it’s just there to be returned, and so we’ve got two basic phenomena. One is we store-housed a bunch of capital, if you think about the last few years, between the changes in CCAR a few years ago that changed the capital dimension, then the proposed rules and then now whatever happens with it, so they were sort of sit in the pandemic. Before that, we were sitting on a fair amount of capital - that should be released over time here, and then secondly the question will be what those rules are going forward, and then third will be what do you need to support the business, which again that’s our primary responsibility. But generally, that is a modest amount of capital, and so most of our desire is really deploy more expenses in technology investments, and we’ve gone from $3 billion to $3.8 billion in annual technology investments across the last couple years with more branches, but that’s more of an expense question than a capital question, Jim.",320.0,142.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.007042253521126761,0.02112676056338028,0.014084507042253521,0.007042253521126761,0.007042253521126761,-0.014084507042253521

Before I begin today, I just want to reflect a second on the horrible events this weekend. We at Bank of America are clear that there's no place for political violence in our great country, and we continue to wish the former President Trump a speedy recovery. And our thoughts, of course, go out to the victims and their families and others impacted by this terrible event. With that, let's turn attention to the results for the second quarter of 2024 at Bank of America Corporation. This quarter, we achieved success in a number of areas, underscoring the benefits of our diversity and the dedication of our team to deliver responsible growth. Our organic growth engine continues to add customers and activity to all our businesses, even as we see the drop in net interest income this quarter. I'm starting on slide two. Our net income for the quarter was $6.9 billion after tax or $0.83 in diluted EPS. Attesting to the balance in our franchise, the earnings were split evenly, half in our consumer and GWIM businesses, which serve people, and the other half in our institutional-focused business global banking and markets. We grew revenue from the second quarter of 2023 as improvement in non-interest income overcame the decline in net interest income. Fees grew 6% year-over-year and represented 46% of total revenue in the quarter. Our strong fee performance was led by a 14% improvement in asset management fees in our wealth management businesses. We grew investment banking fees 29% year-over-year and saw sales and trading revenue increase 7%. Global Markets had its 9th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in sales and trading revenue, a good job by Jimmy DeMare and his team. Card and service charge revenue also grew by 6% year-over-year in our Consumer business. Much of this fee growth is a result of our intensity around organic growth, and is a testament to the diversity of our operating model. Now on to slide three. Organic growth has been driven by several key factors. First, we focus on our customers. We continue to place them at the center of everything we do. Consumer led the way in delivering solid organic growth with high-quality accounts and engaged clients. For the 22nd consecutive quarter, we had significant net new consumer checking accounts. We expanded our customer base and our market share. Specifically, we added 278,000 net new checking accounts this quarter, which brings our first six months of 2024 to more than 500,000. In wealth management, we added another 6,100 new relationships this quarter. In our commercial businesses, we added 1,000s of small businesses and 100s of commercial banking relationships. This has led to now managing $5.7 trillion in client balances, loans, deposits, and investments across the consumer and wealth management client segments. In those areas, we saw flows of $58 billion in the past four quarters. Our emphasis on personalized financial solutions and superior customer service has strengthened customer loyalty, attracted new clients across all our businesses. Our focus on providing liquidity and risk management solutions to our institutional clients positions to continue to gain more share of the wallet as well. Second, we continue to deliver innovative digital solutions. One of the primary contributors of both attracting and retaining customers to our platforms is our digital banking capabilities for our clients across all the businesses. Our fully integrated consumer banking investment app drives the utility for our customers across their investment and consumer accounts. Our use of stats are strong proof points. Our second language capabilities in our consumer businesses further enhance our customers' capabilities. You can see the continued digital growth in the slides on pages 26, 28, and 30 in the appendix. A couple highlights. Our consumer mobile banking app now serves more than 47 million active users. They logged in 3.5 billion times this quarter. We also continue to see more sales through the use of our digital properties. Digital sales represented 53% of our total sales in the past quarter in our consumer businesses. 23 million consumers are now using Zelle. They send money on Zelle at nearly 2.5 times the rate they write checks. And, in fact, more Zelle transactions -- send transactions take place than a combination of customer ATM transactions, cash withdrawals, and tellers. Simply put, Zelle has become a dominant way to move money. In our wealth management business, we are seeing more banking accounts being opened to complement the investment business those clients do with us. Importantly, these clients are also recognizing the ease of our digital banking capability. 75% of our new accounts and our Merrill teammates were open digitally. 87% of our global banking clients also are digitally active. We have innovated and significantly streamlined service requests by enabling clients to directly initiate and track transaction inquiries within our awarded CashPro platform, using AI to accomplish that. Third, we continue to make core strategic investments in our businesses. We're not complacent with the success you see on this page. We continue to strategically invest in our core businesses. A few examples, while we have the leading retail deposit share in America, we continue to invest and have opened 11 new financial centers this quarter -- in this first-half of the year and renovated another 243. This is an investment in both our expansion markets and our growth markets. In wealth management, we continue to invest in our advisor development program. It's grown to 2,300 teammates, allowing us to continuously add more than -- teammates to our 18,000 strong best-in-class financial advisory force across all our wealth management businesses. We're also adding teams of experienced advisors strategically in areas across the country. In our banking teams, we continue to add to our regional investment banking team. We now have more than 200 regional bankers across the country to better serve our commercial clients, and they complement our industry coverage to our corporate clients. In our global markets business, we continue to extend balance sheet to our clients in adding expertise and talent to continue to lead our market share improvements seen over the last several years. We also have increased our technology initiatives and expect to spend nearly $4 billion on technology initiatives this year. We have focused projects around artificial intelligence enhancements with both clients and our teammates. A recent example of our use of AI is our advisor and client insights tool. We've delivered more than 6 million insights here today to our financial advisors, providing them proactive reasons to engage our clients. AI has moved from cost savings ideas to enhancing the quality of our customer interactions. Fourth, organic growth is driving integrated flows across our business. We invest heavily in each line of business that compete in the markets based on their particular customer segment. But importantly, we also invest across our lines of business to knit them together and gain market share in the local markets. It's a differentiated advantage for us, our banking leadership position across our businesses and our nationwide franchise. For example, we leverage our franchise by connecting business customers with wealth management teams. Our teams across all our businesses have made 4 million referrals to other businesses in the first six months of this year. Next, we drive efficiency and effectiveness, and that's through our operational excellence platform. We continue to invest heavily in the future of our franchise and growth, while we also have to manage expenses day-to-day. Our focus on operational excellence has enabled us to hold our expense growth up to 2% year-over-year, well below the inflation rates. We continue to work to achieve operating leverages as NII stabilizes and begins to grow again. As you look at it now, Alistair will explain later, a fair portion of the year-over-year increase in expense is due to the formulaic incentives of wealth management due to the peak growth of that business. And last, our capital strength allows us to deliver for all our stakeholders. Our capital remains strong as we held our CET1 ratio at 11.9% this quarter. We grew loans, increased our share repurchases to $3.5 billion and paid $1.9 billion in dividends. Average diluted shares dropped below 8 billion shares outstanding. In addition, we also announced our intent to increase our quarterly dividend 8% upon board approval. Note that with 11.9% CET1 ratio, we remain in a solid excess capital position, both above the current regulatory requirements and the increased requirement to 10.7% beginning in October as a result of the recent CCAR exam. Let's turn to slide four. A couple things to note here. First, we've noted for several quarters that the second quarter NII would be the trough for this rate cycle. We expect NII to grow in the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year. Alistair is going to provide you some points in detail about the path forward. One of the important contributors to that change is deposit behaviors of our customers. On slide four, you'll note that average deposits grew 2% year-over-year and increased modestly linked quarter. The second quarter, in reality, is typically a heavy outflow quarter. We have a lot of customers who pay a lot of taxes in that quarter. Quarter-over-quarter increases in rates paid continue to slow again this quarter across all businesses except for wealth management. And we show you that on this page, slide four, by line of business. While wealth business deposit rates have moved higher with continued rotation, we expect those rates to begin to stabilize and the rate of quarterly change to decrease going forward. Turning to slide five, in previous calls, many of you asked questions or commented upon the question about consumer net charge-offs and when would they stabilize in the second-half of 2024. That expectation we have remains unchanged as well. This quarter's net charge-offs were 59 basis points. And for context, this is a stabilization of the rate. I would just remind you that prior to this quarter, I have to go all the way back to 2014 to see a charge-off rate of that high. And that's near when we were still emerging from the financial crisis. On slide four, we highlight the 30 and 90-day-plus credit card delinquency trends, which showed delinquencies have plateaued for the second consecutive quarter. This should lead to stabilized net credit losses in credit card in the second-half of the year. At the bottom of the page, note a couple of facts. First, on the payment rates. This is the rate of paydown on balances in a given month remain 20% above index to the pre-pandemic levels, even while our card customers have plenty of capacity to borrow. And importantly, because we're relation-based businesses, look at the right-hand slide at the bottom of page five. There you can see our deposit investment balances of our customers, who also have a card with us, remain 25% above their pre-pandemic levels, illustrating continued health of these customers. So if you think about consumer credit, the card charge-offs drive it, and they flattened out in terms of delinquencies, and we expect an improvement in the second-half. With regard to commercial real estate, our usual CRA credit exposure slide is included in our appendix. We continue to aggressively work through our loans in our modest CRA office portfolio. We saw a decrease in all the categories, a decrease in reservable criticized loans, a decrease in NPLs, and a decrease in net charge-offs. This supports our previous expectation that net charge-offs in the second-half of 2024 will be lower than the first-half of 2024. Our second quarter performance highlights Bank of America's ability to generate strong, sustainable growth through a combination of customer-centric strategies, innovation, strategic investments, and a commitment to a strong balance of risk and reward. We call that responsible growth. We're confident that focused approach will continue to drive long-term success and create value for you, our shareholders. Now I will turn it to Alistair for additional results.",2019.0,1106.0,47.0,13.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,0.042495479204339964,0.011754068716094032,0.0045207956600361665,0.0018083182640144665,0.0027124773960217,0.03074141048824593
BAC,2024-07-16,2024-07-16,,2024-07-16,2024-07-16T08:30:00-04:00,0,2024-07-16,prepared,,Alastair Borthwick,"Thank you, Brian, and I'm going to start on slide six of the earnings presentation. I'll touch on more highlights noted on slide six as we work through the material. I just want to say upfront that we delivered strong returns with return on average assets of 85 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of nearly 14%. So let's move to the balance sheet on slide seven, where you can see we ended the quarter at $3.26 trillion of total assets, relatively unchanged from the first quarter. And not much to note here apart from a mixed shift of lower securities balances, mostly offset by an increase in reverse repo and modest loan growth, as well as global markets client activity. On the funding side, deposits declined $36 billion on an ending basis, reflecting typical seasonal customer payments of income taxes. And as Brian noted, average deposits were still modestly higher. Liquidity remained strong with $909 billion of global liquidity sources that was flat compared to the first quarter. Shareholders' equity was also flat compared to Q1, as earnings were offset by $5.4 billion in capital distributed to shareholders and a $1.9 billion redemption of preferred stock in the quarter. The $5.4 billion of capital contributions included $1.9 billion in common dividends and the repurchase of $3.5 billion in shares. AOCI improved modestly in the quarter and tangible book value per share of $25.37 rose 9% from the second quarter of last year. In terms of regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $198 billion and the CET1 ratio was stable at 11.9%. This 11.9% ratio remained well above our current 10% requirement, as well as our new 10.7% requirement as of October 1, 2024. Risk-weighted assets increased modestly and that was driven by lending activity. Our supplemental leverage ratio was 6% versus our minimum requirement of 5% and that leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. And our $468 billion of TLAC means our total loss-absorbing capital ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Brian already covered deposit trends, so let's turn the balance sheet focus to loans and we'll look at average balances on slide eight. You can see average loans in Q2 of $1.051 trillion. They improved 1% year-over-year, driven by 5% credit card growth and modest commercial growth. The modest improvement in overall commercial loans included a 2% increase in our domestic commercial loans and leases, partially offset by a 4% decline in commercial real estate. Middle market lending saw an uptick in the quarter, and we saw good demand in our wealth businesses from custom lending. These areas of growth were largely offset by continued paydowns from our larger corporate clients on interest rate sentiment. Consumer growth was driven by credit card borrowing, and while home lending balances were flattish, originations picked up a bit this quarter. Lastly, and on a positive note, loan spreads continued to widen. As we turn our focus then to NII performance and slide nine, note that we moved the slide we typically use to talk about excess deposits to the appendix on slide 22, so you can see that there. Our excess deposit levels above loans remained high at $850 billion and continue to be a good source of value for shareholders. 52% of our excess liquidity is now in short-dated cash and available for sale securities. The longer-dated, lower-yielding hold-to-maturity book continues to roll off, and we reinvested again this quarter in higher-yielding assets. The blended yield of cash and securities continued to improve in the quarter and is now 160 basis points above our deposit rate paid. Regarding NII, on a GAAP [Technical Difficulty]",594.0,341.0,11.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.03225806451612903,0.011730205278592375,0.005865102639296188,0.002932551319648094,0.011730205278592375,0.020527859237536656
BAC,2024-07-16,2024-07-16,,2024-07-16,2024-07-16T08:30:00-04:00,0,2024-07-16,prepared,,Alastair Borthwick,"[Technical Difficulty] will materialize. And this now includes three interest rate cuts, starting in September, another in November, and one more in December. And the waterfall shows an estimated impact of those rate cuts to our quarterly NII. The next couple of categories are a result of natural management of interest rate risk in a balance sheet mixed with fixed-rate assets and variable-rate assets. And our balance sheet is split roughly half and half. So we take in liquidity from customers that we use to fund our assets, and then we store excess liquidity in cash and securities. We have fixed assets that mature and pay down, and those supply cash that then gets put back to work on the balance sheet and reprices over time. And we have two basic categories of fixed assets that mature and pay off, and those are securities and loans. On securities, you can see we've got about $10 billion a quarter of cash coming off of our securities portfolio, and we gain roughly 300 basis points of improvement on those assets when we put that money back on the balance sheet. On loans, between resi, mortgage, and auto, we've got another roughly $10 billion, which reprices with a little less yield improvement than securities. And between the securities and loans, we expect a fixed-rate asset repricing adds about $300 million to our quarterly rate of NII as we get to the fourth quarter. On the variable rate asset side, and to protect from down moves in rates, we hedge some of that with cash flow swaps. And those typically roll off in any given quarter and get replaced over time. So included in the cash flow hedges is an impact of cessation of BSBY as an alternative rate. If you recall, we took a charge in the fourth quarter of ‘23. It was $1.6 billion, and we said that would come back to us through time. And beginning in November, we start to see the benefit coming back into NII. And in Q4, that's about $200 million. That Q4 partial quarter benefit will grow by a slightly smaller sequential NII benefit in Q1 ‘25. And then it begins to taper off heading into 2026. In addition, we've got about $150 billion of received fixed cash flow hedges, protecting us from short rate moves moving over. Most are hedging floating rate commercial loans. And the cost of those hedges is reported as contra revenue in commercial loan interest income. These hedges have a weighted average life of just over two years. And they've got an average fixed rate of approximately 250 basis points. So starting in the second-half of 2025, we begin to get some additional NII tailwind, because the cash flow hedges with lower fixed rate likes where we receive, those will begin to roll off, and will likely replace those at higher current market rates at the time. The actual size of the tailwind we'll get from the expiration of those swaps will obviously be highly dependent on the level and the shape of the yield curve at the time of those maturities. And that stretches out over the course of the next four years. Okay, a couple other points to make. You'll note we don't expect much movement around our modestly, liability sensitive global markets NII activity. And lastly, our forward view has an expectation of low-single-digit growth in loans, low-single-digit growth in deposits, with continued slowing of rate paid movement through the back half of 2024. And you can see our expectation of the combined impact here as well. This last element is the one that has the most potential variability. And obviously, it will depend upon actual deposit and loan growth, and pricing and rotation. Okay, let's turn to expense and we'll use slide 11 for the discussion. We reported $16.3 billion of expense this quarter. And that's more than $900 million lower than Q1, which included $700 million for the FDIC special assessment. Not including the FDIC assessment, expenses were lower than Q1 by $229 million, driven by seasonally lower payroll tax expense. Compared to Q2 ‘23, we're up less than 2%. And that increase is equal to the incentives paid for improved fee revenue. Incentives for our GWIN business alone are up $200 million year-over-year. And that's obviously an expense we're happy to pay when we have a 14% improvement in fees for assets under management. Our second quarter headcount number included welcoming a diverse class of nearly 2,000 summer interns we hope will join us over the course of the next year or two upon their graduation. And absent those interns, our headcount fell by nearly 2,000. In the third quarter, we expect to add approximately 2,500 college graduates for full time. More than -- and that's from more than 120,000 applications received, showing that we remain an employer of choice for talented young people. Expense levels for the rest of 2024 are expected to bounce around this second quarter level, given the higher fee revenue and investments made for growth. So let's now move to credit and we'll turn to slide 12. There was little change in our asset quality metrics this quarter. Provision expense was $1.5 billion. That was $189 million higher than Q1, driven by a smaller reserve release in Q2. Net charge offs of $1.5 billion were little changed, with a small increase in credit card, mostly offset by lower commercial real estate office charge offs. On a weighted basis, we remain reserved for an employment rate of nearly 5% by the end of 2025, compared to the most recent 4.1% rate reported. The net charge off ratio was 59 basis points, largely unchanged for Q1. On slide 13, we highlight more credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs increased by a modest $31 million versus the first quarter from the flow-through of higher late-stage credit card delinquencies from Q1. Highlighting the change in direction of delinquencies, consumer 90-day-plus delinquencies declined in 2Q by $57 million. Commercial net charge-offs were relatively flat as lower commercial real estate losses were mostly offset by a small increase in other commercial loans. Our office losses went from $304 million in Q1 to $226 million in Q2. Other commercial real estate loan losses were simply one hotel. Okay, let's move to the various lines of business and some brief comments on their results, and I'll start on slide 14 with consumer banking. For the quarter, consumer earned $2.6 billion on continued strong organic growth, and reported earnings declined 9% year-over-year as revenue declined from lower deposit balances, compared to the second quarter of last year. Customer activity showed another strong quarter, net new checking growth, another strong period of card openings, and investment balances for consumer clients, which climbed 23% year-over-year to a new record $476 billion. That included 12 months of strong flows at $38 billion in addition to market appreciation over the time. As noted earlier, loans grew nicely year-over-year from credit card, as well as small business where we remained the industry leader. The team held expense flat year-over-year, reflecting good work with continued business investments for growth, offset by the operational excellence work to improve processes and move more of our transactions to digital. And as you can see on the appendix page 26, digital adoption and engagement continue to improve, and customer satisfaction scores remain near record levels, illustrating customer appreciation of our enhanced capabilities due to our continuous investment. Moving to wealth management on slide 15, we produced good results, and those included good organic client activity, market favorability, and strong AUM flows, and this quarter also saw good lending results. Our comprehensive suite of investment and advisory services, coupled with our commitment to personalized wealth management planning and solutions, has enabled us to meet the diverse needs and aspirations of our clients. Net income rose 5% from the second quarter of last year to a little more than $1 billion. In Q2, we reported revenue of $5.6 billion, growing 6% over the prior year. As Brian noted, a strong 14% growth in fee revenue from investment and brokerage services overcame the NII headwind. Expense growth reflects the fee growth and other investments for future. The business had a 25% margin, and it generated a strong return on capital of more than 22%. Average loans were up 2% year-over-year, driven by strong growth we're seeing in custom lending and a pickup in mortgage lending. Both Merrill and the Private Bank continue to see good organic growth, and they produced strong assets under management flows of $58 billion since last year's second quarter, which reflects a mix of new client money, as well as existing clients putting more of their money to work. I also want to highlight the continued digital momentum in this business, and you can find that on slide 28. On slide 16, we turn to Global Banking results. And here, the business produced earnings of $2.1 billion, down 20% year-over-year, as improved investment banking fees and treasury services revenue were overcome by lower net interest income and higher provision expense. Revenue declined 6%, driven by the impact of interest rates and deposit rotation. The diversified revenue across products and regions reflects the strength of our Global Banking franchise. In our GTS business, fees for managing the cash of clients offsets a lot of the NII pressure from higher rates, and clients are accessing the capital markets for their capital needs instead of borrowing. Investment banking had a strong quarter, growing fees 29% year-over-year to nearly $1.6 billion, led by debt capital markets fees, mostly in leveraged finance and investment grade. And we finished the quarter strong, maintaining our number three investment banking fee position globally. A solid start to 2024 has left us in a good position, with top three rankings now in North America, Latin America, and EMEA, and number six in APAC. And we're seeing strong performance in important industry groups as well. An increase in provision expense from last year was driven by the commercial real estate net charge-offs I discussed earlier, and expense increased 3% year-over-year, including continued investment in the business. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 17, I'll focus my comments on results, excluding DVA as I normally do. The team had another terrific quarter as we generated good revenue growth and achieved operating leverage and continued to deliver a solid return on capital. Earnings of $1.4 billion grew 19% year-over-year, and return on average allocated capital was 13%. Revenue, and again, this is ex-DVA, improved 10% from the second quarter of 2023. Focusing on sales and trading, ex-DVA, revenue improved 7% year-over-year to $4.7 billion, and that's the highest second quarter in over a decade. FICC was down 1%, while equities increased 20% compared to Q2 '23. FICC revenues remained strong, and versus Q2 '23, they were modestly lower, driven by a weaker macro trading quarter in FX and rates, and that was largely offset by better commodities and mortgage trading. Equities was driven by strong trading results in derivatives and cash equities. Year-over-year expenses were up 4% on revenue improvement and continued investment in the business. Finally, on Slide 18, all other shows a loss of $0.3 billion, and that was little changed year-over-year, as lower expense was offset by lower provision costs as a result of reserve changes. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 9%, and excluding discrete items and the tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, the effective tax rate would have been 25%. And with that, I think we'll stop there, and we'll jump into questions.",1936.0,1088.0,41.0,17.0,15.0,0.0,3.0,8.0,5.0,13.0,0.03768382352941176,0.015625,0.013786764705882353,0.0,0.0027573529411764708,0.022058823529411766

So at the point at which it got interrupted, I just want to reiterate a couple of points that Alistair was making. If you go back to slide nine, where I think we lost the audio, was where we started beginning a discussion about the performance from Q1 to Q2 of net interest income. That was driven by higher funding costs and the rotation of deposits seeking higher yield alternatives. And while higher again in Q2, both the rotation and the rate paid increases did continue to slow down. On the slide 10, I think the only points that I would make that Alistair began to discuss there was, we are just reiterating our expectation that quarter two would be the bottom for the NII in the rate cycle that we have been in. And our trajectory remains the same, the belief that our NII will begin to rise in Q3 compared to Q2 and then rise again in Q4. We provided the range of expectations that Alistair covered. And we expect Q4 NII to be around the $14.5 billion level, plus or minus. That would be approximately 4% to 5% higher than this quarter's NII. And he began that discussion by making sure that you know that we pick up an extra day of net interest income in the Q3, providing about $125 million of additional NII that also carries through into Q4. You see that on the slide. It also assumes that the current forward curve will materialize. That says that interest rate cuts will start in September. We will expect another one in November and December in the curve. And the waterfall includes an estimated impact of those rates to quarterly net interest income. And so then we started the discussion. He began the discussion on the fixed asset repricing, which then I think is where the audio picked back up again. And so we're happy to answer some questions on that. I know you'll have questions, but just wanted to recover that point, those points for you.",364.0,152.0,1.0,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.006578947368421052,0.039473684210526314,0.019736842105263157,0.0,0.0,-0.03289473684210526

I know you would have given us the 2025 NII guide if you wanted to give us one, so feel free to give that if you want, but that's not my question. My question is, given all the pieces of the puzzle that you gave us expectations for modest loan and deposit growth and slowing deposit-seeking behavior, if you get that 4% pickup from 2Q to 4Q this year that you're expecting, right now or at least recently, consensus had NII looking flattish with that fourth quarter number, and that doesn't make a lot of sense given all the pieces.

We're probably not going to give guidance around 2025 for all the reasons that you would expect. What we're trying to do here is reinforce for everyone what we've been saying from the beginning of the year, and that is we think Q2 is the trough, and we believe from this point we're in a good position to grow. Now, when you look at some of the elements of this bridge, you'll draw your own conclusions with respect to fixed-rate asset pricing is going to persist for some period of time, and you'll be able to draw your own conclusions, but I just want to point out we've been pretty clear on our guidance for Q1 and Q2.

We're going to get some benefit in the immediate term from the BSBY cessation and that leading back into the P&L. As that rolls off, we'll get benefit from cash flow hedges repricing.

We've taken our long-term debt footprint down as we've continued to build the strength of the company. So there's a lot of different ways. It doesn't have to be securities reinvestment.

It's more of going back to this concept of we've got $1.9 trillion of deposits and we've got $1.05 trillion of loans. So we've got $850 billion of excess. So when the excess comes in, we can do a variety of different things. We'd love to put it in loans, but that's always our first -- that's our first love. But in the absence of that, we're going to put it in cash or we're going to put it in available for sale, probably swap to floating for the most part.

If it -- I think honestly, the second quarter is sort of emblematic if you think about last year's second quarter. And this year's second quarter, we went from -- we went up by $300 billion -- $300 million, excuse me. As Alastair said, $200 million was just wealth management incentive comp and other growth was really other incentive comp. So the idea, the pressures we face now are really more due to fee growth in the businesses, which typically have a tighter correlation between fees and expenses and incentive comp related to those fees. So that -- as Alastair said, that's not a -- that's a good expense growth is what you want. It does grow and it grows at a good rate. Headcount is basically been bounced around relatively flat. We're 212 million this quarter and even adding a bunch of summer teammates. We were 215 last year. This quarter, the same summer teammates included. So managing headcount, redeploying people. We have the huge -- the cleanup stuff going on. We have the new initiatives going on, or freeing up work and moving it over. So we feel good about managing the company and that's against inflation rate wages at 3% or 5% going on inflation in all the services we buy in the third-party markets, obviously, that the world experiences. So we feel good about how we're managing expenses. The key is pretty simple. As you -- all the revenue side equation that, yes, Alastair has been talking about their colleagues on NII and stuff is that lifts and expenses stay relatively flat, you start moving towards positive operating leverage. We were minus 1% or something like that this quarter, kind of hanging in there. And we'll expect that to go back to the five-year track we had all the way up until the pandemic hit and things got thrown in the sun.

I think it was Slide 22 you pointed to. Can you share with us as you go forward and assuming the Federal Reserve does cut interest rates, I know you put, I think, free Fed fund rate cuts in your Slide 10. But as we go out into the end of '25, the forward curve is calling for obviously more rate cuts.

Can you be more aggressive in lowering your deposit costs?",103.0,50.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.04,0.0,0.0,-0.02

So we think of our deposit strategies in the context of how our customers utilize our services. And so, if you think about the parts that priced up in Global Banking or the investment-related cash in the Consumer business and Wealth Management, that will come back down as rates come, because the short-term equivalents come down, some is absolutely mechanical because it's actually priced to meet a money market fund equivalent that will happen. And so, yes, I think if you think about us being all in, if you look on that slide at 203 basis points, there'll be some pickup as rates come down in those higher things. The zero interest balance accounts are low-interest checking. You know, they don't really move because there's zero interest or low interest, so they'll be kind of static, but they're still extremely valuable in the current context. So when you think of all the consumer, I think 60 odd basis-points or something, that's driven by the fact that we have $40-odd million transactional primary checking accounts that is growing at $1 million a year, meant, multiple years in a row, $900,000 a million a year that are maturing from $3,000 up to $7,000 or $8,000 in balances as people mature the relationship with us, that's where the tremendous value in the deposit base this company goes. And so if you think about $1.91 trillion having grown $100 billion almost from the trough, you think about it growing linked-quarter, multiple quarters in a row, you think about even as we look now to buy the balances above that amount. Yes, that -- those are good dynamics. So we think about it, but it will move.

And one other question on slide 10 and also I think if I recall your first quarter queue, you guys indicated you were asset sensitive.

That's why the red box obviously is bigger than the green box. It's the market specifically that's liability sensitive. So we're still asset-sensitive, Gerard. What it would take for us is either we can have a lot more rotation into interest-bearing or we could buy some short-dated duration, fixed-rate. So those are the two alternatives. And if you look at the course of time, if you were to go back to our queues over time, you'd see that we've become less and less rate-sensitive overtime. We've really narrowed the corridor of whether rates go up by 100 or down by 100, what could that outcome look like? Narrowed that pretty substantially over time because we're trying to lock in rates here, recognizing that NII is up $4 billion or $5 billion over the course of the past several years per quarter.",161.0,77.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025974025974025976,0.0,0.0,0.0

The last thing I'd say, Gerard, for a person who's been around this business as many years as you have, this has been a very abnormal rate environment for the last 15-years or so. And if you get to where you have a one Fed funds rate 3.5, which is what our experts predict, it sort of stops out at the ability to bring the asset sensitivity tighter and tighter is there because you actually have room to move down without hitting zero floors and stuff. So there's -- and so stability during time periods of which the rate environment doesn't flip around. And then secondly, a higher nominal rate environment allow you to manage to that outcome because part of the other outcome for us is just as rate -- the rate structure is nominally very low is the zero floors kick-in and that creates a amount of sensitivity that over time will go away if rate structure is higher.

It's an expensive view because they've got a fixed-rate mortgage loan and they've got a home equity sitting on top of why wouldn't they use it. I like it for it was only two years. It's been four years or five years since that balance went from $30 billion started declining, so it's good to see. I'll note at the bottom of that page, if you look at year-over-year mortgage production $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion and you look at home equity line production, which is new originations in the boxes, solid. But it is nice to finally see that the actual balances have stabilized and we'll see -- they're kind of flattish, they're not really growing, but it's nice to see them not just keep coming down and hopefully, they'll start to be utilized.

First one is it is slowing, that rotation is slowing and we would expect that because at the end of the day, this is mostly cash in motion, it's transactional accounts, that's why it's non-interest bearing. And the answer why it's a little different this quarter is because of the seasonality of tax payments. For anyone who has a big tax payment due, they frequently just allow it to, they may pull it out of their brokerage account, put it into their -- they may put it into their non-interest-bearing and then they're wiring it out from there.

Obviously, we're still waiting for final rules. Maybe there's a little more volatility in your SCB than you would have thought, but you still got a nice buffer? And then I guess one last piece I was thinking is the remixing of the balance sheet that's been commented kind of throughout this call over time probably causes a little creep in RWAs, right, like loans higher than, say, securities.

So if we need to use it to support RWA growth for loans or something, that's a good outcome and that's what we want to do first. Second, we maintain the 11.9% quarter-to-quarter with a little bit RWA increase, I think that would be emblematic. And we bought $3.5 billion, paid out $1.9 billion in dividends. So you'd expect that kind of to continue on in terms of that basic idea of we don't need a lot of capital to grow, because the RWA demands are met with a fairly straightforward amount. We're earning a nice amount of dollars and we'll deploy it back in the dividend and the buybacks. Well, our job is to maintain -- our view is we will maintain a 50 basis point type of management buffer to whatever the requirements are. The volatility, well, there's a whole different discussion on that in terms of the wisdom of that. But the reality is the volatility is absorbable, because you have time to plan into it and get done within a race we've seen. So whether we agree with the volatility or not, we've easily absorbed it and the new rule is coming out. We'll see what happens and we'll adjust. But just think of this as basically a requirement of 10.7 under the new SCB plus 50 is 11.2. Maybe you get a little tighter if you feel you got great insight to what happens next year. And then I think the finalization of all the three will come through and we'll see what that is and see how that all correlates to the various aspects.

Bank of America continued to demonstrate strength this quarter in an economy that continued to be stable, albeit with slower growth and falling inflation. So many of you asked me from time-to-time what do we see in our own customer -- consumer customer base. As we talked about many times, our consumer payments is an indicator of activity. Those payments were up 4% to 5% year-over-year for the quarter in the total money those consumers moved in the economy. The pace of year-to-year money movement has been steady since late summer this year. After having fallen in the spring and early summer. This growth in consumer payments continues into October. This activity is consistent with how customers are spending money in the 2016 to 2019 timeframe. When the economy was growing, inflation was under control. This report is not meant to gainsay that consumers are worried of the cost of living, worried about higher rates and other matters. But overall activity is fine, unemployment is low and wage growth is steady, both of which bode well for the consumer overall and for consumer asset quality. With respect to what we see in our commercial businesses, it is consistent with a lower growth economy. Line of credit usage rates remain lower than pre-pandemic levels. This does not surprise us what with the dramatic increase in the cost of borrowing for small and medium-sized businesses. They aren't being indolent, they want to grow. They are simply being more careful and worry a final demand will hold. Therefore, they are being cost conscious across the board. So how did Bank of America do against this backdrop? At Bank of America, our commitment to responsible growth remains unwavering, and this quarter is another illustration of that. We grew, we did it the right way. In the third quarter, Bank of America generated $25.5 billion in revenue and earned $6.9 billion in net income after tax. Year-to-date, we've generated net income of just over $20 billion. Four quarters ago, we called that a bottom would occur in our net interest income in the second quarter of 2024. Even with a rate environment that has bounced around quite a bit since we said that we got it right. As we expected then, NII indeed troughed in the quarter two. NII grew 2% this quarter and Alastair will note later, we expect NII to grow again in quarter four, even as the market expects two more rate cuts in quarter four. This quarter, we saw a healthy revenue growth in our wealth and investment management business and in our global markets businesses. We returned 5.6 billion of capital to shareholders while also supporting the needs of our clients. So with that brief overview, let's dive into Slide 2. Earnings per share came in at $0.81 this quarter at $25.5 billion in revenue we grew modestly from the third quarter, '23 as improvement in noninterest income more than offset a year-over-year decline in net interest income. Fees grew 5% year-over-year and represented 45% of total revenue. The strong year-over-year fee performance was led by a 15% improvement in investment in brokerage services, mostly in our global wealth management business. We also grew investment banking fees 18% year-over-year sales and trading revenue increased 12% year-over-year and aggregate, these market related revenue streams rose an impressive 13% year-over-year. Our total expense in the company increased 4%. You can attribute most of the year-over-year expense growth to these market related areas. Overall, a good job by the team. On asset quality a few quarters ago we told you that consumer credit losses would go down this quarter, given delinquency trends we had seen at the time. We also told you that office losses would be lower. Both of these proved true again this quarter. Good asset quality resulted in net charge-off in provision expense for this quarter at $1.5 billion, which was unchanged from last quarter. Our performance is partly attributable to the diversity and balance of the company. A little more than half our earnings come from our consumer and GWIM businesses serving people and the other half come through from our Global Banking and Markets businesses serving companies and institutional investors. So let's turn to see how we grew organically this quarter. We are now on Slide 3. Our organic growth has been driven by a continued focus on customers and client experience throughout all our businesses. Consumer leads the way delivering solid organic growth with high quality accounts engaged clients. For the 23rd consecutive quarter, we added significant net new consumer checking accounts and expanded our customer base and market share. We added 360,000 net new checking accounts this quarter, which brings our first nine months of '24 to more than 880,000 net new checking accounts. In wealth management, we added another 5,500 net new relationships this quarter. In our commercial businesses, we added hundreds of small business and commercial banking relationships. Also note that we saw a strong organic growth of investment balances with banking customers and growth in banking products for our investment clients in our GWIM business. This has led us to now manage $5.9 trillion in client balances of loans, deposits and investments across the consumer and wealth management clients. We saw flows of $62 billion into those businesses in the past four quarters. In our Global Banking business, we saw loan demand start to pick up late in the quarter. We again ranked third in the logic IB fees we received and have a solid pipeline. Our global transaction services platform continues to grow around the world and showed strong deposit growth for our commercial businesses over the last year and a quarter. This quarter, global markets saw continued momentum. Global markets recorded the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in sales and trading. Investments we've made in this business and the intensity of the teams has enabled a 35% improvement in sales and trading revenue in the past three years. Good work by Jimmy DeMare and the team. Our customers and clients continue to want more from us, especially when it comes to our digital capabilities. So let's discuss this on Slide 4. Slide 4 highlights this continued success across our digital platforms. As usual, we include our disclosures on digital stats across the business, which we believe lead the industry. I commend you the pages in the appendix, which give you more granular disclosure for each of the businesses' digital activities. Our fully integrated consumer banking investment application drives the utility for our customers across GWIM and consumer. The usage stats you see are strong proof points. Our second language capabilities also enhance the customer's experience. We have grown to more than 48 million active digital users and those digital users logged in more than 3.6 billion times this quarter. We also continue to see more sales through their digital properties. Digital sales represented 54% of our total consumer sales this quarter. Note that it simply takes both high-touch and high-tech to drive continued growth with individual clients across the wealth spectrum in America. Erica, our AI enabled virtual assistant reached 2.4 billion client interactions since its launch and Zelle showed continued user and usage increases. In our wealth management business, we continue to see full relationships increase with both investing and banking relationships being open. 75% of new accounts in Merrill were opened digitally whether they were banking accounts or investment accounts. This enables more efficient customer coverage for our advisory teams. Finally, 87% of our Global Banking relationship clients are digitally active. We have innovated and significantly streamlined service requests by enabling clients to directly initiate and track inquiries within our award winning cash flow platform. As a result, app sign-ins for these clients increased nearly 80% in just the last 24-months. In summary, the economic environment remains solid. Issues remain out there to external factors that could affect our business and the economy generally. We still see great opportunities for continued growth across all our businesses. We are focused on driving market share in all our businesses, investing in technology to further enhance the customer experience and continue to increase our efficiency. With NII now growing and complementing our fee growth along with our continued solid expense discipline, we expect to return to operating leverage as we move through the quarters in 2025. With that, I'll turn to Alastair for additional details.",1423.0,793.0,26.0,8.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,8.0,0.03278688524590164,0.01008827238335435,0.0037831021437578815,0.0,0.0012610340479192938,0.02269861286254729
BAC,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,,2024-10-15,2024-10-15T08:30:00-04:00,0,2024-10-15,qa,qna_heading,Alastair Borthwick,"Thank you, Brian, and I'm starting on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation. We'll touch on more highlights noted here as we work through the material, and I'd just add that we delivered solid returns with a return on average assets of 83 basis points and return on tangible common equity of 12.8%. So let's move to the balance sheet on Slide 6, where you can see that the balance sheet ended the quarter at $3.3 trillion of total assets, up $66 billion from the second quarter, as global markets client demands expanded and commercial loans grew $16 billion in the quarter. Otherwise in the quarter, the investments of our excess liquidity saw a $10 billion reduction in hold to maturity securities, and the combination of shorter-term liquidity investments of cash and available for sale securities were relatively flat for the second quarter. On the funding side, global markets grew to support balance sheet needs of our clients and total deposits grew $20 billion on an ending basis. It's noteworthy that our average deposits are now up for the fifth consecutive quarter. Liquidity remains strong with $947 billion of global liquidity sources, and that was up $38 billion compared to the second quarter. Shareholders' equity was up $2.6 billion, with common equity up $4.6 billion and a preferred redemption driving a $2 billion decline in preferred equity. The increase income and equity compared to Q2, included $5.6 billion in capital returned to shareholders, partially offsetting our earnings, and it included an improvement in AOCI driven by an improvement from cash flow hedges given the drop in long-term rates in the quarter. $5.6 billion in capital distributions includes $2 billion in common dividends and the repurchase of $3.5 billion in shares. Tangible book value per share of $26.25 rose 10% from the third quarter of '23. And turning to regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $200 billion and the CET1 ratio was 11.8%. And that remains well above our new 10.7% requirement as of October 1. Risk weighted assets increased modestly, driven by both lending activity and global markets needs to support clients and our supplemental leverage ratio was 5.9% compared to the minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. Our $463 billion of total loss-absorbing capital means our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. So let's dig a little deeper on deposits and the growth from the second quarter using Slide 7. Here, we show you deposits and rates by line of business. Average deposits grew $45 billion, or 2% year-over-year, and they increased modestly linked-quarter. Notably, quarter-over-quarter increases in rates paid continue to slow again this quarter, rising 7 basis points to 210 basis points. Consumer Banking increased modestly, driven by product mix and higher rate product offerings. And Global Banking rate paid increased modestly driven by growth in interest bearing balances. It's worth noting that wealth management declined a basis point. We acted quickly following the September 50 basis point rate cut in our wealth business and our Global Banking business, and since late in the quarter, only a small portion of those cuts are reflected. Total rate paid for all deposits from these actions is expected to fall below 2% later in October, as the fuller effect of the pass-throughs occur. Let's turn to loans by looking at average balances on Slide 8. Loans in Q3 of $1.06 trillion improved 1% year-over-year driven by solid commercial loan growth as well as credit card and vehicle loans. Overall, commercial loans grew 2% year-over-year. And importantly, this included a drop in commercial real estate loans of 6%. Commercial loans, excluding commercial real estate, grew 3% year-over-year and were up 6% annualized from the Q2. Consumer banking loan growth was driven by credit card, small business and vehicle borrowing, and the overall consumer growth was muted by a decline in mortgage balances as pay downs exceeded originations in a higher rate environment. Let's turn our focus to NII performance and Slide 9. So note that our trended investment of excess deposit slide is in our appendix on Page 21. Deposit levels were $855 billion in excess of loans at the end of Q3 and continue to be a good source of value for shareholders. Nearly $625 billion or 52% of our excess liquidity is in short dated cash and AFS securities. The longer dated lower yielding hold to maturity book continues to roll-off, and we reinvest that in higher yielding assets. The blended yield of cash and securities on Page 21 remains well above our deposit rate paid. So going back to Slide 9, regarding NII on a GAAP, non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $14 billion and on a fully tax equivalent basis, NII was $14.1 billion. On our Q3 earnings call last year, we first provided our expectation that the Q2 would be the trough and then we would begin to grow in the Q3 of '24, marking an inflection point for NII. And that's what you see this quarter. NII increased by $252 million from the Q2 driven by a number of factors. Global Markets activity and pricing, fixed asset repricing and one extra day all benefited NII, while higher funding costs partially offset those benefits. A 50 basis point rate cut in September also negatively impacted NII. With regard to a forward view of NII, there are obviously several variables at play in the Q4, and we still expect Q4 NII to grow, and we expect it to be $14.3 billion or more on a fully tax equivalent basis. Now we note the following assumptions. First, we assume that the forward curve on October 10, is the one that materializes, so that includes a 25 basis point cut in November and another 25 basis points in December. We also assumed very modest balance increases in both loans and deposits in Q4, building off the activity seen in Q3. Last quarter, we told you we expect about $20 billion in the aggregate of fixed rate loans and securities to reprice on a quarterly basis, and those are expected to reprice into higher yielding assets and provide a benefit to NII for many periods ahead. And as described previously, we expect to see roughly $200 million benefit in Q4 from the BSBY alternative rate transition. So we think this sets us up well for 2025. With regard to interest rate sensitivity on a dynamic deposit basis, we provide a 12-month change in NII for an instantaneous shift above or below the forward curve. On that basis, a 100 basis point increase would benefit NII by $1.8 billion, while a decrease of 100 basis points would decrease NII over the next 12 months by $2.7 billion. Okay, let's now turn to expense and we'll use Slide 10 for the discussion. We reported $16.5 billion in expense this quarter, up 1% from the second quarter, driven by the revenue improvement in three primary areas that Brian noted earlier. Investment banking, investment broke - and brokerage fees and sales and trading revenue all have more activity and incentive variability than other revenues, and they were up 3% in aggregate versus the second quarter and up 13% year-over-year. In Q3, our headcount of 213,000 was up a little more than 1000, and this quarter we saw the departure of roughly 2,000 summer interns and we welcomed roughly 2500 college graduates from the nearly 120,000 applications received. Regarding a forward view in Q4, we don't expect much change in our headcount, and with continued investments we expect expense to be in line with Q3 at $16.5 billion. As we look into 2025, with an expected return of NII growth and through our expense discipline, we expect a return to operating leverage, an improvement in our efficiency ratio. Let's turn to credit on Slide 11. And the good news is there's not a lot to report here compared to the second quarter. Net charge-offs of $1.5 billion were flat compared to Q2. We've seen consumer losses in a pretty tight range for a few quarters now. Outside of that, we saw lower losses from office exposure and otherwise we had two somewhat unrelated commercial losses. The net charge off ratio was 58 basis points, down one basis point from Q2. Provision expense was unchanged from Q2 at $1.5 billion as reserve levels remain constant. And with regard to reserve levels on a weighted basis, we remain reserved for an unemployment rate of 5% by the end of 2025 compared to the most recent 4.1% rate reported. On Slide 12, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios, and there's nothing really noteworthy to highlight on this page. So let's move to the various lines of business and some brief comments on their results, starting on Slide 13 with consumer banking. Consumer banking continues to lead the company in organic growth, and this included another strong quarter of net new checking growth, another strong period of card openings and investment balances for consumer clients, which climbed 28% year-over-year to a record $497 billion. It also included 12-months of strong flows at $29 billion in addition to market appreciation. As noted earlier, loans grew nicely year-over-year from credit card and vehicle as well as small business, where we remain the industry leader. One highlight to note, our Practice Solutions Lending Group for doctors and dentists and related professionals saw loans grow 11% year-over-year. All of this organic growth helped to drive $2.7 billion in net income in Q3. So reported earnings remained strong, declining 6% year-over-year as revenue declined from lower NII, partially offset by higher card income. With the trajectory shifting in NII, we should see earnings in this business begin to shift as well. Expense rose 5% as we continued our business investments. And those investments included those in our people, including the announcement of moving our minimum wage to $24 per hour and that raises the minimum annualized salary for our associates to nearly $50,000. As you can see on the appendix Page 25, digital adoption and engagement continue to improve and customer satisfaction scores remain near record levels illustrating the appreciation of enhanced capabilities from our continuous investments. Bank of America's 23 million Zelle users are up 10% in the past 12-months and their volume usage is now up more than 20%. Customers are now using Zelle at nearly 3x the rate they're writing checks, and Zelle usage has meaningfully surpassed the combination of checks written and ATM withdrawals. Moving to Wealth Management on Slide 14. We produced good results, reflecting healthy organic growth and client activity with increased banking activities of our clients and the impacts of increased market levels together with strong assets under management flows. With a continued increase in banking product usage from our investing clients, the diversity of our revenue base continues to improve. More than 60% of our wealth clients now have banking products with us and 30% of our revenue is now in net interest income to complement the fees earned in our advice model. Net income rose from the third quarter '23 to $1.1 billion this year. In Q3, we reported revenue of nearly $5.8 billion growing 8% over the prior year, led by 14% growth in asset management fees that Brian highlighted earlier. Expenses growth reflects the fee growth and other investments for our future growth as we continue to grow our advisor force through hiring of both experienced advisors and graduates from our training program. We welcomed 5,500 Merrill and Private Bank net new households this quarter and more than 1/3 of those Merrill openings were driven by graduates from our training program. The business had a 25% margin and generated a strong return on capital of 23%. Average loans were up 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in custom lending and a pickup in mortgage lending. Both Merrill and the Private Bank continue to see healthy organic growth, producing strong assets under management flows of $65 billion year-over-year, which reflects a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting money to work. We should also highlight the continued digital momentum that you'll find on Slide 27. As an example, three quarters of Merrill Bank and Investment accounts were opened digitally this quarter. On Slide 15, you see Global Banking results. This business produced earnings of $1.9 billion down 26% year-over-year as improved investment banking fees and treasury services revenue were overcome by lower net interest income and higher provision expense. Revenue declined 6%, driven by the impact of interest rates and deposit rotation. In our global treasury services business, fees for managing the cash of clients continue to offset some of the NII pressure from higher rates. Investment banking had a strong quarter, growing fees 18% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, led by debt capital markets fees, mostly in leveraged finance and investment grade. We finished the quarter strong, maintaining our number three investment banking fee position. What began as a slow quarter this summer gained some momentum through September and the pipeline looking forward looks solid. An increase in provision expense from last year was driven by the previously noted commercial and CRE losses. Expense increased 7% year-over-year, including continued investments in the business, particularly around technology. Switching to global markets on Slide 16. I’ll focus comments on results excluding DVA as we normally do and the team continued their impressive streak of strong revenue and earnings performance. They achieved operating leverage and continued to deliver good return on capital. Earnings of $1.6 billion grew 23% year-over-year and return on average allocated capital was 14%. Revenue again, ex-DVA improved 14% from the third quarter of last year as both sales and trading and investment banking fees for institutional clients improved nicely year-over-year. Focusing on sales & trading, ex-DVA revenue improved 12% year-over-year to $4.9 billion. FICC increased 8% while equities increased 18% compared to the third quarter of '23. FICC revenues remained strong growing over both the prior year and the second quarter, driven by momentum in currencies trading. Equities had a record third quarter driven by strong trading performance in derivatives and cash. Year-over-year expenses were up 6% on revenue improvement and our continued investment in the business. Finally, on Slide 17, all other shows a loss of $295 million. Revenue was lower and included a charge to other income of roughly 200 million related to Visa's increase in its litigation escrow account. The decline in expense was driven by reduced costs of a liquidating business and lower legal expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 6% and excluding discrete items and the tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 24%. So that's where I'll stop, and with that we'll open it up for Q&A.",2420.0,1353.0,39.0,23.0,18.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,6.0,13.0,0.028824833702882482,0.016999260901699925,0.013303769401330377,0.0022172949002217295,0.0029563932002956393,0.011825572801182557

Alastair, you talked about still feel comfortable troughing in the second quarter, poised to grow. So can you maybe give us a little bit more on - based on the forward curve, any kind of rough thinking on how NII, the trajectory from here beyond 4Q?

And we felt like as the deposits were beginning to find a floor, we'd be in a position where we could begin to see NII growth. So obviously, that happened in Q3. And at this point, we feel like we're in a good position to do that again in Q4. We'll provide guidance, I think, for 2025 when we get back together again a quarter from now. Part of the reason we try not to do it 15 months in advance is because an awful lot moves with the rate curve. Remember, this year, at one point, we had six cuts another point, we had one cut. And even this past quarter, I think the market was surprised with an extra cut. What we're focused on then is just driving the underlying organic growth. So deposit growth, we're getting to a point now we've had five quarters in a row. Global Banking is back to normal seasonality. Wealth is flattening out. And Consumer is slowing and is in a place now where we think we're pretty close to finding that floor. So deposits in a good place, the rotation is slowing. We've got a little pickup in loan growth this past quarter, that's good. We've got the fixed rate asset repricing over time from which we'll benefit, and we've got some cash flow swaps resetting as well. So look, we're in a position where we're we believe we're going to grow NII again in the Q4. That's going to set us up, I think, quite well in terms of 2025.

Importantly, the non-interest bearing piece going back to your generation new checking accounts seems to be stable. Much of the movement in the consumer business writ large has been for more interest rate sensitive clients with higher balances having moved and you're seeing that also slow. So we feel good about the stability of consumer at this point. And we can the deposits new accounts we're putting on today are the future of the franchise and that's what we keep building towards.

What is rate driven is at the margins consumer customers that have $300,000, $500,000 have moved, have less than their deposit accounts. Honestly, the pre-pandemic, when the aggregate hole is up. So think about that. The constant customers that have been with us since then, so. And so the movement now is just pumping around based on seasonal flows of people paying taxes and people having spent money in the summer and paying down the bills from that and things like that. So we feel there's stability on the consumer side, stability on the wealth management side, including the movement of the higher end balances in the market. And a lot of that pricing on both those businesses adjusts automatically given the rate cut. And then on commercial balances, that's just evidence of the buildup of cash and corporate balance sheets and the activity levels of those customers. So we feel good across the board, and basically for several quarters in a row, we continue to grow the balances. The rate impacts really the higher end balances because remember, noninterest bearing and the consumers and low interest cost checking is driving a lot of the value and is a stable balance.",221.0,107.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037383177570093455,0.009345794392523364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028037383177570093

But that's why you see the balances up a little more end of period than perhaps the prior quarter and the last two quarters have been better than the previous quarters. So I don't know if that's early to call it a streak, but we're obviously pleased to see it. It's been pretty consistent across our small business, our business banking, our commercial banking clients. And I'd say we're not really seeing revolver utilization picking up yet.

So not a great deal of change, Glenn, for us in terms of the securities portfolio from what we said before. Obviously, the hold to maturity continues to run-off. I think it's now 13 quarters in a row, another $9 billion or so this quarter, which allows us to reinvest at higher yields. So that remains basically our first thought with respect to the investment strategy is just allow that to continue rolling down. And we're going to continue to prioritize supporting loan growth for our clients. And you can sort of see that HTM run-off over time, funding the loans growth that we've had over time. Then whatever's left over from deposits growing, we're normally putting into cash and cash equivalents or we're paying down expensive short-term liabilities. So if you look, you'd see that we've allowed about $15 billion or so of Institutional CDs to roll-off this quarter. And at the margin, we're taking a little bit of 1-year to 3-year fixed rate, maybe $10 billion or $20 billion in the last couple of quarters.

I wouldn't pick out any particular area in Fixed Income or Equities for people investments. I think as Jimmy DeMare has highlighted, it's about for us filling gaps with existing clients and making sure we're there for them over time. So, we've added people across the various businesses. And then with respect to balance sheet, it's a little bit of RWAs, as Brian highlighted. It's a little bit of liquidity, allowing us to support the financing businesses.

So we're waiting at this point to see the final rules as they come out. That's going to allow us to give you a much more precise answer over time.

We're going to get some benefit from the BSBY transition feeding back into the P&L. We're going to get some benefit from the fixed rate assets repricing over time.

So maybe I'm going to ask this this way. You've talked about hedges in the past in terms of the sensitivity of your floating rate loans, specifically in commercial. As we think about forecasting for whatever rate curve turns out and we think about your floating rate loans ex card, should we assume a similar sensitivity or on the way down is on the way up excluding BSBY? Or will the hedges, essentially give you some floor and that your sensitivity to repricing going forward, again, ex BSBY is not as significant as it was on the way up?",130.0,56.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.0

So I think it's okay to start with the same sensitivity on the way down as up because the company is largely speaking positioned in the same way. At the same time, you put your finger on it, we are going to benefit from repricings over time. And we mentioned last quarter and we've talked about already on this call the fact that we've got the various securities and the various new originations that replace those loans that are maturing. So that remains the case. And then we've got some cash flow swaps, a number of them are pointed against the commercial. And as we particularly as we get into the third quarter and fourth quarter of '25, you you'll see a benefit in commercial yields there because those ones are at lower rates and they will be repriced in Q3 and Q4. So a little bit of cushion there. That's one of the reasons that as we look forward into NII, we can sort of see how this repricing that's taking place remember, we're coming off of a period now with a long period, 15 years, of a very, very low set of yields. And we're coming back now to something where you can really see the full value of our deposit base. And it takes a while. It's quarter-by-quarter.

And it's been so long since we've seen a neutral rate that's not zero. I guess it’s a two part question. The first is, should we similarly assume the same ability to recapture, on deposit repricing on the way down as it was on the way up in terms of the same deposit beta? And as we think about 2025 that may have better loan growth, where do you think if we if our neutral rate is 2.75%, 3%, where does Bank of America's natural deposit costs fall relative to that?",113.0,45.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.044444444444444446,0.044444444444444446,0.0,0.0,0.0

But if you look where we sort of stand at the end of Q3, the difference between fed funds and the total interest bearing cost of our deposits is around 250 basis points, almost 260 basis points. If you think if you looked at Q2 in '19 when the fed funds hit the highest rate in the last cycle, that difference was 160 basis points, 170 basis points. So there's a fund what you're pointing out, leave aside betas and everything else, there's a fundamental difference of 100 basis points in spread against the interest bearing side and we take the noninterest bearing piece that obviously has a bigger impact. So this will settle in, but you are right for the -- and you've been around this industry for a long time. So if you go back and think about when the Fed's funds rate was sustained in the 2.75%, 3%, 3.25% level, this industry was able to make more money due to the extra value of relative to the last 15 years of the noninterest-bearing deposits in the consumer businesses and the small business in the core commercial business and wealth management business. So we feel good about positioning. We feel good about our deposit makeup, which is driven by core operating activity, the primary household and the consumer side the operating accounts and the businesses, the small businesses and even the wealth management. So see you will see more value. I'm confident and that's what we're looking forward to as the rate structure settles in. And so the key to your point, is not the path of '25 of whether the cuts come in one quarter or another quarter. The key that I think is different is the blue-chip economists, your economists, I'm sure and our economists they all predict that we'll end up with a terminal rate at a 3% level as opposed to the past cycles where we didn't ever get there and rates were starting to be cut at the end [19].",353.0,169.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.029585798816568046,0.01775147928994083,0.011834319526627219,0.0,0.0,0.011834319526627219

So yes, it would at the margin. But remember that at the end of the day, Gerard, we are sending capital back to shareholders because of the fact that the franchise generates activity without using a ton of capital and grows its loans, in deposits, the earnings, et cetera. So we will continue to be discipline with the capital and the capital return, and we'll continue to return more of it if more is available, we're sitting with a fair amount of excess over the current set of rules.

And so if you look at this market, as I always look at the FDIC data and you kind of look at it last couple of years, it's kind of chopped up because of the stimulus and everything. But you see continued progress by us in all these markets moving from nowhere to into the 10th, 7th, 8th and we keep building that out. What that does is we believe in high touch, high-tech across all individuals and even small businesses and even a little bit in the middle market. And what we mean by that is for even wealthy customers, there are times when they need to utilize a branch. And if you have no branch in Denver or Columbus or Indianapolis or Minneapolis or etcetera, it's a little hard for them to get the full experience. So, we've done that. Now, as we think about it, we had extreme discipline. We're going after this to build out markets to a level we feel comfortable that we have the market covered. And so, instead of putting one in every place, we're trying to build out a network in a place like Columbus where I think we have 15, 20 branches now. And that allows us to build the business. We already have a major Merrill presence there. We already had commercial banking presence there. This allows us to build underneath it. And so that's why you're seeing our deposits in those branches push past $100 million per branch, which is much different than we see in others doing it because of density and capacity and the digital and the prior customer base for lack of a better term that we now can get more from. So, the team is doing a good job. We expect you have to go down both paths, but at the end of the day, we're trying to get coverage in the top markets across the country so that we cover the American population in an efficient and effective way. And the truth of the matter is even though we're 54% sales across all the businesses in consumer all different types of products, a lot of the checking sales only digital are about in the 30s as opposed to the 50s, which means people still like to walk in a branch and start a relationship and that's why we're there.",433.0,176.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.011363636363636364,0.005681818181818182,0.0,0.0,0.011363636363636364

Before we begin today, I just want to express our deep concern for our communities, clients, and teammates impacted by the California wildfires. Our top priority, of course, is ensuring the safety and welfare of our team and helping our clients and customers. Our imperturbable Market President Raul Anaya is leading our team out there. We have teams on the ground assisting in any way we can and are monitoring of the situation to extend support and resources. So far, we have activated our Client Assistance Program, donated $1 million in disaster relief to the American Red Cross, additional contributions to the L.A. Food Bank and the L.A. Chamber of Commerce Small Business Efforts. With that, let's turn to earnings starting on page two of the presentation. This morning, we reported $6.7 billion in net income, that is $0.82 in EPS for the fourth quarter. That was a solid finish to another good year at Bank of America. We grew revenue on a year-over-year basis in every category in quarter four. We saw good loan and deposit growth, and Alastair is going to walk you through some of the details of the quarter in a moment, but I want to thank our team for another great year. For the full-year of 2024, we generated $102 billion of revenue and reported net income of $27.1 billion of EPS of $3.21. We produced 83 basis points return on assets and 13% return on tangible common equity. We generated these results working from a strong balance sheet that allowed us to support clients and economies continue to grow. The economy appears to be now settled into a 2% to 3% GDP-type growth environment. It has healthy employment levels in the resilient consumer. The immensity of the American consumer can be seen in our data. So far in the first two weeks in January, they're spending money at 4% to 5% clip over last year, similar to what they did in the fourth quarter. In our business side, the clients are profitable, they're liquid, and seeing good productivity. We ended the year with $953 billion in liquidity. We also ended with $201 billion of regulatory CET1 capital and a CET1 ratio of 11.9%, leaving us nearly 115 basis points of excess capital as we begin 2025. For Bank of America, the year was characterized by a few important highlights that played out as expected and were consistent with our communications to you throughout the year. First, we saw net interest income bottom out at $13.9 billion on an FTE basis in the second quarter of 2024. We ended the year with a fourth quarter on the same FTE basis at $14.5 billion, then that was a bit better than we expected. This obviously provides a great starting point for 2025, and based on the assumptions Alastair is going to discuss a little later, we should report record NII in 2025. So how did we do that? We drove organic growth in all the businesses, and that we have highlighted on Slide 3. We saw continued growth in net new checking, new households, new companies, and commercial banking growth in our institutional markets business. This organic activity enabled us to grow loans and deposits at a pace we believe is to be ahead of our industry average and our peers. A key for us, obviously, is a growth in our deposit franchise. If you look at Slide 4, you can see we've now grown deposits for six consecutive quarters. In the most recent quarter, we saw growth in consumer balances and stability around non-interest-bearing balances across all the businesses. We continued to price in a disciplined manner, and rates paid moved lower this quarter across the board. Overall, rate paid on deposits moved from 210 basis points in the third quarter to 194 basis points this quarter. And we're lower in the fourth quarter, we're lower in every business segment. On the loan side, consumer loans grew in every category-linked quarter. Commercial loan demand continued to build off the strengths we saw in the third quarter of 2024, and commercial loans grew 5% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, and a much faster annualized pace when comparing the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2024. So back to Slide 3. In our wealth management business, we added 24,000 new households in 2024. We ended the year with $6 trillion in total client balances that we manage for people in America across our global wealth and consumer businesses. Our consumer investments team, what we call Merrill Edge, crossed a new milestone this quarter and now sits in excess of $518 billion in balances. Investment banking gained share of industry revenue in 2024. Our sales and trading team put up the 11th straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and achieved a new full-year record of nearly $19 billion in revenue. As the quality stabilized and remained strong, with net charge-offs declining modestly from third quarter. Early in the year, we highlighted that our expectation on consumer credit is that they would stabilize to normal level. And on commercial office losses, they would trend down during the year. We saw both those trends continue into quarter four. On the expense side, we continue to invest in our franchise. And even though spending increases in brand, people, and technology, and strong fee growth, which drove incentive and transaction processing costs higher, we managed to create operating leverage in the fourth quarter. Our digitalization and engagement expanded across all our businesses. We saw more than 14 billion logins to our digital platforms in 2024. Our Erica capability surpassed 2.5 billion interactions from its inception. And our CashPro app surpassed $1 trillion in payments made through the app in 2024. It's also worth noting that digital sales in our consumer product areas crossed 60% in the fourth quarter again. You can see all these trends in our industry-leading digital disclosure on Slides 26, 28, and 30 in the appendix. All the success in balance sheet straights allowed us to deliver more capital back to our shareholders. We returned $21 billion of capital to the shareholders in 2024, which was 75% more than 2023 and included an 8% increase in the common dividend. So in summary, for both the fourth quarter and for the year, we enjoyed good profitability, we drove healthy returns, we saw good organic client activity across all the businesses, we continue to manage the risk well and increase the capital delivered back to our shareholders. And we positioned ourselves well for growth in 2025. I want to again thank my team for continuing to drive another year of responsible growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alastair.",1103.0,577.0,25.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.043327556325823226,0.006932409012131715,0.010398613518197574,0.0017331022530329288,0.0,0.036395147313691506

And I'm going to start on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation, because it will provide just a little more context on the quarter. For the fourth quarter, as Brian noted, we reported $6.7 billion in net income or $0.82 per share. And before we talk about comparisons between periods, I just need to remind you that our fourth quarter 2023 GAAP net income number included two notable items. In the fourth quarter of ‘23, first, we recorded $2.1 billion of pre-tax expense for the special assessment by the FDIC to the industry to recover losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and that reduced EPS last year by $0.20. Second, we recorded a negative pre-tax impact to our market-making revenue of approximately $1.6 billion related to the cessation of BSBY as an alternative rate, and that reduced earnings per share last year by $0.15. So when you adjust for the large FDIC assessment and the BSBY cessation charge, fourth quarter ‘23 net income was $5.9 billion or $0.70 per share. On Slide 6, we note some of the highlights of the quarter and we reported revenue of $25.5 billion on a fully taxable equivalent basis, up 15% from the fourth quarter of ‘23. And if you exclude the fourth quarter ‘23 BSBY cessation charge, our revenues grew 8% year-over-year. As Brian said, all the revenue items are showing improvement year-over-year. NII grew 3%. Investment banking grew 44%. This quarter, our $4 billion of sales and trading revenue marked a fourth quarter record, and it grew 10% from the year ago period. And investment brokerage fees rose 21%, with both assets under management flows and market levels contributing nicely to the growth. Our card income and service charges grew 7%. Non-interest expense was $16.8 billion and was up when adjusted for the FDIC special assessment driven by incentives paid for the strong revenue growth as Brian noted and the related activity costs that comes with that. Expense also included additional investments in people, technology, and brand with some major partnerships announced recently. And it included what we expect to be the peak in quarterly costs associated with enhancing our compliance costs and controls. The good news is we created operating leverage in the quarter. Provision expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion and was consistent with the previous two quarters. And lastly, returns in the fourth quarter were 80 basis points of ROA and 13% return on tangible common equity. Back to the balance sheet on Slide 7. We ended the quarter at $3.26 trillion of total assets, down $63 billion from the third quarter, driven by seasonally lower levels of client activity in global markets, while loans across the businesses grew $20 billion in the quarter. Otherwise in the quarter, the investments of our excess liquidity saw a $9 billion reduction in hold to maturity securities. And at the same time, the combination of shorter-term liquidity investments of cash and available for sale securities increased $28 billion. On the funding side, total deposits grew $35 billion on an ending basis as both interest bearing and non-interest bearing grew. Long-term debt fell $14 billion driven by net redemptions and valuations, and global markets funding declined in line with assets. Liquidity remains strong with $953 billion of global liquidity sources. That is up modestly compared to the third quarter, even as we paid down some debt and retired some preferreds. Shareholders' equity was flat at around $295 billion. And within all of that, we returned $5.5 billion of capital back to shareholders with $2 billion in common dividends paid and the repurchase of $3.5 billion in shares this quarter. Tangible book value per share of $26.58 rose 9% from the fourth quarter last year. Turning to regulatory capital, our CET1 level improved to $201 billion and the CET1 ratio rose to 11.9%, remaining well above our new 10.7% requirement. Risk-weighted assets increased modestly as increases in loans were mostly offset by lower RWA supporting our global markets client activity. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.9% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves some capacity for balance sheet growth, and our $460 billion of total loss absorbing capital means our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Let's turn to Slide 8. We can go a little deeper on loans by looking at average balances. And loans in the fourth quarter of $1.08 trillion improved 3% year-over-year, driven by solid commercial loan growth. Overall, commercial loans grew 5% year-over-year. And importantly, this included an 8% drop in commercial real estate loans. Commercial loans excluding commercial real estate grew 7% year-over-year, and the consumer loans grew modestly both linked quarter and year-over-year. As Brian said, on a linked quarter basis, every category of consumer lending grew, and you can see that at the bottom of Slide 8. If we turn our focus to NII performance and use Slide 9, regarding NII on a GAAP, non-fully taxable equivalent basis, NII in Q4 was $14.4 billion. And on a fully taxable equivalent basis, NII was $14.5 billion. Several quarters ago, we signaled our expectation that NII would trough in the second quarter of 2024 and begin to grow from there. And this represents now our second quarter of NII growth. And we expect that growth to continue in 2025. In fact, if you look at the two quarters after the inflection point, NII is already growing at a 5% rate. Fourth quarter NII on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased by $399 million from the third quarter, driven by a number of factors. First, it was led by improvement in deposits across the businesses. And even as deposit balances increased linked quarter, our interest expense on those deposits declined by $600 million. Loan growth and fixed rate asset repricing also benefited us again this quarter. With regard to a forward view, interest rate expectations continue to drive volatility and predictability, but we'll provide some thoughts for future NII. We expect to start the year in the first quarter with NII modestly higher than the fourth. Remember that the first quarter has two fewer days of interest and that's roughly the equivalent of about $250 million of NII equivalent. So even with that, we expect to grow modestly. Then we expect that growth to increase through the year to the point where it could be 6% to 7% higher in 2025 than 2024. We expect to exit the year at least $1 billion higher in the fourth quarter and that would put us in a range of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion on a fully taxable equivalent basis, and that's obviously significantly higher than the Q2 '24 trough of $13.9 billion. I have to note the following assumptions. First, we assume that the current forward curve materializes. And while the interest rate curve has changed significantly over a fairly short period of time, as of the 10 of January, the curve was expecting only one rate cut in 2025 that may come in May or June. Based on our more recent growth experienced, we're assuming loan and deposit growth in 2025 that's higher than 2024, and more consistent with growth in a 2% to 3% GDP environment. The other elements of anticipated growth in NII expected are the benefits of asset repricing as fixed rate securities and loans and swaps roll off and those get repriced at higher rates. And those themes all remain consistent with our prior conversations with you in the last several earnings calls. With regard to interest rate sensitivity, on a dynamic deposit basis, we provide a 12-month change in NII for an instantaneous shift in the curve, above or below the forward curve. And on that basis, a 100 basis point increase would benefit NII by roughly $1 billion, while a decrease of 100 basis points would decrease NII over the next 12 months by $2.3 billion. Lastly, note that our slide showing the trended investment of excess deposits is in our appendix. It's on page 21. Deposit levels grew to $870 billion over loans at the end of Q4, and that's an incredible source of value for shareholders. And $649 billion, or 54% of our excess liquidity, is now in short-dated cash and available for sale securities. The longer-dated lower-yielding hold-to-maturity book continues to roll off, and we continue to reinvest in higher-yielding assets. Okay. Let's now turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 10 for the discussion. We reported $16.8 billion in expense this quarter. And the fourth quarter of '23 included the large FDIC special assessment charge and excluding that, expense increased. The increased expense from prior periods was driven by a number of factors and was partially offset by a roughly $300 million release of prior period accruals for the FDIC special assessment. Let's talk about the drivers of the expense. First, in regard to revenue, our markets-related businesses of investment banking, investment in Brokerage and Sales & Trading, those were up 20% year-over-year. Incentives for the firm were up 15% versus the fourth quarter of '23 and were in large part related to these market-related revenue streams. On investments that we made, we added bankers and advisers across most of our businesses in 2024, and we also increased investments in our brand with significant sponsorships like the Masters in FIFA to name a few. And we increased our investments around technology as well as financial centers. This quarter alone, we added 17 financial centers with nine of those in our new expansion markets. We're a growth company, and we continue to invest in our future. As far as head count goes, we've managed our head count carefully, and we've held it fairly flat through the 4 quarters of 2024 at around 213,000 people. Lastly, we incurred additional costs to accelerate work on compliance and controls. As you likely saw in late December, the OCC issued a compliance consent order to Bank of America, and that's a result of exams done more than a year ago. This orders about correcting or enhancing certain deficiencies in some aspects of our processes that existed at the time. The order doesn't limit any of our growth plans and the order acknowledges we began taking corrective actions before the order was announced. And as a result of the work in process, we increased our resources substantially in the second-half of 2024 and those costs are already embedded in our quarterly run rate. Okay. Let's go back to expense and how to think about a forward view. First, most importantly, we remain focused on growing the company and driving operating leverage. Second, we expect the first quarter to include some normal seasonal elevation and we believe this amount will be roughly $600 million to $700 million, primarily for payroll tax expense. So we think $17.6 billion is a good number to expect for Q1 and before seasonally declining in Q2. And that's all part of our expectation that expense should be roughly 2% to 3% higher in 2025, compared to 2024. Let's now move to credit and turn to Slide 11, where you can see net charge-offs of a little less than $1.5 billion, improving modestly compared to Q3. That's the fourth quarter now that net charge-offs are around $1.5 billion. We've seen consumer losses in a pretty stable range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion over those past few quarters. And on the commercial side, we saw losses of $359 million, which is down from the third quarter, driven by the continued decline in commercial real estate office losses. Net charge-off ratio this quarter was 54 basis points, down 4 basis points from the third quarter. We don't see overall net charge-offs or the related ratio changing much in 2025, without much change in current GDP or the employment environment, we expect the net charge-off ratio to be in the range of 50 to 60 basis points of loans for 2025. Q4 provision expense was $90 million lower than Q3 at $1.5 billion as reserve levels remain constant. And as it relates to reserve levels on a weighted basis, where reserved for an unemployment rate a little below 5% by the end of 2025, and that compares to the most recent 4.1% rate reported. On Slide 12, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both consumer and commercial portfolios. And there's nothing really noteworthy here that I want to highlight on this page. So let's move to the various lines of business starting on Slide 13 with Consumer Banking. That business made nearly $11 billion or 40% of the company's earnings in 2024. In the fourth quarter, Consumer Banking generated $10.6 billion in revenue and $2.8 billion in net income. Both grew modestly from the fourth quarter of '23 as fee improvement for card and service charges is now being complemented by the growth in NII. Consumer Banking continued to deliver strong organic growth with high-quality accounts and engage clients and they achieved a new record of client experience scores in December. The organic growth activity noted on Slide 3 includes more than 200,000 net new checking accounts, which now takes us to six years' worth of quarter-after-quarter growth. And we show another strong period of card openings and investment account growth. Investment balances grew 22% to $518 billion with full year flows of $25 billion and market improvement throughout the year. Expense rose 8% as we continued investments in our business. The biggest story in consumer this quarter is deposits because these are the most valuable deposits in the franchise. And in the last six months, we believe we've seen the floor begin to form after several periods of slowing decline. Consumer Banking deposits appear to have bottomed in mid-August at around $928 billion and ended the year at $952 billion on an ending basis. Looking at averages, you can see then the deposits grew $4 billion from the third quarter to $942 billion, all while our rate paid declined to 64 basis points. Finally, as you can see in the appendix, page 26, digital adoption and engagement continue to improve and customer satisfaction scores rose to record levels, illustrating our client appreciation of enhanced capabilities from these investments. On Slide 14, we move to Wealth Management, where the business had a very profitable year, generating $4.2 billion in earnings from nearly $23 billion in revenue. In 2024, our Merrill Lynch and Private Bank advisers added another 24,000 net new relationships. And the professionalism of these teams earned them numerous best-in-class industry rankings as you can see on Slide 27 in the appendix. With a continued increase in banking product usage from our investing clients, the diversity of revenue in the wealth business continues to improve. The number of GWIM clients that now have banking products with us continues to grow. And at this point, it represents more than 60% of our clients. Importantly, about 30% of our revenue remains in net interest income, which complements the fees earned in our advice model and those have also grown. Net income rose 15% from the fourth quarter of '23 to nearly $1.2 billion. In the fourth quarter, we reported revenue of $6 billion, growing 15% over the prior year and led by 23% growth in asset management fees. While expenses were up year-over-year, they grew slower than revenue creating the operating leverage in the business. Business had a 26% pretax margin and generated a strong return on capital of 25%. Average loans were up 4%, driven by growth in custom lending, securities-based lending and a pickup in mortgage lending. Deposits grew 2% from the third quarter, and the teams were quite disciplined on pricing of those deposits. Both Merrill and the Private Bank continued to see strong organic growth. And that helped to produce excellent asset under management flows of $79 billion this year, reflecting a good mix of new client money, as well as existing clients putting money to work. We also want to draw your attention to the continued digital momentum that you'll find on Slide 28. Because, for example, three quarters of Merrill bank and brokerage accounts were opened digitally this quarter. Slide 15 shows the Global Banking results and this business generating $8.1 billion or 30% of the company's earnings in 2024, and it continues to be the most efficient business in the company at less than 50% efficiency ratio. The business saw a nice rebound in investment banking fees in 2024, which we expect to continue in 2025. In Q4, Global Banking produced earnings of $2.1 billion. Pretax pre-provision results were flat year-over-year as improved investment banking fees offset lower NII and higher expense. The total earnings were down 13% year-over-year, driven by higher provision expense that came as a result of prior period reserve release. Investment banking fees were $1.7 billion in Q4, growing 44% year-over-year. This was led by mergers and acquisitions. We also saw strength across debt capital markets fees mostly in leverage finance and in equity capital markets fees and we finished the year strong, maintaining our number three investment banking fee position. The fourth quarter saw a strong momentum as the election results provided a lift to sentiment for a more pro-business climate and expectations for more deals to be completed. Expense in this business increased 6% year-over-year, driven by the 13% growth in non-interest income and continued investments in people and technology. The balance sheet saw good client activity, and it was muted somewhat by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Year-over-year flatness in Global Banking loans includes this foreign exchange impact and a $6 billion decline in commercial real estate from paydowns. Otherwise, loans in Global Banking were up 2%. Deposits have been growing for many quarters now with our commercial and corporate clients. And total global banking deposits are now up 10% year-over-year, reaching a new record. So we're seeing strong growth across all the categories from our corporate and commercial clients all the way from the larger end the business banking on the lower end. And we also saw a 10% growth in our international deposits. Turning to Global Markets on Slide 16, I want to focus my comments on results excluding DVA as we normally do. Our team continued their impressive streak of strong revenue and earnings performance. They achieved operating leverage, and they continue to deliver a good return on capital. For the year, record sales and trading results of nearly $19 billion grew 7% from 2023 and they've been growing consistently now on a year-over-year basis for almost three years. This led to $5.7 billion in full-year profits and represents more than 20% of the company's full-year results. In the fourth quarter, earnings of $955 million grew 30% year-over-year. Revenue and again, this is ex DVA, improved 15% from the fourth quarter of '23, as both Sales & Trading and Investment Banking fees improved nicely year-over-year. Focusing on sales and trading ex DVA, revenue improved 10% year-over-year to $4.1 billion. This is the first time we've recorded more than $4 billion in our Q4 results and it included Q4 records for both FICC and Equities. FICC grew 13%, while equities improved 6%, compared to the fourth quarter '23. FICC benefited from tighter credit spreads as well as increased volatility in interest rates, while equities benefited from increased activity around the U.S. election. Year-over-year expenses were up 7% on revenue improvement and our continued investment in the business. And then on Slide 17, you can see all other with a loss of $407 million in the fourth quarter. We spoke earlier about the fourth quarter ‘23 charges for BSBY and the FDIC special assessment charge. Their reversal impacts the comparisons on revenue, expense and net income in this segment. Otherwise, there really isn't anything significant to report here. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 6%, and excluding discrete items and the tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 26%. Looking forward, we expect the tax rate for 2025 to be in a range of 11% to 13%. And this just includes our expectation for higher expected earnings in 2025 and relatively stable tax credits. Finally, this quarter, on page 18, we thought it was important to summarize some of the guidance points we talked through this morning, and we hope you'll find this page helpful. So in summary, we're looking for a strong growth in NII, and we'll look to both continue important investments in the franchise and drive operating leverage as we grow throughout the year. We aren't expecting much movement around credit based on a pretty solid economic outlook. And we remain with a very strong balance sheet with excess capital that we can deploy to grow the business and deliver back to shareholders as appropriate. So with that, I'll stop there. I thank everybody, and we'll open it up for Q&A.",3405.0,1847.0,54.0,23.0,27.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,9.0,13.0,0.029236599891716297,0.01245262587980509,0.014618299945858148,0.0010828370330265296,0.002165674066053059,0.016783974011911208

How much of the build that you're guiding to is attributable to loan growth versus some rate or repricing tailwinds, runoff of legacy swaps, what have you? And does that acceleration in NII you cited for the second-half continue into '26 given some of those tailwinds should remain in place beyond '25?",70.0,30.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'm always reluctant to talk about the back half of '25. So I'll leave '26 for another time. But we don't have a whole lot of news, Stephen, relative to what we talked about in the prior quarters. We're obviously pointing right now to deposit growth in particular because it's beginning to get back to something more normal. There was a period there where deposit balances were declining as people got back to something more normal in their accounts. But we're highlighting here consumer found its floor in August, wealth found its floor in July. And that's giving some support then as we grow deposits. That's helping us with the NII growth. So that hasn't changed. It's just that now we've got successive quarters of growth that we can actually point to. The loan growth that you asked about is interesting in that -- there were several quarters there where we were bouncing around flattish on loans. In Q2, we added $9 billion of loans. In Q3, we added $19 billion. In Q4, we added $20 billion. So the loan growth has picked up a little bit. We can sort of see a little more optimism with clients, a little more activity, a little more demand from clients for loan growth. So those two things, a little more confidence around deposit growth, a little more confidence around loan growth, those obviously compound through the course of the year. So that will help us in the back half of '25. And then as you pointed out, we're still a beneficiary of the fixed asset repricing. That comes from some of the old loans that are on our books that come off in 2025 and we reprice. And then we've got some cash flow swaps that also will mature through the course of the year. So that's what leads us to this idea of we think the NII growth will accelerate to 6% to 7% and for the full-year. So a little bit of it -- a little bit faster in the back half of the year, we kind of just see that, but that's what gives us the confidence on NII.",374.0,164.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.012195121951219513,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.012195121951219513

Just at a recent conference, you spoke about the expectation of delivering 200 bps of sustainable operating leverage, laying out an algorithm where revenues grew 4% to 5%, expenses grow 2% to 3%. What gives you confidence in that ability to deliver that level of top line growth on a sustainable basis? Just want to unpack that a little bit further.",67.0,31.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.0,0.0

And having produced that for five years in a row, I think it was by quarters or something like that. And so it's not something we haven't done. But if you think about the current environment, what's driving is different. Our revenue growth is growing at twice that rate plus and the expense growth is growing close to that number. But when you get to higher growth rates, especially where it's coming from Wealth Management business, market-based business, businesses in investment banking, it attaches a higher sort of instantaneous expense. And yet it still produces even a little bit of operating leverage at a higher growth rate, a good after-tax, a good EPS result, a good net operating income results. So there's different times, different models. This is a model where revenue is growing faster than it might grow all the time in more normalized environments, but the business is coming from are those businesses which have the quickest move relative to expense. Giving you an example of that of the normalized last year's expense and think about our expectations from '23 to '24 and you look at the growth rate, a big part of the growth rate in expense about 45% to 50% of it is the incentives to the wealth management teammates, which is a good thing. And so that means revenue is growing, and we're taking about half of that in. And if you look at the other pieces added to that. So Steven, it's simply put, we did it before. We know we can do it. You can see underlying setup. And as you see NII kick in the consumer business, which is more incrementally profitable because of NII, you see that kick in and you see the expense base there flattening out. And you see the revenue base of the company broaden out, you'll see that we'll get back to the operating leverage that we expected, albeit it may be a little slower year-over-year growth rate unless you're going to tell the market, it's going to go up 25%, 30% every year and drive the wealth management. When that slows down to a more normal growth rate that will slow down its expense growth rate also, therefore, you'll see the opening up at that level. So it's not something we make up. It's something we put in our operating principles and it's something we have done a lot of quarters, but we have to sort of get the stability in the relative business position.",459.0,211.0,8.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.037914691943127965,0.014218009478672985,0.009478672985781991,0.0,0.0,0.023696682464454975

At the end of the day, our costs are all people, and that's been relatively stable, and that will start to flow through because during the course of last year, we basically kept the head count relatively stable. We had some offbeat expenses that we had to deal with, but now we're sort of settling into that 213,000 level people with the takeout on stuff through operating excellence and putting in on stuff into quiet coverage, expanding our pipes to draw more marketing, more client coverage, more technology investment.

Alastair, is the deposit growth in the model that you've laid out the year being used to pay down more expensive funding? You've talked about the ability to kind of self-fund balance sheet growth. And then also, is there any sense of the yield pickup you get on the swap roll off and replacement that you could give us kind of ballpark on?",85.0,39.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.05128205128205128,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.0,-0.02564102564102564

So I think your first question was if we get the deposit growth we anticipate, do we think we'll use some of that to pay off some of the higher cost liabilities on the balance sheet? The answer is yes. That's consistent with what we said in prior calls. We've done that. If you look at the other institutional CDs, you'll see they came down by another $7 billion this quarter. So as we grow the really high-quality parts of the deposit franchise that allows us to take those down. And that's one of the things that's going to help grow net interest yield on an ongoing basis. It's not NII accretive necessarily, but it helps us with net interest yield. So that remains a part of the strategy, John, you'll see that continue. As it relates to the cash flow swaps and how those reprice? No, we typically don't lay out the table of what we've got on and how it reprices over time, but it is embedded in our guidance. So each quarter, when I give you guidance for the next quarter, that will incorporate what we know is coming off on the cash flow swaps and how that does. The other fixed rate assets you can kind of see in our supplemental information just based on the originations of resi mortgage, the originations of auto loans. And every time, obviously, we're booking new residential mortgage and old residential mortgages coming off, we're picking up 250 basis points every time there. So you can see that happening each time you pick up the supplemental. We just don't tend to disclose the cash flow swaps.

We'd expect to continue to step back at the highest levels, we are in the money, we pay the dividend, we invest in the growth of the business, and then we use the rest of buyback stock. That was $3.5 billion in the past couple of quarters. So at this earnings rate, that seems level that makes sense. We're 11.9, we think at a 10.7 requirement, a buffer of 11 -- 50, that's 11.2. Obviously, there's going to be some sort of changes in the capital rules, and we'll have to settle it after we see that, and we hope some relief in the volatility of the CCAR outcomes, because remember that last year, we jumped quite a bit without a lot of correlation to the actual risk of the company and stuff.

I think the capital normalization will be more sort of holding that capital to grow through it and not have to retain more capital for growth, frankly, if there's math that helps us favor it. But the NIM is probably more critical to move the yield from sub-2% this quarter -- 2% this quarter to 10-plus at the end of the fourth quarter and then moving from there. That, as you know, is -- all that flows the bottom line. So we'll continue to drive the RTC back up as -- if you look back in the areas where there was any front-end. Fed funds was 2%. We were running a couple of hundred basis points more. It's the huge zero interest deposit base, especially in consumer and low interest deposit base that provides a lot of leverage.

But when we see good environments like this, some companies tend to really blow out numbers. You guys have zero loss days, tend to blow out numbers.

But over a course of time, we just want us to keep walking up the ladder and they've done a great job of doing that, continuing to drive the business. In fact, if you look at year-over-year comparisons because your point was obviously something we asked ourselves, we looked at the last 48 hours, here 24 hours, basically, a lot of people in the same range as opposed to fourth quarter where some people's last year's fourth quarter was down a lot in the prior year. Ours was more stable. And I think last year's fourth quarter was one of the highest fourth quarters we ever had. And then we put another 10% plus growth on top of it. So think of us as being that business that just is imperturbable, just keeps commonly growing forward and driving itself up without having maybe some of that more traditional trading house up and down. Not because we're not good at.

So this is literally a weighting of a base case, which would match that in an adverse case and some other cases just in the way we build methodologies for the reserves because you're reserving for uncertain future, and that's how it has it.

Brian, I think I heard you say in response to John's question that you think the exit rate, net interest margin will be 2.1%, I think in 4Q '25, I just wanted to confirm that I heard that correctly.

There are I think two things going on right now that are interesting. The first one is, generally speaking, in the commercial businesses with the higher-end deposits. We're typically following the rate cuts and just going down 25 basis points. Obviously, at the other extreme on the noninterest-bearing, there's nothing we can do with that. It's already noninterest bearing. But we're following the Fed cuts, we're moving the rates with discipline accordingly. And then the second thing that's going on is there was some rotation going on over the course of the past 2 years, where there have been a lot of things going from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing across the different parts of our businesses. That has slowed significantly. So you look at, for example, consumer noninterest-bearing, that seems to have bottomed out in February of last year, and the noninterest-bearing balances are growing now again. So that rotation is slowing also. Both of those things are factoring into our guidance.",186.0,90.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.011111111111111112,0.0,0.0,-0.022222222222222223

So Erika, if you look at the interesting part, that's gone on in the last couple of quarters just from a deposit behavior. If you look at our accounts that were here prior to the pandemic to now, you saw a run-up and then you saw a little depletion and it's basically stabilized at a level. But if you look at it in the aggregate, all the depletion is actually driven by the highest balance accounts, like 250, 500 average balances million and the others are still multiples of where they were before, that's been going on, and they've been growing, and they're growing 9% year-over-year in the lower balance accounts as people make more money in store more cash and have cash flow. So if you think about what had happened is our average balance count was around 7,000, went up to 11,000, and now it's basically stable at 9,000 checking accounts, and that's kind of -- and you can grow out from there. That is very valuable because checking is either zero or very low interest. And so it's where the growth we see coming as deposits grow in consumer that helps produce irrespective of the market dynamics or the higher at the market price deposits where you see the impact of the deposit franchise coming through. So consumer being down 1 basis point quarter-to-quarter doesn't sound like a lot, but you got to remember a lot of the stuff, it doesn't really price but are they growing that stuff?

And just as a follow-up, both you and Alastair have during -- over the course of 2024, started introducing the concept of a normalized net interest margin of 2.3%. With the neutral rate maybe around 4%, does -- can BMA get there more quickly, particularly given the deposit dynamics that you mentioned, Brian? I guess I'm trying to -- we're just trying to figure out, you guys did introduce the concept of normalized NIM. So I'm not trying to seek out guidance in terms of '26 or '27 or whatever, but you had to have told us that for a reason.

Simple because that's obvious because the sheer volume of loans. So if we were sitting here in the October, I think when we're talking about that, the amount of rate cuts was still, I don't know how many more -- 3 or 4 more than we've had so far, and now we're down to 1. So as it stays at a higher nominal rate, you'll see this adjustment come through. There are two caveats at. One is we're carrying a larger markets balance sheet, which, by definition, is a little less robust in that area. And then secondly, we're carrying a lot of low -- a lot of excess liquidity just because we're running that down as Alastair said.

Because if you think about it, we just don't have enough fixed rate assets repricing to really drive NII. In any given quarter, you've got a few billion of resi mortgage, a few billion of CVL repricing, let's call that 10 to 12. You've got $8 billion to $10 billion of hold to maturity securities repricing. But that's in the context of a $3.3 trillion balance sheet. So it's still the short-term that drives most of the NII. So when Brian says, obviously, we're helped by the fact that there might be two or three rate cuts less than they were previously. That's obviously helpful. But the big thing is always for us in terms of year-over-year growth, it's always about deposit growth and loan growth. The fixed rate asset repricing is turbo charges a little bit at the margin but it's about deposit and loan growth, and those are the important ones.

The places that our industry, our company have been advocating heavily is that we've had a little bit of a situation from the pre-pandemic to-post pandemic where you've seen capital -- required capital go up nominally 10%, 15%, 20%. And not a big change in the risk of the companies. And that is to all the mathematics behind all the counting, right? And so we're saying, oh, well, wait, we aren't indexing the G-SIB. So therefore, our relative size economy isn't growing as fast as it was intended to be indexed on that basis, isn't there. You've had, as you said, sort of accretion of sort of methodologies that keep pulling more in, including the stress test volatility that we've all pointed out to them. And then -- and the last point you make it is if you look at this concept of Basel III making equivalent around the world is completely off in a different world because we're using advanced -- excuse me, the rest of the world is using advanced. We're using standardized gold plate or whatever you want to talk about, it's just apples and oranges. And so I would never think that we go -- and we ever got to Europe, our numbers would be probably a big -- a lot higher, but that's not going to happen because just we're going to have -- we as a society have a more conservatively capitalized industry. So I think it's simply put if they were to take into account our clear statement -- our clear advocacy about as an industry about index take the volatility out of CCAR, how can it change so much in the relatively same scenario. And also, behind the scenes, all the changes in accounting, not a counting, but accounting for risk you're increasing capital requirements and without an explicit decision to do so. And we think that, that would be worth probably 100 basis points or so. If you really sat back and thought about it, how do you get there, Mike? Think about our volatility in CCAR outcomes, I think we went from we want to buy, I don't know, 50, 70 basis points last year, whatever it was. The risk of the company didn't change. As a matter of fact, it probably went down, honestly. And so that's what we're working on. So we want to see that. And then in a day-to-day supervision, we just want to see people focused on safety and soundness and good management and making sure there's the regular agencies cooperate on things like BSA and AML and things that -- everybody is all over the place, and the industry is trying to sort it out in the middle.

So, if the consumer team had, you know, more credit card loan growth that was based on what they think the right risk balance is and getting paid for it, etc., that's gone on. You saw us just grow balances last quarter out of loans or whatever. And so, I think it -- you know, I don't see that. Wealth management, obviously, not much of a RWA user in a lot of ways. And then, you know, the real question is -- in a global banking business, again, if they get strong loan growth there's nothing that we're slowing it down. In the markets business, we continue to drive the capital up, being the lowest return on equity business we have. We have to be a little careful that we don't do it. But Jim and the team had done a great job. And we've -- basically, the balance sheet is $300 billion larger than it was four, five years ago. And they've grown -- you know, we've grown through the G-SIBs, as you know, from 2.5 to 3, and, you know, we'll keep probably growing through those and that we use some. But it's not like we'd say you can't have it because of capital. It's really just running the company and keeping the balance and the overall management of the risk and where we want to take risk and how we do it.

Even though you have enough capital to put to those businesses, if the returns aren't making your hurdles -- you know, maybe it could with some tweaks. You know, I've heard some of your peers talk about equity prime brokerage as one area that could have higher returns if capital requirements are reduced.

We look at the risk and sort of market-based capital and other things. But it could take the sort of, for lack of a better term, a little bit of the penalty to some of these businesses down some. But you also have to remember the ROA and the mix of businesses, and there's another side to this because we have 6%, you know, tangible common equity, and we got to produce returns on that, and low ROA of businesses affect that. So, there are things that will favor it under regulatory capital but not favor it under sort of market-based disciplines. So, we work through all that. I don't expect to see change in how we do it, but also don't think that any of our businesses are constrained because we're not having capital. So, if Jim and the team have a chance to go prime brokerage and make it work, in our company, we can have other businesses which have very high ROAs to make up for it.

I think one thing that hasn't changed -- our underwriting strategy, our standards, our risk appetite, our client selection, those really haven't changed, Gerard. But I think you're right. Things are obviously different than 2019. 2019, we didn't have this rate structure. So, that's a little bit harder at the margin for the consumer. At the same time, the consumer is stronger. We can see that in the deposit balances. We can see it right now in the consumer spending in the 3% to 4% range. We can see it in the balances being elevated over five years ago. We can see it in the unemployment level, the income level, home prices, wealth effects. So, look, 2019 was freakishly low in terms of like a historical norm. But things have settled in here. We sort of said a year ago, we thought they would plateau right around where we are. We're glad to see three or four quarters now with some stability. It feels pretty good on the consumer side. It feels very good still on the commercial side. So, that's why we're sort of laying out.

But we have wars, you have trade wars, etc., that bothers. You have the availability of resource around the world, whether it's physical resource or human resource, to do work and shortage of that because unemployment rates in a lot of countries are pretty low. And so, can you get the productivity to keep growing the economy? You know, but -- all the usual things. But if you think about it, you know, Gerard, just to be clear, we've seen a 15-year run, you know, from after the pandemic -- excuse me, after the global financial crisis or more, year run, where you've seen constantly improving, you know, credit statistics that then interrupted in the pandemic a little bit and then because of the stimulus dropped down again and now it's back to normal. But that's a long-term trend. So, it's not complacency. It's just that how much leverage is building up in the system that there'll be difficulties with, either at the household level, at the corporate, at the company level. And then, you know, a lot of it's outside the banking system. So, we worry about that and how it reverberates into the banking system because just leverage that exists out there at higher levels than we traditionally have given. And the banking system still affect us because that means if people can't carry it, they'll be restructuring the companies and bankruptcies and things like that, which are going on today, but they're going on a level which is very manageable. So, we worry about all those things and, you know, the federal debt levels and the pinch that will come out of state and federal spending that they need to slow down the growth. All those things are factors which we think about. And the way we manage the company is to run it so that, given those events, we can continue to operate. And that's why the stress testing, quite frankly, is a good thing because it makes you think about the parade of horribles happening, even though they don't happen, and make sure that you are positioned to survive them. And, you know, if you said to -- the question Alastair answered, one of the big impacts across time here in the banking industry is because the top 30 institutions are doing stress testing, which assumes that you're wrong in your underwriting and the economy goes, you know, from 4% unemployment to 10% employment overnight -- unemployment overnight. You know, think about the impact of that on bringing the underwriting narrower so that you can afford that capital that you have to hold for that outcome even though that outcome hasn't occurred. That's going across a big portion of the banking industry. So, I just think it's more fundamentally structured, but leverage is going to be the issue.

So, small business -- small medium-sized businesses -- so in our business banking category in our -- so we have small business, business bank, and we have, you know, global commercial banking, and think middle market. Across that environment, the draw rates and lines of credit stuff are still much lower than they were in a pre-pandemic and things like that and to hire some more people when the payroll dynamics of that, whatever it is. And they might permanently finance that, but immediately, they use lines. And the draw rates, you know, 400 basis points over where it normally runs, so to speak, which means that they're drawing at less rate. And that probably means they're doing a little less. And so, we haven't seen that move a lot. That's a to-come in terms of loan growth, as Alastair mentioned earlier. But their optimism has changed, and you saw that -- you know, and that's really around the other things. When you talk to our small business customers, and we made these points to, you know, people in Washington is the over -- you know, the regulation, the impact, the hard -- it's hard to do business, hard to get things done, you know, the rules coming out, they don't have the big, you know, staffs that, you know, we do and other companies do that can deal with all that. And so, it all confuses, it slows them down, it makes them hesitate. Their belief is that that's change. And that's why you see the optimism come up. And then, we got to translate that optimism into activity. And then, you'll see the long growth come.

And second, given the market volatility and concerns of potential changes in the economy and its outlook, at the end of the quarterly presentation, I'm going to give you some facts to set the context about the quality of our credit portfolios, our capital, and liquidity as we may face periods of economic change and set that in the context to how we fared prior to past periods of economic stress. So let's get going on slide two of the discussion. This morning, Bank of America reported $7.4 billion in net income, and $0.90 in EPS for the first quarter of 2025. That's a solid start to 2025 and great work by our teams. On a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue by 6%. Grew net income at 11%, we grew earnings per share 18%, and we delivered more capital back to shareholders and we reduced shares in the aggregate by 3%. We produced an 89 basis points return on assets, and a 14% return on tangible common equity in the first quarter. So let me hit on a few highlights that drove that performance. Net interest income grew 3% year over year and is up from quarter four to the high end of our guidance range we gave you three months ago. We grew deposits for the seventh straight quarter. They reached nearly $2 trillion a quarter end and have now grown 8% from their mid-2023 low point. We grew commercial loans in nearly every line of business. This is the second quarter in a row they've grown across the board. Holly O'Neil and our consumer team marked the twenty-fifth straight quarter of net new checking account growth. We saw annual flows to our consumer investments business of $22 billion over the last twelve months. Our wealth management businesses led by Eric and Lindsay and Katie Knox in the private bank together added 7,200 net new households in this quarter and saw net AUM flows of $24 billion in the quarter. Jim Demar and the team recorded a twelve straight quarter of year-over-year sales and trading revenue growth. That achieved a 16% return on allocated capital. We generated these results working from a strong balance sheet with over $200 billion in regulatory capital nearly $1 trillion in liquidity. This allows us to provide strong support and solutions for our clients. Turning to slide three. On organic growth. One of the keys to our earnings improvement has been our ability to consistently drive organic growth. Organic growth remains strong across the businesses as highlighted on Slide three. I will go through all the statistics and all the points on the page, but as you can see, the minimum has continued. I noted the continued growth in net new checking new households, new companies of commercial banking, and growth in our institutional markets business. Clients continue to see the value of our capabilities and connected businesses as a company. Our digital engagement and sales continue to expand across all our business. We saw more than 14 billion logins in 2024. Erika has now surpassed 2.7 billion interactions since its inception. Our Cash Pro app for our commercial customers continued strong adoption and usage rates as you can see. Transactions sent through Zelle at Bank of America are not only speed times the number of checks written by our Bank of America customers, but also 1.3 times the number of checks written plus the number of cash transactions taking money out of the ATMs. It's also worth noting that digitally enabled sales in our consumer product business across the board reached 65% of total sales. You can see these trends on digital in the slides we show you each quarter, on slides twenty-six, twenty-eight, and thirty in the appendix, and we commend those to you. As you go to slide four, showed you some of the highlights in economic activity. Provide some of the current spending data by our consumers of Bank of America, there's a lot to potentially change given the uncertainty around the tariffs and other policies in the future path of the economy. And our communications with all of you, just so we've done during other stress periods, we want to relay to you those facts, which we think give you some context. But before we do that, our research team, like many research teams led by Candice Browning, does not currently believe we'll see a recession in 2025. However, they've lowered their GDP growth rates for 2025. And continue to see no rate cuts during 2025 but expect as inflation gets under control, you may see them in the future. In I e in 2026. But going more to what our customer data shows, it shows that the money moving across all our consumer spending methods debit, credit cards, ACH, checks written, Zelle, etcetera. All that aggregate shows a group about 4.4% pace in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024. As you look in the chart and look across it, you can note that consumer spending has been consistently growing year over year but during last year, it actually slowed a bit, especially in the summer and picked back up in the fall. That resulted in the fourth quarter of 2024 over the fourth quarter of 2023 being about a 4% pace, and that pace has continued. That pace has also continued through the first part of April. We note that some retailers may say that their sales are slower and others are picking but in the aggregate, the consumer keeps pushing money into the economy. As we look at our business side and what our business clients are telling you, in the current setting, they remain profitable liquid, and have strong results. They all look ahead and worry about the same things that you hear reflected in your conversations with them also. So we continue to watch for signs of the environment actually changing. We thought it would be good to share with you what we're actually seeing on our customer base at this moment. So far so in summary for Bank of America for the first quarter of 2025, want to thank the team for another strong quarter. We saw good organic client activity, we saw enjoyed good growth in revenue and earnings. We continue to invest in the future growth of our company. We manage the risk well. That drove healthy returns for you, our shareholders, and we increased the capital delivered back to our shareholders. That, I'm going to turn it over to Alastair to talk you through the",1176.0,590.0,17.0,8.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0288135593220339,0.013559322033898305,0.01694915254237288,0.001694915254237288,0.0,0.015254237288135594

I start on Slide five of the earnings presentation to provide a little more context on the quarter. And as Brian noted, we generated $7.4 billion in net income or $0.90 per diluted share this quarter. And that represents good growth over both last quarter and the year earlier period. On slide six, we note some of the highlights of the quarter. Revenue of $27.5 billion on an FTE basis grew 6% from the first quarter of '24. Most revenue items showed improvement year over year. NII grew 3% Investment and brokerage fees rose 15% with both assets under management flows and market levels contributing nicely to the growth. This quarter's $5.6 billion in sales and trading revenue grew 9% from the year-ago period. Service charges grew 8% with particular strength in our global payment solutions revenue. Card income improved 4%. And other income also improved driven by gains mostly associated with leveraged finance positions and these were positions that we disposed of during the quarter. Non-interest expense was $17.8 billion up from the fourth quarter driven by seasonally elevated payroll taxes and markets revenue-related costs of processing and incentives. Litigation costs were also higher related to a recent decision in a long-running matter. Good operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 300 basis points faster than expense compared to Q1 2024. Provision expense for the quarter was $1.5 billion with asset quality remaining in great shape. Preferred dividends were $125 million less than the first quarter of 2024, as we redeemed some preferreds over the past year. And used some of our excess capital to reduce our outstanding shares 4% from the first quarter of last year. All of these things aided in EPS improving 18% year over year. Let's move to discussion of the balance sheet using Slide seven. You can see assets ended the quarter at $3.35 trillion. That's up $88 billion euros from the fourth quarter driven by higher levels of client activity in global markets. In addition, loans grew $15 billion in the quarter supported by $24 billion in As deposit growth exceeded loan growth, we continue to add to our liquidity. Long-term debt increased $21 billion driven by funding needs to support the growth in client assets, average global excess liquidity at $942 billion remained strong and up year over year. Shareholders' equity was flat with the fourth quarter around $296 billion. And within that, we returned $6.5 billion of capital back shareholders, with $2 billion in common dividends, and the repurchase of $4.5 billion in shares. It's worth noting that year-over-year equity is up $2 billion and a $10 billion increase in common equity was partially offset by a 28% reduction in preferred stock. Tangible book value per share of $27.12 rose 9% from the first quarter of 2024. Turning to regulatory capital on Slide eight. Our CET1 level increased to $201 billion and the CET1 ratio is 11.8%. This is down 11 basis points and remains well above our 10.7% requirement. You can see in the waterfall, we deployed capital in a number of ways this quarter. In addition to the increased amount of share repurchases, we allocated more capital to our Global Markets business and grew both consumer and commercial loans. Within the ending loan growth, it's worth noting we bought an $8 billion portfolio of residential that's both high and quality and allows good potential to expand relationships with customers beyond those mortgage loans. And we expect these loans to add just over $100 million in NII annually. Supplemental leverage ratio was 5.7% versus a minimum requirement of 5% leaves capacity for balance sheet growth and our $468 billion of total loss absorbing capital means our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. As you see on Slide nine, we've now grown deposits for the seventh consecutive quarter on an average basis and we're near $2 trillion euros on an ending basis. Typically, we see some downward pressure on deposits as we move from Q4 to Q1, as commercial clients use their cash to pay bonuses and taxes. And this year, we saw commercial deposits more stable as clients remain highly liquid. In addition, we remain disciplined on pricing as we pass through short rate declines and saw a 24 basis point decline in rate paid in global banking. We saw continued stability around our consumer non-interest bearing balances and as interest rates move lower in CDs and preferred deposits on our brokerage platform, we saw a three basis point decline in rates paid in consumer banking this quarter. To 61 basis points. Overall, rate paid moved 194 basis points in Q4 to 179 basis points this quarter and were lower in every business segment. Let's turn to loans by looking at average balances on Slide ten. And you can see loans in Q1 of $1.09 trillion improved 4% year over year. Driven by 7% commercial loan growth. Excluding commercial real estate, that year-over-year growth was 9%. We noted a modest increase in revolver utilization during the quarter, as clients navigate the current environment. Consumer loans grew modestly year over year with linked quarter movement reflecting seasonal credit card paydowns. And the $8 billion of residential loans we purchased this quarter and that I noted earlier. Those will come onto the balance sheet or they came onto the end of the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. So they don't really impact averages this period and will begin to impact them next.",883.0,519.0,13.0,6.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,6.0,0.025048169556840076,0.011560693641618497,0.0,0.0038535645472061657,0.005780346820809248,0.01348747591522158
BAC,2025-04-15,2025-04-15,,2025-04-15,2025-04-15T08:30:00-04:00,0,2025-04-15,prepared,,Alastair Borthwick,"Where on a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q1 was $14.4 billion. And on a fully taxable equivalent basis, NII was $14.6 billion. That's up 3% from the first quarter of last year. We finished at the higher end of our expected range. And NII grew $75 million on a fully taxable equivalent basis over Q4 even as we incurred approximately $250 million headwind from two fewer days of interest accrual. The improvement was driven by global markets activity, as well as deposit favorability and loan growth. And fixed-rate asset repricing also benefited NII. With regard to interest rate sensitivity, on a dynamic deposit basis, we provide a twelve-month change in NII for an instantaneous shift in the curve. That means interest rates would have to move instantaneously another 100 basis points lower than the forecasts already expected and contemplated in the April tenth curve. On that basis, a 100 basis point decline would decrease NII over the next twelve months by $2.2 billion. And if rates went up 100 basis points, again, more than the forward curve, NII would benefit by roughly $1 billion. With regard to a forward view of NII, given the uncertainty of announced tariffs, we've seen expectations for more cuts in interest rates and more variability now in the market expectations for economic growth. So let us provide a few thoughts for you using slide twelve to illustrate. In Q4, we provided our expectation that we could exit Q4 of 2025. With NII, on a fully taxable equivalent basis in a range of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion. And that included an acceleration of NII growth in the second half of the year. Our assumptions underlying that NII belief then included an interest rate which anticipated one rate cut in the middle of the year and modest loan and deposit growth. And while the interest rate environment has changed a little, our current expectation for the exit rate of NII in Q4 remains unchanged. Using the first quarter 2025 as the base, the waterfall gives you some idea of our assumptions to bridge to our Q4 2025 expected exit rate. First, we pick up two additional days of interest, one in each of the next couple of quarters. Fixed-rate asset repricing also benefits our NII, it takes into account the impact of the current interest rate curve. There are three primary buckets for that benefit. Securities, mortgage loans, and cash flow hedges. Security pay downs are running about $8 to $9 billion a quarter. Mortgage loans are another $4 to $5 billion a quarter. And each gains a little more than 200 basis points as they're replaced. Cash flow swap repricing benefits are a little more staggered than their roll down and make up the rest of the benefit here. We assume the early April interest rate curve, which reflects four cuts, and a couple are later in the year. So that will have some negative impact near term on our expected NII growth but it improves as the funding costs more fully reflect those cuts. Best proxy for that impact is our asset sense which even below the rates cuts currently in the curve. We provide our best estimate using the timing of those cuts. And at the same time, with lower rates, we would expect just a little more loan and deposit activity and we estimate the NII impact of that growth would offset some of the interest rate impact from lower rates. We already saw modestly better deposit growth in the first quarter than we expected. In addition, we believe our liability-sensitive global market will also likely benefit NII more as we move through the year. And that obviously depends on the way clients choose to trade with us. Bottom line, our fourth quarter exit rate expectation for NII is unchanged to $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion from our previous expectation. And that means we're still expecting strong full-year NII improvement this year of 6% to 7%. Okay. Let's turn to expense. And we'll use Slide thirteen for the discussion. We reported a little less than $17.8 billion in expense this quarter. And that included roughly $500 million in seasonal elevation from payroll tax and some markets related revenue-related costs. We also had higher litigation expense to $160 million driven by a recent decision in a long-running matter. And remember, as you think about the expense increase from Q4, that quarter included a $300 million release of accruals for the FDIC special assessment. Expense compared to Q1 2024 is up a little less 3%. Consistent with our full-year 2025 growth expectations and the increase reflects costs of higher sales and trading and wealth management fees and in the investments made to add more sales associates and to support increased technology and marketing costs. Let's move to credit and turn to Slide fourteen. Where our asset quality remains sound. Net charge-offs were $1.45 billion modestly down compared to Q4. This is the fifth consecutive quarter that net charge-offs have hovered around $1.5 billion. The total net charge-off ratio this quarter was 54 basis points flat with Q4. Q1 provision expense was $1.5 billion and matched net charge-offs. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.1 billion consistent with the past few quarters. Now 90% of our consumer net charge-offs are driven by credit card, which highlights the importance of prudence in underwriting that portfolio as we note on Slide twenty-two. On the commercial side, we saw losses of $333 million down modestly from Q4. Near term, we don't expect much change in net charge-offs as you can see improvement in both early and late-stage delinquencies from the fourth quarter. That tells us the net charge-offs could even be a touch lower next quarter on the consumer side. On Slide fifteen, in addition to the improvement in we note the modest changes in other stats for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Okay. Let's move to the various lines of business and some brief comments on their results. Starting on Slide sixteen with Consumer Banking. For clients, Consumer Banking continues to deliver strong organic growth driven by high touch and high-tech capabilities convenience and security. For shareholders through NII in particular, this business is increasingly seeing benefits fall to the bottom line for its high-quality deposit book, with only 61 basis point rate paid on nearly $950 billion of deposits. In Q1, consumer banking generated $10.5 billion in revenue, and $2.5 billion in net income. Revenue grew 3% from the first quarter of 2024 as NII growth was complemented by fee improvement in card and service charges. Expenses rose 6% as we continued our business investment and worked through elevated compliance costs. The organic growth that Brian noted on slide three included nearly 250,000 net new checking accounts this quarter, another strong period of card openings and strong investment account growth. Investment balances grew 9% to $498 billion with full-year flows of $22 billion and market improvement. Consumer banking deposits continued to increase from their mid-August low that was $928 billion it's now at $972 billion pounds on an ending basis. Looking at averages, deposits grew $5.2 billion from the fourth quarter to $948 billion and our rate paid declined to 61 basis points. Finally, as you can see in the appendix Slide twenty-six, digital adoption and engagement continue to improve and customer experience scores rose to record levels illustrating the appreciation of enhanced capabilities from these investments. Moving to wealth management on Slide seventeen, the business had another strong quarter. With a continued increase in banking product usage from our investing clients, the diversification of the revenue in this business continues to grow. The number of clients that have banking products with us continues to grow also and is now approaching two-thirds of the client base. Importantly, about 30% of our revenue remains in net interest income which complements the fees earned in our advice-driven model. And those have also grown. Net income of $1 billion rose modestly from the first quarter of 2024 a solid revenue growth was mostly offset by higher revenue-related costs, and continued investments. In Q1, we reported revenue of $6 billion growing 8% over the prior year led by 15% growth in asset management fees. Expense growth of 9% supported both cost of the increase in fees as well as investment in technology and the cost of hiring to add experienced advisors to the platform in Merrill, and the private bank. Average loans were up 6% year over year. That was driven by growth in custom lending, securities-based lending, and a pickup in mortgage lending. Profits were relatively stable compared to Q4 and our pricing discipline resulted in a 25 basis point decline in rates paid. Both Merrill and the private bank continued to see organic growth and produced strong assets under management flows of $79 billion over the past twelve months which reflects a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting money to work. We also want to draw your attention to the continued digital momentum that you'll find on Slide twenty-eight. Our new accounts continue to be predominantly open digitally. On Slide eighteen, you see the Global Banking results. And the loan and deposit gathering success of the team. In the first quarter, Global Banking produced earnings of $1.9 billion modestly lower than the year-ago quarter as lower credit costs from CRE office losses were more than offset by higher expense of investment in the business. Revenue of $6 billion was flat to the prior year, as lower NII was offset by roughly $230 million higher other income related to leveraged finance positions. As well as higher treasury services revenue. Firm-wide investment banking fees were $1.5 billion in Q1. Similar to last year's first quarter. We maintained our number three investment banking fee position and looking forward, we've got a healthy pipeline and our clients are simply waiting on more clarity on trade policy and the regulatory environment before committing to deals. Expense increased 6% year over year driven by continued investments in technology and operations to support clients. On the balance sheet, we saw good client activity. As I noted earlier, we saw good growth in commercial loans, mitigated by decline in CRE loans. And total average global banking deposits are up 9% year over year, where we saw strong growth across all categories from corporate and commercial clients on the larger end to business banking on the lower end. Switching to Global Markets on Slide nineteen. I'll focus my comments on results excluding DVA as we normally do. As Brian said, we continued our streak of strong revenue and earnings performance achieved operating leverage and continued to deliver a good return on capital. In Q1, we earned $1.9 billion and that grew 8% year over year. Revenue again ex DVA, improved 10% from the first quarter of '24, on good sales and trading results and $230 million of other income on leveraged finance positions similar to Global Banking. Focused on sales and trading ex DVA, revenue improved 9% year over year to $5.6 billion. Equities led the way this quarter growing 17% year over year while FIC grew 5%. Equities and FICC both benefited from increased client activity. Among the market volatility. And our continued investments in the business. On slide twenty, we show all other with a loss of $4 million in Q1 and the driver of the year-over-year improvement in expense and net income is the absence of the first quarter 2024 FDIC special assessment. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 9%, which reflects the discrete impact of share-based compensation awards. As a reminder, our tax rate remains well below our typical corporate tax rate driven by tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing. Looking forward, as we said last quarter, we expect the tax rate for the full year 2025 be in a range of 11% to 13% excluding unusual items. So let's shift gears to finish and we'll use Slide twenty-one. Over the last couple of weeks, investors have signaled concerns for the bank industry over potential changes in the economy. And in light of that, we added the next few slides to illustrate how much stronger our risk profile and balance sheet are today. For whatever economic outcome we might face. And let me offer three important takeaways as you see the next three slides.",2040.0,1170.0,35.0,14.0,20.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,9.0,0.029914529914529916,0.011965811965811967,0.017094017094017096,0.002564102564102564,0.0017094017094017094,0.017948717948717947

Second, at the same time, we strengthened the balance sheet by adding billions of capital and liquidity. Third, following fifteen years of operating under responsible growth, our portfolio and our balance sheet are well prepared to support our clients. In various economic outcomes. Now the left side of Slide twenty-one highlights the shift in the loan portfolio to a more balanced mix of commercial and consumer as well as a more geographically diverse mix. Our high-quality commercial loan portfolio at this point is more than 90% investment grade or collateralized and it also includes a more diversified geographic mix as you see at the bottom of the page. At the top right, you see the improved mix toward a more secured collateralized balance of our consumer book. Bottom right illustrates the nine-quarter loss rate and how our nine-quarter, so this isn't annualized, this is nine-quarter stress loss ratios fared in the Fed models and CCAR exams. And we compare quite favorably to peers in each of the past twelve years of exams. CCAR provides investors an annual independent view. Analyze adverse impacts in the most severe circumstances. So just to recap, if you went to the latest results from 2024, those scenarios include a drop of 6% to 8% in real GDP from peak to trough. It includes a rapid increase in unemployment up to 10%, and significant changes in inflation. It also assumes housing prices falling 35%, it assumes short rates basically go to zero and the ten-year goes to 1%. And it assumes bond spreads widen dramatically commercial real estate prices decline 40%, and equity prices would drop by 50% together with significant weakness in international economies. It also assumes the portfolio size doesn't change from any management actions that we might take in that environment. And we obviously do quite well in that CCAR stressed environment. That, I'm gonna stop I'll turn it back to Brian for a couple of thoughts to wrap up.",341.0,188.0,4.0,9.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.02127659574468085,0.047872340425531915,0.031914893617021274,0.0,0.0,-0.026595744680851064

On that slide, we highlight some of the key balance sheet or asset quality statistics of the company has faced important periods of economic disruption. And we compare those to the current status.

Second column obviously is fourth quarter 'nineteen, which represents what we look like heading into the pandemic. And now we show you what the company looks like today. We have a multifarious loan book. Across types of clients geographies, and various asset classes. That holds us in good stead. Total, our consumers loans are down more than $200 billion as home equity loans are down more than $125 billion and credit card loans, unsecured credit card loans are down more by more than $60 billion.

We are well reserved for our portfolio and risk profile. On a weighted basis, including our model reserves, our imprecision reserves, and our judgmental reserves, it positions us at a six per approximately 6% unemployment rate. The current reserve allocation on card is 7.4%, for example. It gets to charge our freight of about 4.4%. When you go to slide thirty-one, you can see some more statistics about our portfolios. Excuse me. Twenty-three, you can see some more statistics about our portfolios. Let's take a deeper look at those. Just a couple of points. On slide twenty-three, you can see that regards to mortgage, between the first and second lien products today, we have a total of about $260 billion. On average, our borrowers have FICO scores above 770, and average debt to income ratios of 35% for the residential mortgage product and 39% for the home equity product. Loan to values also leave us in strong equity positions being below 50%. For comparative purposes, we ended the financial crisis early 2007 and you can see the exposures were more than $400 billion with average FICO scores were fifty-six fifty to sixty points lower and higher LTVs. So $400 billion more in balances, lower credit scores, and higher LTVs. So we've significantly repositioned those portfolios across the last several years. Moving through the other consumer loan types, you can see the high quality of the collateralized securities based asset lending and other portfolios. And on consumer credit card percent. we have about $100 billion in outstandings with a current net charge off ratio, as I said, about four The FICO score of our average borrower is 777. And thinking about exposure, borrowers are less than a current FICO score of 660, We have about 12% exposure. Art is really our only consumer unsecured exposure in the portfolio. As comparison, adding into the financial crisis in fourth quarter, we had $150 billion in credit card balance about one and a half percent. Of one and a half times our current balance of card loans. The average FICO score was fifty FICO points lower, and the unused lines of those books were much, much higher. This strong position allows us to better serve our clients in the times of stress which may come ahead according to our projections. Bank of America stands ready to support them as never before. Whether it's a commercial client when the when she's helped to borrow and navigate the changing economy around the world, whether it's a commercial client needs to reposition their debt structure or move money. To to help participate in the economy. We'll be there for them. If it's a wealthy client and needs advice and counsel on rocky periods or loan to get them through, we're there for them. If consumers need to access to cash or borrowing, we're also there for them. Bottom line, operating the company in this way allows us to stand tall in time to stress.

Wanted to start off with one on capital management. Certainly encouraging to see the acceleration, the buyback towards that $4.5 billion level. At the same time, you're still running with more than 100 basis points of cushion I was hoping you could speak to, given the uncertainty in the environment, what level of CET1 you're currently comfortable running with in terms of the ratio, and whether this $4.5 billion buyback level is something that we expect to be sustained over the near to medium term.",99.0,53.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.05660377358490566,0.018867924528301886,0.03773584905660377,0.0,0.0,0.03773584905660377

So Steve, if you look at what we did this quarter, just take a look at slide eight in the earnings materials. Now here's a quarter where we ended up earning $7 billion and you know, it allowed us to step up the share buyback from $3.5 billion up to $4.5 billion in an environment where we also invested more RWAs in global markets, and into higher loan balances. So not only do we, you know, grow the loans call them organically, but we also purchased a loan portfolio this quarter. So we're sort of growing into our capital at this point. By investing in the business and we still have some flexibility to increase the share buyback. So I don't think we have an ultimate destination in mind right now on CET one. Recognizing that we don't have full clarity yet on all the aspects of capital, and we'd like to see that before we before we determine it. But obviously, as you point out, we've got a lot of flexibility. And we're we're more focused on just make sure that the CET one's in a good place and then grow into the capital base that we have. That's probably the best way to articulate it. It's great. And for my follow-up, just on the outlook for loan and deposit growth. You know, you delivered better growth across both KPIs relative to peers. Somebody could speak to what drove the strength in one q beyond the portfolio purchase you alluded to earlier, And just bigger picture, the outlook for commercial loan growth as tariffs and policy uncertainty certainly raised concerns regarding weakening loan demand.

Remember over the last several years, we've been investing in basically building out more commercial bankers across the world. Including build outs in Switzerland and the UK and things like that. We built more commercial loan officers in United States and our our public commercial banking business under Lendinga team. Private bankers and more in the in the wealth management team under Merrill, what we call wealth management bankers, support those teams who've grown them. So those investments sort of, you know, kicking in on that sort of yeah, twenty twenty mile march way, just more of a more of a more of a net keeps driving it through. So that's why you're seeing us sort of do better in the competition just in linked quarter loan growth. We look forward, you know, with all the things you described, the statue changes economy, business views, people draw, in anticipation of tougher economic times. We'll see all that play out. But the real way that the real reason that we're driving our capabilities is you have more capacity and then making that honestly, we're also making that capacity more efficient using some artificial intelligence machine learning to direct that calling capacity, and that's allowed us to take what we call new logos in the commercial business, adding new companies, The first time you're seeing that having started a couple years ago is now maturing in the balances in outstanding switch.

And then we have the ability to layer on top after we model our reserves. We have the ability to layer on imprecision and judgmental on top of that. So we did this quarter the same way that we've done in other quarters. We went through and assessed using the blue chip economic indicators, so the consensus view of all of the various macro assumptions. That's sometimes different than others who use their own proprietary. We feel like the right answer is to use the blue chip consensus. It's more independent. And then we've got that as our baseline. And we've got four other scenarios around that. We've got upside, and three downside. And so in this particular quarter, already the blue chip economic indicators have moved down in terms of economic growth. So GDP lower in the baseline. And a little higher on inflation. So that's reflected in the baseline before we even get to the weightings. And then weightings this quarter, we those are unchanged for us. And by the time we then take that modeled answer, and then layer on top of it the judgmental piece all the way through the close, we're reserved closer to an unemployment rate that's right around 6%.

Starting a number of years ago, this has been a relentless climb up the ladder and and not overshooting and and having to cut off. So that, you know, three years of year-over-year growth, you know, consecutive quarters that other people don't do because there's more volatility. So Jim and the team are basically building up. So what have we done? More capital. Probably over five or six years, we you know, $300 billion more debt balance sheet capacity even though the this quarter was sixty ish billion dollars. So we keep adding capabilities capacity. But remember, the and we've, you know, on a relentless march, you have fourth third in this category your third, second in this category, keep moving up.

It's just the way the gym and the team have driven it, and they've done a frankly, a very good job doing it. And so expect us to keep gaining share. We'll keep closing the gaps that you mentioned, It's getting closer to the you know, third place gap. But you know, in a given quarter, other people may shoot up a little higher because of this element or that element, but our job is to just do because consistent across all the elements that we participate in.

Everything you said is true. Loans, deposits, credit's good. Charge offs went, you know, down. Delinquencies are down at the end of the quarter versus fourth quarter. You're looking at all that and say, okay. That's that's what we did. If we look forward, you know, our our economists, your economists, I'm sure, are all predicting a slowdown in growth. And the the core question will be when all these different policies and stuff come together and response with the policies by, you know, other trading partners.

Dimension one is, yep, I think you know, less regulations new and getting other regulations off the book and refining based on view that the pendulum is going too far. Is that talking about bank regulations, but it's actually more broad across. The second way is actually reduce the size of the federal administration that brings, you know, the regulatory inquiries and things like that. So we're seeing you know, some relief. We look forward to seeing more relief as as the nominees get in position and and the policy outlines can be then drilled throughout the teams. But you know, it's it's critically important that we get this rebalance. We wanna run a company that is gonna be well well well capitalized, great liquidity, fair to consumers, etcetera, Mike. But sometimes the regulation gets in the way of that and way overshot you know, the issues. And we look forward to having it come back in the middle and, you know, just take the the debate about treasury trading. The SLR requires us to yep, hold capital at a level against riskless assets and treasuries and cap yep. Cash that doesn't make a lot of sense. And and we've been saying that for a long time, and we expect now heard it said, that there'll be relief in that. Will help us provide liquidity to our clients. In good times and times of stress, but you know, that that you remember our cash and our you know, government guaranteed securities and government issued securities is $1.2 trillion of our balance sheet right now, Mike. You know? So you have to think about that in terms of it and and capitalizing that under the SLR. You know, 5% or whatever it is, and that's a big number. You know. And and none of that has any risk attached to it. You just wanna know. And so that's one thing.

You know, and and and and that's proved out. So think of that as our long-term debt posture being up higher, etcetera.

If I remember who asked it. You know, at the end of the day, you most of what drives that change is the markets business. There are other factors, obviously, Erica, but the big factors in market's business. And if they're out there getting market share and getting the return on that, we'll keep we'll keep growing through that. That's in fact why we have gone up. Yeah. The chunk we've gone up. Now go back to sort of Mike's point and frankly, I think, embedding your question. Think about the facts that the G SIP calculations at the time they were set think it was off at twelve data or something like that, 2012 data, The idea, and it's right, in the rules, was that they should be indexed so that our relative position, Bank of America, relative position, to industry and the economy you've bought a we ought to be able to grow. We've had a nominal economy growth of 30% in the last since the pandemic to now just sheer size growth of which there is no adjustment in the G SIP calculations for that. It was in the statute. It hasn't been implemented. You've heard in some of the even discussion by the the Fed that they would index a lot of the one of the proposals was from sort of now forward, which then skips all the growth, our belief is it should be indexed you know, more fairly as designed in the statute because our relative size hasn't grown even though our balance sheet grown. To the the economy or to the industry. So why are we more GSIP sized than we were before? So I think yep, that's the two sides of trade. Yes. We'd let if the market business can get the returns and grow and do it in a way that sticks to the ribs, Jim and the team will grow, and that will probably push our g SIP. But back up and think about the reality of it. You know, you're now looking at Bank of America and our peers circa 2014 fifteen off of 2012 date, if I remember the exact date. And think about the sheer size of the US economy, probably you know, fifty, sixty percent bigger, and we have not indexed anything for this. And, therefore, we're shrinking our banking size relative to the economy for the same yep. Without kind of the logic behind it, and that's what we've been pushing about.

Obviously, you know, there's some increase in 1Q from seasonal soft end markets. But maybe it won't be as much going forward, and the loan growth might pick up a little bit.

Yeah. Yeah. So that's on $1.7 trillion, so less than a percent. Growth in RWA. And, you know, the earnings growth through. So we will always always, always deploy capital into the businesses at whatever they need to grow the businesses with the right returns. That that's a given. In fact, the efficiency of our RWA deployment is something we work at all the time, and that's why you can see know, the growth in size relative to RWA, and we think we have room to go on this. Is always less than the overall growth in the in the loans and deposits. And so yeah, we'll continue to work that efficiencies, but you've got exactly right. The capital goes to deploy to support the business. Going at a much the the business's demands for that are much lower rates than the capital accumulation and then we turn around and say, what do we do with it? Well, you have a common dividend, obviously, and then the rest goes to to buybacks. And you saw us step that up this quarter, as Alastair said earlier, to $4.5 billion.

The other income line this quarter as in every quarter, it's generally most impacted by what's going on with our tax credit activity and often it depends on the timing of the completion of really long-dated projects. Could be solar, could be wind farms, could be housing. In any given quarter, there can be some timing there where we catch up in the later quarters.

That's that we would continue to invest where we see the opportunities and where we see opportunity outside the United States is with the teams that we have that have been in these countries Japan for since the day after World War two ended, India for sixty-five plus years. Australia for sixty plus years, European countries for many years. You know, we're deeply embedded in those countries, and the idea was we basically are coming from pure multinational largest companies in those you know, national champions and taking around the world and taking companies from outside that particular country into those countries. Yep. We will then we're now moving down a notch in size. You know, strong, you know, family-owned businesses in the production supply chains business, we understand. And I I don't think that'll change dramatically. The product the goods and products start to be produced, and so we'll continue to work with we're watching our clients and helping them try to figure you know, what this all means to them in terms of supply chain alignment and things like that. So I I think it's yep. It may ebb and flow. But remember, when you then take the other side of where the investment is in United States, you know, that's where it's just a larger factor in terms of the overall commercial business, meaning small business. We're the largest small business lender in the United States. By quite a bit. And those loans are growing. Signing them as small business, meaning FDIC loans under a million, which we both have in our consumer business and our business banking area. And then middle market largest you know, one of the largest lenders in the United States and then large corporate. So we you know, because of a diversity of our company, we'll see yep, what might not be as possible in a place due to dynamics you're describing maybe more possible in in in a in a place like you know, Georgia.

And so they see the policies along multi-agency regulations, the tariff policy, immigration policies, etcetera, and they look at all of it and say, in tax policy, And so they they're trying to figure out how it affects their business. In the end of the day, today, they're producing the goods and the goods are going out the stream and being sold, but they're trying to figure out how how that relates to it. And there's you know, the concerns, I think, that were interesting is for a while, it was inflation, obviously, coming through last year when that was discussion. Then it, interestingly, flipped to labor again, which was a little bit unique in that they're trying to make sure they get the call qualified employees that need to operate. But if you look about it, they're basically sanguine on the current environment. But they're worried they're worried about how this will affect their businesses. And where they should invest. And I think that's slowing down you know, some of their decision paths right now because they're trying to figure out if my goods and services will be I'd be able to pass to the price. You know, do I need to, you know, change my business plans in terms of growth? Should I buy that piece of equipment? That's why line usage has been relatively muted still and we continue to to try to grow it. Now there's areas which in in our small business growth, which are yep, sort of recession resistant, which is like in health care. We do we have a big business lending to docs in and veterinarians and other people involved in practice. Those things tend to have less impact by the issues at the moment because of services, business, and things like that. So I think it depends on the business, depends on location, depends on whether in services or whether in goods. But right now, if they look at the last quarter, just like we're gonna look at, looks pretty strong, then they're gonna sit there and say, read the papers and see all the things coming out and saying, should I slow down my decisioning? That, I think, is the worry is because once they talk themselves in slowing down, it'll be a while till they get restarted.

Around residential mortgages, let's say we're originating $5 billion a quarter. Typically, we're picking up couple hundred basis points, sometimes more on those. Just depends on prevailing market rates. So think about that being $5 billion at couple hundred basis points or more. And then the cash flow swaps, we'll talk more about those as we go into the second half. But you can think about that as being something where we're probably picking up 150 basis points or so. It just depends depends on any given quarter. So we'll give you a little more guidance as we get closer.",175.0,83.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.08433734939759036,0.0,0.04819277108433735,0.0

Felt like when it comes to the commercial and the wealth clients in particular, where they have interest-bearing balances, we just pass through the cuts. And then as it relates to the consumer book, we've got an awful lot of non-interest bearing there, obviously. So really, you're focused there on the piece that's in the CDs and then the preferred deposits. And there again, we tend to pass that through as it comes through. So so it's trickier, obviously, in consumer where we're paying 61 basis points on $950 billion. But even there, just because we we still have some CDs outstanding and we still have some preferred.

And if we move up to slide twenty-one, you can see the consumer loan portfolio has obviously been derisked as you pointed out. I'd like to ask a question about is the commercial loan portfolio particularly the growth. Can you guys share with us some of the confidence you have that we're not going to see some issues here you know, particularly you look at the dark blue non-US commercial has grown very, very strongly over this time period.

I'd say we felt like over time as we've become a more global and international company than maybe we were in 2007, it was important for us to diversify the loan book outside of just the US. And it was appropriate because we've got to support clients who are multinationals in the United States operating around the world. And multinationals around the world who also operate and sell into the United States and other places. So that's natural, I think. We kinda supported that over time. That's been a big part of our growth over a fifteen-year period. Now in terms of commercial, if you look at the loan growth overall, I'd say you know, we're we're we're we're pretty diversified in the way we look at that. So all lines of business grew last quarter. So that's small business banking, it's business banking, it's the commercial bank, XCree. It's the Global Corporate Investment Bank. It's Global Markets. And its wealth. Terms of their commercial exposure. So a little bit of it is diversification in all lines of business. And then if you looked at the the book itself, for the most part, as we talked about it secured, It's investment grade. We always think about good client selection as the sort of people who can make it through any and environment. That's where we're investing and partnering. And we've had virtually no charge-offs. So then when you turn to, like, the the global markets business, that again, very diversified, all assets, all client types across things like asset banks and mortgage warehouse and credit financing and subscriptions. So we feel like this book is in very good shape. We feel like they're the right clients. And then, you know, for our teams, it's just about driving the relationship deepening to make sure that we're seeing benefit, not loan portfolio, but in the other things we do across the platform.",349.0,157.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,0.012738853503184714,0.0,0.012738853503184714,0.0,0.0,0.012738853503184714

And then as a follow-up, Alastair, you guys mentioned that the credit card charge off ratio, you know, was a seasonally higher number at just over 4%. And when we go back to the first quarter of twenty-four and twenty-three, obviously, the charge off levels were lower. Can you and especially with the unemployment rate remaining as low as it has over the last couple of years, is the higher level due to some of that FICO score inflation we've heard about during the pandemic? What are you guys, like, account for the number being where it is today versus the last couple of first quarters of, you know, each of those prior years?

That that with all the stimulus and all the that, you know, after the pandemic, you the wage growth for inflation, the stimulus that came in just sheer cash, you saw these things drop to levels that we knew wouldn't wouldn't hold. Right? Meaning charge off rates in the card went way down. And all you've seen now is it sort of normalized around where it wasn't and a very good credit period for our company. Yep. And then, you know, 2019 pre-pandemic type of era. So, yep, that's just normalization. I I wouldn't over read that. It's comparative period. So if you look you know, relative to 2019, 2018, you'd seeBrian Moynihan: that those charge off rates run-in three and a half ish, you know, plus or minus percent or similar to we have now. So we feel good about it. The, you know, important thing is you know, if you look at stressing that portfolio like we do you know, you could see that the you know, the losses are projected whether it's in the CCAR process or own internal stress test. You know, if you take it take it across nine quarters, it it doesn't come it's closer to, honestly, the charge off freight we actually underwrote to prior to the financial crisis. We underwrote to, like, a five and a half percent charge our freight in normal times, and then it would go up from there. And so it's a much more core book driven at a very strong performance through crisis. So I I think I I just I think it's just normalizing more to where you know, where where it was in the in the relatively good credit times in 2019. Rather than any significant movement. In fact, we said that as we came through last year over and over again, people kept doubting it. What you've seen is delinquency actually have fallen and it's flattened out.

First, a couple of words on environment. We continue to see a solid consumer spending data, which you can see on our Page 21 on the deck. Improving credit quality that Alastair talked about from already strong statistics, plenty of household net worth growth and the market growth and also the cap balances, again, staying strong above where they were pre-pandemic.  . We see solid commercial loan growth and we see good credit quality with the exception of CRE and office, which we'll talk about. We also see our clients continue to see clarity with the changes in trade and tariffs and now with the Tax Bill passing, we can see them start to understand the future and expect them behave accordingly. We saw improving market conditions during the quarter, and that leads our worldwide leading research team to continue to predict no recession, a modestly growing economy about 1.5% at the end of the year and continued no Fed rate cuts till next year. So with that backdrop, we talk about our second quarter. Key points on the second quarter as follows. We produced another solid quarter of revenue growth, earnings and returns. These earnings are -- second point is these earnings are driven by strong organic growth across all the businesses. The third is we continue to drive technology innovation, both on the product side that we offer our customers but also on the operational excellence side. We're continuing to see the benefits of our long-term investment in technology capabilities, digitization, machine learning. And now we're starting to see at the beginning at the AI practices that we develop pay off, and we're looking forward to much more. On Slide 2, we start the earnings discussion. This morning, we reported revenue of $26.6 billion on an FTE basis, net income of $7.1 billion after tax, and earnings per share of $0.89 for the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue 4% and grew earnings per share 7%. We produced a return on assets of 83 basis points and return on tangible common equity of 13.4% in the second quarter. We produced $14.8 billion NII, a record for the company, growing 7% from the second quarter in 2024. This represents the fourth quarter of NII growth in line with the guidance we've been giving you. Supporting that average deposits have now grown for 8 consecutive quarters, and we have achieved this while maintaining very disciplined deposit pricing. That's great work by our teams. Market-related revenue gained momentum throughout the quarter. We recorded our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and trading growth, given the [ bar ] and the team continue to do a good job there. Revenue was up 15% over the prior year quarter. We also produced more than $1.4 billion in firm-wide investment banking fees and the better quarterly results improved as each month of the quarter progressed. We reported expense below $17.2 billion this quarter, $600 million lower than the first quarter of 2025, in line with the expectations we gave you. We report our sixth consecutive quarter of net charge-offs at around the $1.5 billion level. This is a little bit of a tale of 2 cities. Consumer net charge-offs were lower. Offsetting that, we had elevated commercial real estate office charge-offs. We resolved a number of credits in this quarter in the second quarter. When those credits closed in the third quarter, you'll see the reduction in NPLs related there, too. The good news is that most of those second quarter charge-offs were previously reserved so it had a modest impact on the profitability for the quarter. We provided capital in support of our customers and clients to help them grow. For example, we delivered strong commercial loan growth, as you can see. We also provided more balance sheet to our institutional clients for their financing needs. At the same time, we also increased the capital return to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased $5.3 billion in shares and paid $2 billion in dividends. In the first half of 2025, we have returned $13.7 billion in total capital, 40% higher than the first half of '24. Tangible book value per share continued to grow this quarter. Let's move our discussion to organic growth. You can see that on Slide 3. We added new clients and deepened relationships with our existing clients. That was across all our businesses, Consumer Wealth, Commercial and our Markets business. Our teams are winning in the marketplace by putting the client first. For example, in Consumer Banking, we continue to grow primary checking accounts. We grew average consumer deposits for a third consecutive quarter. Balances were up year-over-year for the first time since 2022, putting the effects of the pandemic surges behind us. This quarter, we grew across the milestone of 5 million net new checking accounts over the last 6 years. We saw increases in the average consumer checking account balance of our clients for 2 consecutive quarters, and now the average balance per account is over $9,200, and 92% of the primary checking account in the household. On the investment side, our clients carry an average funded balance of more than $130,000, strong when compared to the industry. Our home and auto originations grew on a year-over-year basis this quarter. We continue to be a leading supplier of credit to small businesses, helping the core segment economy grow. Loans were once again up year-over-year, and reflecting the commitment to add more bankers in the markets that we serve across the United States. In Wealth and Investment Management, client balances reached $4.4 trillion. We saw strong AUM flows and loan demand as well as market appreciation. Our advisers continue to deliver comprehensive banking solutions to help our clients achieve their goals. In our Global Banking business, client activity remains solid. Commercial clients are actively using their credit facilities, albeit at still a lower level than they used them as a percentage prior to pandemic. And our risk management approach remains very disciplined. We added more than 1,000 net new clients, most of them driven by our payments capabilities. Global markets continued to perform well with a record second quarter level of sales and trading revenue. Institutional clients [indiscernible] funding of their warehouse of loans and other needs at an increased pace for high-quality collateral. Organic growth means that we're also investing in our own capabilities, our people and our technology, to serve our clients more effectively. Those investments have led to continued expansion in digitalization and engagement across all our lines of business. Nearly 80% of our consumer households are now fully digitally engaged, and they benefit from our award-winning platforms. Just to give you a sense of the volumes. In the second quarter alone, 4 billion logins were made by our consumer. In the second quarter, 65% of our consumer product sales were digital. You can see all these trends in our disclosures on Slides 24, 26 and 28 in the appendix. I commend you to review them to see how the technology application can be scaled and applied across the businesses. We also continue to invest in our teammates and are moving more money into the AI side and machine learning side. And as we think about the quarters ahead and the operating leverage you're turning in the company due to the NII growth, it's key to note we have fully absorbed the cost of the last several years of inflation and wages of -- inflation and wages and other third-party provided services. 15 years ago, to make an understanding of how much an impact technology had 15 years ago, the company had a head count of 300,000. Today, we have 212,000. We did that with a relentless application of scalable, secure, resilient technologies. Customer behavior also changed the matched digitization, simplification of products, machine learning and models and process improvements to help us get there. Now we have a chance to capture the value that with the new enhanced capabilities of AI and machine learning. Artificial intelligence allows us to change the work across many more areas of our company effectively than prior tools allowed us. We have deep scaling experience in AI capabilities with Erica, our AI assistant, is the most recognized aspect of that. As you can see on Slide 4, we think about the way we apply artificial intelligence and augmented intelligence in 4 different pillars. AI agents search and summarization, content generation, importantly coding and automated processes. First off, as an example, is our virtual system, Erica. This is a model we introduced back in 2018 and developed prior to that. It was the first true banking industry virtual agent. It averages over 58 million interactions per month today, helping to make it easier for clients to bank, how they want and where they want. We also leveraged Erica capabilities for use of our commercial clients in CashPro as well as with our employees in Erica For employees. To give you a sense, 90% of our more than 210,000 teammates have now utilized Erica for Employees to complete such tests as password updates, equipment refreshes, et cetera. In wealth management and our other relationship management banking businesses, AI is helping those relationship managers and advisers search and summarize information, preparing them to deliver personalized planning and personalize pitches to clients for their business and help with their advice. Copilot help them organize the prospecting process, and all this is implemented and going through the system. In our operations group, AI tools to help improve our process around customer satisfaction. One chat-based AI product works between markets and operations allows us to have [ 750 ] people engage with AI agents to allow them reconciled trades, which has saved many FTE already. In addition, as you can see, we have 17,000 programmers using AI coding technology today, saving 10% to 15% in cogeneration costs, and we expect that to continue to rise. Overall, we have 1,400 AI patents and have created over 250 AI and machine learning models in the company. We're currently working through many dozens or AI proof of concepts beyond what I just spoke about. These investments are intended to help both improve the client experience and our own productivity. So if you think about the quarter before I turn it over to Alastair, just a few points. We saw good organic client activity. We enjoyed good growth in revenue and earnings per share. We continue to invest in that growth, and are beginning to see the impacts of AI, again, aiding our efficiency. We manage risk well, that drove healthy returns, and we kept delivering more capital back to you as our shareholders.",1773.0,948.0,35.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.03691983122362869,0.0010548523206751054,0.004219409282700422,0.0,0.0010548523206751054,0.035864978902953586

It's a tremendous business, and we'll only get more and more profitable as NII kicks in because they're the biggest beneficiary of that. So if you think about it in terms of deposit growth, we look pre-pandemic now, our team has gone from $700 billion odd numbers to $950 billion. We've grown our deposits as a company faster than the industry grew from the pre-pandemic to now at 39% versus the industry like 37% and large banks 32%. And obviously, we contributed to that large bank growth rate. So we feel very good about it. The key is they've grown checking accounts for 5 years now. They've grown retail deposits, which were influenced a lot because of our mass market customer base being such a big amount by the pandemic stimulus that has all gone through the system, and you're seeing the retail, the consumer deposits growth 3 quarters in a row now. And the key is that the average checking account balance is at 9,200, that went into pandemic, about 6,000 or 7,000. So you're seeing that growth. So we feel good about that. Overall, our average deposit size per branch is $500 million versus the next best at $400 million, and the one behind that at $300 million. So I don't know all these methodologies.

So that's kind of revenue-related growth, which we all cheer for growth there because that means the bottom line has grown. If you flip that around, then the rest of the stuff grew at a really relatively modest growth rate. So on the -- if you think about it going forward, out of the orders on AML that were public and stuff, we obviously put a 1,000 to 2,000 people to work to clean up a lot of stuff. That's now tipping over. So we feel good about that as we move into the second half of the year. And then frankly, the overall inflation rate and expenses are starting to flatten out, even though you hear a lot of talk about the inflation rate outside in general. But at the end of the day, we've got stability in terms of headcount, in terms of third-party rents and all that stuff is sort of flattening out. So we feel good about that. And then the idea is then just to bring the head count down. So if you think about it over the last 15 years or so, we have from 300,000 people to 212,000 people. We just got to keep working that down. We'd been able to maintain flat head count across the last 4, 5 years as we've invested heavily in the front end of the business. And you expect us now with these -- some of these new techniques, frankly, make progress a little bit more faster. So we feel good about the expense trajectory, but the key is you're not going to change some of the related stuff and you wouldn't want to.

So it does seem like the costs are coming a little bit higher, but I appreciate the kind of higher fees.

If we have a model we can run the place on a couple of hundred basis points net of expense growth, which is inflationary cost of 3%, 4%, and then offsetting it by a lot of activity. As the NII kicks in, each quarter, we see it growing and then growing at a little faster rate, frankly, as Alastair talked about, that's the operating leverage kicking back in. So we had 5 years operating leverage disrupted by the pandemic up back in, and then the rates fall off, hurt us, obviously, from NII, as that now hit a record level this quarter and is going to grow off of that record level, you'll see the operating leverage overall kick back in.

But if you look at '19 and now, 200 basis points of the efficiency ratio is just because we have another income loss, which hurts revenue, it's made up in the tax line. So the bottom line effect is still positive for the company. So that's 200 basis points difference because back then, we ran about $300 million a quarter of tax benefit -- negative other income due to the tax exempt deals. Now we're running at $900.  million.  And so you'll see that close out, frankly, as these deals sunset. Then on top of that, the NII kicking in just because of the nature of it, and you'll see the consumer business get very, very efficient like it was back then, just because its NII piece basically all follows the bottom line. So we feel very good about that. So yes, we will move back down in low 60s, and then potentially crack through it with, obviously, just the NII lift in the operating leverage lift.

So focusing on stable coins as a transactional device, if it's a new payment rail and we have trillions of dollars we move for our clients every day, we believe that if they want to use stable coins to move part of that money, they'll move. So consider them having an account and they can send up money in U.S.  dollars.  They can also initiate transaction, have it go into euros, and it could have to go into stable coins and then transact on that system. So we feel both the industry and ourselves will have  responses. We've done a lot of work. We're still trying to figure out how big or small it is because of some of the places, there are not big amounts of money movement. So you'd expect us all to move, you expect our company to move on that. At the end of the day, the debate will be how big an item this will be and how much more an effective payment stream it is. And there's places like small balance transfers across border that you can see the case. You can see it with -- you have sort of smart contracts and money movement. You can see it in digital native apps, in-app payments and stuff. But we'll be there just like we were there when we move from checks to Zelle. And you can see that when the industry puts its mind to it, if you were talking to me 6 or 7, maybe 10 years, you'd say this thing called Venmo is coming on and you guys can be left behind, and here we are.

They've been cut pretty significantly. That's a headwind that we don't include here. So you're absolutely right. There are some things that we've been really happy with in terms of loan growth. There are some other places which have maybe grown a little less quickly. So I'd love -- I'd still love to see the consumer noninterest-bearing growing just a little faster.

But let's just step back and think about the application technology, 15 years ago, we had 100,000 people in our Consumer Business. Today, we have 53,000. The deposits, I think, at the time, we say [ 400 billion ], now they're [ 900 ] plus. The numbers of checking accounts are up 50%, transaction volume through the roof et cetera, et cetera. And so all that is enabled by application technology on scale, with control and resiliency. And so when you're now doing 2 billion digital interactions, you have to be up all the time, and we have invested probably $2 billion in what we call never down [ hot-hot ] back up so that those systems can run all time. So you don't have to -- we have to debate the future. We don't -- you just look at what we've done. We're down half the people in this business and it's bigger and more complex and more widespread, et cetera.  So that's one. As we look forward, you take something like Erica, and it was developed when none of us knew what a large language or small language model was. It is built -- it's operating in what I described earlier is it now those 20 million consumers use it every quarter actively. They use it 60 million times a month. This is not -- again, and every one of those would have been a phone call and stuff. So as we bring it out to a wider use case, wider things it can do and train it on, as we bring it across various parts of the company, commercial business with CashPro, Erica for Employees, et cetera, you're seeing these models that are -- the data is carefully crafted.  So it works.  They get the right decision, they can train them, and we're using it in more places. So we just see that going and going and going. Now meanwhile, in that consumer number, we have twice as many relationship bankers as we did at the start. So we reinvest part of that savings to drive that checking growth on a consistent basis for 5 years. And if you start to think about 5 million net checking accounts with $9,000 of our balances and start to do some math, you start to think that we've grown a good sized bank incrementally over the last 4 or 5 years. So it enables you to do that. Well, the cost structure went down $1 billion a quarter in consumer over the time frame. So that's what happens. They take something like this [ Optimus ] model, which is model that we've built with others, third-party models that we've fine-tuned and the ability for fixed income traders, which is relatively bespoke still. We have one common equity. We have 300 [ CUSIPs ] for fixed income to give you an example just as our company to allow them to reconcile trades all using bots and agents between operation itself instead of e-mails and shared drives and everything going up, it's pretty powerful. And we're just starting that 750 people. This is 90 days old for implementation, and we'll see the benefits of that 5 people so far, 10 people, you'll start to see more people. And we'll just stop adding -- stop replacing head count attrition in these areas or reapply that head count somewhere else. So we think there's a lot to go here. And now I think -- we got to be careful. It's got to be done right. The decisions we make are meaningful to people's lives, so it can't be made in a way that's not correct, meaning it comes up with the wrong decision. The customers [indiscernible], I mean their confidence will come and go if you don't handle them right. So we have to be very careful. And that's why it's not a fast follower or a leader, it's can you apply it at scale. That's the question. And if you could apply it at scale, then you can get the benefit. If you can't apply it at scale, meaning it isn't always up and operating, then you have problems, and that's what we're driving at. So you'll figure out in 5 years whether we are the leader or not the leader. We got the patents we showed you, we got the model. And the question is, are you actually getting the benefits and the scale we have and we will, and we expect to continue, and yet we're still in the early stages.",771.0,320.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.009375,0.015625,0.009375,0.0,0.0,-0.00625

But it seems like the way you're thinking about stable coins is your -- it's a little wait and see, right? JPM has a tokenized deposit. Citi has a tokenized deposit. I haven't seen any announcement from you, guys. You don't have a large cross-border business right now relative to others. So you could be the disruptor in this new ecosystem, same way you were with mobile, same way you were with digital agent. Are you just skeptical at what this could mean long term? Like why not lean in with this breakthrough technology the same way you have with these others?",159.0,65.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.03076923076923077,0.015384615384615385,0.046153846153846156,0.0,0.0,0.015384615384615385

We've used it in the trade area and stuff, and a lot of information has got to move and money and things like that.

How do you feel about when is the appropriate time to address that 130 basis point buffer? So granted the stress test has been quite volatile in the SCB results. But clearly, there's perform to address that.

We always want that to be utilized, for lack of a better word, by the core businesses because that's what we're here for. So we pay our dividends. We're basically using all the incremental capital to refer to shares and then letting the business use up the excess capital to grow. And at the high point, I think we were 12%. Now we're down to 11.5%. So they're using it up. What we just did is increase the amount of which we have. So we expect them to use that and expect us to move down to 50 basis points. Now remember we got this debate between averaging and not averaging. We'll see it happen. The SLR is really not relevant for us because frankly, other ratios would catch us before the SLR. The G-SIB calibration is critically important because people forgetting that, that has to happen because we're effectively using 2010, '11 or '12 data on the size of the economy and our company and other companies relative to size to judge how systemically important -- it was meant to be indexed. It hasn't been -- the proposals was indexed a year ago or so from then on, that wasn't really right because it skips all the run-up in size of the pandemic. So you have to see more of this come together. Expect us to work that capital down one way or the other way. But we're always trying to grow the company. And that's what that extra capital there is to grow the company loans, deposits -- loans, more interactions, more transactions, the balance sheet market has grown, and they've done a good job returning on it. So that's what we keep doing. So back up 50 basis points is the target buffers. We just got a change in the last few weeks. The change is still being debated about the implementation timing. We got to get the G-SIB thing figured out because if they don't index it, we'll have an increase coming at us in another year or so. And all this, we're working on. But at the end of the day is we just returned all the capital we earned back to the shareholders, and we'll continue to do that and more if the business can't use it to grow.",423.0,168.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.011904761904761904,0.011904761904761904,0.005952380952380952,0.0,0.0,0.0

And just my follow-up question here, Brian, is are there businesses that you're prioritizing in terms of redeploying that capital to that perhaps where the profitability looks better under this regime?

So obviously, think of our appetite. Every business has an opportunity for growth. Some will have more RWA intensity. Some will have less. If you notice, see RWAs in the industry have grown and ours have grown pretty rapidly. We need to -- all need to fine-tune that. That's part due to the models and stuff that are being pushed around behind the scenes. So hopefully, we get more rational discussion about. But every business has the opportunity to grow. And so the most discrete decision we made was to put -- with Jim DeMare and team is to give them more capital and capacity to grow, and they've used that wisely. But if you look across our businesses, that's the lowest return on allocated capital. So we have to be careful to get the returns. We have to make sure that the wealth management business and the consumer business, which have very high returns on capital, are also growing. So everybody can grow. If they need the capital, they'll take it down.

We got the dynamics there, their impact on net interest income. So Jim and the team have got to get the returns and return on assets has to be -- move towards 100 basis points and beyond. So there's no theoretical ceiling. It's just the dynamics of how far they can go before they do it. We went from a $600 billion or $700 billion balance sheet to base good trillion, and that will ebb and flow based on clients' activity. The G-SIB buffer calculation. We're not worried about that. We've gone from basically [ 2 50 to 3, ] and it will move up -- we wouldn't worry about that because as they're deploying, they're actually getting enough return, and it's absorbing the impact to the rest of the company. That's the other thing you always have to be careful of, is if markets can cause the G-SIB trigger and everybody pays for it. And so we make sure that they can actually get the return. It justifies not only what goes into their business, but what the whole company experiences. And that's why the calibration is critical. We got to get -- these things all work together and the calibration of G-SIB is critical. And the reality is, is that you've had a basically a 20% growth in the capital requirement. So no major change in risk for most of us across the last 3 or 4 years, just by methodologies of G-SIB creep and RWA calculations behind the scenes where they're pushing us on the models and stuff like that.",288.0,116.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.008620689655172414,0.008620689655172414,0.008620689655172414,0.0,0.008620689655172414,0.0

Now they have to get them into production and they have to get it all -- they have to get construction started by a couple of different dates. But you can think about it as between now and 2027, that's when you're going to see all of these things begin to slow and then stop. We happen to have, number one, an installed base of production tax credits. So that will stay with us. But those will begin to burn down over the course of the next 8 years. That's the way I would think about that. And then the low income housing tax credits aren't impacted. So we anticipate we'll continue to be involved with those. So I would say, we're likely to be involved in deals for the next couple of years. And then you'll start to see the portfolio come down in the course of 2028, all the way through 2033.

Before I turn it over to, I'm going to hit a few highlights here. We reported revenue of $28 billion, up 11% year over year. EPS was $1.06, up 31% year over year. We drove operating leverage of 560 basis points in the quarter. The efficiency ratio fell below 62%. The return on assets reached 98 basis points. And during the quarter, we returned to our shareholders $7.4 billion through dividends and share repurchases, net interest income on an FTE basis reached a record $15.4 billion. That was supported by strong commercial loan and deposit growth, along with continued balance sheet positioning. Investment banking fees exceeded $2 billion, up 43% year over year. Our team in sales and trading grew revenue 8%, marking our 14th consecutive quarter of year over year revenue growth. Our asset management fees increased 12% compared to last year. All the business segments contributed to earnings improvement and had growth earnings two stood out this quarter. Our consumer banking team delivered $3.4 billion in after-tax earnings, up 28% year over year, with 600 basis points of operating leverage. This reflects strong revenue growth and disciplined expense management. This business is driven off the core operating accounts of our consumer customers, and we gained more of them this quarter. These accounts have strong balances per account. The customers give us great customer scores and we operate them at lower costs with more primacy in the account and lower attrition compared to anyone in the industry. That is a winning combination. Our global wealth and management teams posted net income of nearly $1.3 billion, up 19%. That was driven by the strong Merrill and private bank advisor productivity. And in concomitant continued growth in fee-based assets, lending in this business was particularly strong, with $12 billion in loan growth in this quarter. GWIM also opened another 32,000 banking accounts and grew deposits $3 billion from quarter two. As we look ahead, we believe this quarter's performance continues to reflect the impact of the investments we have made on a continuous basis for many years in technology, talent and client experience. These continue to translate into strong financial results. We have been growing loans with the right risk and deposits as we continue to gain market share through organic growth. That translated into continuous NII improvements and complementary growth in our fee-based businesses. This quarter, I also, as usual, commend you to look at the digital slides in the appendix on slides 20, 22 and 24. They show the continued progression across all the businesses of applied technology, with lots of discussions going on about technology and AI and other things. We give you the stats, what you'll see in these slides is a customer-facing activities of Erika. For example, there are many other applications of AI going on in this company, but this one has been handling successful interactions for years with scale and that application has now been applied across other businesses and even across our employee base. So we're confident in our trajectory of our results, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. We look forward to look forward to talking to you at Investor Day in November. I'll turn it over to Alastair to walk through the financials in more detail.",651.0,356.0,23.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.06460674157303371,0.0028089887640449437,0.008426966292134831,0.0,0.0,0.06179775280898876

And I just have three things on the income statement that I want to add to Brian's comments. First, we're pleased with the continued demonstration of expense discipline across our businesses. So in the third quarter, we delivered 11% year over year revenue growth, significantly outpacing 5% expense growth and resulting in that strong 6% operating leverage. Of the $28.2 billion in total revenue and aggregated amount of $11.3 billion came from our sales and trading, investment banking and asset management fees. Three of our more highly compensable market-facing areas. So those areas grew 15% year over year. In the aggregate, and we're excited to continue our investments given their strategic importance and attractive returns when coupled with investment spending and inflation. This revenue growth helps frame the 5% expense growth. Even better. Importantly, expense growth versus the second quarter was held to under 1%, while those same compensable revenue streams grew 8% sequentially. Further reinforcing our ability to scale efficiently and invest where it matters most. Second, provision expense improved this quarter with net charge-offs declining 10%, and we had a modest reserve release as a result of both credit card and commercial real estate improvement. The strong asset quality reflects the continued strength of our credit portfolio. Years of disciplined risk management and higher growth of the portfolio than other banks with good credit results. Lastly, our average diluted share count declined by 24 million shares from the second quarter, and this quarter included the dilution we've highlighted before in our filings. And that comes from our 2008 issued convertible preferred Series L stock. On slide four, you'll note the various earnings highlights. Brian and I have talked about. I don't have much to add here, and would instead spend just a moment on our continued organic growth, which is powering our loan and deposit activity. We added new clients and we deepened relationships with existing clients and across consumer wealth, commercial and institutional businesses. Our teams are winning in the marketplace by putting our clients first. As always, we highlight the continued organic growth across each of our businesses. Driven by client engagement, disciplined execution and strategic investment. And you can see the results there on slide five. Consumer banking continued to show strong momentum. We grew another 212,000 net new checking accounts, extending our string of consecutive growth to 27 quarters. This includes the fourth consecutive quarter of increased average noninterest bearing deposits, and those are important because they are the primary operating account for a relationship and they're quite beneficial as a low-cost funding source. Additionally, card, home and auto loan balances grew year over year, reflecting healthy consumer demand. And we believe those further cement the relationship beyond just the operating account alone. In small business, we continued our strength, our string of lending growth, and we remain the number one leading provider of credit to small business in the United States. Wealth and investment management saw client balances climb to more than $4.6 trillion, driven by strong AUM flows of $84 billion in the past year. Strong loan originations and market appreciation. Our advisors continued to deliver comprehensive solutions to help clients achieve their financial goals. In global banking, we saw a nice pickup in client activity in investment banking, resulting in market share gains, leadership rankings across many products and the highest non-pandemic fee quarter in our firm's history. Commercial client activity showed a continuation in the demand for loans and cash management needs, as Treasury service fees increased 12% year over year. Alongside deposit growth of 15%. Markets continued to deliver on their string of year over year revenue growth and also continued to grow loans from healthy demand of our clients. Let's transfer to a discussion of the balance sheet using slide six, where you can see total assets ended the quarter at $3.4 trillion. That's down $38 billion from the second quarter. As good loan growth was offset by lower global markets assets and wholesale funding reductions. As part of our plan to continue to tighten the balance sheet. Importantly, this balance sheet tightening will continue to benefit the net interest yield. NII deposits ended just over $2 trillion and were up $72 billion from the year ago period, with growth in both interest bearing and non-interest bearing deposits. Average global liquidity sources of $961 billion remained strong, and shareholders equity of $304 billion was up $4.6 billion from last quarter. As we issued $2.5 billion of preferred stock. Otherwise, a $2 billion increase in tangible common equity to $208 billion included a modest capital build, as net income was slightly more than capital distributions, and we saw some improvement in AOCI, we returned $7.4 billion of capital back to shareholders, with $2.1 billion in common dividends paid and $5.3 billion of shares repurchased. Tangible book value per share of $28.39 rose 8% from the third quarter of 24. Looking at regulatory capital, our CET1 level increased modestly to $203 billion, while the risk-weighted assets were relatively flat. And that drove our CET1 ratio higher to 11.6%. This is well above our October 1st 10% regulatory minimum. Our supplemental leverage ratio was 5.8% versus a minimum requirement of 5%, which leaves capacity for balance sheet growth. And our $473 billion of total loss absorbing capital means our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. On slide seven, we show a ten-quarter trend of average deposits to illustrate the extension of consecutive growth across those periods. Average deposits were up $71 billion, or 3.7%, from the third quarter of 24. Consumer deposits were up 1% year over year, while global banking deposits grew 15% compared to a year ago. Our global capabilities, digital solutions and relationship managers continue to win clients in the marketplace. In addition, we remain disciplined on pricing to achieve that growth. Overall rate paid on total deposits declined 32 basis points year over year, reflecting both lower rates and disciplined actions in our global banking and wealth management businesses. Rate paid on the roughly $950 billion of consumer deposits remained low at 58 basis points in Q3, driven by the operating nature of that account and client base. Compared to the second quarter, total deposit rate paid rose two basis points due to mix shift into interest bearing, and we expect improvement next quarter, driven by repricing after the Fed funds rate cut in late September. Let's turn to loans by looking at average balances on slide eight. You can see loan balances in Q3 of $1.15 trillion, improved 9% year over year, driven by 13% commercial loan growth. Consumer loans grew at a slower pace and importantly, were up across every loan type for the second consecutive quarter. Every business segment recorded higher average loans on both a year over year basis and on a linked quarter basis. Focusing on commercial loans and global markets, we continue to take advantage of the strong financing demand in the marketplace from institutional borrowers, where we lend against diverse collateral pools. Small business is benefiting from our newly combined local market-based coverage model for small business and business banking, and that's creating more capacity for client expansion. And lastly, note the 9% improvement in wealth management as affluent clients borrowed for investments in assets like sports and arts and businesses. So all of that balance sheet activity across deposits and loans results in net interest income. And let's turn our focus to NII on slide number nine. On a GAAP non-fully taxable equivalent basis, NII in Q3 was $15.2 billion on a fully taxable equivalent basis, NII was a little less than $15.4 billion. And as I said earlier, that's up 9% from the third quarter of 24. NII grew $1.3 billion year over year and $572 million on an FTE basis over the second quarter, driven by higher loan and deposit balances and benefits from fixed rate asset repricing and versus Q2, we also gained an extra day of interest. The net interest yield, improved seven basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the growth in NII, while the earning asset balance modestly declined as loan growth replaced lower yielding securities and global markets balances declined modestly. And as I said, we reduced expensive wholesale funding and cash. Regarding interest rate sensitivity on a dynamic deposit basis, we provide a 12-month change in NII for an instantaneous shift in the curve. So again, that means interest rates would have to instantaneously move another 100 basis points lower than the expected cuts that are already contemplated in the curve. So if you think about that 100 basis points below what the curve implies, more simply put, that would mean, for instance, on the short end, the July Fed funds rate next year would be getting down to 2.25%. So on that basis. A 100 basis point decline would decrease NII over the next 12 months by $2.2 billion. And if rates went up 100 basis points. NII would benefit approximately $1 billion. With regard to a forward view of NII, let me give you a few thoughts. In January and again in April, we provided our expectation that we could exit Q4 of 2025 with NII on a fully taxable equivalent basis in a range of $15.5 to $15.7 billion. We also noted our expectation for that growth to accelerate in the second half of 2025. Despite all the uncertainties we've experienced around tariffs and rates, we've seen good performance against our expectations. And even with the third quarter. Late quarter interest rate cut and with the curve anticipating two more cuts in October and December, we believe fourth quarter NII will be in the higher end of that range of expectations. So think of that as being $15.6 billion plus on a fully taxable equivalent basis. And that would represent approximately 8% growth from the fourth quarter of 24. Thinking a bit more generally, we just note for the full year of 2026, our expectations about the drivers of growth are largely aligned with 2025 performance. We expect good core NII, performance driven by core loan and deposit growth. A little bit above GDP, which. Will additionally benefit from sizable fixed rate asset repricing. And in 2026, we expect to see roughly $10 to $15 billion in combined quarterly mortgage-backed securities. And mortgage loans. Those will roll off and they'll be replaced with new assets at 150 to 200 basis points. Higher yield. That should result in full year NII growth, somewhat similar to 2025 performance over 2024. So think of that as something like 5 to 7% growth. Okay, let's turn to expense. And we'll use slide ten for the discussion. First I just want to highlight the strong operating leverage which we expect again in Q4. We reported $17.3 billion in expense this quarter. And that was up modestly compared to the second quarter and up 5% year over year. As I noted earlier, the year over year increase was primarily driven by incentives tied to growth, especially in our market-facing businesses, as well as ongoing investments across the enterprise. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect expenses to remain roughly in line with Q3. As you know, headcount is the key driver of expense from compensation and benefits to occupancy costs and technology. And we manage this closely. Not just in total numbers, but also in organizational structure, ensuring we're striking the right balance of managers and teams. And the good news is we continue to manage headcount well. So looking at the past three years, we've been able to lower our headcount from a peak of 217,000 to 213,000. Now. And more recently, since the third quarter of last year. We're down 500, which includes the addition last quarter of nearly 2000 plus college grads. And it's this disciplined approach that supports both efficiency and growth. So let's now move to credit and turn to slide 11. And you can see asset quality remains sound with improvements in several key indicators. Net charge-offs were $1.4 billion, down about 10% from the second quarter, with the improvement split pretty evenly between credit card and commercial real estate. The total net charge-off ratio this quarter was 47 basis points, down eight basis points from Q2. Q3. Provision expense was $1.3 billion and mostly matched net charge-offs. We had a modest reserve release associated with improved outlooks for both credit card and commercial real estate. Focusing on total net charge-offs again and looking forward in the near term, we would not expect much change in total net charge-offs given the steady consumer delinquency trends, stability of CNI and reductions in CRE exposures. On slide 12. In addition to the improvement in consumer losses. Note the reductions in both reservable criticized and non-performing loan metrics. Commercial portfolios. Non-performing loans are down 19% from Q2 and Reservable. Criticized exposure in commercial real estate is now down nearly 25% from the third quarter of 24. As we dealt with the more problematic exposures across the year. Let's turn to the performance across our lines of business, beginning with consumer banking on slide 13. Summer banking delivered strong results, generating $11.2 billion in revenue, up 7% year over year and $3.4 billion in net income, or 28% growth. Return on allocated capital rose to 31%. These results reflect the value of our deposit franchise, underscoring both the breadth of our platform and the success of our organic growth strategy and digital banking capabilities. Innovation such as family banking are high value cash back credit cards, and our industry-leading preferred rewards program are delivering differentiated value to clients and value we believe is unmatched elsewhere. This client value proposition, combined with disciplined pricing, helped drive a 9% year over year increase in net interest income. Another strong highlight this quarter was expense management, which enabled us to deliver more than 600 basis points of operating leverage, continued innovation and the deployment of advanced technology and tools helped us to hold expense growth to just 1% year over year. While revenue grew significantly as a result. Our efficiency ratio improved, falling below 50% for the quarter. We continue to invest in high tech, which drove higher digital engagement, and we continue to invest in high touch. We continued our march into new markets, filled out more of previously expanded markets and supported our brand in those communities. As an example, we just opened four new financial centers in Idaho over the past six months. Expanding our presence and complementing our existing Merrill team in the local market to better serve clients in that region. Consumer investment balances grew 17% to $580 billion, supported by market appreciation and $19 billion in full year client flows. Third quarter average balance per new account of $110,000 is up 6% from last year, and the investment platform serves as a great catch basin for first-time investors and for more affluent investors looking to manage some element of their own money. As mentioned earlier, consumer net charge-offs improved on a linked quarter basis. Following a decline in delinquencies. The largest component of consumer losses is credit card, and our loss rate decreased from 3.82% to 3.4%. Linked quarter. This contributed to an improved risk-adjusted margin on credit card approaching 7.5%. Finally, as shown on appendix, slide 20. Strong digital adoption and Erica engagement continues and customer experience scores remain elevated, reflecting the impact of our ongoing investments in digital capabilities. Turning to wealth management on slide 14, the business delivered a strong quarter marked by improved profitability. Net income grew 19% year over year to nearly $1.3 billion, driven by new household growth, strong AUM flows, loan growth and disciplined expense management that produced meaningful operating leverage and a 26% return on allocated capital. We achieved 300 basis points of operating leverage, which contributed to a 27% pre-tax margin, an improvement of over 200 basis points to. Merrill and the private bank managed $4.6 trillion in client balances and continued to generate organic growth, with $84 billion in AUM flows over the past year. This reflects a healthy mix of new client assets and existing clients, putting more capital to work. During this past quarter, Merrill and the private bank added 5400 net new relationships, with the average size of new relationships continuing to grow across both businesses. And importantly, we're not just adding relationships. We're deepening the ones we enjoy already. And reflecting the strength of our integrated model and our product offering. The percentage of clients with banking products continue to rise, and it's now at 63%. In the third quarter, GWIM reported record revenue of $6.3 billion, up 10% year over year, led by a 12% increase in asset management fees. Loan growth remained strong and we saw a notable pickup in custom lending with both volume and loan size increasing. And that drove a 9% year over year increase in average loans. Finally, I'd highlight the continued digital momentum as shown on slide 22. New accounts are increasingly being opened digitally, underscoring the effectiveness of our digital investments and the evolving preferences of our clients. On slide 15, you see the results for global banking, which benefited from improved investment banking activity, significant deposit growth and solid loan performance in Q3. Global Banking delivered net income of $2.1 billion, up 12% year over year, supported by 500 basis points of operating leverage and a 17% return on allocated capital. The standout driver of performance was a 43% year over year increase in Firmwide investment banking fees, which fueled 7% overall revenue growth. Firmwide investment banking fees rose across the solution set advisory was up 51%. Debt underwriting increased 42%, and equity underwriting grew 34%. We maintained our number three position year to date, and we also gained market share during the quarter. Notably, we participated in several of the industry's largest transactions, a clear testament to the value clients place on our financial advice and solutions. Non-interest expense grew compared to last year as we continue to invest in the future. And average deposits grew 15% year over year, contributing to a 6% increase in global transaction services revenue. And, importantly, disciplined pricing. Coupled with lower rates led to a 47 basis point decline in rate paid compared to a year ago. Switching to global markets on slide 16, I'll focus my comments on results excluding DVA, as we typically do. As Brian mentioned, we extended our streak of strong revenue and earnings performance, and once again achieved a solid 13% return on allocated capital in the third quarter. Global markets generated net income of $1.6 billion, up modestly year over year, and consistent with the prior quarter revenue. Excluding DVA, grew 10% year over year, driven by strong sales and trading performance and the benefit of higher investment banking revenue shared with global banking. Focusing on sales and trading revenue, ex DVA rose 8% year over year to $5.3 billion. Thick revenue grew 5%, driven by improved performance in credit products. Equities trading led the improvement, with 14% revenue growth supported by increased financing activity in Asia. Expense growth year over year reflects both the revenue increase and higher trading related costs in certain Asian markets, and those costs are passed through to clients and therefore appear in both the revenue line and the expense line. As noted earlier, we continued to benefit from lending opportunities tied to highly collateralized pools of high quality assets and clients value our expertise and the liquidity we provide in delivering these solutions. On slide 17, all other shows a loss of $6 million in the third quarter, with very little to talk about here. Our third quarter effective tax rate was 10.4%. And excluding the tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing. And a small number, a small amount of discrete items, the effective tax rate would have been much closer to a normal corporate tax rate at approximately 23%. So thank you. And with that, we'll jump into the Q&A.",3263.0,1932.0,78.0,24.0,23.0,3.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,16.0,0.040372670807453416,0.012422360248447204,0.011904761904761904,0.0015527950310559005,0.0010351966873706005,0.027950310559006212

Look, we believe applied technology, which is a range of outcomes from the digitization that we show in those pages in 2022 and 24 over a period of time. And the customer adoption of technologies and interfacing with our company and technology. Always provides that. So we had 280,000 people 15 years ago. We have 213,000 people. Three years ago, we had 217,000 people. After the pandemic and all the manual stuff we had to build up, we worked that back down. So we believe strongly that all technologies help drive that. And this technology and artificial intelligence allows you to do things that heretofore haven't done. And so I think the question is just it's to put it in place. You have to have your data appropriately arrayed. You have to make sure the models are going to give the right answer. It has to be in a controlled environment, because in a regulated institution like ourselves, we don't, you know, we don't get you. Know, excuse saying the model said it, sorry. It has to be right. And so if we turn down a mortgage loan under automated underwriting, we're liable for the outcome irrespective of how we did it. So we're seeing it go everywhere and the volumes activity the company have gone up huge since, you know, that period of time where the headcount has come down by a lot. And so, so we continue to apply what I'd look at carefully on those pages is things like on the consumer page, you'll see Eric interactions building up and Erica users building up. And we've gone from 200 and tenths questions that could be answered to 700. But just to put that in context, you know, in the last 24 hours, there were 2 million interfaces where consumer got an answer from Erica and our company and that same technology is applied in the institutional basis. I think you can see that on page 22. If I'm right, or maybe 24, but you can see that, Erica, in the institutional a lot smaller number of customers. But rising very fast. So that's just one model. We have models all over the company. So we believe strongly that this will have an impact. We will continue to manage it. But the implementation these are not proofs of concept and things like that. They're past tense things happening. 2 million customer faces yesterday. So this isn't something to come. We've been at it a while, but I think the idea of it providing constant leverage and constant reinvestment with the same expense base is really what we're after, and then grow the revenue faster, continue to take market share. So it's impact on expenses is felt. We are reinvesting some of that to actually grow faster. And you're seeing the results of that.",490.0,207.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.004830917874396135,0.014492753623188406,0.024154589371980676,0.00966183574879227,0.0,-0.00966183574879227

We've obviously seen a pickup in activity here in the third quarter. We were happy to see that as as we've seen more certainty now around trade and tariffs and around taxes as well. It's allowed our client base to make longer term decisions. And that's reflected in our investment banking activity in terms of the pipelines. They're up this quarter up. Over double digits. So we feel good about the pipeline and the way it's developing. And you know we'll need to see how the transactions execute in Q4. But it feels like a good environment in terms of, for example, M&A at this point. Around the global markets, business. We've obviously invested significantly there, just as we have in investment banking. I should go back to investment banking and the investments we've made there. We've always profiled the investment we've made in middle markets and in international and in earlier stage, faster growing economies. So that's been a big part of our investment banking growth in the course of the past year or so, when we get to sales and trading. We've obviously invested a lot there in terms of technology and people and balance sheet. Normally Q4, you see a seasonal impact from client activity slowing as you move into the fourth quarter. That would be pretty normal. But the constructive environment for the sales and trading business remains as investor clients continue to reposition based on rates and policies as they develop around the world.

And I say that because obviously at $2 trillion of deposits and a trillion 150 of loans, we've got substantial excess that we can provide for clients in the economy over time. So we've got a lot of capacity in terms of demand. I'd say it's been reasonably robust over the course of the past couple of years, and we happen to be in a good place to capitalize on that, because when you talk about the world's leading asset managers, we have great relationships with them in our global markets, business and in investment banking. And then we're in a position where we're not loaned up. So we have the ability to provide the lending capital, and then you've got to structure it the right way. And we obviously have that capability. So those sorts of things put us in a good position to see that demand. Spreads have been attractive. You know, a big part of the global markets story of improving returns over time has been growing. Their loan book with attractive returns, and you've seen them consistently improve return on capital.

Would we like to be back to the 4% plus that we we typically enjoy? Yes, we would. But remember we're coming off of a period where consumer deposits really had to normalize after pandemic.

So now that that obviously requires, number one, it happens tomorrow. Number two, it exists all year. And number three, it happens at the short end and the long end, all at the same time. So I don't know how. How you would assign a probability to that. But it's obviously on the lower end. But we provide it. So you get a general sense for asset sensitivity. On the short end you'd end up seeing probably 80% or so because so much obviously of the company's balance sheet just reprices daily. And then. On the longer end is probably 20% of the sensitivity.

And the Fed shows the entire industry, consumer deposits, household checking account deposits are, you know, significantly higher from pre-pandemic. So that pandemic surge hasn't left the banking system. Do you guys have any color on what you're seeing from that behavior, from pre-pandemic to today? I know you're taking market share and you're growing while yours are growing, but any color on why we still have such elevated levels of deposits?",115.0,57.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

So I think if you remember back in, we're all in 21 and stuff trying to, you know, have the great debate about where all this cash that was put into the economy going to flow right back out, etc., and if you drew a line of the growth rate, you know, leading up. To 19 over a long period of time and then saw a bubble above it, it was working. It's basically worked its way back down relative in the aggregate amount of deposits and relative synchronicity to the to the to the long term growth rate. So the size economy is bigger, the notional economy is bigger. We we can get economists in our company and I'm sure in your company that will have a great debate. Notional real economy sizes and stuff. But it's just the economy is bigger. The amount of cash in circulation is bigger. So therefore you expect it. Now the most important thing, though, is that we've gained share during that time in terms of core transactional. So we're you know, we're 20%, 30% more. In deposit transaction accounts. And our consumer business, that's numbers of customers who are carrying instead of 6 or $7000 on average, $9,000 in average. And at the same time, we're probably we've reduced the numbers of branches because of more digitization, automation, the numbers of teammates in consumer dedicated to service, etc.. So it's a great operating leverage. So even though the economy grew and everything else, the fact of the matter is those deposits that are core in the all in cost of all consumer deposits, 58 basis points against the current rate environment is a big profit improvement in that consumer business. In just in the last year, you saw a 30% increase and it's still gaining the efficiency, not from cost reduction as much, but cost levels against the NII improvement as the knee comes in the company. They are a big beneficiary of of that amount. So it's so I'd say I think you're now seeing deposits grow in the industry. Now for at our company now for many quarters, I think it was the mid of. Almost two years, a year and a half to two years ago where we bottomed out and we've grown since then. And so you ought to grow with the economic growth. And if you take share, you grow a little faster. That's the gig that we're we don't see any dynamic that, you know, even as they continue to. Adjust interest rates and stuff that you see a lot of money flowing back out of the banking system.

That's a core part of responsible growth. It's got to be focused on clients. And the clients that we're talking about here are typically the top asset managers or the top financial institutions in the world. So that's that's who we're interested in working with here. Beyond that, we're looking for collateral pools. We want high quality. We want diversified. We're looking for structures that have security, credit enhancement, performance triggers, mark to market. They typically tend to be shorter duration. And then you know, we don't put all our eggs in one basket. We're diversified across multiple sectors. So that can be mortgage or it can be asset based. It can be business lending or private equity. It can be consumer assets or subscription facilities. And. And when you add all that up. You end up with a diversified book that's typically investment grade. It's lower risk. And the loss you know, the loss content. If you look at our secret, it's less than a basis point. If you look at our CLS, it's less than 0.1%. So by the time you you have those great clients, you have good collateral, you have good structures. Generally speaking, you tend to have little losses. And then the asset test ultimately shows up in returns for the global markets business, because any losses they absorb and over time they've done a good job of deploying capital. While increasing ROA and return on capital. So we feel like that business has worked well. The final thing I'll just say is, I mean, I feel like we have we have differentiated capability here in that. We tend to have very strong relationships with these global markets, clients that we talked about. We have the structuring and the underwriting, and we've got the excess in the form of lots of deposits and less loans where we can actually make loans to those clients to satisfy the demand.

And one of the reasons why we started a long time ago, disclosing global markets separately as a separate operating unit, because it supports the whole company, including the wealth management business, including the consumer business for FX transactions. So we disclosed it separately, but a to do. To show its breadth in the company, but also to show it's less volatile than people assume it is when you're running the way that Jim and the team have run it. So. 14 quarters in a row of year over year revenue growth is is a pretty sustainable record. And there might be some data that's broken. It has been broken for three plus years. So that's good. And the profitability i.e. the returns of the business continue to go up. And that has a lot to do with how they conduct the business and how they, you know, it's a it's a moving business, not a storage business. It's not holding a lot of risk on a given day. On the lending. It's high quality assets underneath them. No surprise. ET cetera. ET cetera. So that's, you know, so we feel that is sustainable. And yes, it does it benefit and especially on the equity side, you know when markets are moving around and people are trading more. Sure. You saw that this quarter. But overall it just keeps grinding its way forward. Now when you look on the investment banking, you know, $2 billion in fees coming in the quarter, you know, everybody expected it to be less than that. It came. But you're seeing the activity spread out geographically. You're seeing a lot of activity in the midsize market in the US, which we are capturing through the combination of our investment banking teammates and our commercial banking teammates to cover all the markets and are out there in our middle market franchise and capturing strong market share from those customers. But I think one of the things you need to think about is, is that business. We we run a global corporate investment banking business as a consolidated business, as a business. And that goes into global banking along with our middle market and our business banking business. Why that's important to think about is with our relationship with these customers. We have their credit relationship, their transaction services relationship, and the fees for that grew 12% year over year. And their investment banking and their, you know, hedging and other types of things on top of that, in the markets. And by doing all that, you actually have a more stable revenue stream attached to that business. So whether investment banking goes up or down by $100 million, if you look at the global banking results. The the volume of revenue is coming from the lending side and the deposit side. So, you know. It's great to see Matthew and the team have a good quarter. But Matthew themselves will tell you it's also great that the loans grew or the deposits grew year over year. The loans are solid.
