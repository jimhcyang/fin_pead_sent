Our caller today, let&#8217;s call her &#8220;Gwen,&#8221; is a young adult fresh out of college and off to a good start with a credit score of 746 (which FICO considers &#8220;very good&#8221;), but looking for a better credit card to maximize her cash back. Gwen is rocking a Chase Freedom Student card at present, a holdover from her college days that Chase Bank actually no longer offers. The Chase Freedom Student has been phased out and replaced by a similar card that&#8217;s now called &#8220;Chase Freedom Rise.&#8221; It&#8217;s not a bad card as cashback cards go. It doesn&#8217;t charge any annual fee for example. But it only pays 1.5% cash back on purchases, which these days is really the absolute minimum you should demand in a cash back card. Long story short, Gwen can do better. Let&#8217;s help her out with that. .keypoints-box { margin-bottom: 20px; } Key Points No one credit card is best for cash back. A good cash back strategy includes a single all-around card paying 2%, supplemented by multiple cards paying more cash back for specific kinds of purchases. The Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express pays 6% cash back for gas grocery and streaming purchases, but it does charge an annual fee. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) Ordinarily, my advice when picking cash back cards is to go for a mixed approach, holding one card that pays a decent cash back rate on all purchases in all categories, with no limit on the cash back you can earn, and no annual fee. Any of several major branded credit cards fit this bill, including The Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) Active Cash card, Citi (NYSE: C) Double Cash, and SoFi&#8216;s (Nasdaq: SOFI) Unlimited 2% credit card. This all-around &#8220;good enough&#8221; card should then be paired with a handful of other cards that pay less than 2% for what Gwen might call &#8220;etc&#8221; purchases, but more than 2% for specific categories of purchases where she spends heavily. Whenever making one of these specific purchases, Gwen would switch out her good-enough card, and use one of these credit cards tailored to the specific purchase she&#8217;s making, be it gas, or groceries, or restaurants for example. Good options for this part of the package might include Bank of America&#8216;s (NYSE: BAC) Customized Cash card, which lets a cardholder pick one category of purchase to receive 3% cash back on; or Citi&#8217;s Custom Cash card, which let&#8217;s you pick a category to receive 5% cash back (albeit, only up to $500 in purchases per month). Is the Blue Cash Preferred Card a good cash back card? Gwen seems to be thinking along these same lines as well, asking specifically if she should ditch her Chase Freedom Student card in favor of the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express (NYSE: AXP). So should she? My first instinct is to say &#8220;no&#8221; without thinking, because unlike all of the cards I&#8217;ve named above, the AmEx card charges a $95 annual fee (after the first year). But on further reflection, the Blue Cash Preferred Card idea may have some merit, especially when used in conjunction with a second, good-enough card. Why? Well, consider this: The Blue card pays a superb 6% cashback on grocery purchases, 6% more on &#8220;select&#8221; streaming subscriptions, and 3% on gas stations. It pays only 1% cashback on everything else, but Gwen already has a card that she can use for everything else, her Chase card, and it pays 1.5%. The question really comes down to this: Will Gwen spend enough on groceries and streaming, to cover the $95 annual fee, and still give her more cash back than she&#8217;d get if she used a different card (or cards) paying only 3% on groceries and streaming? It&#8217;s not too hard to answer that question, though. First, we need to know how much Gwen pays for groceries and streaming in an average month. Is it $500? If so, then at 6% cashback she&#8217;s getting $30 back a month on those purchases, or $360 a year, instead of the $15 a month, or $180 a year, she&#8217;d be getting with a 3% cash back card (or cards). The difference between $360 and $180 ($180), is more than the $95 annual fee, so Gwen is actually getting a good deal in this case. Conversely, if Gwen spends only $200 a month on groceries and streaming, her cashback at 6% is $144 a year. Minus the $95 annual fee, she&#8217;s netting only $49 cash back, which is less than the $72 she&#8217;d get on a 3% cashback card with no annual fee. In that case, she&#8217;s better off finding a different card, and leaving the AmEx card to bigger spenders.

Which Cards Are Best For Me?", "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/my-cash-back-cards-arent-great-and-i-dont-20250417.jpg", "site": "https://247wallst.com", "text": "Short and sweet. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;d describe this next letter from the Reddit mailbag. In 53 words, four of which are conjunctions, our caller today (let&#8217;s call him &#8220;Al&#8221;) polls the Reddit-verse advice on &#8220;the best&#8221; cash back credit card, to replace his current cash back card, which Al consider suboptimal. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking for a credit card that has better cash back than my current ones. I don&#8217;t really care for the travel points or anything like that. Just strictly cash back. I&#8217;ve heard chase sapphire is good and discover it, but I&#8217;m wondering what you all have found to be the best. Thanks!&#8221; In just 53 words, you wouldn&#8217;t expect Al could go far wrong with his request, and yet in fact he does. The problem with Al&#8217;s question you see, lies in his assumption that there must be one best cash back credit card out there. But there isn&#8217;t. Rather, the best way to make use of credit cards to get cash back, is to use them in combination. Key Points There is no such thing as one &#8220;best&#8221; cash back credit card. To maximize your cash back, it&#8217;s best to use one general cash back card, plus a combination of multiple specialized cards paying extra cash back on specific kinds of purchases. A combination like this can increase your monthly cash back by 20% or more. The right cash back credit card can earn you hundreds, or thousands of dollars a year for free. Our top pick pays up to 5% cash back, a $200 bonus on top, and $0 annual fee. Click here to apply now (Sponsor) Think of it like this: Some cash back cards pay you a decent rate, say 2% on everything you buy. Other cash back cards pay you a superior rate, say 5% on purchases of gas (but only in certain time periods, like from January to March), or they may pay you back 3% on gas all the time, but 1% on everything else. The devil, as the saying goes, is in the details. And it&#8217;s these details that make it hard to say if a card paying 5% on one thing, 3% on another, and 1% on everything else, is better than a card that just pays you a straight 2% cash back on whatever you charge on the card. How to work the system on cash back credit cards So you do you untangle this intricate web of rewards? I can answer that in two steps. Step 1: You start off by getting one single, all-around cash back card that pays a decent rate on everything, all the time, and with no limits or fees. The Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) Active Cash card, Citi (NYSE: C) Double Cash, and SoFi&#8216;s (Nasdaq: SOFI) Unlimited 2% credit card all pay 2% on all purchases in all categories, with no limit on how much cash you can get back, and none of these cards charges an annual fee for the privilege. You only need one of these cards; there&#8217;s little point in having more than one, other than to increase the total amount you can charge across cards. If asked to choose, of the three, I prefer SoFi&#8217;s card over the others, because it does not charge foreign exchange fees when traveling outside the country (and unlike Al, I actually do &#8220;care for the travel&#8221;)! Step 2: Now that you&#8217;re guaranteed a minimum of 2% cash back on all your spending, you try to bump up your average cash back from there, trying to inch past 2%. Add a Capital One (NYSE: COF) Savor Card for example, to get 3% cash back on groceries and restaurants. Add a Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) Customized Cash card and choose to get 3% back on gas for your car. Add a Citi Custom Cash card (similar concept, but from a different bank) and choose to get 5% back your internet provider&#8217;s bill (only up to $500 per month, but most internet bills are less than that). Then substitute the Capital One card for your SoFi card when buying food or visiting restaurants, substitute the BofA card when paying your internet bill, and substitute the Citi card when filling up. Say in a given month you spend $700 on food, $200 on gas, $100 on internet, and $2000 on everything else. How does this work out? Well, your total cash back across the four cards will be: $700 x 0.03 = $21 $200 x 0.03 = $6 $100 x 0.05 = $5 And $2000 x 0.02 = $40 Add it up, and you got $72 cash back on $3000 in spending. $3000 divided into $72 = 2.4%. That&#8217;s the total cash back you&#8217;re getting, and it&#8217;s 20% better than a plain vanilla 2% cash back card.

With all the different perks and benefits available today, it makes perfect sense to shop around and find who offers the best deal. Key Points This Redditor is looking for a great combination of general and travel card. Sadly, they don’t want to live in a cash-back world. There are a few really strong recommendations that are worth considering. The right travel credit card can take you to places you’ve never dreamed of. Click here now to see our top picks. (Sponsor) This is precisely the situation with one Redditor posting on r/CreditCards, as they are looking to find the card that best matches their goals and travel needs. This individual is looking at travel as their primary goal, so all efforts here will be about earning miles and points. It’s a little confusing that the Redditor wants a card that excels for both general and travel purposes, as most cards do one or the other really well, but there is no harm in trying to find something that works. The Criteria With an income of over $300,000 and a FICO score of 800, this Redditor hopes to get a solid travel card that allows them to use points for domestic and international travel. Currently, they are okay with category-specific cards but do not favor rotating-category cards, which knocks some of the more popular cashback cards off the board. While they only travel once per year, either domestically or internationally, they have an international trip already planned, so it would be ideal to have a card they could use to rack up some points this year. As far as expenses, they have their once-yearly travel plans, a $5,000 monthly mortgage, a $500 HOA, and $350 in monthly utilities, none of which are paid by card. There is also a Costco membership, but this really isn’t a factor, and they already have a Costco Citi Visa, BoA unlimited cash rewards, BoA customized cash rewards, and a Discover card. So, after considering the AMEX Platinum and Bilt cards, they are still waiting to find something better. However, it’s worth noting that in the comments, they clarify that they are okay with an annual fee and the option to downgrade if they find themselves traveling less. The Options AMEX Platinum Among the top recommended options is a card that the original poster is already considering. The American Express Platinum card has a $695 annual fee, which is a definite negative, but it also has many bonuses to help offset this charge. However, before getting into the benefits, it&#8217;s worth knowing that the attractive 80,000 membership reward point bonus requires $8,000 in eligible purchases over 6 months. While we don’t know precisely what the Redditor spends monthly, this should be manageable based on their overall income and general spending habits. With this card, you get a $155 Walmart+ credit, a $200 hotel credit every year, a $240 digital entertainment credit, and a $200 airline fee credit, which means the $695 annual fee is offset by $900 in value when you also get a $15 Uber Cash credit every month. Capital One Venture X Another solid option for this Redditor might be the Capital One Venture X card. While it has a $395 annual fee, it offers a $300 annual travel credit, a $120 Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit, 10,000 bonus miles (equivalent to $100) every year, and 75,000 bonus miles after you spend $4,000 in the first three months. Earning 10X miles on hotel and car rentals, 5X miles on flights, and 2X miles on all other purchases, this Redditor should have more than enough time to spend and save for their once-yearly big trip. Plus, you get access to more than 1,300 lounges, which could be beneficial if and when the original poster goes international and wants a nicer place to sit and wait for their flight. Chase Sapphire Preferred Among Chase’s best cards, this one offers an outstanding balance between general and travel spending, making it a top option. The Chase Sapphire Preferred has a $95 annual fee but offers 100,000 bonus points with just $5,000 in spending after 90 days, a pretty strong bonus overall. In addition, you get $200 in partner value from Chase partners, $50 statement credits every year when booking through Chase Travel, and 25% more value when rewards are redeemed for travel. To earn rewards, you can earn 2X on all travel purchases, 3X on dining out or taking in, 3X points on grocery purchases, and 3X on streaming services, so rewards can quickly add up.

Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended that investors vote against the payouts, expressing concerns about the process used to set the compensation. aAdsList.push('Article'); aAdsListSize.push([300, 250]); aAdsListCA.push(null); Moynihan earned $35 million for last year, an increase of roughly 21%. The company's board credited him with growing its net income 2.3% last year and boosting revenue 3.4%. On U.S. plans to impose tariffs on trading partners, Moynihan said any impact on the bank will be indirect - on how a trade war affects the economy. \"The impact on our bank will be through the economic impact of a trade war... so if you believe that consumption falls and that results in reductions in force of employees and unemployment rate would go up,\" he said. The administration of President Donald Trump earlier this month announced, then paused, sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, throwing the global economy into a state of uncertainty. Moynihan reiterated that the bank's economic team does not see a recession this year, but expects the Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates because inflation is sticky. Regarding a question about the risk of Trump sacking Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the CEO said an independent central bank is one of the important things about U.S. consistency. Trump stepped up his criticism of Fed Chair Powell for not cutting interest rates, calling him a \"major loser\", in a social media post on Monday, which raised concerns about the president's influence over the central bank. BofA's shareholders also voted on other management proposals, but rejected all individual shareholder proposals. These individual proposals included a request to the board to annually report on the alignment of its lobbying and policy influence activities with regard to its 2030 sectoral emissions reduction and 2050 net zero targets. BofA had joined other major U.S. banks to leave the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, one of the world's top banking sector climate coalitions in recent months. BofA topped estimates for first-quarter profit as interest income grew and volatile markets helped its stock traders rake in a record haul.

Authorities claim the group — one man and three women — were caught red-handed committing the April 16 theft, as they were being surveilled in connection to a similar theft of a Rolex in Orange County earlier this year, according to the criminal complaint obtained by Patch. In this case, authorities say one of the women was inside a Vermont Avenue Bank of America scouting for victims. There, she let a person cut in front of her in the ATM line and that person withdrew $10,000, ATF Special Agent Wyatt Haccou wrote in court documents. After that, the woman and her group followed the victim via car from the ATM to a 76 gas station at Melrose and Vermont avenues. While the victim was at the gas pump, the group found the $10,000 inside the vehicle's center console and took off with it, according to prosecutors. ATF agents watched the theft unfold and followed the group in their vehicle to a residence near Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue, where they arrested the four suspects, prosecutors said. Several of the suspects said they commit these types of crimes in order to send money back to their families, according to prosecutors. All four were charged with conspiracy to transport, transmit or transfer at least $5,000 of stolen money in interstate or foreign commerce: Javier Jesús Cordoza Araújo, 41, of Venezuela; Ingrid Carolina Medina, 40, of Colombia; Gladys Gruz Navarro, 62, of Venezuela; and Guadalupe Delcristo Martínez, 46, of Mexico. The ATF was surveilling the group as part of the investigation into the theft of a $100,000 Rolex from a vehicle in Orange County. Authorities suspect the watch was stolen by one of the group members from a victim's vehicle after the victim had been shopping at a jewelry store, according to court documents.", "url": "https://www.patch.com/california/hollywood/crime-tourists-stake-out-la-atm-looking-victims-nab-10k-doj", "ticker": "BAC", "event_date": "2025-04-15", "window_start": "2025-04-01", "window_end": "2025-04-29", "publishedDateET": "2025-04-22T12:36:11-04:00", "date_et": "2025-04-22"}

Key Points A Reddit user is concerned because Bank of America cut his credit limit. He’s not sure why his limit was reduced by over $5,000. Possible reasons for a credit limit reduction include not using the card enough, or banks becoming concerned about your debt. Finding the best credit card just got a lot easier. We’ve assembled a list of cards with unlimited cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 fees, and more. See the list for yourself. You can click here to get started. A Reddit user is upset that his Bank of America credit card just had its limit slashed. While the poster originally had an $11,000 balance, his limit has now been cut by over $5,000, which he discovered when he tried to use the card and it was declined. The original poster (OP) wanted to know why the card had been declined, and other posters chimed in with some possible reasons. Why did the bank cut the poster&#8217;s credit limit? Of course, the only way to get a clear answer on why the poster had his credit limit cut would be to call Bank of America directly and see if he can find out. However, there are a number of possible explanations. Some Redditors said that the issue might be that the OP wasn&#8217;t using the card very much. Many banks will reduce your credit line, or even close your card entirely, if the card is dormant. Since it&#8217;s typically not a good thing to see old credit cards shut down or to have your credit limit reduced, this is why it is a good idea to use your card on occasion. Even if you don&#8217;t use the card often because you have moved on to others, charge one or two small purchases every few months and pay them off just to keep the card active. Other Redditors said that the credit limit decline may have happened if the banks ran a credit check and saw signs of red flags that could suggest the OP was getting into financial trouble. One poster who replied explained that credit card companies may reduce your credit limit if they sense economic turmoil based on a review of your finances, as they want to limit their risk exposure. Since the poster here said he has been carrying a balance on some cards, and he had started using the Bank of America card a lot more recently, the most likely reason for the cut in this case is that the bank got nervous he was getting too deeply into debt. How to build good credit using your credit cards Unfortunately, the OP is not in a great situation here because having a credit line cut can hurt your credit score by reducing the amount of available credit that you have available to you. Credit utilization is the second most important factor in the credit scoring formula, and it is determined by dividing the credit used by the credit available. Since the OP has now had his credit line cut, at the same time as he said he is carrying balances, he could see a big decline in his credit score due to the reduction in his account limit. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s not a whole lot he can do about that unless he can get Bank of America or some of his other card issuers to raise his limit again, or unless he can start paying down his debt. The reality is, credit cards can be a great tool to help you build credit, but you need to be smart about how to use them in order to make that happen. You should research to find a great cash back card or two, use the cards regularly to develop a positive payment history, but keep your balance below 30%, and pay off the bill in full every month. If you do that, hopefully your card can help you build a great score that helps ensure banks want to give you as much credit as possible, rather than cutting your limit for reasons you don&#8217;t understand.
