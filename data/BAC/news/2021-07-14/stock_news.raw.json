    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bank of America today announced the launch of the Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card, which allows clients to earn unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases. This new credit card is the latest among Bank of America’s suite of rewards cards, each designed to fit a variety of clients’ needs. “We heard from our clients that they want earning rewards on their credit card to be uncomplicated,” said Jason Gaughan, credit card executive at Bank of America. “With our new Unlimited Cash Rewards card, we’ve made earning cash back on all purchases even easier, and are helping clients optimize their spending.” Unlimited Cash Rewards Features – Clients will automatically earn 1.5% cash back on all purchases, with no limit on the amount of cash back earned. Cash rewards don’t expire, and redemption is simple: clients can redeem their cash back for any amount, at any time for statement credits or deposits directly into a Bank of America checking or savings account, or for credit to an eligible account with Merrill. The Unlimited Cash Rewards card has no annual fee. Earn Even More with Preferred Rewards – Members of Bank of America’s Preferred Rewards program earn 25% to 75% more cash back on every purchase made with the Unlimited Cash Rewards card, depending on their rewards tier. That means the unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases could increase to up to 2.62% cash back. Award-Winning Credit Card Options – The new card joins the suite of award-winning credit cards from Bank of America including the Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards credit card, which offers clients 3% cash back in a category of their choice. Cardholders choose from one of six categories including gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drug stores and home improvement. Customized Cash Rewards cardholders also earn 2% cash back at grocery stores and wholesale clubs, and unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases. Clients earn 3% and 2% cash back on the first $2,500 in combined purchases each quarter in the choice category, and at grocery stores and wholesale clubs, then earn unlimited 1% thereafter. Coming Soon: Business Advantage Unlimited Cash Rewards – Bank of America will launch a similar credit card for business owners in October. The Business Advantage Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card will enable clients to earn unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases. Business Advantage Unlimited Cash Rewards clients enrolled in Preferred Rewards for Business can increase their credit card rewards bonus by 25% to 75%, depending on the rewards tier for which they qualify. The Business Advantage Unlimited Cash Rewards card will have no annual fee and rewards do not expire. Download the Bank of America app or visit bankofamerica.com.

    "text": "CIUDAD DE NUEVA YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merrill Lynch Wealth Management publicó hoy tres estudios que analizan las comunidades afroamericanas, LGBTQ+ e hispanas de altos ingresos. Los primeros informes de estudios de este tipo titulados, “Puntos de vista diversos: comprender la riqueza en los EE. UU.” (solo se ofrece en inglés), buscan tener un mejor conocimiento acerca de cómo las personas de estas comunidades diversas logran alcanzar el éxito y aumentar su patrimonio, motivaciones, desafíos y metas para el futuro. “Atender a un grupo de clientes diversos requiere de un entendimiento profundo de las experiencias particulares y la trayectoria de la vida financiera de cada persona”, dijo Andy Sieg, director de Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. “Y aunque nunca podamos ponernos realmente en el lugar del otro, este estudio enfatiza aún más nuestro compromiso de apreciar y reflexionar con mayor amplitud sobre los mercados diversos en las comunidades a las que atendemos”. Los estudios fueron realizados por la firma de investigación Ipsos y encontraron que el crecimiento de estos hogares diversos de altos ingresos (ingresos anuales de más de $125,000) está superando al de la población en general. Desde 2015, las comunidades afroamericanas, LGBTQ+ e hispanas de altos ingresos han crecido en un 65%, 76% y 81% respectivamente, mientras que la población general ha crecido en un 53%. Si bien la encuesta encontró muchos puntos en común y surgieron temas notables en cada una de estas comunidades, también identificó diferencias en comparación con la población general de personas con altos ingresos: Metas Afroamericanos: En cuanto a su vida financiera, las personas de esta comunidad dan prioridad a apoyar a los familiares, invertir en los negocios de personas que conocen y asegurar el patrimonio a través del espíritu empresarial LGBTQ+: Comenzar una familia se convierte cada vez más en un objetivo. Casi una cuarta parte de las personas aspira casarse y el 13% de los jóvenes LGBTQ+ (de 20 a 34 años) afirma que tener un hijo es una de sus metas financieras más importantes (en comparación con el 5% de los LGBTQ+ de 35 a 54 años). A largo plazo, más miembros de esta comunidad mencionan el pago de la atención médica y la atención prolongada como una meta financiera importante (24% vs. 17% de la población general de altos ingresos) Hispanos: Los miembros de esta comunidad tienden cuatro veces más a afirmar que su objetivo financiero más importante es “planear para ayudar o apoyar a padres mayores”. Además, uno de cada cinco hispanos también dice que es muy importante dejar una herencia a su familia Motivaciones y prioridades financieras Afroamericanos: El deseo de superación personal tiende a motivar el doble a las personas de esta comunidad. Además, el deseo de preparar para el éxito a generaciones futuras tiende a motivarlos un 25% más LGBTQ+: Los miembros de esta comunidad están enfocados en vivir de manera auténtica con las actividades que les gusta hacer o simplemente vivir la vida de la manera que desean. Además, tienden a ver un 45% más como prioridad principal la retribución y el apoyo a su comunidad Hispanos: El 35% afirma que el cuidado de su familia es una de las principales motivaciones personales. Además, se ven impulsados tres veces más por el deseo de enorgullecer a su familia Desafíos Afroamericanos: Las personas de esta comunidad enfrentan muchos de los mismos desafíos que los demás. Sin embargo, tienden a concentrarse el doble en reducir sus niveles de deuda actuales, 25% más a mantener económicamente a su familia, y tres veces más a afirmar que pagar la educación es una fuente de estrés LGBTQ+: Un tercio no se siente aceptado por su familia. Como resultado, el 58% afirma que ha tenido que trazar su propio camino hacia la independencia financiera Hispanos: Las personas de esta comunidad están más estresadas por poder pagar las cuentas del hogar (17% vs. 12%) y equilibrar financieramente el cuidado de los demás mientras se mantienen a sí mismos (15% vs. a 12%) “Muchos desafíos financieros han tenido un impacto desproporcionado en las comunidades diversas en los últimos años. A través de estos resultados, esperamos generar un diálogo adicional y significativo con los clientes y a través de la industria que promueva nuestra capacidad de cubrir las necesidades de todas las personas y comunidades”, dijo Kirstin Hill, director de operaciones de Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. Para avanzar en la conversación, Merrill convocó a miembros de las comunidades afroamericanas, LGBTQ+ e hispanas de altos ingresos para discusiones de mesa redonda. Metodología de “Puntos de vista diversos: comprender la riqueza en los EE. UU.” Los investigadores de la firma Ipsos resumieron y revisaron una variedad de publicaciones y estudios académicos sobre temas de diversidad, patrimonio e inclusión en los servicios financieros, entre otros. Además, se realizaron entrevistas con expertos y académicos destacados. A partir de allí, se llevó a cabo un estudio cualitativo a través de una comunidad en línea, seguida de etnografías en casa con encuestados que representan el segmento de altos ingresos de las comunidades afroamericana, hispana y LGBTQ+. También se realizó una encuesta cuantitativa entre más de 450 miembros de cada una de las comunidades, con personas con más de $100,000 en activos invertibles. Cada comunidad se comparó con una muestra representativa de 1,000 estadounidenses de altos ingresos, un grupo al que se hace referencia en los informes como la población general de altos ingresos. Se realizó un análisis estadístico en los cuatro grupos para garantizar la representación, precisión e integridad.

    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merrill Lynch Wealth Management published today three studies examining the affluent Black/African American, LGBTQ+ and Hispanic/Latino communities. The first-of-its-kind research reports titled, “Diverse Viewpoints: Understanding Affluence in the U.S.,” aim to better understand how individuals in these diverse communities achieve success and grow their wealth, their motivations and challenges and goals for the future. “Serving a diverse client base requires a deep understanding of people’s unique experiences and financial life paths,” said Andy Sieg, head of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. “And while we can never really know what it’s like to walk in someone else’s shoes, this research further underscores our commitment to more fully appreciating and reflecting the diverse markets in the communities we serve.” Conducted by research firm Ipsos, the studies found that the growth of these diverse affluent households (annual income more than $125,000) is outpacing that of the general population. Since 2015, affluent Black/African American, LGBTQ+ and Hispanic/Latino communities have grown by 65%, 76% and 81% respectively, while the affluent general population has grown by 53%. While the survey found many commonalities, within each of these communities notable themes emerged, as did differences when compared to the general population of affluent individuals: Goals Black/African American: With respect to their financial life, individuals in this community prioritize supporting family members, investing in the businesses of people they know, and securing wealth through entrepreneurship. LGBTQ+: Starting a family is increasingly a goal, with nearly a quarter aspiring to get married and 13% of young LGBTQ+ (20-34 year olds) citing having a child as one of their most important financial goals (compared to 5% of LGBTQ+ 35-54 years old). Longer-term, more members of this community cite paying for healthcare and long-term care as an important financial goal (24% vs. affluent general population 17%). Hispanic/Latino: Members of this community are four times as likely to cite that their most important financial goal is ‘planning to assist or support aging parents.’ One-in-five also say leaving an inheritance to their family is very important. Motivators & Financial Priorities Black/African American: Individuals in this community are two times more likely to be motivated by a desire for personal achievement. They are also 25% more likely to be motivated by a desire to set future generations up for success. LGBTQ+: Members of this community are focused on being able to live authentically by pursuing activities they love or simply living life the way they want. They are also 45% more likely to view giving back to and supporting their community as a top priority. Hispanic/Latino: 35% cite providing for their family as a top personal motivator. They are also three times as likely to be driven by a desire to make their family proud. Challenges Black/African American: Individuals in this community face many of the same challenges as others; however, they’re twice as likely to be focused on reducing their current debt levels; 25% more likely to be supporting their family financially; and three times more likely to say paying for education is a source of stress. LGBTQ+: One-third do not feel accepted by their family. As a result, 58% say they’ve had to chart their own path to financial independence. Hispanic/Latino: Individuals in this community are more stressed about being able to pay household bills (17% vs. 12%) and balance financially caring for others while supporting themselves (15% vs. 12%). “Many financial challenges have disproportionally impacted diverse communities in recent years. Through these findings we hope to spark additional, meaningful dialogue with clients and across the industry that furthers our ability to meet the needs of all people and communities,” said Kirstin Hill, chief operating officer at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. To advance the conversation, Merrill convened members of the affluent Black/African American, LGBTQ+ and Hispanic/Latino communities for roundtable discussions. Methodology for “Diverse Viewpoints: Understanding Affluence in the U.S.” Researchers at the firm Ipsos synthesized and reviewed an array of publications and academic research on the topics of diversity, wealth and inclusion in financial services and beyond. Additionally, interviews were conducted with leading experts and academics. From there, qualitative research was conducted through an Online Community, followed by in-home ethnographies with respondents representing the affluent segment of the Black/African American community, Hispanic/Latino community and the LGBTQ+ community. A quantitative survey was also conducted among more than 450 members of each of the communities, with individuals with more than $100,000 in investable assets. Each community was compared to a representative sample of 1,000 affluent Americans, a group referred to in the reports as the affluent general population. Statistical analysis was conducted on all four groups to ensure representation, accuracy, and completeness.
