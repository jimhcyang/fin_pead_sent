    "text": "Close Shares of Marvell Technology (MRVL) soared on Wednesday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the chipmaker’s stock, citing the “exceptional” strength of AI demand. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore on Wednesday raised his Marvell price target by about 10% to $80 while maintaining an “equal weight” rating. “Marvell is firmly in the AI winners camp, and sentiment has swung aggressively negative compared to a few months ago,” Moore wrote. “We are more excited for their opportunity in optical, which brings higher margin and durability vs. their ASIC opportunity, which has disappointed.” (ASIC refers to application-specific integrated circuit, a class of customizable chip that combines several circuits to perform tasks that would otherwise require multiple interconnected chips.) Marvell shares were up more than 9% in recent trading, making it the best-performing stock in the Nasdaq 100. Despite Wednesday's gain, Marvell shares are down about 23% since the start of the year. Marvell is just one of several semiconductor stocks Moore expects to benefit from strong AI demand over the next year. He also raised his 12-month price targets on Nvidia (NVDA) by 17%, Broadcom (AVGO) by 25%, Astera Labs (ALAB) by 26%, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) by more than 50%. All of those stocks were also trading in the green on Wednesday. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) “While stock prices have moved higher, our conviction on AI spend durability in 2026 continues to grow,” Moore wrote. Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) last week raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast, citing the need to accelerate data center buildouts to meet seemingly insatiable demand for AI and cloud computing. Investors will get more updates on the strength of AI investment after markets close on Wednesday when tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) report earnings.

Despite impressive user and revenue growth, Meta's massive spending—particularly in Reality Labs—continues to weigh heavily on margins and cash flow. Much of Meta's revenue growth is driven by raising ad prices, a strategy that may not be sustainable long-term and could hinder future earnings growth.",

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Roku (ROKU) +2.13% 4:45 pm Roku executed cleanly, but the modest stock move reflects already high expectations. Free cash flow, platform margin expansion, and a solid Q3 guide reaffirm the recovery story. The question now is whether Roku can re-accelerate engagement and ad yield fast enough to justify further multiple expansion. More Takeaways 4:43 pm Platform Margins Rebound: Platform gross profit rose 20% YoY, while platform gross margin rebounded to 54.5% (up from 51.8% last quarter). This reflects improving ad pricing and better optimization of first-party demand. Free Cash Flow Turns Positive Again: Roku reported $26.5 million in free cash flow, swinging back into the black after a few quarters of cash burn. Operating leverage from better gross margins and tight expense control helped drive the shift. Active Accounts &amp; Engagement Trends 4:35 pm Active Accounts: 84.8 million (up 1.7M QoQ, up 12% YoY) Streaming Hours: 31.7 billion (flat QoQ, up 20% YoY) Roku added more accounts than expected, but total streaming hours plateaued sequentially — a key area to watch as engagement fuels ad inventory monetization. Guidance Update 4:23 pm Roku provided the following Q3 2025 outlook: Revenue: ~$940 million Adj. EBITDA: $(20) million Gross Profit: ~$430 million This represents a ~7.6% sequential growth in topline revenue, while narrowing EBITDA losses significantly. Gross margin guidance implies modest operating leverage ahead. CEO Anthony Wood emphasized that advertising spend is stabilizing, and Roku continues to gain share of traditional TV budgets. The tone was cautiously optimistic, especially on the AI-powered ad tools improving campaign efficiency and targeting. “We are seeing healthy engagement and strong monetization as marketers adapt to converged TV,” said Wood. CFO Dan Jedda added that “Disciplined expense management” remains a top priority amid evolving macro conditions. Roku Earnings Out, Stock Up 4:11 pm Roku share are up 3% immediately after releasing earnings. Metric Reported Consensus Estimate Beat/Miss Revenue $1.118B $1.072B Beat Adjusted EPS –$0.07 –$0.16 Beat Free Cash Flow $161.7M $57.7M Beat Gross Profit $500M N/A — Gross Margin 44.7% 43.5% (est. Q1) Beat What&#039;s Wall Street saying about Roku? 3:33 pm by Eric Bleeker We&#8217;re now just 30 minutes away from earnings. One question before earnings is what Wall Street has been saying about Roku recently. On July 3rd, BofA analyst Brent Navon raised his price target on Roku to $110 &#8211; up from a previous $100 price target &#8211; and maintained a buy rating on the company. He cited industry-wide advertising trends as a reason for the update. Meta&#8217;s earnings yesterday provided one more positive datapoint on advertising before Roku reports tonight. Roku Shares are Surging Ahead of Earnings 1:10 pm by Eric Bleeker Roku shares are jumping before earnings today. It&#8217;s a great day for tech stock sin general with the Nasdaq Composite up .83% today following outstanding earnings from Meta (Nasdaq: META) and Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT). What Wall Street Expects When Roku Reports Tonight 12:25 pm Here are the consensus expectations for Roku&#8217;s second quarter earnings: Revenue: $1.072 billion Adjusted EPS: -$.16 Free Cash Flow: $57.7 million And Wall Street will also be closely watching Roku&#8217;s guidance, so here&#8217;s what&#8217;s expected from the company&#8217;s third quarter earnings. Revenue: $1.169 billion Adjusted EPS: $.11 Free Cash Flow: $99.1 million Roku (Nasdaq: ROKU) shares have been soaring in recent months. The company&#8217;s shares are up 66% since April 4th. Can the rally continue? We&#8217;ll be hosting a live blog breaking down Roku&#8217;s Q1 earnings. The moment earnings go live, we&#8217;ll be posting news and analysis. All you have to do is leave this page open and new updates will automatically appear as we post them. Before diving into what Wall Street expects next quarter, let&#8217;s take a look at what Roku reported when it last released earnings. What Roku Reported Last Earnings Roku last reported on May 1st.

Our scale in the U.S. exceeds half of broadband households and continues to grow. We remain focused on our initiatives to grow Platform revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow.&#8221; CFO Commentary: Dan Jedda: &#8220;While there is more macro uncertainty than normal, we are providing our best outlook based on our current visibility and what we are observing in our business. We remain vigilant and adaptable as market conditions evolve.&#8221; Strategic Updates: Roku announced an agreement to acquire Frndly TV, a subscription streaming service that offers over 50 live TV channels, on-demand video, and cloud-based DVR for an affordable price. This acquisition is intended to support Roku&#8217;s focus on growing Platform revenue and Roku-billed subscriptions.

Overall, the company did a lot tonight to push the narrative they&#8217;ll be aggressive to catch up in AI and that device sales are rebounding. It&#8217;s a good quarter for Apple that might start turning around what&#8217;s been a disappointing 2025. Tim Cook on AI 5:58 pm TD Cowen Analst: Tim, I was curious about your thoughts on AI for edge devices. There&#8217;s like some people who think that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you think &#8212; do you see a scenario where the LLM become a third part of your iOS or is the SLM the way to go and how to think about evolution of edge devices in a futuristic AI world and is smartphone going to be the choice of device. Just curious your thoughts on it, broadly speaking. Timothy Cook Chief Executive Officer The way that we look at AI is that it&#8217;s 1 of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. And I think it will affect all devices in a significant way what pieces of the chain are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn&#8217;t want to to really talk about today. because that gives away some things on our strategy. But I think it&#8217;s a good question. . Tim Cook on Apple Momentum 5:48 pm Here&#8217;s what Tim Cook had to say about Apple&#8217;s surprising momentum in China last quarter: &#8220;Yes. We did grow in Greater China by 4% during the quarter versus the previous quarter, it was driven by an acceleration by iPhone, although we also had substantial growth on the MAC year-over-year. From a &#8212; as you know, the government has placed certain subsidies that affects some of our products, not all of them, but there are some of them. And I think that had some effect. It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out. that cut in during a portion of the previous quarter. The other things I would say are that the installed base hit a record high in Greater China &#8212; and we set an all-time record for the iPhone installed base. The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter. And according to Boral Panel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top 3 models in Urban China, which is extraordinary. Also, if you look at the other products, Mac, iPad and watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China Mainland were new to the product. So lots of good things there. And the other thing I would point out, which is an interesting point, The MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model in all of China, and the Mac Mini was the top-selling desktop model in all of China. So overall, a positive &#8212; very positive quarter.&#8221; Apple&#039;s CFO Says AI Investments Will Rise 5:47 pm &#8220;I would say, a pretty significant driver as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. So that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we&#8217;ve been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers. The other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where in cases we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. So you are going to see an increase in CapEx. We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities in tooling, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you&#8217;re seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments.&#8221; &#8211; Kevan Parekh, Apple CFO Tariff Implications 5:22 pm On Apple&#8217;s conference call they just said they incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs last quarter.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Five Conference Call Quotes That Caught Our Attention Tonight 6:51 pm “We are confident we can sustain 20 % – 30 % year-over-year growth driven by just gaming.” — Adam Foroughi, CEO “On October 1 2025 we plan to open the AXON Ads Manager on a referral basis, perfectly timed for the holiday season.” — Foroughi “During the quarter, revenue increased by a very healthy 77 % from last year to approximately $1.216 billion, while adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled, achieving an 81 % margin.” — Matt Stumpf, CFO “Our strategy is simple: build world-class products, launch them when they meet our high bar and compound from there.” — Foroughi “We have one of the most lucrative financial models the world has ever seen, and we’re very good performance marketers.” — Foroughi We&#039;ll post an Update Later with Thoughts on Applovin&#039;s Earnings Call 4:58 pm Applovin&#8217;s conference call starts now. You can register to listen in here. We will be listening in to Applovin&#8217;s conference call so posts will be limited. If you leave this tab open a new post should automatically post later with our summary of the call. We thank you for joining us today for this review of Applovin&#8217;s Q2 earnings. We&#8217;re hosting several live blogs on 24/7 Wall St., so if you&#8217;re looking for analysis of your favorite stocks make sure to come back! Advertising is Becoming a Battleground 4:41 pm AppLovin continues to trade down about 7% after hours. It&#8217;s worth noting that Unity reported before the market opened today and initially saw its shares up 10% at the open, but by midday shares were down more than 10%. The results of Meta have likely poured lighter fluid on expectations of what AI-frst advertising stocks can deliver in the near-term. Still, it&#8217;s interesting to see this battle where results are causing wild swings in share prices of companies in the ad space. Wild After Hours Price Action 4:36 pm And now shares are testing lows again! Applovin shares are down 8% as of 4:36 p.m. ET. This is some fairly wild volatility. The company&#8217;s conference call starts in 24 minutes, we&#8217;ll see if that calms after hours jitters. That&#039;s More Like it... 4:24 pm We were perplexed by the massive drop in Applovin shares. Earnings was a beat last quarter and on guidance. It&#8217;s a stock that has seen significant gains but results seemed perfectly fine. Shares are now down 2.5%, which seems more in line with what Applovin reported. We&#8217;ll continue monitoring news on the company. AppLovin Quarter in More Detail 4:12 pm APP | AppLovin Q2&#8217;25 Earnings Highlights: Adj.

Upgrades on APP 2:53 pm A few weeks ago BTIG raised its price target on AppLovin to $483 from $480, reaffirming a Buy rating ahead of the company’s Q2 earnings report on August 6. The stock currently trades at $389.03. According to the firm’s latest industry checks, AppLovin maintained or extended its leadership position in the mobile gaming segment during the quarter. Analyst commentary pointed to above-peer growth across a sector that showed clear signs of recovery, adding to the bullish tone. BTIG reiterated AppLovin as a Top Pick, citing ongoing share gains and operational leverage within the company’s AXON ad platform. Solid field intel suggests AppLovin outperformed peers in Q2, reinforcing bullish positioning into earnings. Unity Sinks and AppLivin Roars 2:39 pm AppLovin competitor Unity opened the day up more than 10% after reporting earnings, but saw shares sink into midday trading. Shares have rebounded slightly, but Unity is still down 6% today. Investors in AppLovin don&#8217;t seem to be too bothered by Unity&#8217;s earnings, shares of AppLovin are up 2.5% as of 2:40 p.m. ET. Big money moving in before earnings 1:37 pm There’s been a massive wave of institutional buying in $APP ahead of earnings today after the close. What to watch for: Ad-tech Revenue &#8211; Expectations are in the $1.2-1.27B range, which would be 70% YoY growth. I wouldn’t be surprised if they beat this.

Wall Street expects another quarter of double-digit revenue growth as the company sharpens its focus on ad tech following the sale of its gaming business.

Consensus Estimates Quarterly Estimates Revenue: $1.22 billion EPS (Normalized): $2.32 Full-Year Forecasts FY 2025 Revenue: $5.48 billion FY 2025 EPS: $8.91 This implies: Revenue growth: +13% YoY (vs. $1.08B last year) EPS growth: +98% YoY (vs. $1.17 last year) for Q2 FY Revenue growth: +16% YoY (vs. $4.71B in FY24) FY EPS growth: +56.6% YoY (vs. $5.69 in FY24) Keys to Watch Axon 2 momentum and efficiency gainsManagement said Axon 2 drove “meaningfully better monetization” and remains early in deployment, with SDKs available for both iOS and Android. Continued expansion is expected to fuel outsized software margins and revenue acceleration. Software revenue mix and margin trajectoryCEO Adam Foroughi reiterated the company’s expectation for “35 to 40% software segment margin in 2025,” up from 33% in Q1. This reflects better ad targeting, conversion rates, and cost discipline across the ad stack. Developer adoption and retentionCFO Herald Chen highlighted “record retention of our Axon customers” in Q1 and strong renewals in the developer base. Investors will watch for evidence of broader Axon adoption or net new logo growth in this segment. App portfolio capital efficiencyManagement said adjusted EBITDA margins in apps improved 1,100bps YoY despite lower revenue. The team is focused on managing UA spend and investing in fewer titles with higher ROI.The post Live: AppLovin (APP) Beats Earnings But Shares Sink appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

    "site": "https://www.fool.com",
    "text": "Shares of The Trade Desk (TTD -39.17%) were taking a dive for the second time in three earnings reports today. The leading independent demand-side platform (DSP) in adtech posted results that were in line with expectations, but its guidance confirmed that competition was becoming more of a threat to the business. As a result, several Wall Street analysts downgraded the stock this morning, and shares were down 38.1% as of 10:08 a.m. ET. The second-quarter results weren't bad. Revenue rose 19% to $694 million, which topped the consensus at $686 million. The company touted progress in several channels, including connected TV, retail media, and supply chain optimization, and its Kokai AI platform is being adopted by its customers. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose 12% to $271 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased from $0.39 to $0.41, which matched estimates. The Trade Desk's results make it clear that its growth rate is slowing, which is a problem for a stock that has historically traded at a high multiple. Several analysts downgraded the stock on the update. Bank of America double-downgraded the stock to underperform, saying concerns about competitive pressures were justified. At least three other analysts also cut their ratings as it appears that the \"walled gardens\" that The Trade Desk competes with like Netflix, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet are becoming stronger. Looking ahead to the third quarter, the company called for revenue of at least $717 million and EBITDA of about $277 million, indicating margins are expected to fall slightly on a sequential basis. The revenue forecast, which compares to the average estimate at $722 million, implies growth of at least 14%, a clear sign that growth is decelerating. Given that, the sell-off looks justified as The Trade Desk now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 31 based on adjusted earnings, which seems like a fair price now that its growth prospects are in doubt.",

    "text": "CALIFORNIA — The number one reason people are drawn to the Golden State is for the lifestyle, experts say. When it comes to figuring out the best counties to call home, Patch consulted experts in real estate, travel, and entertainment to help find the ideal spot to hang your hat, no matter if you are single, raising your family, or planning out your golden years. While many reports focus on the best California cities to live in, as locals know, one town tends to flow into the next. Therefore, Patch broadened our view to explore the best counties to call home, based upon home availability, proximity to shopping, restaurants, wineries, and nightlife. In these areas, you can find homes from the upper $500,000 range to the lower $2 million range. Sorted alphabetically by county, here are the places where real estate agents say deals can still be found and career opportunities exist. Take a virtual stroll through these virtual neighborhoods in these counties: 1. Los Angeles County: When it comes to life in Los Angeles County, there are several locales that could be ideal for the lifestyle you are looking for. Here, one neighborhood blends into another and whether you enjoy the city, the country or the beach, there truly is a place for everyone. Redondo Beach According to Travel + Leisure, Redondo Beach is an ideal locale to call home. It's close to the Getty Center, Hollywood, aquariums, and of course, the beach. The breezy weather makes it ideal for those who wish to live where the stars walk on the ground. Redondo Beach, according to Real Estate Broker Jamie Waryck, of the JW Group, told Travel + Leisure, is a\" beach town that knows how to blend small-town charm with big-time culture.\" This small town will bustle in the summer and fall months, and likely be foggy much of the spring. Life in Redondo Beach gets an A+. According to Niche, Redondo Beach was recently voted among the #3 Best Suburbs to call home in California. There are beach concerts, boutiques, pedestrian-friendly restaurants, and quality seafood, Waryck says. Niche also approves of life in Redondo, though it is pricey. The median home value in this area is $1.2 million, with monthly rents averaging $2,562. 2. Riverside County: The landscape of Riverside County extends from balmy wine country in the southwest to the deserts of the eastern Coachella Valley. Both were given nods by Travel + Leisure for the beauty, affordability, and lifestyle offered here. —La Quinta: Close to Indio, concerts and festivals, Indio is ideal for those seeking outdoor life in the winter and poolside living during the summer. Love to travel? The Palm Springs International Airport is close by, making it a breeze for desert dwellers to fly away from the 100+ degree heat of summer. La Quinta has a median home value of $612,800 according to Niche, with a median rent of $1,741. —Temecula: Just north of San Diego County along the I-15 corridor lies the award-winning wine country of Temecula. This city is blooming with shops, restaurants, wineries and hotels, including the famed Pechanga Resort Casino. In Temecula, there is always something to do for residents of all ages. Niche has given Temecula a B+ rating for schools, diversity, and nightlife, while housing remains hit or miss. “Temecula is a beautifully designed community with a lovely rural feeling,” realtor Nancy Hughes told Travel + Leisure. “The Kaiser Development Master Plan had a goal of creating large areas of very low density, which is why we have several communities with larger acreages.” The median home value hovers around $640,400 with a median rent of $2,297. 3. Sacramento County: —Sacramento: \"The City of Trees,\" and California's state capital, Sacramento, should not be overlooked if you are looking for a convenient, central location to live.

With over 70 miles of coastline, people who call this area home can enjoy the San Diego Zoo, the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, SeaWorld, Balboa Park, the Hotel Del Coronado, and Sea Port Village if you want to play tourist. —Coronado Coronado Island, just over the sweeping arc of the bridge from downtown San Diego, offers a small, tight-knit community in the off-season, and you'll find the streets and the shores packed with visitors in the summer. Parks, beaches, restaurants, and concerts are all within easy walking distance or short bike rides here, and a water taxi can whisk you across to a San Diego Padres baseball game or to the downtown San Diego Gas Lamp area. The Hotel Del Coronado is a landmark that is not to be missed. About 18,500 people call Coronado home, according to Niche. Here, there are many restaurants, shopping centers, coffee shops, and parks. According to Niche, Coronado gets an A+ grade, thanks to public schools, nightlife, and diversity. It's a great place for families, with slightly lower grades for crime and safety and housing costs.

San Joaquin County: The Central Valley county of San Joaquin is one of the nation's most desireable housing markets for those looking for affordable housing in California. Here, you can find good schools, close-knit communities, and a high quality of life, according to the county website. \"Our communities appeal to a range of budgets and lifestyles. From urban and upscale living to serene settings to family-centric neighborhoods and master-planned communities, house hunters have options for a fraction of the cost of neighboring markets. And it's all within commuting distance from the Bay Area and Silicon Valley.\" —Lodi This little Central Valley town is situated in San Joaquin County. It's home to about 67,000 people. The town, a suburb of Stockton, is full of small-town charm, according to realtor Ryan Sherman of Sherman & Associates Real Estate Co. For families, Lodi is commutable distance to Sacramento, and has a vibrant downtown. \"It is celebrated for its award-winning wineries, and the eclectic dining, boutique shopping, and farmers markets,\" Sherman told T+E. \"There are 85 wineries in Lodi, along with tasting rooms to enjoy them.

Most residents own their homes, according to Niche, and the median home value is about $468,800. A rental house in Lodi would cost approximately $1,500 per month. 7. San Luis Obispo County Welcome to the Central Coast of California. Nicknamed \"SLO County,\" this is a place where agriculture reigns, with grapes at the top of that food chain. Here, you can explore the historic San Simeon, Hearst Castle, or visit beaches, national wildlife refuges, and vineyards. —Paso Robles Paso Robles is about 200 miles from Los Angeles and another 200 miles from San Francisco. It's packed with restaurants, vineyards and scenic landscapes. Real estate expert Mark McConnell and Liz Lee of Heart to Heart real estate shared their thoughts on what makes Paso Robles a great place to call home, telling Travel + Leisure: \"One can choose from a downtown bungalow, a sprawling estate home or rolling hills or vineyards.\" The town itself is historic, with shopping and culinary stores.

It's a big draw for working families in the tech industry. —Sunnyvale According to Travel + Leisure, Sunnyvale is filled with parks, excellent schools, and is close to numerous Silicon Valley businesses, including Apple, Google, LinkedIn, Meta, and Amazon. What's more, the Mediterranean climate is top-notch. Realtor Shirley Frantz, of Keller Williams Luxury Silicon Valley, told Travel + Leisure that the community rallies in the year-long sunshine. \"It's a community that goes to the farmers market on Murphy Avenue, watches their kids play sports on the same fields that they did growing up, and spends time getting to know one another.\" Here, there are coffee shops, restaurants, parks and great schools. Niche ranks Sunnyvale as the #11 best city to raise a family in America, according to a recent survey. It gets an A+ for public schools, good for families, diversity, nightlife, with crime and safety and housing coming in last on the report card. About 150,000 people call Sunnyvale home. Buying a home here will cost about $1.8 million, and the median rent is $3,065 per month. About 56% of Sunnyvale residents are in the rental market. A few final notes about life in California: California may have the third-highest home prices in the nation, according to recent reports on Niche and Travel + Leisure magazine, but rentals remain on average about $3,000 per month across the board. It isn't cheap to live here, but there are benefits to making a life in the Golden State, experts say. One of the biggies for retirees is that California State social security benefits are untaxed, and as for vacations? Residents who choose to staycation instead can save upwards of $7,250 per person per year on a trip in the United States, and over $9,900 on an international trip, according to the Motley Fool.
