Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore on Wednesday raised his Marvell price target by about 10% to $80 while maintaining an “equal weight” rating. “Marvell is firmly in the AI winners camp, and sentiment has swung aggressively negative compared to a few months ago,” Moore wrote. “We are more excited for their opportunity in optical, which brings higher margin and durability vs. their ASIC opportunity, which has disappointed.” (ASIC refers to application-specific integrated circuit, a class of customizable chip that combines several circuits to perform tasks that would otherwise require multiple interconnected chips.) Marvell shares were up more than 9% in recent trading, making it the best-performing stock in the Nasdaq 100. Despite Wednesday's gain, Marvell shares are down about 23% since the start of the year. Marvell is just one of several semiconductor stocks Moore expects to benefit from strong AI demand over the next year. He also raised his 12-month price targets on Nvidia (NVDA) by 17%, Broadcom (AVGO) by 25%, Astera Labs (ALAB) by 26%, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) by more than 50%. All of those stocks were also trading in the green on Wednesday. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) “While stock prices have moved higher, our conviction on AI spend durability in 2026 continues to grow,” Moore wrote. Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) last week raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast, citing the need to accelerate data center buildouts to meet seemingly insatiable demand for AI and cloud computing. Investors will get more updates on the strength of AI investment after markets close on Wednesday when tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) report earnings.

Free cash flow, platform margin expansion, and a solid Q3 guide reaffirm the recovery story. The question now is whether Roku can re-accelerate engagement and ad yield fast enough to justify further multiple expansion. More Takeaways 4:43 pm Platform Margins Rebound: Platform gross profit rose 20% YoY, while platform gross margin rebounded to 54.5% (up from 51.8% last quarter). This reflects improving ad pricing and better optimization of first-party demand. Free Cash Flow Turns Positive Again: Roku reported $26.5 million in free cash flow, swinging back into the black after a few quarters of cash burn. Operating leverage from better gross margins and tight expense control helped drive the shift. Active Accounts &amp; Engagement Trends 4:35 pm Active Accounts: 84.8 million (up 1.7M QoQ, up 12% YoY) Streaming Hours: 31.7 billion (flat QoQ, up 20% YoY) Roku added more accounts than expected, but total streaming hours plateaued sequentially — a key area to watch as engagement fuels ad inventory monetization. Guidance Update 4:23 pm Roku provided the following Q3 2025 outlook: Revenue: ~$940 million Adj. EBITDA: $(20) million Gross Profit: ~$430 million This represents a ~7.6% sequential growth in topline revenue, while narrowing EBITDA losses significantly. Gross margin guidance implies modest operating leverage ahead. CEO Anthony Wood emphasized that advertising spend is stabilizing, and Roku continues to gain share of traditional TV budgets. The tone was cautiously optimistic, especially on the AI-powered ad tools improving campaign efficiency and targeting. “We are seeing healthy engagement and strong monetization as marketers adapt to converged TV,” said Wood. CFO Dan Jedda added that “Disciplined expense management” remains a top priority amid evolving macro conditions.

It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out. that cut in during a portion of the previous quarter. The other things I would say are that the installed base hit a record high in Greater China &#8212; and we set an all-time record for the iPhone installed base. The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter. And according to Boral Panel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top 3 models in Urban China, which is extraordinary. Also, if you look at the other products, Mac, iPad and watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China Mainland were new to the product. So lots of good things there. And the other thing I would point out, which is an interesting point, The MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model in all of China, and the Mac Mini was the top-selling desktop model in all of China. So overall, a positive &#8212; very positive quarter.&#8221; Apple&#039;s CFO Says AI Investments Will Rise 5:47 pm &#8220;I would say, a pretty significant driver as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. So that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we&#8217;ve been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers. The other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where in cases we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. So you are going to see an increase in CapEx. We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities in tooling, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you&#8217;re seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments.&#8221; &#8211; Kevan Parekh, Apple CFO Tariff Implications 5:22 pm On Apple&#8217;s conference call they just said they incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs last quarter. Conference Call Next 4:51 pm by Eric Bleeker Apple&#8217;s conference call is coming soon. We&#8217;ll post highlights. To receive them: simply leave this blog open and an update will post after we&#8217;ve been able to listen in. Shares Now Up 2.9% 4:46 pm Shares are gaining momentum.

The company also achieved a 12% increase in diluted earnings per share, which stood at $1.57. This growth was driven by double-digit increases in iPhone, Mac, and Services revenue across all geographic segments. The services segment reached a new all-time high, contributing significantly to the overall revenue. Apple&#8217;s CEO, Tim Cook, highlighted the company&#8217;s success at the WWDC25 event, where new software designs and Apple Intelligence features were introduced. The board declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share, payable on August 14, 2025. The earnings call is scheduled for July 31, 2025.

We&#8217;ll continue digging into why enthusiasm hasn&#8217;t kept up from the initial &#8216;pop.&#8217; China Back to Growth 4:31 pm It looks like the bleeding has stopped in China, Apple saw growth in the region.

We&#8217;re hosting several live blogs on 24/7 Wall St., so if you&#8217;re looking for analysis of your favorite stocks make sure to come back! Advertising is Becoming a Battleground 4:41 pm AppLovin continues to trade down about 7% after hours. It&#8217;s worth noting that Unity reported before the market opened today and initially saw its shares up 10% at the open, but by midday shares were down more than 10%. The results of Meta have likely poured lighter fluid on expectations of what AI-frst advertising stocks can deliver in the near-term. Still, it&#8217;s interesting to see this battle where results are causing wild swings in share prices of companies in the ad space. Wild After Hours Price Action 4:36 pm And now shares are testing lows again! Applovin shares are down 8% as of 4:36 p.m. ET. This is some fairly wild volatility.

That&#039;s More Like it... 4:24 pm We were perplexed by the massive drop in Applovin shares. Earnings was a beat last quarter and on guidance. It&#8217;s a stock that has seen significant gains but results seemed perfectly fine. Shares are now down 2.5%, which seems more in line with what Applovin reported. We&#8217;ll continue monitoring news on the company. AppLovin Quarter in More Detail 4:12 pm APP | AppLovin Q2&#8217;25 Earnings Highlights: Adj.

Continued expansion is expected to fuel outsized software margins and revenue acceleration. Software revenue mix and margin trajectoryCEO Adam Foroughi reiterated the company’s expectation for “35 to 40% software segment margin in 2025,” up from 33% in Q1. This reflects better ad targeting, conversion rates, and cost discipline across the ad stack. Developer adoption and retentionCFO Herald Chen highlighted “record retention of our Axon customers” in Q1 and strong renewals in the developer base. Investors will watch for evidence of broader Axon adoption or net new logo growth in this segment.

The leading independent demand-side platform (DSP) in adtech posted results that were in line with expectations, but its guidance confirmed that competition was becoming more of a threat to the business. As a result, several Wall Street analysts downgraded the stock this morning, and shares were down 38.1% as of 10:08 a.m. ET. The second-quarter results weren't bad. Revenue rose 19% to $694 million, which topped the consensus at $686 million. The company touted progress in several channels, including connected TV, retail media, and supply chain optimization, and its Kokai AI platform is being adopted by its customers. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose 12% to $271 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased from $0.39 to $0.41, which matched estimates. The Trade Desk's results make it clear that its growth rate is slowing, which is a problem for a stock that has historically traded at a high multiple. Several analysts downgraded the stock on the update. Bank of America double-downgraded the stock to underperform, saying concerns about competitive pressures were justified. At least three other analysts also cut their ratings as it appears that the ""walled gardens"" that The Trade Desk competes with like Netflix, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet are becoming stronger. Looking ahead to the third quarter, the company called for revenue of at least $717 million and EBITDA of about $277 million, indicating margins are expected to fall slightly on a sequential basis. The revenue forecast, which compares to the average estimate at $722 million, implies growth of at least 14%, a clear sign that growth is decelerating. Given that, the sell-off looks justified as The Trade Desk now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 31 based on adjusted earnings, which seems like a fair price now that its growth prospects are in doubt.",https://www.fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/08/why-the-trade-desk-stock-tumbled-today/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/why-the-trade-desk-stock-tumbled-today-20250808.jpg
