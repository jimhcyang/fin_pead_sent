    "text": "Nvidia Corporation NVDA shares fell notably in overnight Robinhood trading on Sunday as China's DeepSeek unveiled an AI model that reportedly offers cutting-edge performance at a fraction of the cost. This development has sparked doubts about the need for massive GPU investments. What Happened: DeepSeek, backed by Chinese quant firm High-Flyer, launched its R1 language model (LLM) as open source last week. It also published a technical report asserting that advanced AI systems can be developed on substantially smaller budgets. 🚀 DeepSeek-R1 is here!⚡ Performance on par with OpenAI-o1📖 Fully open-source model & technical report🏆 MIT licensed: Distill & commercialize freely!🌐 Website & API are live now! Try DeepThink at https://t.co/v1TFy7LHNy today!🐋 1/n pic.twitter.com/7BlpWAPu6y What stands out is DeepSeek's ability to achieve competitive results with less funding and technology compared to industry leaders like OpenAI, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, and Alphabet Inc. GOOG GOOGL. DeepSeek reportedly used roughly 50,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs. However, the extent of this hardware usage remains unclear. See Also: Jeff Bezos-Backed Perplexity Revises TikTok Merger Deal, Proposes Giving US Government 50% Stake: Report Over the weekend, DeepSeek's R1 model became a sensation on social media with several tech experts reacting to the company and its model. Here are some reactions: Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya took to X, formerly Twitter, and highlighted a report written by Jeffrey Emanuel, the founder of YouTube transcript optimizer. He underscored a portion of the report that detailed how DeepSeek essentially cracked one of the holy grails of AI: step-by-step reasoning without massive datasets. This report is long but very good. \"With R1, DeepSeek essentially cracked one of the holy grails of AI: getting models to reason step-by-step without relying on massive supervised datasets. Their DeepSeek-R1-Zero experiment showed something remarkable: using pure reinforcement… 28-year-old Alexandr Wang, who is the CEO of Scale AI and has made history as the youngest self-made billionaire in the world, also took to X and said, \"DeepSeek is a wake-up call for America.\" Wang stated that the U.S. must focus on out-innovating and accelerating progress while strengthening chip export controls to maintain its lead. DeepSeek is a wake up call for America, but it doesn't change the strategy:– USA must out-innovate &race faster, as we have done in the entire history of AI– Tighten export controls on chips so that we can maintain future leadsEvery major breakthrough in AI has been American Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. AI engineer Shubham Sahoo highlighted that DeepSeek R1 is open-source and 96.4% more affordable than OpenAI's o1 model, offering comparable performance.

    "text": "Vice President JD Vance, who was backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, has voiced his concerns about the influence of big tech companies, asserting that these companies wield “too much power.” What Happened: Speaking on “Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan” on Saturday, Vance was asked about the prominent presence of tech leaders at Donald Trump’s inauguration. This included names like Meta Platforms, Inc.’s META Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com, Inc.’s AMZN Jeff Bezos, Tesla Inc.’s TSLA Elon Musk, Apple Inc.’s AAPL Tim Cook, and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG GOOGL Sundar Pichai. To illustrate his point, the Vice President noted that the tech leaders did not receive preferential seating over his mother or other supporters. “We believe fundamentally that big tech does have too much power.” See Also: Nvidia Stock Slides Overnight On Robinhood As China’s DeepSeek Sparks Doubts Over GPU Spending Frenzy — Chamath Palihapitiya Highlights Report Indicating AI Holy Grail Cracked He stressed the importance of tech companies respecting constitutional rights and halting censorship and cautioned that Trump’s administration would not look kindly on non-compliance. Why It Matters: The tech sector played a crucial role in Trump’s 2024 election victory, with Musk investing significantly in support of Trump and other Republicans. Trump appointed Musk to lead a new agency focused on reducing federal spending. Other tech leaders also engaged with Trump, visiting Mar-a-Lago before the inauguration. Vance has been vocal about his desire to break up large tech companies, particularly Google's parent company Alphabet. Interestingly, the Vice President had a powerful Silicon Valley backer in the share of Thiel who has also funded his 2022 Ohio campaign with $15 million. Image via Shutterstock",

Meta's Q4 results and commentary lead us to believe there is more upside potential for its ad revenue growth, particularly with the use of AI. The lighter Q1 guide does trigger some concern, but we'd prefer a conservative outlook with green shoots, as we expect it makes Meta better positioned to outperform expectations in FY25.",
