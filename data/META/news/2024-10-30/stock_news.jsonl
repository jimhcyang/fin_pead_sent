(NASDAQ: META) is now a household name because of the foundational success it experienced in social media. But it has been over a decade since its IPO on May 18, 2012, As the only company in the ‘Magnificent Seven’ that has yet to undergo a stock split, an investor who purchased $1000.00 worth of META stock on the day it went public at $38.00 per share would now be sitting on an investment worth $15318.16, good for a gain of 1431.82%. But since its IPO date, a lot has changed. For starters, on Feb. 1, 2024, the company announced — alongside authorizing a $50 billion stock buyback — that shares of META would begin paying a dividend. And while its current yield of 0.34% may not seem like much, at its current price, that equates to $0.50 per share quarterly, or $2.00 per share annualized. META is the dominant player in the social media landscape but it is now branching out more broadly into tech, and specifically, the artificial intelligence (AI) space. It is the latter that the company is most heavily investing in now, and for that reason, it is also the primary driver of 24/7 Wall Street price predictions and forecasts for 2025-2030. Key Points in This Article: “Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,” according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. 24/7 Wall Street projects a 70.94% upside potential for the stock through the end of the decade.

The report includes a complete industry map of AI investments that includes many small caps. Recent Meta Stock Updates and News 11/12/2024 Despite an overall negative trading day, Meta saw a slight uptick of 0.28% today, ending a two-day losing streak. 11/11/2024 Meta has announced a partnership with 13 universities in the U.S. and U.K. to bring virtual reality (VR) into classrooms. This new initiative, called “Meta for Education beta”, aims to test new VR and XR products, make learning more immersive and engaging, and make the company’s VR more mainstream. 11/8/2024 A federal judge has ruled that Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, is not personally responsible for lawsuits accusing the company of harming children through addictive social media platforms. The judge dismissed claims that Zuckerberg knowingly concealed the mental health risks associated with using Facebook and Instagram. While the judge’s decision exonerates Zuckerberg from personal liability, it doesn’t affect the lawsuits made against Meta itself. 11/7/2024 Meta experienced a 2.7% increase in its share price today, trading as high as $587.77. Trading volume was significantly lower than average, with only 3.7 million shares changing hands. 11/6/2024 Meta has adjusted its policy regarding the use of its AI model, Llama. The company has now granted access to U.S. national security agencies and defense contractors. 11/5/2024 Meta is now facing a $15.6 million fine from the South Korean Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) for sharing user data with advertisers. The PIPC is accusing Meta of sharing the sensitive personal information of 980,000 South Korean Facebook users with 4,000 advertisers, violating the country’s privacy laws. 11/4/2024 Meta’s recent attempt to secure additional nuclear power has been rejected.

The primary driver of that growth over the past 10 years has been ad space for the company’s social media platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Reel, and WhatsApp, among others. While Meta Platforms has branched out into augmented reality and virtual reality — a business segment it refers to as Reality Labs — 99% of its revenue generation comes from its Family of Apps business segment, as of year-end 2023. But as the company looks to the second half of the decade, Zuckerberg and the company will focus on a few key focus areas that will have a large impact on Meta Platforms’ stock performance. Key Drivers of Meta Platforms’ Stock Performance AI Investment: Founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta Platforms “released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we’re driving good growth across our apps.” While the market for Meta’s social media advertising remains healthy and continues to drive the majority of the company’s revenue, it is focusing heavily on AI investments to expand through the end of the decade. Price-per-ad revenue saw a 10% year-over-year gain, and that success will fund its AI spending aimed at future growth. The company said shareholders should expect between $37 billion and $40 billion in capital expenditures this year that will fund a data center capable of powering its AI initiatives. That is likely to continue into next year, with CFO Susan Li stating that the META expects “significant capital expenditure growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence research and product development efforts.” Continued Renewable Energy Development: According to the company’s net zero plan, which it is aiming to achieve by 2030, “Since 2020, Meta’s global operations have been supported by 100% renewable energy. As of 2023, we have 10,000MW of contracted renewable energy across 6 countries.” As part of its net zero plan, Meta Platforms’ reliance on renewable energy will ultimately decrease the cost of its utility expenses, and ultimately, its carbon footprint through contracted and self-employed green technologies. Renewables already cost less than fossil fuel energy sources, and according to Canary Media, “By 2030, technology improvements could slash today’s prices by a quarter for wind and by half for solar.” The company has announced that its goal for its forthcoming data center is that it is 100% sustainable and net zero. Focusing on Growing Free Cash Flow: Zuckerberg coined the 2023 Meta Platforms “year of efficiency,” and their results were staggering. By year-end, the company recorded a record free cash flow of $43 billion. That is up from $21 billion in 2019, marking a nearly 105% increase in its cash position in four years. Meta’s free cash flow TTM stands at $49.74, showing that its focus on its bottom line is driving decisions from the top down and has increasingly strong results. Meta Platforms (META) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus one-year price target for Meta Platforms is $597.50, which represents a 2.59% upside potential from today’s share price of $582.43.
