Following the release of Meta's 3Q results on Wednesday, Oppenheimer analysts rate the stock 'Outperform' but lowered their 12 to 18-month price target from $190 to $140 due to the company's much higher investments in Facebook Reality Labs and its conservative 2023 operating expenses (opex) guidance which assumes 18 x 23E GAAP earnings per share excluding real estate consolidation expenses.  Meta stock plunged almost 24% in after-hours trading overnight, falling to about $98.90 per share shortly before the market opened on Thursday.",
