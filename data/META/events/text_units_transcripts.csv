META,2021-01-27,2021-01-28,,2021-01-27,2021-01-27T17:00:00-05:00,0,2021-01-27,prepared,,Mark Zuckerberg,"All right. Thanks everyone for joining us today. I hope you are all staying healthy and well. Our community and business had a strong end of the year. As COVID continued to keep many of us apart and at home, people and businesses continued relying on our services to stay in touch and create economic opportunities. 2.6 billion people now use one or more of our apps each day; and more than 200 million businesses, mostly small businesses use our free tools to reach customers. Those numbers give a sense of scale, but some of the stories we hear show the impact. Groups have formed where COVID long-haulers are helping each other through the scary experience where there’s not much else to turn to. Teachers are sending class assignments to students through WhatsApp. Local bookstores and coffee shops are using Instagram to let customers know they’re open for curbside pickup. We saw people come together to raise $1.8 billion for nonprofits and personal causes through our fundraising tools last year, including $175 million for COVID-related causes alone. I’m proud of the role that our services played in helping people support each other during what has been such a hard time. Now, I’ve spent a fair amount of time on recent earnings calls talking about our election integrity efforts. So, I’m not going to discuss them at length today, but I do want to call out that according to our estimates, we easily surpassed our goal to help 4 million people register to vote as part of the largest ever effort -- largest effort to distribute authoritative voting information in recent history, and I want to thank everyone involved in our teams and outside, involved with that effort. So, today, I’m going to focus on our product work, and specifically I’m going to focus on four themes that I’m excited about for the year ahead: communities; private messaging; commerce tools for small businesses; and building the next computing platform. So, let’s start with communities. Now, I think that helping people build communities is one of the most important things that we can do. Our social fabric is made of multiple different layers through which we get our social support. First, we have friends and family, and that’s the most personal layer. Then, we have communities we’re a part of where we feel a sense of purpose and belonging, explore interests, develop skills, grow as individuals, and then meet new people. And then, finally, there’s the safety net that society and government provide. And in many parts of the world, there’s been an unfortunate decline in community participation over the last several decades. It’s that second layer, and this isn’t something that we can solve alone, but I think we can help. So, now that we’ve helped billions of people stay connected with friends and family, helping everyone find and participate in communities that are meaningful to them has been our next goal. And we even updated our mission a few years ago to reflect this, making it, give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Today, more than 600 million people are now members of a group on Facebook that they consider to be meaningful in their lives. This has grown steadily over time. And I hear all the time from people who are in parenting groups that there are major resources to navigate raising kids or from people who found a group that shares the same health condition, and they can lean on that community for knowledge and support, or from people who’ve moved to a new place and joined local groups to meet people and get situated. Our product focus now is to develop this community infrastructure beyond that feeds and message boards to help people build and run full self-sustaining community institutions. So, we’re building tools to help groups get things done together and provide support for people that span messaging, video chat, and even communities’ own websites. And we’re exploring different ways to raise funds, including donations, merchandise, and membership fees to help group leaders support their communities’ operations and hire people for different roles that are needed to build sustainable communities for the long term. So, as we continue to focus on this, we need to make sure that the communities that people connect with are healthy and positive. And that’s something that we’ve been focused on for a while now. One way, of course, that we do this is by taking down groups that break our rules against things like violence or hate speech. And in September, we shared that we had removed more than 1 million groups in the last year alone. But there are also a lot of groups that we may not want to encourage people to join even if they don’t violate our policies. So, for example, we stopped recommending civic and political groups in the U.S. ahead of the elections. And we’re continuing to fine tune how this works, but now we plan to keep civic and political groups out of recommendations for the long term, and we plan to extend that policy globally. And to be clear, this is a continuation of work we’ve been doing for a while to turn down the temperature and discourage divisive conversation and communities. Now, along these same lines, we’re also currently considering steps that we can take to reduce the amount of political content in News Feed as well. We’re still working through exactly the best ways to do this. And to be clear, of course, we’re still going to enable people to engage in political groups and discussions, if they want to. These can often be important and helpful, and there can be ways that people organize grassroots movements or speaking out against injustice, or learn from people with different perspectives. So, we want these discussions to be able to keep happening, but one of the top pieces of feedback that we are hearing from our community right now is that people don’t want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services. So, one theme for this year is that we’re going to continue to focus on helping millions of more people participate in healthy communities, and we’re going to focus even more on being a force for bringing people closer together. Next, let’s talk about private messaging. As we’ve discussed before, while people enjoy connecting with friends and communities in the digital equivalent of a town square in apps like Facebook and Instagram, the fastest growing social experiences are about connecting privately in the digital equivalent of a living room in services like WhatsApp and Messenger. So, that’s why we kicked off a big effort a couple of years ago to re-imagine what a modern social platform would look like if you build it from the bottom up to be privacy first, and we identified several core principles. A private social platform should be built around the most intimate interactions that we have, and that’s one-on-one conversation. The most important aspect of privacy and security is that your conversations should stay between you. And that means that your conversations should always be end-to-end encrypted and they should disappear when you’re done with them. Safety and reducing spam matter too, and that means that we should maintain a minimum amount of metadata to build sophisticated tools to stop bad actors using these services. And you should have choice over what services you use. So, we should make messaging as interoperable as possible across our apps. And finally, no matter what, we should only store people’s data in countries where we know we can keep it secure, and we should continue opposing data localization in countries with weak records on human rights or privacy. Now, I think that these are the privacy principles that matter most to people. First and foremost, people care if their conversations stay private, but after that, people also care about safety and other convenience too. And from this perspective, WhatsApp and the direction that we’re heading in with Messenger are the best private social apps available. Now, we have a lot of competitors who make claims about privacy that are often misleading. Apple recently released so called Nutrition Labels, which focus largely on metadata that apps collect, rather than the privacy and security of people’s actual messages. But, iMessage stores non-end-to-end encrypted backups of your messages by default, unless you disable iCloud. So, Apple and governments have the ability to access most people’s messages. So, when it comes to what matters most, protecting people’s messages, I think that WhatsApp is clearly superior. Now, since I try to use these earnings calls to discuss aspects of business strategies that I think are important for investors to understand, I do want to highlight that we increasingly see Apple as one of our biggest competitors, iMessage is a key linchpin of their ecosystem, it comes pre-installed on every iPhone, and they’ve preference it with private APIs and permissions, which is why iMessage is the most used messaging service in the U.S. And now, we are also seeing Apple’s business depend more and more on gaining share in apps and services against us and other developers. So, Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own. And this impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world, including with the upcoming iOS 14 changes, many small businesses will no longer be able to reach their customers with targeted ads. Now, Apple may say that they’re doing this to help people, but the moves clearly track their competitive interests. And I think that this dynamic is important for people to understand because we and others are going to be up against this for the foreseeable future. Now, our messaging services continue growing, but it is an uphill battle, and our services just need to be that much better as private social platforms to succeed. So, to make sure that we remain the best, a couple of years back, we kicked off a number of long-term efforts that have started shipping recently, and more of these projects around strengthening encryption, ephemerality, interoperability, and offering other tools are going to be shipping throughout this year. All right. So, now, let’s talk about commerce. Our goal here is to give every individual, entrepreneur and small business access to the same kinds of tools that historically only the big companies have had access to. And we’ve always cared about this, but the pandemic has made it more urgent. So, it used to be the case that only large companies could afford to have analytics or targeted advertising capacity to reach their customers. And it was expensive to build these capabilities and it often required building teams and storing large amounts of data in-house which most small businesses can’t do. And so, one of the things that I’m most proud of is that we build the tools so we can offer these same capabilities to small businesses often for free. So, when you hear people say that we hold a lot of data, that’s because hundreds of millions of businesses that would have otherwise had to do this individually and would have had no easy way of doing so are now using our services to help them reach customers. And when you hear people say that we’re connecting data from lots of sources, that’s to help small businesses reach customers more efficiently. Now, big companies often do this themselves, but small businesses can’t, a lot of times. So, we do this for them. So, when you hear people argue that we shouldn’t be doing these things or that we should go back to the old days of untargeted television ads, I think that what they’re really arguing for is a regression where only the largest companies have this capacity, small businesses are severely disadvantaged and competition is diminished. So, with our commerce tools, we’ve made it so that a business can set up a shop once, and then they will have an online storefront in both, Facebook and Instagram immediately, and eventually on WhatsApp and Messenger as well. And we recently expanded Checkout to all U.S. businesses, making the process of buying a lot more seamless. And as the lockdowns have continued, we saw more businesses, more small businesses and creators also use Paid Online Events as a way to make money. WhatsApp is also an important part of our strategy here. More than 175 million people message a WhatsApp business account every day, and we’re building new features to make it even easier to transact with businesses in the app. We introduced Carts which lets people grab catalogs, select multiple products and send the order as a message to a business. And, the more people that interact with businesses, the better tools that we’re going to need to provide for businesses to help them support their customers. And many businesses need more than a phone to manage their customer service. So, we’re building tools to let businesses store and manage their WhatsApp chats using our secure hosting infrastructure, if they would like. And we’re in the process of updating WhatsApp’s privacy policy in terms of service to reflect these optional experiences. Now, to clarify some confusion that we’ve seen. This update does not change the privacy of anyone’s messages with friends and family. All of these messages are end-to-end encrypted, which means we can’t see or hear what you say, and we never will, unless the person that you message chooses to share it. And business messages will only be hosted on our infrastructure, if the business chooses to do so. So, we want everyone to know the lengths that we go to, to protect your private messages. So, we are moving the date of this update back to give everyone time to understand what the update means. Finally, let’s discuss our work building the next computing platform. This is one of the areas that I’m most excited about our progress, heading into 2021. If you look at the history of computing, every 15 years or so, a new major platform emerges that integrates the technology more naturally and ubiquitously into our lives, starting with mainframes and PCs and browser-based computing, and then mobile. And I believe that the next logical step here is an immersive computing platform that just delivers this magical sense of presence that you’re really there with another person or in another place. Our phones can’t deliver this and neither can any other technology that has come before it. This is going to unlock the types of social experiences that I dreamed about building since I was a kid. And it’s what we’re building towards at Facebook Reality Labs. We launched Quest 2 in October and it is on track to be the first mainstream virtual reality headset. We designed it so that anyone could jump in with the best and most immersive experience out there, and at a price that makes it available through as many people as possible. And I think that Facebook has done more than any other company to help to bring virtual reality to the mainstream. And it’s been great to see so many people embrace this, especially this year, during the pandemic. We’re seeing people use it to play games with friends when they can’t be together in-person, to do workouts in their living room or to meet with colleagues while they’re working from home. So, there is a lot of reasons, the Quest 2 was one of the hot holiday gifts this year. We’re also seeing a growing ecosystem of developers, building amazing new experiences for the platform. Right now, more than 60 Oculus developers are generating revenue in the millions, and that’s nearly twice as many as a few months ago. In previous quarters, I’ve talked about our long-term future goals when it comes to virtual reality, but I think that this quarter’s results show that this future is here. Augmented reality glasses are going to be a key part of this vision too. We’re still working on some of the foundational technology to underpin these, and the ultimate product is still some years away. But this year, we are excited to deliver a first glimpse of what it will be, when we launched our first pair of smart glasses from Ray-Ban, in partnership with Luxottica. And during this pandemic, we’ve also seen Portal has proven to be a great way for people to stay connected, especially over the holiday, as families had to celebrate apart. This year, we’re focused on expanding the role of a Portal and virtual reality presence into the workplace, bringing more features that can improve remote presence, collaboration and productivity. 2021 has a lot of unknowns. We don’t know when vaccines are going to be widely available, when our teams will be back in the office, or when our lives are going to start feeling normal again. But, what I do know is that we are going to keep investing in and innovating on the big themes that I discussed here, in order to put more power in the hands of people and small businesses. I personally believe that technology can unlock progress and opportunity, and that the full story of the internet has not yet been written. That’s why I’m hopeful for the year ahead and grateful that you’re all in this journey with us. And now, here is Sheryl, to talk about our business."
META,2021-01-27,2021-01-28,,2021-01-27,2021-01-27T17:00:00-05:00,0,2021-01-27,prepared,,Sheryl Sandberg,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. Like Mark, I hope everyone is safe and healthy. This was a strong quarter for our business as the acceleration of online commerce we’ve seen during the pandemic continued into the holiday season. Our total revenue for Q4 was $28.1 billion, which is a 33% year-over-year increase, our fastest growth rate in over two years. After a really difficult year for so many businesses, this holiday period was important. And while many businesses are still struggling, the good news is that Q4 was stronger than expected for retail. In the U.S., the National Retail Federation reported that sales in November and December went up 8% year-over-year and online sales were up 24%. This holiday period was also longer. Compared to previous years, advertisers started spending earlier and sustained that spend well beyond Black Friday and Cyber Monday. We saw robust performance across all regions as well as an improvement in brand advertising. The strength of our Q4 performance is a result of years of investments in free and paid tools to help businesses succeed online. Even before the pandemic, businesses were going digital, but COVID made this a necessity. Almost overnight, businesses had to create digital storefronts, figure out how to take online orders and find new ways to reach their customers. For many small companies, these steps, or even just setting up a website or a mobile app can be difficult and expensive. Our free and paid tools help solve these problems for businesses around the world. With so many businesses struggling when the pandemic hit, we asked our teams what do businesses need and how can we help? First, they need the tools to get their business up and running online. So, what can we do to make ours simpler and more effective, and can we build new ones to help them. Second, they need the digital skills and knowhow to succeed. So, how can we help more businesses with training and resources? And third, they need their voices to be heard. So, can we use our scale to amplify their voices and tell their stories? We’ve been asking these questions throughout the last year and into Q4. On the first, we accelerated our work on tools to make it easier for people to find brands and products they love and for businesses to manage their online presence and connect with customers. Mark talked about some of the new tools we’ve launched like Shops and Paid Online Events. In the fall, we also rolled out Facebook Business Suite, a new interface to help businesses manage their pages or profiles across our apps. We also continued to invest in making our products as effective as possible, so businesses can get more value for every dollar they spend. Personalized ads are privacy safe and help businesses reach customers where they are, which has been more important than ever during the pandemic. One notable area of progress this past year was in Stories ads, which have become more effective for direct response advertisers. One business that used Stories ads is Carlota Flower Lab, a florist in Los Reyes, Mexico. Before COVID, they made 70% of their revenue from face-to-face workshops. So, when the pandemic hit, founder, Paola Mendoza had to get creative. She used personalized ads on Instagram to reach new audiences and even found her first international customers with campaigns targeting California and Texas. One campaign for Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead, in November, led to a 24 times return on ad spend, helping Paola triple her annual revenue in 2020, despite COVID. On the second, resources and training, we did some big things in 2020. We created a business resource hub, a one-stop shop for resources and trainings for small businesses that we’ve continued to build out through the end of the year. We committed to reach 1 million members of the black community and 1 million members of the Latinx and Hispanic communities in the U.S. with free digital skills trainings through our Elevate program by 2023. And we reimagined our Boost with Facebook events to reach businesses virtually with 100 million people tuning in throughout the year. This included our 12-week Season of Support to help businesses across 16 countries prepare for the holidays. On the third, a great example of how we amplified the voices of our businesses in Q4 is our BuyBlack Friday campaign, one of my favorite campaigns ever. In the U.S. black-owned businesses closed at twice the rate of others after the start of the pandemic, so we wanted to help people shop with them over the holidays. We created ways for people to find black businesses in their local area, a gift side featuring products from black businesses across the U.S. and even a BuyBlack Friday show on Facebook live that was seen by 15 million people. One of the small businesses we featured is a vegan skincare brand called Redoux from New York City. Its founder Asia Grant appeared on the BuyBlack Friday show, and that became one of her most successful sales days ever. The campaign gave her record revenue and web traffic, and she was even able to hire more people, something that’s so important, given current unemployment rates. Business owners like Asia and Paola have worked hard to adapt and grow online, but lots of businesses will continue to struggle in 2021. So, we’re going to keep listening to them and building on what we did last year. That means improving our products and tools to help businesses seamlessly manage their online presence, advertise across our apps and communicate with customers through business messaging. It means making more training available through programs like She Means Business for women and Elevate for diverse communities. And it means finding more ways to amplify their voices, whether it’s sharing the stories of small businesses worried that Apple’s iOS 14 changes will hurt their ability to reach customers or showcasing small businesses and gift guides and products, like businesses nearby. I want to close by saying how grateful I am to all the businesses around the world who work with us. Your partnership helps us build the tools you need so you can continue to grow and hire. And as always, I’m grateful to our incredible teams who have done so much to help businesses survive this difficult year, including coming up with great ideas like BuyBlack Friday. I hope that 2021 is a better year for everyone. Now, here’s Dave."
META,2021-01-27,2021-01-28,,2021-01-27,2021-01-27T17:00:00-05:00,0,2021-01-27,prepared,,Dave Wehner,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was a strong quarter, capping off a solid year for our business as full year 2020 revenue grew 22% to $86 billion. We have been encouraged to see improved demand for our ads during the second half of the year after facing significant headwinds at the onset of the pandemic. Our results reflect the ongoing strength in the digital economy and the value we’re providing to millions of businesses who use our services to reach consumers and generate sales. Let’s begin with our community metrics. In December, we estimate that approximately 2.6 billion people used at least one of our services on a daily basis and that approximately 3.3 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. Facebook daily active users reached 1.84 billion, up 11% or 188 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 66% of the 2.8 billion monthly active users in December. MAUs grew 299 million or 12% compared to last year. Consistent with our outlook, U.S. and Canada DAU declined 1 million sequentially as usage continued to normalize from peak COVID levels experienced earlier in the year. Turning to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q4 total revenue was $28.1 billion, up 33% or 32% on a constant currency basis. We benefited from a currency tailwind, and had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q4 of last year, total revenue would have been $339 million lower. Q4 ad revenue was $27.2 billion, up 31% or 30% on a constant currency basis. The growth in advertising revenue was largely driven by a strong holiday shopping season for retail, which benefited from the ongoing shift to online commerce. On a user geography basis, ad revenue was strongest in Europe, which grew 35% and benefited from currency tailwinds; U.S. and Canada grew 31%; and Asia Pacific grew 29%. Rest of world growth improved to 25%, but continues to be significantly impacted by currency headwinds. In Q4, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 25%, and the average price per ad increased 5%. Impression growth was driven by both, Facebook and Instagram. The increase in average price per ad was driven primarily by Facebook mobile feed as well as pricing improvement in Instagram Stories. Other revenue was $885 million, up 156% due to strong Quest 2 holiday sales. We’ve been encouraged by the positive reception of Quest 2 since its October launch. Turning now to expenses. Q4 total expenses were $15.3 billion, up 25% compared to last year. In terms of specific line items, cost of revenue increased 49%, driven primarily by hardware costs related to Quest 2 sales, core infrastructure investments and payments to partners. R&D increased 34%, driven primarily by hiring and investments in core products as well as our consumer hardware efforts. Marketing and sales increased 8%, driven by hiring and marketing spend. Lastly, G&A expenses decreased 13% as we lapped charges related to the BIPA legal settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019. In the past year, we added a record 13,600 net employees and reached our goal of adding 10,000 employees in tech and product roles. We ended the year with over 58,600 full-time employees, up 30% compared to last year. We continue to be pleased with our ability to recruit, onboard and retain talent in this environment. Fourth quarter operating income was $12.8 billion, representing a 46% operating margin. Our tax rate was 14%. Net income was $11.2 billion or $3.88 per share. Capital expenditures were $4.8 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office facilities and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $9.2 billion, and we ended the quarter with $62 billion in cash and marketable securities. For the full year, we repurchased $6.3 billion of our Class A common stock and had $8.6 billion remaining in our prior authorization as of December 31st. Today, we announced a $25 billion increase in our stock repurchase authorization. Turning now to the outlook. We continue to face significant uncertainty as we manage through a number of crosscurrents in 2021. We believe our business has benefited from two broad economic trends playing out during the pandemic. The first is the ongoing shift to online commerce; the second is the shift in consumer demand towards products and away from services. We believe these shifts provided a tailwind to our advertising business in the second half of 2020, given our strength in product verticals sold via online commerce and our lower exposure to service verticals, like travel. Looking forward, a moderation or reversal in one or both of these trends could serve as a headwind to our advertising revenue growth. At the same time, in the first half of 2021, we will be lapping a period of growth that was negatively impacted by reduced advertising demand during the early stages of the pandemic. As a result, we expect year-over-year growth rates in total revenue to remain stable or modestly accelerate sequentially in the first and second quarters of 2021. In the second half of the year, we will lap periods of increasingly strong growth, which will significantly pressure year-over-year growth rates. We also expect to face more significant ad targeting headwinds in 2021. This includes the impact of platform changes, notably iOS 14, as well as the evolving regulatory landscape. While the timing of the iOS 14 changes remains uncertain, we would expect to see an impact beginning late in the first quarter. There is also continuing uncertainty around the viability of transatlantic data transfers in light of recent European regulatory developments. And like other companies in our industry, we are closely monitoring the potential impact on our European operations as these developments progress. Turning now to expenses. We expect 2021 total expenses to be in the range of $68 billion to $73 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. This is driven by investments in technical and product talent as well as continued growth in infrastructure costs. We continue to expect 2021 capital expenditures to be in the range of $21 billion to $23 billion, driven by data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. Our outlook includes spend that was delayed from 2020, due to the impact of the pandemic on our construction efforts. Turning now to tax. We continue to expect our full year 2021 tax rates to be in the high teens. In closing, 2020 was a unique operating environment that introduced a number of unforeseen challenges. We’ve been pleased with our team’s ability to adapt in order to maintain the reliability of our services, deliver new products and experiences, and support the millions of businesses who use our platforms to reach consumers. With that, Mike, let’s open up the call for questions."

META,2021-01-27,2021-01-28,,2021-01-27,2021-01-27T17:00:00-05:00,0,2021-01-27,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, for either Mark or Sheryl, I appreciate the color on commerce. I was curious as for any encouraging, quantifiable signposts or learnings that you’ve seen so far in Instagram Shopping that sort of gives you confidence you’re making progress in building out this opportunity. And then the second one, Dave, I appreciate the comment on the forward outlook and the outlook commentary. I guess, the question is you sort of talked about this shift to consumer expenditure toward products away from services that could potentially be a headwind in the back half as it reverses. I think, last quarter, you mentioned you had 10 million advertisers. So, maybe talk to us about sort of some of the segments of advertisers you think that you’re missing, and what initiatives do you have in place to sort of broaden the advertiser base to bring more services on the platform. Thanks."
META,2021-01-27,2021-01-28,,2021-01-27,2021-01-27T17:00:00-05:00,0,2021-01-27,qa,,Sheryl Sandberg,"I can take the first. With Instagram Shopping, we launched a new shop tab on Instagram in Q4, and this is built on other shopping efforts we’ve had. We see this as an overall part of our commerce effort. We’ve always been, I think, a great place for people to discover new products and services, but we are very interested in taking people all the way down that funnel from discovery to purchase to finding products and services to checking out as well. And, our shopping efforts are part of that. We’re seeing nice uptick. It’s still really early days, but we think businesses are having a good experience and people are having a good experience. And as always, with our ad products and with our commerce products, we want to make sure we provide a great experience to the end user, so that they can find the things they’re looking for."

Yes, the data that we’ve looked at there really is that when you look at the data from the U.S. BEA, it basically showed that in Q3, while the services consumer spend was still down year over year spending on goods actually surged to record levels or the highest in like 15 years. We don’t have the results for Q4, but we expect that sort of trend continued. If you look at the balance of our business, it tends to skew more towards products relative to the overall GDP -- or the overall consumer spend in, for instance, the U.S. So, we just think we’re overall exposed a little bit more to products. We continue to invest to improve our exposure and travel -- sorry, in service areas like travel. But, our expectation would be in 2021, we’ll continue to have a similar skew towards products as we’ve had in the past. So, we’ll continue to make investments to make our ad products more relevant for services as well."

Just curious how you’re thinking about Facebook’s ability now to offset some of the impact just through things like limited login mode and new APIs and other conversion tools and data. And then, if you could just talk a little bit more about how you’re thinking about the impact across fan and then the core products. Thanks."

We continue to believe that that will be a headwind in the ads business. It’s in our view, not just limited to IDFA, but broader than that is we’re going to have to be providing a prompt asking people for permission to use third-party data to deliver personalized ads. So, that’s going to be true whether you’re using IDFA or not, and we do expect there to be high opt out rates related to that, and that’s factored into our outlook. We expect that to roll out sometime -- we expect later in Q1. But, the timing is uncertain, and Apple hasn’t given clarity on that at this point. And we do expect that will have increasing impact through the year as more users adopt iOS 14 and go through those permissions. When you think about what the mitigations might be, obviously there is going to be mitigation of the impact on us to some extent just because this is a platform-wide change, and so it will impact everyone. And so, that’s going to mitigate it to some extent. And in addition, over time, we hope to help businesses by providing more on-site conversion opportunities through initiatives like shops and also click to messaging ads. As it relates to specifically the audience network products, obviously that’s going to have a significant impact on audience network on iOS as we have explained in the past. But, it’s -- but the broader impact, given the size of that business is really to our -- to the core advertising business on iOS."

Mark, just coming back to your comments, what do you see as some of the key investments either on the hardware side or the content and application side to unlock the opportunity based on what you recently saw with the success of Oculus in the holiday period, where there’s a piece of hardware obviously that’s sold through quite well. And how do you think about aligning investments against the opportunity in the coming years? And then, maybe -- I don’t know if it’s for Sheryl or Dave, but maybe I could just follow up a little bit on Doug’s question. When you think out to the language you’re using about the back half of the year, is there any sense you can give us quantitatively about how to think about some of the tougher comps you’ll see as we move through ‘21 versus identifying the degree or the severity of different outcomes from some of the headwinds?"

So, when we started working on virtual and augmented reality, we basically laid out a path where we knew that virtual reality would be practical to build first. And we view that that -- that it’s kind of all part of one continuous ecosystem for spatial, immersive, computing and presence. So, the key things that we’re trying to do with VR now, I do believe that Quest 2 is the first mainstream virtual reality product that is doing quite well, and I’m really proud of what we’ve been able to do there. The goal there is, we keep on shipping content and titles and working with developers and shipping new capabilities to the device. Like last year, we shipped the ability to do now hand tracking, which no one expected to be possible yet, but the team working on that did some really great work. And it just made the device better and increased the value. So, we’re continuing to work on new hardware as well. The new hardware will kind of fit the same platform. So, the content that works on Quest 2 should be forward compatible. And so that way we’re going to build one kind of larger installed base around the virtual reality headsets that we have. And at the same time, we’re building towards a future with some of this -- the fundamental technology investments that we’re making to be able to provide augmented reality glasses that hopefully will be able to support a lot of the same content in this ecosystem over time and take advantage of a lot of these foundational investments that we’ve made. So, this continues to be a long-term investment. I think, it’s very important, both for the vision of what we want to do, like I said in my script before -- earlier, it’s just -- some of the things that we’re going to be able to build with VR and AR are the types of social experiences that I wanted to build since I was a kid, and I’m excited to be able to unlock that. And I also think strategically, it’s important for us to have a little more control of our own destiny in terms of the operating systems and platforms that all of our services operate on. So, continue to be very-focused on this and optimistic about what we’re seeing."

I think, the context is, we have this -- we’ve had a tremendously strong quarter, Q4 of this year. A number of factors we talked about driving that. A couple of are pandemic related, which is just the shift to online commerce as well as the ongoing -- the shift to more spend on products versus services. In Q4, we also saw strength with sort of our full range of advertisers. We have seen sort of small and medium-sized businesses come back and start getting strength in Q2 and Q3 or Q3 specifically, and then, Q4, we also saw strength from some of our largest advertisers as well. So, as you look out in 2021, I think, we’re just going to be facing tougher comps in the back half of the year. Some of those things related to the pandemic had the potential to revert, whether it’s more consumer expenditure shifting towards services away from products. So, that will make it a little bit of a tougher comp. And then, you layer on top of that headwind to growth related to privacy-related headwinds. The biggest factor there is iOS 14. So, we certainly anticipate growth, but we’re just looking at tougher comps as we hit the back half of the year, given really, most importantly, the strength that we saw this year. And then, on top of that the headwinds that we’re seeing from some of the privacy changes."

First, Mark, in your prepared remarks, you elevated a little bit competition with Apple. Is there anything going on with iOS 14 besides IDFA that maybe puts you in more direct competition with Apple?

And with the exception of the work that we’re doing on communities, which I think is quite separate from the work that they do, the other three areas I think are going to have very significant competitive overlap with Apple. In messaging, certainly, iMessage is the most popular service in the U.S. I think because of the fact that they pre install it and give their app several advantages that other apps don’t have. In commerce and supporting small businesses, I think there, you have some of the iOS 14 changes that we think are going to be very problematic, especially for small businesses. And then, longer term, as we move towards building the next computing platform, I think we would expect to see them as more of a competitor there as well. So, I do think that this is sort of shaping up that -- we face many competitors, right? There are a lot of competitors in the core social app work that we do [Technical Difficulty]"

I mean, on regulation overall, because I think some of the question was focused on that, the point that I would highlight is, I actually think it would be very helpful to us, and the internet sector overall, for there to be clearer rules and expectations on some of these social issues around how content should be handled, or on how elections should be handled, around what privacy norms governments want to see in place. Because these questions all have trade-offs. All the content and elections content and elections questions have trade-offs between giving people free expression and a voice but some, there trade-offs again safety and privacy and other social equities, they’re all very important. And it’s I think very difficult for a private company to balance those. And I think, it would be much better to have just a clearer guidance and clearer rules for the internet.

This is the first quarter in a long time that price I think was up year-on-year. I know, there’s a lot of factors that go into that.

So, I mean, as you know, with the auction dynamic, the growth in pricing is -- does really depend on impression growth. And we saw impression growth slow this quarter to 25% from the Q3 rate of 35%. And some of that is just due to lapping product optimizations on Instagram during Q4 of ‘19 as well as just the normalization of engagement trends on Facebook. And so, we would expect that sort of overall story to continue into Q1 with those trends. And then, we’re also continuing to make iterative improvements that enhance the performance and benefit pricing over time. And the one example that we give there is Instagram Stories that, as you know, it’s been an area we’ve been focused on to try and make DR performance through better ads in our activity, work better on Stories, and we’ve been seeing some good progress there. So, we called that out as well as being a driver of price improvement. There’s still a gap with Stories ads and Feed ads, but we’ve been pleased with the progress we’ve been making on that front."

I mean, the biggest connection for -- the biggest difference between Messenger and WhatsApp is, obviously, the connection to Facebook and the kind of same identity and graph that you use on Facebook comes with you to Messenger. So, even if you can send messages across the different apps and there’s more interoperability, and we bring the same world-class privacy features to both, I think that that will still make the apps feel fairly distinct. I also think the kind of aesthetic and focus of the apps on how much different functionality they include will vary. I think, WhatsApp has always had -- we’ve always focused a lot on making it a very utilitarian experience and place more of a premium on simplicity there. So, we’ll continue adding new functionality, but we’re more focused on keeping that minimal. Whereas in Messenger, we have a lot more tools and features for expression.

We launched shopping in Reels. And we’ve said that we will launch ads. The timing is to be determined. And we’re going to follow the same pattern we followed on other things, like Stories. We launch a consumer product. We make sure there’s product market fit, and people are using it. Then, we launch an ad product. And we make sure that it’s beneficial for consumers. And as David answered in I think the last question, we work very diligently quarter-by-quarter on the basis point improvements that help us scale a product.

How important, or how large is civic and political contents on the site? Is there a way to quantify it or to quantify the engagement with it, to see if this is one of the headwinds that you guys talk about in terms of potentially emerging in 2021? And second, on the regulatory headwinds, there is just increasing talk of about Section 220 protection. I know it’s a thorny subject.

Yes, I don’t know if we have any stats to share on the size of civic and political content, but it’s a pretty small minority of the content, right? And it’s -- and all the feedback that we have from our communities suggest that the vast majority of people would like it to stay that way. And I think, there has been this trend, I think, across society where a lot of things have become politicized and politics has kind of had a way of creeping into everything. And I think a lot of the work that we’re -- a lot of the feedback that we see from our communities that people don’t want that in their experience. And they come to our services to connect with friends and family, to connect to communities that they care about. And I think that we can potentially do a better job of those core jobs that we have and do a better job of helping to bring people together and helping to promote healthier communities if we can reduce the amount of politics on our services. Now, I mean it’s -- we’ll have to balance this carefully because we have a deep commitment to free expression. So, I believe that if people want to be able to discuss the stuff or join groups there, they should certainly be able to do that. But, I just don’t think that it’s serving the community particularly well to be recommending that content right now. But, one thing to mention just because you were asking about the headwinds and all that is, I don’t think that this is a factor in any of that. And Wehner can jump in, if there’s any more that you want to add on that. But I don’t think that that’s what he had in mind in any way there. Wehner, I’ll skip a beat for you to jump in if you want before going to the next question."

This is not something that’s factoring into our outlook. It’s not a headwind that is a factor in our 2021 outlook. And certainly, on the ads front as well, political is extremely small. It’s low single-digit revenue, even in an active political quarter like we had. So, no, it’s not factoring in on either the ad side or the engagement side in our outlook."

And now, going to your 230 question, I do think, and I testified this -- about this in Congress. I do think that Congress should update Section 230 to make sure that it’s working the way that people intend, right? And it’s after, I think, being in place for almost 25 years. And the Section 230 has been very important. It’s helped give rise to the internet as we know it today. And it’s given internet platforms tools to be able to balance free expression and safety. And I think, it’s also gone pretty far in terms of helping to ensure that values like free expression are built into the internet’s DNA. So, I think that any changes should be thought through very carefully, and should be thought through not just from the perspective of what a larger company like Facebook or Google or Twitter could handle in terms of updating their content moderation policies, but also from the perspective of making sure that new companies can continue to emerge. I think, that’s very important as well. So, we’ve supported changes in this for a while. Back in 2018, we supported a change to prevent sex trafficking. And we’ll support similar efforts to tackle harms like child exploitation, imagery and material and opioids. And we’ll also support the new push to make content moderation systems more transparent.

First, for the business, and I don’t think we look at communities separately from friends and family. They are both different types of content that show up in news feed that people interact with. But my guess is that it’s probably already a pretty meaningful driver of the business and the value that people get from the services today. So, absolutely, I think as this continues to grow, it should be in the future. The big trend that we’re looking at now, and that I tried to call out in my remarks earlier, is that right now, there is a spectrum of different kinds of groups and communities on Facebook. Everything from meme groups that people find very entertaining and fun, to groups that people really turn to for support when they have kind of serious issues in their lives. And I think that right now, though, most of these communities, they have this backbone of -- there’s a feed, there are ways to message people. But, when I think about the physical communities that I’m a part of, in my life, they often have more of an institutional structure, right? There are sub-communities. There are people who -- it’s their full-time job to basically help people engage and basically help people navigate them. I’m thinking about things like the synagogues that I’m a member of, right? I mean, there are people there whose job it is to help engage the congregation and help them get basically the most out of everything that the institution has to offer, and that’s a very important kind of community organization. And I would love for more institutions like that to be able to organize and build community more effectively online. So, there are lots of just different tools that I think that if we provide spanning messaging, spanning video chat, these organizations own websites and other things that they do that if we can help in a lot of those areas, then we can make it that groups on Facebook are not just to feed and a place where you post some content and maybe engage on a post, but that we can really help more organizations build up community institutions like that. And I think that that could be a very big contribution and something that I’m excited about taking on."

So, small businesses are very reliant on personalized ads, the ability to use data in a very privacy safe way, to get the customers who are interested in their products and services. And that makes sense. Big businesses, we can buy an ad to the whole country. We can buy an ad to a whole region. Small businesses can’t. They have to find the precise audiences they want. And I think, one of the mainstays of our business is we’ve enabled that targeting in a very privacy safe way, without giving information without permission to advertisers. And what’s happening with IDFA is that small businesses are really concerned because they are worried that they’re not going to be able to buy effective advertising. If all personalized ads went away, small businesses would see a 60% cut in website sales. Now, we don’t think Apple’s contemplating going that far that quickly, but that is the general direction of what would happen. And you can see that that would be very detrimental to their business. It’s also very detrimental to economic growth because so much of our job growth comes from small businesses. I think it’s worth noting, it’s not just about advertisers. Some of these changes also impact developers and other forms of businesses. We are starting to hear from creators and developers who are worried that some of their free services will have to start charging or shut down, force them into subscriptions or other in payments for revenue. Now, not all small businesses are aware of these challenges, but we are hearing from more and more of them, so are very concerned."

Before we get started, I just want to take a moment to say that we are very worried about the COVID situation in India and also in Brazil. I'm hoping that we can get this virus under control soon. And in the meantime, we're focused on what we can do to help there. Now, turning to the results. This was another strong quarter. More than 2.7 billion people now use one or more of our apps each day, and more than 200 million businesses use our tools to reach customers. And this has been an intense year, and I am proud that we continue to deliver value for people and businesses around the world. Now, over the past couple of quarters, our business has been performing better than we expected. And this has given us the confidence to increase our investments meaningfully and in a few key areas that have the potential to change the trajectory of the Company over the long term. So, on today's call, I'm going to talk about the opportunities that we're pursuing in augmented and virtual reality and around commerce, business messaging, and creators. So first, let's talk about building the next computing platform. Now, I believe that augmented and virtual reality are going to enable a deeper sense of presence and social connection than any existing platform. They're going to be an important part of how we'll interact with computers in the future. So, we're going to keep investing heavily in building out the best experiences here, and this accounts for a major part of our overall R&D budget growth. Quest 2 is doing better than we expected, even after the holiday season. We continue to see good engagement, and we keep shipping updates that make Quest better and better, including Air Link which enables wireless streaming of games and content from PCs and support for 120 hertz refresh rates. Now, achieving Quest's high quality in a wireless form factor has been a major breakthrough. Having wires wrapped around you just really breaks the sense of presence in immersion, and the technology to deliver a great experience wirelessly is very advanced, and most companies aren’t going to be able to deliver this, but we believe that it is the minimum bar for a high-quality experience. This quarter we also shared more about our future investments, including neural interfaces for interacting with AR. And we started testing our new avatar system, which will be a key part of how people express themselves and connect. One interesting trend is that we're seeing the app ecosystem broaden out beyond games into other categories as well. The most used apps are social, which fits our original theory for why we wanted to build this platform in the first place. We're also seeing productivity and even fitness apps. So, for example, we launched a tool so people can subscribe to services like FitXR to do boxing and dancing in VR just like they would for biking on Peloton. We introduced App Lab, so developers can ship early versions of their apps directly to consumers without having to go through the Oculus Store. And between App Lab and streaming from PCs, we're pioneering a much more open model of app store than what's currently available on phones today. Now, over time, I expect augmented and virtual reality to unlock a massive amount of value, both in people's lives and the economy overall. There's still a long way to go here, and most of our investments to make this work are ahead of us. But, I think that the feedback we're getting from our products is giving us more confidence that our prediction for the future here will happen and that we're focusing on the right areas. Now, beyond AR and VR, I want to call out some of the other long term opportunities that we're really focused on, especially in commerce and in business messaging. Commerce has been growing in our services for a while, but it has become a lot more important as the pandemic has accelerated a broader shift towards businesses moving online. In the last year, we've seen online storefronts stay open even when physical stores closed; and going forward online commerce will continue to offer an increasingly personalized and convenient experience. Commerce ads continue to do very well and drive a meaningful amount of our overall business. We built Marketplace into one of the world’s leading services for people to buy and sell, and I am pleased to share today that more than 1 billion people visit Marketplace each month. And now, we're investing in building for the future of commerce. We launched Shops last year. And as I recently shared, there are now more than 1 million monthly active Shops and over 250 million monthly Shops visitors. We're also focused on building more native commerce tools across our apps. We recently updated WhatsApp Catalog, so businesses can keep them updated from their computers and to include what's in stock. We launched Carts on WhatsApp last year, and people have used them to send orders more than 5 million times. We're also building a broader infrastructure to support commerce, everything from payments to customer service and support, and WhatsApp Payments is now live in India, and we've gotten approval in Brazil to launch shortly too. We're starting to see a meaningful shift in the way that people communicate with businesses. For a lot of people, online commerce is less about websites and Shops and more about messaging. People want to get support and make purchases right from a chat. Smaller businesses want to show their products and take orders via messages, and larger businesses want reliable and secure infrastructure to communicate with their customers. Businesses using the WhatsApp Business API are already sending more than 100 million messages per day. Over the last year, during the height of COVID, total daily conversations between people and businesses on Messenger and Instagram grew by more than 40%. More than 3 million advertisers are already using Click-to-Message ads to direct people to Messenger, and since we introduced Click-to-WhatsApp ads, nearly 1 million advertisers have already started using them too. And now, the next step here is we’re going to make it possible to create those Click-to-WhatsApp ads from directly within the WhatsApp Business app. The next step is to make it easier for businesses to adopt all these services, and to give them the tools that can handle messages and customer relationships. Our acquisition of Kustomer is going through regulatory approval, and we're looking forward to offering businesses a native way to manage their customer relationships on our platform. Now, I want to be clear that we have a long way to go to build out a full-featured commerce platform across our services, and this is a multiyear journey, but I am very committed to getting there. This modern commerce system is going to bring together a number of areas where we either already have strong offerings, like in ads, community tools, and messaging, with areas like Shops, business messaging, and payments that we're focused on ramping up now. As part of this, we're also investing more in building out better customer support for our products. For the last several years we've focused a lot on content moderation and privacy work, and I view customer support as the next pillar of the trust and safety work for our services. The last area that I want to discuss today is around creators. I think that a positive vision for the future of the economy is one where more people get to do creative work that they enjoy rather than jobs that they don't. And to get there, we need to build out the creative and monetization tools to support this creator economy. People create an incredibly diverse set of content across our services, from long form writing to live conversations to documentaries and augmented reality filters. And our goal is to support the full range of human expression, and to be the best platform for millions of creators to make a living. Now, part of this is going to be delivering a suite of tools and products that span all the ways that people want to create and consume content. I believe that at the intersection of every media type and every audience size, there is a compelling experience to build. For example, I recently discussed our audio roadmap. And we already support audio calls for private audio communication, but now we're also building out Live Audio Rooms, which we think will be especially useful for groups and communities, we're building Soundbites for sharing and consuming short-form audio clips broadly, and we're supporting podcasts for sharing and listening to long-form audio. We're also partnering with Spotify to launch a music player in the Facebook app. So, we also need to connect these experiences with easy options for monetization, whether that's subscriptions, tipping, or enabling creators to give product recommendations and enable commerce. And with Instagram and Facebook, we have a unique ability to bring creators and commerce together, and we will share more on that later this year. Now, together, these efforts around creators, commerce and the next computing platform are a few of the big areas that we are doubling down on going forward. And in each of these, there's a unique opportunity to help people connect in deeper ways and to support a stronger economy for everyone. I'm optimistic that our work in all of these areas will help accelerate some of the positive emerging trends that we're seeing in the world. And now, I’m going to hand it over to Sheryl."
META,2021-04-28,2021-04-29,,2021-04-28,2021-04-28T15:00:00-04:00,0,2021-04-28,prepared,,Sheryl Sandberg,"Thanks Mark, and hi everyone. I hope you’re all safe and healthy. This was a really strong quarter for our business. Our total revenue for Q1 was $26.2 billion, which is a 48% year-over-year increase. We’ve seen good growth in all regions, and we continue to see strong results in verticals that have performed well during the pandemic, like E-commerce, Retail and CPG. Our performance has been driven in large part by the continued digital transformation as more and more businesses shift online. For years, we’ve invested in products and tools to support this shift, and these investments have helped many businesses reinvent themselves during the pandemic. One of the best parts of my job is I get to meet SMB owners and hear what’s on their minds. Many of them tell me how they’ve used Facebook to adapt and grow. At a virtual roundtable with SMBs from Detroit this quarter I spoke to La’Asia Johnson, who runs an all-natural skincare company called Elle Jae Essentials. When COVID hit and she had to close her store, she started a Facebook Group called The Garden, which now has more than 1,000 members. They give her product ideas, and when she makes the products they suggest, as she says it, they sell quicker than she can keep them on the shelves. By pivoting online she’s been able to replace all of the income she lost from her store. I also spoke to Ita Reyes, who runs a yoga studio in nearby Ann Arbor. She started doing outdoor classes during the pandemic and needed to get the word out. She couldn’t afford to advertise to everyone in the city, and not everyone in the city wants to do yoga, so she uses personalized ads. This enables her to advertise to people in the area who are interested in yoga or meditation. It’s all done in a privacy-protected way, we show her ad to those people, and we don’t share their information with her. And then they sign up for her classes. Like everyone else, the business owners I talk to want to know what will happen next. Many are all-in online, so even when things reopen fully they want to be able to do more online than they did before. So understandably, they’re asking us what we’re doing to help them, not just now but over the long run. Part of the answer is continuing to improve our tools and products and creating new ones to suit their needs. And part of it is helping them navigate the headwinds that are coming down the line, whether it’s the iOS14 changes or potential regulation. On the first part, tools and products. We’re all-in too. From day one of COVID, we fast-tracked our work to help people buy and sell online. Initially, we focused on getting the experience right for sellers. As Mark said, we launched Shops nearly a year ago. We’ve continued to develop new features to help personalize the shopping experience and worked with partners to make transactions as seamless as possible. And we’ve created new formats, like Live Shopping, which bring to life the unique commerce experiences our platforms can offer. Now, we’re equally focused on getting the experience right for consumers. We’re rolling out the Shop tab in more countries and exploring new immersive formats, like Product Tags and Drops stickers, that enable more people to shop with creators and brands they love. We're also constantly developing and improving our ad products to help businesses reach people where they are and get the best possible return on investment. We continue to see strong growth in Stories ads and video ads, which we’ve invested in heavily. We’ve also seen strong growth across ads in Facebook Watch, which now has more than 1.25 billion people visiting every month. As the number of people watching video grows, we’re developing more opportunities for businesses and creators to reach them. We’re expanding Paid Online Events to more countries. We’re enabling more people to run instream ads, including in Live videos. And we’re developing ads in short-form videos, where we’re testing the ability for content creators to monetize their Facebook Stories with ads that look like stickers. On the second part, headwinds. Yes, there are challenges coming to personalized advertising and we’ve been pretty open about that. We’re doing a huge amount of work to prepare. We’re working with our customers to implement Apple’s API and our own Aggregated Events Measurement API to mitigate the impact of the iOS14 changes. We’re rebuilding meaningful elements of our ad tech so that our system continues to perform when we have access to less data in the future. And we’re part of long-term collaborations with industry bodies like the W3C on initiatives like privacy enhancing technologies that provide personalized experiences while limiting access to people’s information. It’s also on us to keep making the case that personalized advertising is good for people and businesses, and to better explain how it works so that people realize that personalized ads are privacy-protective. Small businesses don’t have to understand the alphabet soup of acronyms they’ll need to comply with, but they do need to have confidence that they can still use our tools to reach the people who want to buy what they’re selling in a privacy-safe way. We’re confident they can, and that they can continue to get great results as digital advertising evolves. With the roll-out of vaccines, there’s reason to be hopeful. But the pandemic is still causing real heartbreak and real hardship for people in many countries, and in particular, like Mark, my thoughts are with our friends and colleagues in India and Brazil right now. If the last year has taught us anything, it’s to not make assumptions, and to not expect things to get better for everyone at the same time. Whatever happens, we’ll continue to keep people connected, support the public health response, and invest in ways to support businesses now and in the long-term. I want to close by saying how grateful I am to all the businesses who work with us, big and small, who we learn from every day, and to our incredible teams who have supported millions of businesses through this turbulent time and set them up for success now and in the future. Now, over to Dave."
META,2021-04-28,2021-04-29,,2021-04-28,2021-04-28T15:00:00-04:00,0,2021-04-28,prepared,,Dave Wehner,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter for our business, driven by the sustained growth in the digital economy and our continued success in helping businesses engage with consumers across our services. Let’s begin with our community metrics. We estimate that approximately 2.7 billion people used at least one of our services on a daily basis in March, and that approximately 3.4 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. Note that these Q1 Family metrics reflect new data from recent user surveys. Further details on our family metrics are included in the earnings slides on our IR website. Our global community continued to grow even as we lapped elevated user growth in the first quarter of last year related to the pandemic. Facebook daily active users reached 1.88 billion, up 8% or 144 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 66% of the 2.85 billion monthly active users in March. MAUs grew by 250 million or 10% compared to last year. Turning to the financials. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $26.2 billion, up 48% or 44% on a constant currency basis. We benefited from a currency tailwind and had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q1 of last year, total revenue would have been $706 million lower. Q1 ad revenue was $25.4 billion, up 46% or 42% on a constant currency basis. The growth in advertising revenue was largely driven by continued strength in product verticals such as online commerce. Growth was broad-based across all advertiser sizes, with particular strength from small and medium-sized advertisers. Our year-over-year ad revenue growth also benefited from lapping pandemic-related demand headwinds experienced during March of last year. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth accelerated in all regions. Growth was strongest in Europe at 53%. Rest of World, Asia-Pacific, and the U.S. & Canada grew 47%, 46%, and 42%, respectively. Europe and Asia-Pacific benefited from currency tailwinds while Rest of World continued to face currency headwinds. In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 12% and the average price per ad increased 30%. Impression growth was driven by both Instagram and Facebook. The increase in average price per ad was driven primarily by lapping depressed pricing levels from one year ago as well as strong advertiser demand. Other revenue was $732 million, up 146%, driven by continued strong Quest 2 sales. We've been encouraged by the sustained strength we’re seeing with sales of Quest 2 since its October launch. Turning now to expenses. Q1 total expenses were $14.8 billion, up 25% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items: Cost of revenue increased 48%, driven mostly by core infrastructure investments, hardware costs related to Quest 2 sales and payments to partners; R&D increased 29%, driven mostly by hiring to support our core products and consumer hardware efforts; Marketing & Sales increased 2%, with growth in hiring partially offset by lower marketing spend; Lastly, G&A expenses increased 2%, with growth in employee-related costs partially offset by lapping higher bad debt expenses related to COVID in the first quarter of last year. We added over 2,000 net new hires in Q1, primarily in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 60,600 full-time employees, up 26% compared to last year. First quarter operating income was $11.4 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. Our tax rate was 17%. Net income was $9.5 billion or $3.30 per share. Capital expenditures including capital leases were $4.4 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities. Free cash flow was $7.8 billion. We repurchased $4.1 billion of our Class A common stock in the first quarter and we ended the quarter with $64.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. In terms of sustainability, I’m pleased to report that Facebook’s global operations have now reached net zero emissions and are 100% supported by renewable energy. This is an important milestone for our business, but we also recognize there is more work to do in the years ahead, and we remain committed to our next goal of decarbonizing our entire value chain in 2030. Additional information on our ongoing efforts across environmental, social and governance areas can be found in our recently filed proxy statement. Turning now to the outlook. We are pleased with the strength of our advertising revenue growth in the first quarter of 2021, which was driven by a 30% year-over-year increase in the average price per ad and a 12% increase in the number of ads delivered. We expect that advertising revenue growth will continue to be primarily driven by price during the rest of 2021. We expect second quarter 2021 year-over-year total revenue growth to remain stable or modestly accelerate relative to the growth rate in the first quarter of 2021 as we lap slower growth related to the pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we expect year-over-year total revenue growth rates to significantly decelerate sequentially as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth. We continue to expect increased ad targeting headwinds in 2021 from regulatory and platform changes, notably the recently-launched iOS 14.5 update, which we expect to begin having an impact in the second quarter. This is factored into our outlook. There is also continuing uncertainty around the viability of transatlantic data transfers in light of recent European regulatory developments, and like companies across a wide range of industries, we are closely monitoring the potential impact on our European operations as these developments progress. Turning now to expenses. We expect 2021 total expenses to be in the range of $70 billion to $73 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $68 billion to $73 billion. The year-over-year growth in expenses is driven by investments in technical and product talent, infrastructure, and consumer-related costs. We remain committed to investing for long-term growth and our expense outlook reflects the underlying strength of our business and the compelling investment opportunities we see across our products, including consumer hardware. We expect 2021 capital expenditures to be in the range of $19 billion to $21 billion, down from our prior estimate of $21 billion to $23 billion. Our capital expenditures are driven primarily by our investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities. Turning now to tax. We continue to expect our full-year 2021 tax rate to be in the high-teens. In closing, the pandemic during the past year has presented some incredible challenges to our global community. During this time, we have worked to help both businesses and consumers stay connected. We remain focused on helping people and businesses navigate the transition out of the pandemic as more regions reopen. With that, France, let’s open up the call for questions."

You made a lot of progress, around the million Shops, 250 million Shop visitors. Where would you say you've made the most progress for advertisers and merchants so far? And then, as you sort of look into the back half into '22, what are the biggest areas of innovation that you're really focused on to continue to grow that number? Maybe talk about non-advertising monetization optionality. And the second one I had is around as we -- I know it's early in the reopening, but would be curious to hear about what you're seeing from an engagement or time spent perspective of your user base in the areas of the world that are a little more reopened, and how you're thinking about that in the back half?"
META,2021-04-28,2021-04-29,,2021-04-28,2021-04-28T15:00:00-04:00,0,2021-04-28,qa,,Sheryl Sandberg,"I can start on the first. So, there's a lot of commerce activity on our platform already. People really discover lots of products through our Feed and ad Stories -- through our Feed and Stories ads. It's been our largest ad vertical. COVID really accelerated it, but it's been one of the fastest-growing verticals we've had over the last five years, and we believe that Facebook drives hundreds of billions of dollars of off-site e-commerce GMV today through our ads business. So, we've certainly made a ton of progress there. And our goals going forward are, we want to continue to be the very best place to advertise. We're going to have to do work to do that. As I mentioned in my remarks, that we can still use data in a privacy-safe way, get the right ads to the right person at the right time, but we think we are market leaders here. The other work we're doing, and Mark talked about it in his remarks and I did as well, is to make it easier to sell on our platform. Now, the shopping experience is really well-defined in other places, and we are later to that than we were to adds. So, we know we have a lot of work to do. We're working with partners to build some of the parts of the experience that we're not as an expert in, and we're integrating -- and we're integrating products like Shops. We have more than 1 million active Shops and more than 250 million people interacting with merchandise per month. So, we've made some good progress. But we recognize that getting to a really seamless transaction experience is going to take work on our side, and we're going to continue to invest there. I think, another area where we do have to do more is we have to improve the consumer experience to help people transact on the platform. We've done, I think, more work on the business side, on the integration side, and now we are focused on continuing to build that and continuing to build out the consumer experience. For the foreseeable future, ads are going to be the vast majority of our revenue in this area and that commerce vertical is so important to us. We don't need commerce itself or fees to become a big part of what happens in order to make the investment worthwhile, but we really have to focus on helping more businesses move online and have a great experience on our platform. And that, along with that, makes this a very worthwhile investment for us."

So, I think broadly, what we're seeing is just engagement trends that are going back to a more normalized level. So, if you think about the past year, it's been pretty noisy because of COVID. In the first quarter of 2020, we saw a significant increase in engagement as a result of the pandemic, and we've seen some of those trends subside as the year progressed and we saw gradual phase down of lockdowns. I don't think anything hugely dramatic, but it's certainly something that we're seeing in the engagement trends. And that's one of the factors that's playing into price being a bigger driver of growth on the revenue side because of the impression growth being lower. And I'd say, COVID is certainly a factor in that. On the revenue front, I think there we're seeing continued strong demand with products and even -- and then we're seeing services spend come back.

I think there's been some questions on engagement, just because you see the strong growth of things like TikTok or maybe Snap, but you've built some super platforms within Facebook with the Watch usage and Marketplaces, could you comment on what you're seeing with overall engagement? And as people use these over -- new platforms, is it growing time spent on other factors? And then, the second question, maybe to Dave, any surprises with the iOS 14-5 update? And any comments on what you've seen with users who have already opted out of tracking before this update?"
META,2021-04-28,2021-04-29,,2021-04-28,2021-04-28T15:00:00-04:00,0,2021-04-28,qa,,Dave Wehner,"Hey Justin, it's Dave. Yes, I can take -- I can take both of those. So yes, on the impression growth front, I think we're seeing a couple of factors. We talked about the COVID impact and the return to more normal levels, and that's affecting some of the impression growth. The second factor that we're seeing, and it kind of gets at some of your question, which is we're seeing really strong engagement on video, particularly internationally. And that's -- we're pleased with that. I'd point to a couple of examples there. I'd say Facebook Watch, we talked about the 1.25 billion users. Also, Reels is starting to get traction on -- and doing well on Instagram. Now, video currently has relatively fewer impressions on a time spent basis. So, that's playing into the engagement trends as well. And then finally, I would say, we are seeing competition in News Feed from both our own video products and also others’ products as well. So, that's factoring into it. And then, your second question was regarding any surprises with iOS 14-5. Look, I think it's really early. They just began rolling out the update. So, it's sort of very, very low kind of penetration rates of the new OS at this point. But a couple of things, I'd say, we continue to be concerned about the impact that this update is going to have on the ability of small businesses to use their advertising budgets effectively. That said, the impact on our own business, we think, will be manageable. We continue to expect it will be a headwind for the remainder of the year, but we're making encouraging progress, as Sheryl mentioned, on our own solutions to help advertisers navigate these changes. And that includes helping advertisers work with the Apple API as well as our own approach to using aggregated data for targeting and measurement that we call Aggregated Events Management. So, the goal there is really to maintain it in the long run, even improve performance with less data, so. And then, I'd also add that just in addition to these mitigations, we're also just seeing very strong overall ad demand, which is contributing to a more positive outlook for 2021. And I would say, just overall, the impact of these -- the specific iOS 14 changes are one element of some of the challenges with Apple. But, we think the impact of the Apple approach is really much bigger than this particular update around third-party data usage. Apple has a number of private APIs on hardware and software that advantage their own products and services in ways that are challenging, and we face that issue with -- in places like our messaging products and even with the hardware products we're launching. So, we generally don't think that this closed approach is the best one for the industry from an innovation perspective. Go ahead, France, next question."

Mark, you highlighted the three areas where you're doubling down across AR and VR, commerce and then the creator economy.

Thanks."

I think, we mostly think about these things from the perspective of improving the experiences that we can build. So, augmented and virtual reality, I have thought about for a long time, because I think that it's sort of the holy grail of delivering a sense of presence and the type of social experiences that you would want to build. So, right now, and I guess for the whole history of the Company, we've been constrained to a web browser, and now, in some cases, this increasingly restrictive mobile app rules. But, I think that this future environment where you're going to be able to feel like you're really present with someone else, that's going to be really powerful. And it's going to unlock a bunch of experiences that we wanted to build for a long time, and that's what I'm really excited about. Similarly, on the commerce side, I mean part of this is motivated by wanting to help out small businesses and different businesses sell more across our platform. And a lot of it is also just about making the consumer experience better, right? So right now, a lot of times, you'll click on an ad, you'll see an interesting ad, and it'll take you to a website, and the website won't necessarily have full context on who you are, the payment experience will be clunky in doing that. And there's just an opportunity, I think, to make that all a lot more seamless. And when it is seamless, it bolsters a better experience for the people using it, but then it also converts better for the businesses and performs better. So, I think the way we're going to approach this is largely from starting with having built out this very robust ad system and then just basically working our way down the experience from there. So, making it so businesses and creators can have Shops and that the ads can then link into Shops and have a native shopping experience. And then over time, we will also increasingly, as our payment systems get better and better and more people have credentials on file, I would imagine that that going all the way through the funnel will become an increasing part of what people do, and that will both be a better experience for consumers and convert better for businesses. Similar story on the creator side. Here our main goal is not necessarily that the creator economy is a major business by itself. But, if we become the best place for creators to make a living, then I think that's going to mean that there's better content across the services and better opportunities for community building and engaging people, and that's what we care about. But of course, if there's more engagement and if creators are finding that there are good opportunities to monetize, then they'll engage more with our business products too and there will be some opportunity there. But -- so I kind of think about all this stuff from the perspective of improving the products. And I think that that's going to lead to a lot of benefits for all of the stakeholders over the next several years."

So, this -- I think, recently this week, there were congressional hearings on this concept of algorithmic amplification or how algorithms on Facebook or Instagram surface content to kind of maximize engagement. And sometimes that means some of the more controversial content is what gets surfaced. So first off, is that a fair characterization? And if you guys were forced to maybe change up the way all these algorithms work, what might -- what kind of impact will that actually have on engagement? I think, 10 years ago, the News Feed was kind of the whole story, but now we're talking about many different areas within the apps. So, how much is from this algorithmic-driven content versus utility style engagement, like going into Messenger or going into Marketplace or something that's just kind of an everyday behavior? Thanks a lot."

Overall, I think that the narrative that you are pointing to is dramatically overstated by critics. We do not optimize our systems to increase the amount of time spent in News Feed. I explicitly do not give our News Feed team or the Instagram feed team goals around time spent. Our belief is that if we build a product that is more valuable, then people will engage more, but you should start by trying to build something that's more valuable, not by trying to increase the time that people are spending. So, we've done that for years, and I think it's yielded good results. So from that perspective, I know that what you're saying is something that -- that some folks like to throw around and say. But, I actually think that the more that different regulators or other folks dig into this, I actually think that our practices here are quite robust. And we don't want extreme -- extremist content or any of that stuff on our services. So, if anything, to the contrary of trying to promote that, we go out of our way to try to reduce that. And I think that that -- contrary to what a lot of these other folks say is it is actually in our business interest to reduce it because people don't like it, right? I mean, consumers don't like it. Advertisers don't want to be near it. So, I don't actually think that this kind of narrative about the Company is accurate. And we've tried hard to dispel it. I don't think we've been super successful of that. We will continue trying to work on that. But just to kind of be clear about how I see things, that's the basic download. I think, News Feed is still a huge part of the products and the home feed in Instagram. But increasingly, Stories is a big deal in Instagram, a lot of people are using Explore and IGTV. Video and Watch on Facebook are quite big. And as you say, a lot of people spend a lot of their time and attention is in messaging apps and private interfaces like that as well. So, I think there are a lot of different things that people are doing across the services. But, Wehner can jump in with any more color on that that he wants to add."

So, we've got 35,000 -- over 35,000 people on the safety and security side. We've got the most robust set of content policies out there. We do a quarterly call, public call around our content review process and procedures. So, I think that on the front, before it even gets into the algorithm, I think we really do more than anyone else in the industry on the safety and security front to prevent things like misinformation and a bad content going into the system in the first place."

Mark, you've been talking about VR for a long time now, every -- basically every quarter. I was just wondering what happened this particular quarter that's compelling you to want to double down on virtual reality? What was the realization this quarter that maybe made you want to do that? And I guess more importantly and related, is there a need for Facebook to perhaps want to own a studio or maybe a series of studios to accelerate to rollout content which should help drive adoption because the other friction point is price, and you've already lowered the unit to $299, which is a very compelling price. Thanks."

In terms of what changed, I think the big piece here is that Quest 2 is doing quite well. And I don't want to overstate it because I think compared to platforms that are kind of large, massive successes today, it's still obviously on the small end. But there's been a very real inflection in terms of adoption and engagement that we're seeing with Quest 2. It feels like there's something about the quality bar that we hit and the price that we hit and the fact that we're able to do that in a wireless form factor. But, I think it's just -- first of all, it's going to be really hard for anyone else, I think, to meet those different attributes. Some other folks might try to ship something that the claim is higher quality but has a wire. And I just don't think that consumers are going to want to go for that. So, we'll see how all of that plays out. But, I also just look at how the team is executing and the products that we have in the pipeline. And I want to make sure that we can really go all in and deliver this. But, I do admit Quest 2 has been a meaningful step up from Quest 1 in terms of the progress that we're seeing. And content is definitely a part of this. And we have a team internally that's focused on both first party, I guess it's all first-party, second-party and third-party content and making partnerships with studios. And that certainly is a big part of this. I think Quest has, I think by far the best lineup of VR content. And I think the road map of what's ahead is even more exciting, some of the stuff that's coming over the next few years."

So, it's not the first time that we sort of put a spotlight on that. It's been an ongoing investment area. And studios, as Mark said, and content is an important part of that. France, we can go to the next question."

Mark, as you're building and investing in the platform, kind of what do you expect AR, VR to be more widely adopted? What kind of ultimately drives the fast pace accelerating consumer adoption?

In terms of when these platforms will be more adopted, I think a lot of it is about form factor and use cases. I mean Quest 2, I think, is -- we kind of hit a key point, but I think there's still further that we want to go on the form factor of that. But I think the wireless part is key. So, I'll just say that again. So, I think that there's a lot that you can do in terms of getting products that might have better graphics or something. But with a wire, it really hurts the sense of immersion because you don't want to have like a wire wrapped around your neck while you're doing all this stuff. But the other big piece is the use cases, which is why I called out in my remarks in the beginning that one of the promising signs that we're seeing is that it is expanding out beyond games. Now, it's still primarily games. But, when we started on this journey, a lot of the reason why I said that I thought it made sense for us to invest in this is because I expect virtual and augmented reality to be some of the most social platforms that get built. And the fact that a number of the most engaging experiences on the platforms today are social and a lot of the top games are social, I think, is really promising. But also seeing things in terms of productivity, and like I mentioned, it’s just really promising that you're seeing the early signs of this becoming a broader platform. So, there's -- again, I don't want to overstate any of this because it's all quite early still, and all these things need to develop out. But, those are very promising signs from my perspective. And as those keep on developing out, then I think the platforms will be broadly applicable to more people. And then, the other thing I'd say is that we haven't really even gotten there on AR yet, right? I think virtual reality, the form factor constraints, I think, are a little less than what you're going to have in augmented reality, where in virtual reality, I think you need to get to a high-quality wireless experience. In augmented reality, you're going to really need a pair of glasses that look like normal looking glasses in order for that to hit a mainstream acceptance. And that, I think, is going to be one of the hardest technical challenges of the decade, it's basically fitting a supercomputer in the frame of glasses. So, I'm -- I find not a very exciting problem to work on. And I think that once that's achievable, potential on that is going to be quite big."

But I think you've got a couple of factors. One was marketing spend was relatively lower compared to Q1 of last year where the growth was lower. And then also, we had a bad debt expense that, I think, was not unique for Facebook. I think you see this in some other companies as well that we took in Q1 of last year related to our expectations on collectibility around COVID. So, that's factoring into some of the compares on the growth rates as well. And then, as you look at the remainder of the year, a couple of things. One is the strength of the business, in general, is giving us confidence, and we're looking for areas to invest more. So, we're continuing to invest in research and development across the priorities that Mark outlined in his comments. And then, as well, we'll see a pickup in things like marketing in the remainder of the year. So, that's what's driving the acceleration of expense growth as you look forward. And then, the COVID compares are a little bit, there's just different expense lines that COVID impacts. So, it's a little noisy from that as well."

First, Sheryl, in the past, you've talked about advertising being kind of a relative ROI gain. So, when you think about the shift from iOS changes, perhaps going from like an operational short-term headwind to potentially a tailwind as other outlets for advertising lose ROI on a relative basis, like is that something that happens in months, in quarters, in a year? Like talk about how you see that potentially evolving? And then, second one, Sheryl, you also talked about starting to invest more in building out the consumer experience on the shopping side. So, maybe you can just walk us through some of the things you think Facebook can uniquely bring into e-commerce that might make for a newer, better user experience? Is that AR, VR? Is that -- what are some of the things that could really make Facebook stand out for consumers on e-commerce?"
META,2021-04-28,2021-04-29,,2021-04-28,2021-04-28T15:00:00-04:00,0,2021-04-28,qa,,Sheryl Sandberg,"Yes. On the first, the relative ROI, you're exactly right. People are going to advertise. They're going to advertise on TV, on radio, on billboards, on different online platforms, and they're looking for relative ROI. That means a signal goes down and it goes down everywhere, we're competing differently. Our goal is to make sure that we can still do personalized ads. We do think that our relative competitive advantage has been that our ads are more personalized. And that's really important because as in some of the examples I shared, most small businesses, the yoga studio in Detroit can't afford to advertise to everyone in Detroit, much less everyone in Michigan, much less everyone in the U.S. And so, advertising using who lives there and who's likely to be interested in yoga and meditation is really important. We believe we will still be relatively better positioned. Virtual -- Phase 2, not all players, right, because we're not running the platforms, but based on many, we're still going to do better at that than a lot of digital players. We're still going to do better at that than TV or radio. But, when signal goes down, we're going to have to rebuild that capability, and that's what I talked about. In terms of the timing you asked specifically, we really don't know. The iOS 14 changes are really new. Regulatory changes that might happen at a state level or a global or a regional level or a national level haven't happened yet. So, we'll have to see. And I don't have a real sense of what those changes will be, what their impact will be right now. But, we are very focused on competing for those ad dollars and doing it as well as we can. In the consumer experience on the shopping side, where we are right now is we launched the shop -- a lot of the shopping tools, and we've had broad business adoption, and that's been good. We don't offer the full suite of tools that a lot of other places do. But more and more, we have shops functionality that people are adopting. We really need to work on the consumer side of the experience. I do think we have a unique opportunity there. You asked again, like what is our -- I think -- is my language at yours, but I think you were asking like what is our sustainable competitive advantage here. We have a lot of people doing a lot of activity. We increasingly have people looking for products. We increasingly have people finding products. And so, we've always been strong at the top of the funnel. Can we move people down the funnel? We think we can. But, that's going to take work, and it's also going to take some time for people to get used to that. But, in terms of the long-run competitive advantage, we have a lot of people looking for a lot of things, sharing a lot of things and continuing to find things they really like. And so, I'm very optimistic about our opportunity here, but it's going to take real work."

I think right now, I think the trajectory of this is that when you are very early on in the platform, it's helpful to centralize a bunch of that development close together in the organization. But then as things start to build out and you want to get the full energy of the different app teams involved in building for this, then you want to decentralize it more. So, right now, it's still more on the centralized side. But, I'd say that over the next year or two, we're certainly going to generate more of that work out across the Company and have more of the work that we do be building towards these different platforms. And to your point on the other kinds of services and that are important for commerce, payments, both things like Facebook Pay and eventually, hopefully, we'll be launching Novi and -- sorry, Diem soon, that I think is going to be a pretty big thing too. And that's very important for all the reasons that you're saying. Commerce, across all these platforms is going to be very important. And certainly in a platform that we're building like this, we want to enable payments very easily to make it to that -- the economics all work out for developers."

I know there are a few important components here that creators need. One are the creative tools to be able to share the full range of expressions, right, so from any kind of writing, to audio, to video, to all these different mediums. Then the second is connecting that work with a large audience of people and helping people find their audience and community. And then, the third is monetization. And I'd say that we're probably strongest on the second two of those today. And I think we have creative tools, and we will invest more in building those. But, when it comes to helping people reach the largest audience or finding their specific audience, I think we are world-class at that. I think we're the best of that. And then, in terms of monetization, I also think that as our business results show, we are very efficient at that. And if we can put that to work for creators to help them make money from their work, then that can help achieve this goal of enabling millions of people to make a living through this kind of creative work. So, I think on those two pieces, especially on the monetization side and on the helping people connect with their specific community and getting as much distribution as possible, I think that we're going to do some really great and unique work to help a lot of creators out. And then, we'll build out the broader suite of tools, too, but I think that those two places are really where we enter this from."

I think, the really simple story on pricing is that demand has just been higher than we expected for ads. And I think it's -- if you had to pick one vertical, it would be commerce that outperformed. But it's a -- and that dovetails nicely obviously with our commerce efforts. But it's really been a broader story than that. Really almost every vertical was very strong. I think we're still kind of -- we're still seeing recovery in some of the verticals that were weaker from COVID, like travel. But we're starting to see, I think, some signs of life there in some other verticals that were being negatively impacted by COVID. But really just strong across-the-board demand for ads has been what's driven it for us. I think the two-year compare that you talked about is a helpful compare because there's a lot of noise in our year-over-year revenue growth rates when you look just at 2020 compared to 2021. And if you do sort of a two-year compare, I think -- and looked at the year-over-year growth rates by quarter, I think we'd expect a more normalized rate of deceleration of growth, not just all of the bouncing around from the weak quarters that we're going to have, and then I think correspondingly stronger quarters as the year progresses from a compare basis into 2020. But, yes, the simple story, advertiser demand, better than we expected."

This was a good quarter for our product and business. There are now more than 3.5 billion people who actively use one or more of our services, and I'm excited about our product roadmap ahead. I want to start today by discussing some of the themes that we're seeing and our major efforts around creators, commerce and the next computing platform. Each of these areas is important and it's going to unlock a lot of value on its own, but we're also building blocks for the future of the Internet and the future vision for our company, and I'll discuss that as well. So first, let's talk about creators. We want our platforms to be the best place for millions of creators to earn a living. And if we can do this within our services, we'll also have the best content across many different types of media, from text and photos to audio, gaming and video. Video, in particular, is becoming the primary way that people use our products and express themselves. Now I know this is a theme that we've been talking about for a few years now, but we've been executing on this for a while, and video has steadily become more important in our product. Video now accounts for almost half of all-time spent on Facebook and Reels is already the largest contributor to engagement growth on Instagram. Across all forms of video, short-form video like Reels is growing especially quickly. We're very focused on making it easy for anyone to create video and then for those videos to be viewed across all of our different services, starting with Facebook and Instagram first. People like to watch videos recommended by our personalized algorithm, so this gives creators a good way to reach new people who don't follow them yet and this is also a good complement to our social feeds and it's an area where our progress in AI is going to make the experience a lot better in the coming months and years. On-demand video like in Facebook Watch is also growing quickly and is now growing faster than in other types of video or content in News Feed. We're building a number of new video monetization tools for creators that can get compensated for making great content. So for example, last year, people spent more than $50 million of stars to game stream creators going live on Facebook alone. And now we're extending stars to [Indiscernible] to any creator doing on-demand video as well. I just want to call out live video for a moment. This is a smaller percent of our overall video on our services, but it's some of the most unique content and gives creators a way to build community and engage with their followers. And we're also focused on developing monetization tools like live breaks, mid row ads and live shopping, so creators can make a living and engage their communities more deeply in commerce with their content. So overall, there is a lot more to do here. And as it becomes the majority of engagement across our services in the coming years, we're going to continue to focus on them. We're also focused on other types of creators beyond video and some of the most interesting emergent behavior that we're seeing is creators using a lot of different types of content to engage their communities. We launched live audio rooms this quarter, as well as podcast. We also launched bulletin, our publishing and subscription service for writers with features now can find and grow their audiences, including integrations with groups, Facebook Live and live audio rooms. To help grow the creator economy overall, we're going to keep our creator tools free to use through 2023, and we recently announced that we are investing $1 billion in creators across Facebook and Instagram. So I'm optimistic that creators will get more opportunities to do the work that they want and that's going to lead to people hearing lots of new voices across our different services. The second area that I want to talk about today is commerce. Our goal here is to create better experiences for people interacting with businesses and to help businesses grow even more on our platform. Our approach is to work our way down the stack and build world-class services at every layer of commerce, starting from discovery, at the top of the stack, all the way down to payments. And just like we want to be the best place for millions of creators to make a living, we also want to be the best place for businesses to grow as well. We started here by building world-class ads tools to help businesses reach potential customers and help people discover new products and services that they might like, but what we found is that when these ads link off site, you often land on a webpage that's not personalized or not optimized or where you have to re-enter your payments information and that's not a good experience for people and it doesn't lead to the best results for businesses either. So our next phase here is focused on building out shops, marketplace, business messaging and WhatsApp and Messenger to create more native commerce experiences across our apps. There's a lot of work here to do to support all of the business tools natively that already exist for the web. But as we bring more of this online and enable more of this, it's going to create a superior consumer experience and it's going to convert better for businesses. This is going to lead to more businesses investing in building out their presences across our services and that will lead to even more diversity of products for people to discover and interact with. So this is a long-term strategy. It's going to take a while before it's meaningful, especially given the scale of our ads business already, but I'm confident that it's the right long-term bet in product direction.  And as we work our way down the stack from discovery and ads to native commerce storefront, we're also making progress on payments at the same time. So WhatsApp payments are now available to everyone in Brazil, as well as India. Lots of people are using this as a simple and secure way to send money to friends. We're adding new payments features in Messenger in the US like QR codes. We also just announced that we're making Facebook Pay available outside of our apps for the first time, which means that you're going to start seeing it as a checkout option on the web and especially in web view that you see within our apps after clicking on ads or other business content. The commerce experiences are now accessible across most of our services, and we have a full roadmap of deeper integrations that I'm excited about in the months ahead. The third area I want to talk about is building the next computing platform. We're continuing to invest very heavily in building technology and product to deliver a full sense of presence. This is going to be critical for unlocking the next generation of social internet services. Quest 2 in particular continues doing well and it keeps getting better monthly as we released regular software updates, including most recently our pass-through APIs so developers can start building mixed reality experiences on Quest. The range and content and experiences that we're seeing keeps broadening as well to the point where there are a lot of popular virtual reality experiences beyond games at this point. The most popular apps on Quest are social, which fits our original thesis here that virtual reality will be a social platform and that's why, while we're still focused on building it. But we're also seeing compelling use cases and other forms of entertainment as well, as well as work, creativity and fitness. Looking ahead here, the next product release will be the launch of our first smart glasses from Ray-Ban in partnership with EssilorLuxottica. The glasses have their iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things. So I'm excited to get these in people’s hands and to continue to make progress on the journey towards full augmented reality glasses in the future. Now, the areas that I've discussed today, creators, commerce and the next computing platform, they're each important priorities for us and they each can unlock a lot of value on their own. But together, these efforts are also part of a much larger goal to help build the metaverse. And I'll be sharing a lot more about this in the months ahead, so I want to discuss now as you can see the future that we're working towards and how our major initiatives across the company are going to map to that.  So what is the metaverse? It's a virtual environment. We can be present with people in digital spaces. And you can kind of think about this is an embodied Internet that you're inside of rather than just looking at. And we believe that this is going to be the successor to the mobile Internet. You're going to be able to access the metaverse from all different devices and different levels of fidelity from apps on phones and PCs to immersive virtual and augmented reality devices. Within the metaverse, you can build a hang out, play games with friends, work, create and more. You're basically going to be able to do everything that you can on the Internet today, as well as some things that don't make sense on the Internet today like dancing. The defining quality of the metaverse is presence, which is this feeling that you're really there with another person or in another place. Creation, avatars and digital objects are going to be central to how we express ourselves and this is going to lead to entirely new experiences and economic opportunities. I think that, overall, this is one of the most exciting projects that we're going to get to work on in our lifetime. But it could take a lot of work and no one company is going to be able to build this all by themselves. Part of what I've learned over the last five years is that we can't just focus on building great experiences. We also need to make sure that we're helping to build ecosystem so millions of other people can participate in the upside and opportunity of what we're all creating. They're going to need to be new protocols and standards, new devices, new chips, new software from rendering engines to payment systems and everything in between. And in order for the metaverse to fill its potential, and we believe that it should be built in a way that is open for everyone to participate. I expect that this is going to create a lot of value for many companies, up and down the stack, but it's also going to require a very significant investment over many years. I see our focus here as a continuation of our work to build technology that brings people together. In many ways, the metaverse is the ultimate expression of social technology. Some of the experiences that I've dreamed of building since well before I started Facebook are only starting to become possible now. If you look at the investments that we've made over the years, you can see this vision gradually starting to come to focus, and you could see why we're so excited about it. So, in addition to being the next generation of the Internet, the metaverse is also going to be the next chapter for us as a company. And in the coming years, I expect people will transition from seeing us primarily as a social media company to seeing us as a metaverse company. And there's a lot that we do to get there, and they're going to be many exciting milestones along the way, including some, which we'll share in the months ahead. But in the meantime, I just want to take a moment to thank everyone in our community, all of our partners and employees and everyone who have supported us so far. I continue to be grateful to be on this journey with all of you. And now, here is Sheryl."
META,2021-07-28,2021-07-29,,2021-07-29,2021-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,1,2021-07-29,prepared,,Sheryl Sandberg,"Hi everyone. Thanks, Mark. I hope you're all safe and healthy. So this was a really strong quarter for our business. Our total revenue for Q2 was $29.1 billion, which is a 56% year-over-year increase. We've seen strong growth in all regions and across most verticals. Our strongest verticals are those that have performed well throughout the pandemic, including e-commerce, retail and CPG. And we're also seeing continued recovery in others like travel that were hit hard by COVID. Our performance continues to be driven by the ongoing digital transformation, which has accelerated during the pandemic and our long-term investments in tools and products to help businesses make the shift online. Not long ago, it was much harder and much more expensive for businesses to create a digital presence, take orders online and reach customers remotely. Our tools and products make these things easier and more accessible. Businesses and creators can set up pages, profiles and chats on Facebook and Instagram. They can engage with customers directly and groups or through Messenger and WhatsApp. And they can tell their stories in creative ways with Reels, Stories or by going live on Facebook and Instagram. With personalized ads, they can easily reach the people most likely to be interested in their products or services for just a few dollars. This has helped so many businesses, especially small businesses, find success when reaching people in person have been much harder. A great example is the Pizza Cupcake, a family-owned baking business in New York City. They've been selling at pop-up shops since 2018. But when COVID hit, pop-up locations shutdown and catering events canceled. So in March last year, they became an e-commerce business. In Q3 they tested their first Facebook ad campaigns in the New York Tri-State area and by the following quarter ramped up their budget to sell across 28 states. They've since made three new hires and plan to start shipping nationwide this year. They've expanded production, which has also led to jobs being created at fulfillment centers in Maryland, Florida, Arizona and California. We're constantly working to improve the effectiveness of our ad products to help businesses like the Pizza Cupcake reach customers and create a great return on their investment. We're doing this through our investments in machine learning and monetization of newer surfaces like Stories and Reels. In all of this, we're planning for the long term. Mark talked about some of the key elements of our strategy going forward, so all focus on the strategy for the ads business. If you think about the journey we've been on over the past decade or so, we started with desktop ads on the right hand side of peoples feeds, then consumer shifted to mobile and we put ads in News Feed. Then quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, as we've created great new consumer products like Stories and Reels, we found the right way for advertisers to reach consumers within these products. And we're constantly working to make our ads deliver more for businesses and be more relevant for people. To support the growth of our ads business over the next 10 years, it's going to take a similar effort. We need to build on our success by developing innovative new products and discovery experiences, while giving everyone more control over their personal information. To build the next era of personalized experiences, we're focused on product innovations in four areas. The first is discovery. We want to keep making our apps the best places to discover products and businesses you'll love. For example, we're testing a new experience in News Feed where you can tap to browse content from businesses on topics like beauty, fitness or clothing, and reducing context to make smarter recommendations about which ads to show. So if you're watching a travel video, we could show ads for hotels and flights. The second area is commerce, which Mark touched on a moment ago. We're building a modern commerce system across ads, community tools, messaging, shops and payments. It's all about creating a personalized seamless customer journey, where it's easier to discover a product, buy it, pay for it and have it delivered to your doorstep. The third area is privacy-enhancing technologies. We know businesses are experiencing challenges because of platform changes. We want to make sure they can continue getting great results through privacy safe personalized ads long into the future. So we're collaborating across the industry to develop new technologies to help minimize the amount of personal information we process, while still allowing us to show relevant ads and measure their effectiveness. The fourth is building tools to help businesses beyond marketing. We want to help solve all kinds of businesses, whether it's customer relationship management, business messaging tools, or hiring through Facebook Jobs. We're helping people run their business across our apps easily with Facebook Business Suite. We're making it easier to message customers across our apps from a single interface, and we're expanding our Messenger API for Instagram as customers increasingly rely on messaging instead of phone calls. The digital transformation is a long-term trend that isn't going away. By focusing on innovation in these four areas, we will continue to help businesses of all sizes make the shift online and reach customers with privacy safe personalized advertising. As ever, I'm grateful to all the businesses who work with us, and I continue to be amazed by our teams all over the world. Throughout this period, we've been really lucky to have so many brilliant people working hard to keep people connected and help businesses survive and thrive online. Now, over to Dave."
META,2021-07-28,2021-07-29,,2021-07-29,2021-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,1,2021-07-29,prepared,,Dave Wehner,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered strong results in the second quarter, as our services continued to help millions of businesses reach customers around the world. Let's begin with our community metrics. We estimate that approximately 2.8 billion people used at least one of our services on a daily basis in June and that approximately 3.5 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. Our global community continue to grow, even as we lapped elevated user growth in the second quarter of last year related to the pandemic. Facebook daily active users reached 1.91 billion, up 7% or 123 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 66% of the 2.9 billion monthly active users in June. MAUs grew by 194 million or 7% compared to last year. Turning to the financials; all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $29.1 billion, up 56% or 50% on a constant currency basis. We benefited from a currency tailwind and have its foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q2 of last year, total revenue would have been $982 million lower. On a two-year basis, Q2 total revenue growth decelerated to 72% from 74% in the first quarter. Q2 ad revenue was $28.6 billion, up 56% or 51% on a constant currency basis. The macroeconomic environment for online advertising remains very strong. As Sheryl noted, the growth in the advertising revenue was largely driven by verticals that have performed well during the pandemic, such as online commerce and consumer packaged goods. In addition, we saw improved growth trends in verticals that were particularly challenged during the pandemic, such as travel, entertainment and media. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth accelerated in all regions as we lap the strongest quarter of last year. This is the second quarter of last year, which was a period hardest hit by the pandemic. Growth was strongest in the rest of world at 86%, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the US and Canada grew 63%, 56% and 48%, respectively. Europe, Asia Pacific and rest of world all benefited from currency tailwinds. In Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 6% and the average price per ad increased 47%. Impression growth was primarily driven by developing markets, especially in Asia Pacific, while pricing growth benefited from broad-based strength in advertiser demand. Recall that in the second quarter of 2020, the effects of the pandemic contributed to elevated impressions and depressed prices, which we are now lapping. Other revenue was $497 million, up 36%. Other revenue growth continues to be driven by Quest 2 sales, though the rate of growth slowed in the second quarter as we entered a seasonally slower sales period. We also recorded a revenue adjustment for returns related to the Quest 2 from facial interface recall. Turning now to expenses; Q2 total expenses were $16.7 billion, up 31% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 41% driven by consumer hardware cost payments to partners and core infrastructure investments. R&D increased 37% driven primarily by hiring to support our core products and consumer hardware efforts. Marketing and sales increased 15%, mainly driven by hiring and marketing spend. Lastly, G&A expenses increased 23% driven mostly by employee-related costs and legal expenses. We added over 2,700 net new hires in Q2, primarily in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 63,400 full-time employees, up 21% compared to last year. Second quarter operating income was $12.4 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. Our tax rate was 17%. Net income was $10.4 billion or $3.61 per share. Capital expenditures, including capital leases, were $4.7 billion driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. Free cash flow was $8.5 billion. We repurchased $7.1 billion of our Class A common stock in the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with $64.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. In terms of our sustainability efforts, we remain focused on achieving our goal to reach net zero emissions for our entire value chain in 2030. In June, we released our second Annual Sustainability Report, which details our work towards achieving our objectives. Turning now to the outlook. Similar to the second quarter, we expect that advertising revenue growth will be primarily driven by year-over-year advertising price increases during the rest of 2021. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we expect year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis, as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth. When viewing growth on a two-year basis, to exclude the impacts from lapping the COVID recovery, we expect year over two year total revenue growth rates to decelerate modestly in the second half compared to the second quarter rate. We continue to expect increasing ad targeting headwinds in 2021 from regulatory and platform changes, notably the recent iOS updates, which we expect to have a more significant impact in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. As noted in recent earnings calls, we continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations. Turning now to expenses; we expect 2021 total expenses to be in the range of $70 billion to $73 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. The year-over-year growth in expenses is driven primarily by investments in technical and product talent, infrastructure and consumer hardware-related costs. Our expense outlook reflects our commitment to invest ahead off a compelling long-term growth opportunities we see across our product portfolio. We expect 2021 capital expenditures to be in the range of $19 billion to $21 billion, unchanged from our prior estimate. Our capital expenditures are driven primarily by our investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. We expect our full-year 2021 tax rate to be in the high teens. In closing, we are pleased with the strong performance of our business and remain committed to innovating on behalf of the people and businesses who use our services around the world. With that, France [ph], let's open up the call for questions."

META,2021-07-28,2021-07-29,,2021-07-29,2021-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,1,2021-07-29,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on shopping and sort of all the Instagram and Facebook shopping efforts. And you've been sort of at this for over a year now. And Mark, I thought, your comments about, it's going to take a while, while it’s meaningful tonight were [somewhat] (ph) meaningful. Talk to us about sort of what are one or two of the key execution areas you really need to overcome to make this shopping opportunity really be larger for the company over the next few years? And then secondly on the creator economy, there's a lot of different platforms with reach and algorithm sort of attacking this creator economy. Maybe just help us better understand a little bit the way you intend to really compete for creators to bring more exclusive content to your platform? Thanks."
META,2021-07-28,2021-07-29,,2021-07-29,2021-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,1,2021-07-29,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Sure. I think I can probably take both of those. On commerce, I think the main thing to keep in mind is just the ads business is so large that it's going to take a long time before anything that we do with commerce is going to be particularly meaningful at scale. But I think overall, the strategy is really to work our way down the funnel from discovery and all the things that we're already world-class that with ads to making it so that those ads increasingly point to shops across our different services. In order to do that, each layer of the funnel that we're working on, we want to be world-class on its own, which means that basically there is this whole long tail of functionality that businesses have come to expect on the web and from other tools, and we need to make sure that that's available for shops and business messaging and all the tools, whether we do that through partnerships, with other e-commerce companies or building it up ourselves. So, we're seeing meaningful improvements every quarter in this in terms of how effective these are. There are already a pretty meaningful number of merchants and people who are using shops, and we expect this to compound over the coming years. But I just think in terms of the scale of the ads business that we're starting at, I just think realistically, we shouldn't expect that this is going to be a meaningful driver of our business or profitability in the near term, it's just going to take a while for that compounding to become meaningful numbers. But I think the strategy is the right one, it's creating a better product experience for people. When you click on an ad or when you engage with the business, it's just going to be much better to do that natively, whether you're in Instagram or Facebook or WhatsApp or whatever you're using, then go to a website that doesn't have your payment information and isn't personalized. So I think we're on the right path here, and we're focused on compounding this as quickly as we can.  I guess for the second question on the creator economy. I mean, yes, there are a number of different companies that are focused on this. I'd say there are a couple of things here that are interesting properties of this. One is that if you're a creator and you're trying to get your content out there and you're trying to make a living, you want to be in all these different platforms. So I think a lot of what we're trying to do is, it's not necessarily the case that people are going to be on one platform versus another. We just want to make it so that that creators have their best content here and that we can help them make a living better than other platforms, and we think that if we do, we'll have an advantage on content over the long term, but it's not like we fundamentally have to win creators over from another place. Our monetization tools, I think, are a pretty big advantage that we bring to the table. Our advertising is world-class, so the ability to basically help creators make more money from the work that they're already doing, I think it's something that we should really be able to bring those set of tools to the table. We also have a lot of distribution an ability for people to find their communities and help personalize recommendations to help connect people with the people who are going to be interested in their content. So, I think about that is some of what we're seeing and why a lot of creators are excited about the work that we're doing. And over the long term, I think if we are able to make it so that, millions of creators are able to make a living across our platforms, I think that's just going to mean that there's going to be a long-term breadth and healthy set of content across the systems that I think is going to be increasingly important, especially as video becomes more important on our platforms like, what we're seeing both with Watch and Reels now."

First on the DAUs, you're kind of back where you were in Q1 last year for US and Europe. How do you feel about how re-openings are affecting activity and penetration levels today, where could they go from here? And then Mark, really appreciate all the commentary on meta-universe. I think some companies would build in private. I appreciate the thoughts around that. Maybe first, what's kind of the business model on a very high level? And second, what kind of disclosures could we see on expenses around AR, VR? It looks like maybe up to 20% of job openings are Oculus. So it looks like the investments already started. I was wondering if you might be able to -- how you're thinking about giving us updates around that? Thank you."

On the DAU front, we are seeing those trends being impacted by COVID, that's especially noticeable in some of the larger markets where we have high levels of penetration like North America and in Europe. And I'd say in North America, given our high level of penetration, we do expect sort of MAU and DAU levels to sort of bounce around from quarter to quarter, given kind of how significantly penetrated we are in that market. And then in Europe, we're seeing combination of seasonal slowness, as well as COVID-related softness, when we saw a restrictions ease, obviously, with Delta, we might see other trend, it's hard to predict how that's going to play out in this cycle, but that's kind of the best read on it I can give you at this point."

Before I get into the business model, our basic playbook as a company is build products that you get to scale, especially social products. It's important that the people you want to interact with are there. So we are going to focus on having hundreds of millions of people use the metaverse and the new platforms that we're building before we really turn this into what I expect to be a very important and big part of the business. But overall, and I think that there is -- as we embark on this next chapter, ads are going to continue being an important part of the strategy across the social media parts of what we do and it will probably be a meaningful part of the metaverse too. I think commerce is going to be increasingly important, which is why we're -- one of the reasons why we're focused on this across our current apps and the current economy. But I think digital goods and creators are just going to be huge, right, in terms of people expressing themselves through their avatars, through digital clothing, through digital goods, the apps that they have, that they bring with them from place to place, a lot of the metaverse experience is going to be around being able to teleport from one experience to another. So being able to basically have your digital goods and your inventory and bring them from place to place and that's going to be a big investment that people make. And our focus for now is really on helping to develop the community, helping to develop the number of people who -- grow the number of people who can be in these metaverse experiences and can experience in the next computing platforms like virtual and augmented reality and that's I think what you should expect us to focus on for the next period. But over the long term, I think if there's going to be a very big digital economy around this. And that's where we're primarily going to be shooting for. Our business model isn't going to primarily be around trying to sell devices at a large premium or anything like that because our mission is around serving as many people as possible. So, we want to make everything that we do as affordable as possible. So as many people as possible can get into it and then compound the size of the digital economy inside it. So that's kind of at a high level how I'm thinking about this, and I'm happy to talk about this more as we continue to evolve the investments. And Dave can speak about the expenses and disclosures and all that, but I will note that that I appreciate the ingenuity and cleverness of looking to our job descriptions to just to see where we're investing. This is a big focus, as I called out in my comments at the beginning."

And Justin, I mean obviously, from a capital allocation perspective, our overall focus is on growth, and we've repeatedly called out that as it relates to our investments in innovation, FRL is a big focus area for us and a major investment driver in our expense outlook. So we have mentioned that we're investing billions of dollars annually, and we expect to invest in this area for the foreseeable future. As we make progress towards building this next computing platform, there is a lot of hard work that needs to be done. But it is a big focus, but we haven't provided any more granularity on it. Okay. France [ph], you can go ahead and go to the next question, please."

Just first on the mix of slower impression growth and then with prices the driver here for the year. Is there anything else that we should be thinking about beyond the comps from last year? And how do you think that expanding surfaces to create more ad inventory going forward? And then secondly, just curious if your view on ATT has changed over the past three months at all? And if you could comment at all just early on some of your mitigation efforts and what you're seeing there? Thanks."
META,2021-07-28,2021-07-29,,2021-07-29,2021-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,1,2021-07-29,qa,,Dave Wehner,"Yes. Sure, Doug. In terms of impression growth, we'd called out last quarter that we would expect for the remainder of 2021 for pricing to be a bigger driver of growth. And mentioned at that time, there are a few factors driving it. The biggest factor is lapping the COVID engagement that we saw that was particularly pronounced in North America, where we saw more engagement related to the lockdowns and higher impression growth last year. So that is one of the big factors. The other factor that we're seeing is a shift towards video both for our products and other products. And that's just generally a big trend in the market and that tends to have a lower impressions per the amount of engagement than things like News Feed. So kind of both those things are factors, but the COVID factor is the one that I would call out. And when you think about how we're expanding services to create more ad inventory, I would say that we've got a number of impression growth opportunities. We've seen growing impression contributions from new services, like Instagram Explore broadly within video, marketplace and then when we look forward, I think Reels is a really significant future opportunity. We've only just really begun to make ads available globally on Reels. So, when you kind of look at all of these different services, we think there are a lot of good growth opportunities. They're still small and absolute size compared to things like Feed and Stories, but big opportunities for growth. In terms of your question on ATT. So the impact from the ATT changes has really generally been in line with our expectation. We're obviously benefiting as others are, from a very strong macro environment for advertising. But look, this has been very challenging for advertisers to navigate, and we're working with them to help them navigate these changes. And we've introduced solutions to help them do that through approaches like our aggregated events management API, which is aggregated data for targeting and measurement. Obviously, we're doing a lot of work on using machine learning and AI to help rank ads and make them more valuable. But overall, we do think there are opportunities to continue to improve our capabilities through investments in areas like machine learning and AI to make ads more effective. And if we can get advertisers to get the same number of conversions from fewer ads, that's great. That works for them and it creates more value for the ads for us. Okay. France [ph], we can go to the next question?"

Back on the metaverse investments, Dave you used to take a swing at that question about how much expense associated with building out the metaverse that investors should expect? We came up with their own crude numbers of maybe 5 billion a year or are we anywhere ballpark close on that? And then given the rise in pricing, just address the issue. I know you've done it in the past to the extent to which that's had a material impact on ROI for marketers. I know it's an auction-based system, but as prices rise, is there any reason to be concerned about whether there will be some marketers that would be priced out because of that and create less optimal outcomes for your platform? Thanks a lot."

We haven't given a specific breakout on what we're investing in FRL, it's obviously a significant investment we've categorized it is billions, and so your number is billions. So it's consistent with that saying billions. But beyond that, we don't have any more specificity to get. But it is certainly a significant investment. And I would say that is inclusive obviously of all of the efforts we're making across FRL, not just the metaverse. And then on pricing and ROI, Sheryl, you might be able to give some color on that as well. You're muted Sheryl. Hang on a second."

On pricing and ROI, the beauty of an auction is that people can see the prices they're paying, they're able to measure the results and then data appropriately. As people get more specific, more personalized, more targeted in what they're doing, even if prices are rising, they can find the bias within the system that work for them. And the good news is that's good pressure in the system because it makes the ads more relevant for the people who are seeing them. Once you are really incentivized within an option to find the saying that is returning for you, that's actually almost always the same, that is the most relevant for people who are seeing the ads. And I think that's been a good system and good pressure within the system going forward. We're certainly seeing our large brand advertisers continue to spend and get better at using personalization in our ad formats. And we're seeing small advertisers be able to compete very effectively. It doesn't mean that rising prices aren't an issue some time, but I think overall, this is where the auction system serves us well, and most importantly, serves consumers well."

First for Mark, maybe going back to the metaverse vision, how much of the building blocks that you need to basically build this future is within your control versus maybe pieces that other need to build? I'm thinking, particularly around the hardware side because just listening to you, it seems like this is more of a communal thing that many, many, many people, many parties, even maybe some walled gardens would need to kind of open up to embrace this. Just wondering how you kind of look at that? And then maybe, Dave or maybe Sheryl, I want to go back to the impact of iOS 14.5 on targeting general, but maybe DR in particular, we heard from several marketers throughout the quarter that they had pulled back, not just on Facebook, but really across the board on the some ad formats like app installed ads because of ATT. I was wondering if you can maybe speak to DR versus brand? Thank you."
META,2021-07-28,2021-07-29,,2021-07-29,2021-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,1,2021-07-29,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"I can start off with the metaverse question. I do think that this is going to be a macro wave overall that a lot of companies are going to be able to ride and benefit from. So whether that companies like and videos that are building a lot of the graphics chips that are going to be really important for a lot of the content, but I think is going to be increasingly graphically intense, that certainly building those kind of graphics chips is not a thing that we're intending to get into, where certain accounting on companies like that in the industry to kind of continue improving compounding overall. But on the hardware side, I would say that we have a pretty big program on building virtual and augmented reality devices. And I mean, sure a lot of people are still going to be using phones and computers for a long time, but I think when it gets to what are the devices that are going to deliver the deepest sense of presence and that are going to be increasingly important over the next decade, we're certainly investing in that because we want to make sure that those develop in a way that's in line with the vision of these platforms helping people to interact with each other and socialize, then that means prioritizing certain feature development or certain sensors in the devices that we want to make sure that we can help push that in a direction that will help us to become a very social platform. So overall, I do think this is going to be a big space. The point that I was making is that, I think they're going to be a lot of winners and this is going to be nothing that one company builds alone, but I think it is going to be a whole ecosystem that needs to develop. So we're certainly making a lot of the key investments that we need to make in the foundational technology to be able to deliver the parts that we want to."

So in terms of Facebook ads performing well in both direct response and brand, this quarter, we continued to see solid growth across both direct response and brand. Direct response continues to be the bulk of our business and the primary driver of growth, but we did see a nice rebound consistent with others in the market of brand spend back on platform and brand obviously took a big hit on a year-ago basis, really saw a bigger pullback in brand and sub-brand came back more strongly than DR. But DR is still doing quite well. We're seeing a lot of the categories that let during the pandemic continue to do well and those are all highly DR-centric verticals like commerce, so continuing to see good performance there."

So even the categories that people are used to thinking about, I think it's more of the buy than the advertiser as our largest brand advertisers. I think many of them are becoming increasingly proficient and effective in what would traditionally be considered DR advertising."

So YouTube pays $0.50 on every dollar to the creator, about $15 billion or so this year. So I guess, Dave, what's the view on the financial model and how that might change as you guys are winning in this area? I know that influencers are getting paid maybe not directly by Facebook today, but by other folks to postings on Facebook. So I guess in the new world, are we looking at lower margins and other things that might offset like higher engagement? And then is the creator content going to be on just the new surfaces like Reels or is it likely to proliferate everywhere, including like the News Feeds on Instagram? Thanks a lot."

I mean, we already like YouTube pay a lot out to the creative industry more broadly as opposed to specific individual creators. So for instance, we pay to on the music licensing front, we do a fair amount of that, there is significant payments we make there above and beyond what we're talking about with $1 billion commitment to creators that Mark outlined. This is obviously something that is part of the cost structure, but it's something that we've long had in our outlook. So I don't think it's a meaningful change in the business model or outlook, but it is something that we're committed to helping people continue to build a vibrant communities and businesses on our platform, just like we have with advertising.

Our process has been, as I talked about, we roll out consumer products and then we find the right ad format so that businesses can take those opportunities as well. And I think that's what we're seeing. We now have Reels ads available to advertisers and almost all markets where we hold is live. It's a pretty similar format to Stories, it's full screen and in between Reels videos up to 30 seconds. We think it's a pretty natural fit in Reels. It's a really great discovery surface, and we're seeing engagement and effectiveness parallel some of our other products. And we're really pleased with that. It's still early, but we think that has a lot of potential. Do you want me to take the second question?"

So Mark, on the second question, we're obviously very focused on making sure that our ads are effective, and we've got good conversion rates for our advertising partners. So part of what we're doing there and Mark talked about this in the Q1 call is making sure that the ad units optimized for whichever experiences is converting the best. So if you've got a store, a shop on Facebook or Instagram is that converting better or is your own web store converting better and then that allows us to also just get better at making our shops and more effective. And so we want to do what's best for the advertiser and also continue to make our online and our own shops more effective.

And then with advanced AI and machine learning now seemingly table stakes for most platform companies, Mark, I'm just kind of curious if this is still a significant competitive advantage for you in your view?

So in terms of messaging, we're working on cross-dock communication between them, business messaging APIs. I mean, a lot of this is very much -- the business messaging I think is going to be an important part of commerce and helping people interact with businesses in a way that is natural to them. The cross-dock communication in terms of helping people reach people wherever they are, it kind of fits into this vision that we have for the future of people being able to easily teleport between experiences that I think it's going to be increasingly important as we move towards the metaverse. People are going to need messaging services that's going to continue to be a core way that people communicate, people are going to want to reach the people they care about, no matter what service they are on and be able to move between these. So when I talk about kind of interoperability and moving more there in the future, we're trying to get our core experiences today aligned with that as well. The other thing on messaging is the connect to the business today is that click to messaging ads are one of the parts of the ad business that is growing quickly and doing quite well. And part of that is because even if we're not charging a lot directly for the messaging APIs for businesses, that if the interactions between people and businesses end up helping businesses convert better and drive more sales and business is naturally going to want to pay to have their ads point towards that rather than other surfaces that we may not control or that may be a worst experience, so that's on the messaging side. On the AI side, I mean this is a really good question, it's probably something that doesn't come up as much on these earnings calls, as it probably should for how important of a driver of the progress in AI is for our overall results. One of the things that I've observed and just running the business over the last couple of years is there's a lot of focus on kind of different headwinds that we may face, whether it's from other platforms or regulation or different things. But one of the areas that I think has routinely outperformed our expectations is progress on AI. And we don't have a single product, which is like an AI product that's sort of the embodiment of all the AI work, that's not something that we've done yet. But basically, we've a very large investment in AI, and we build out this platform, but then all of our products used. So when we make foundational improvements, it makes ranking better, a news feed and Reels and ads and it makes our sound detection and our integrity systems more effective at identifying stuff, everything just get better and this is really been one of the big tailwinds are way of is that that we've been writing and just from what I can see technologically, on the horizon, it really doesn't seem like this is going to be slowing down anytime soon. And I don't think that this is a Facebook specific thing, I think that this is probably across the whole industry or maybe even across the whole economy more broadly. But I do think that the progress that's been made at the fundamental levels with AI is driving a lot of progress and just one of the important macro effects that we're seeing. For PyTorch specifically, I mean, it certainly helps that the framework that we use to develop our AI work is one that's embraced by the communities. So a lot of time is when we go to spin up a new project is that there already have been some team that contributed an open source library to it, and that makes it easy. So I think that there certainly are dividends that we get from having developed or help develop PyTorch to become an increasing standard, especially among researchers and it's certainly an area that we're going to focus on investing more in. I think that the core AI platform is just an important part of the progress that we're seeing overall."

Sheryl, in the past I've asked you this question, but now we're seeing it. So post-pandemic, there has been a real weakness in TV impressions. And as TV dollars are going to look like to Avon in YouTube. So can you talk a bit about your vision for video and how they may seek opportunity maybe grab some TV dollars? I mean do you expand the definition of creators to include premium video content or sports? And then for you, Dave, following up on Doug's question, can you talk a bit, I know it's early, about the learnings from your aggregated event measurement? What has been the impact on things like signal loss, ROI or spending from those who have used it in the early days? Thanks."
META,2021-07-28,2021-07-29,,2021-07-29,2021-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,1,2021-07-29,qa,,Sheryl Sandberg,"So I can talk about video ads. So we're seeing very strong growth in video monetization across Watch, Feed, Reels, and we think we're continually getting better at monetizing video. But there is still monetizing at lower rates versus feed stories, but we have a lot here. We have 2 billion people watching in stream ad eligible videos per month. Mobile first video is increasing, meaning even brand advertisers are getting better at doing mobile first video. And certainly, we think advertisers are looking for the best place to reach audiences, and we compare very favorably across the board. I'll share really I think a cool recent example, Walmart, a very larger advertiser engaged Ree Drummond, who is the Pioneer Woman cooking show host to host their first live shopping event. And the event was to launch for Walmart exclusive line of home and fashion products, and they used a mix of our personal ads to drive awareness to a live shopping event and then reengage its viewers after a purchase, and they had really great results across the board. They ran part of that live as video ads and resulted in thousands of engagements -- a lot of engagement with people and sales. And so, I think that's a good example of our products like live, combined with the use of video on our platform, combined with people taking an opportunity for video ads and putting it all together in ways. I think, will compete very favorably with other formats like TV."

I don't have specific data to share, but I mean just contextually, the work that we're doing with the aggregated events management API is part of the broader work that we're doing to rebuild meaningful elements of our ad tech. So that our system can continue to perform well, having access to less data in the future. And it really dovetails into some of the work that Mark was talking about with machine learning and AI, because that's going to be an important part of being able to make better use of less data. And so, again, why having access to the ML and AI capabilities that we have with Facebook or is going to be so important to the future and maintaining and growing the efficacy of ads. So I think broadly, we're pleased with the progress we're making on this. It is disruptive for advertisers to have to go through the process of also learning how to retool. So I don't want to lessen the impact this is having on our advertisers. I think it is a challenging period for them, and we're trying to help them work through it as effectively as we can. So with that, I think we are done. So thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call today, and hope everybody stays safe."

We made good progress this quarter across a number of product priorities and our community continues to grow. There are now almost 3.6 billion people who actively use 1 or more of our services, and I'm excited about our roadmap to keep building great new experiences for them. As expected, we did experience revenue headwinds this quarter, including from Apple's changes that are not only negatively affecting our business but millions of small businesses, and what is already a difficult time for them and the economy. Sheryl and Dave will talk about this more later. But the bottom line is we expect we'll be able to navigate these headwinds over time with investments that we're already making today. Before we get to our product update, I want to discuss the recent debate around our Company. I believe large organizations should be  (ph). So I'd much rather live in a society where they are, than one where they can't be. Good, safe criticism helps us get better, but my view is that what we're seeing is a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our Company. The reality is that we have an open culture where we encourage discussion and research about our work so we can make progress on many complex issues that are not specific to just us. We have an industry leading programs to study the effects of our products and provide transparency into our progress because we care about getting this right. When we make decisions, we need to balance competing social  (ph), like free expression with reducing harmful content, or enabling strong encrypted privacy with supporting law enforcement or enabling research and interoperability with locking down data as much as possible. It makes a good sound bite to say that we don't solve these impossible trade-offs because we're just focused on making money. But the reality is these questions are not primarily about our business, but about balancing different -- difficult social values. And I've repeatedly called for regulation to provide clarity because I don't think companies should be making so many of these decisions ourselves. I am proud of our record navigating the complex trade-offs involved in operating services at global scale. And I'm proud of the research and transparency we bring to our work. Our programs are industry-leading. We have made massive investments in safety and security, with more than 40,000 people. And we're on track to spend more than $5 billion on safety and security in 2021. I believe that's more than any other tech Company, even adjusted for scale. We set the standard for transparency with our quarterly enforcement reports and tools like the  (ph) ads archive. We established a new model for independent academic researchers to safely access data. We pioneered the oversight Board as a model of self-regulation, and as a result, we believe that our systems are the most effective at reducing harmful content across the industry. And I think that any honest account of how we've handled these issues should include that. I also think that any honest account should be clear that these issues aren't primarily about social media. That means that no matter what Facebook does, we're never going to solve them on our own. For example, polarization started rising in the U.S. before I was born. At the same time, independent research shows that many countries around the world have flat or declining polarization despite similar social media use there than in the U.S. We see this pattern repeat with other issues as well. The reality is, is social media is not the main driver of these issues and probably can't fix them by itself either. We should want every other Company in our industry to make the investment and achieve the results that we have. I worry about the incentives that we're creating for other companies to be as introspective as we have been. But I am committed to continuing this work because I believe it will be better for our community and our business over the long-term. Now we can't change the underlying media dynamics. But there is a different constituency that we serve that has always been more important, and then I try to keep a focus, and that's people. Billions of people use our services because we build the best tools to stay connected to the people you care about, define communities that matter to you, and to grow your small business. And the reason we've been able to succeed for almost 2 decades is because we keep evolving and building. Facebook started in a dorm room and grew into a global website. We invented the News Feed and a new kind of ads platform. We became a mobile first experience and then we grew a whole family of apps that serve billions of people. And there is so much more to build. Even with all of the tools that we have today, we still can’t feel like we're right there together with the people we care about when we're physically apart, we can't teleport as holograms to instantly be at the office without a commute or at a concert with a friend, or in your parents living room to catch up. The creative economy and commerce tools are still nascent, and there should be opportunity for millions of more people to make a living doing the work that they love. Our 3-product priorities remain our focus on creators, commerce, and building the next computing platform. A big part of our work with creators is our focus on Reels. Reels is already the primary driver of engagement . Is incredibly entertaining, and I think that there is a huge amount of potential ahead. We expect this to continue growing, and I'm optimistic that Reels will be as important for our products as Stories is. We also expect to make significant changes to Instagram and Facebook in the next year to further lean into video and make real and more central part of the experience. One aspect of this is giving all our apps the goal of being the best services for young adults, which we defined as ages 18 to 29. Historically, young adults have been a strong base, and that's important because they are the future. But over the last decade as the audience that uses our apps has expanded so much and we focused on serving everyone, our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them rather than specifically for young adults. And during this period, competition has also gotten a lot more intense, especially with Apple's iMessage growing in popularity. And more recently, the rise of TikTok, which is one of the most effective competitors that we have ever faced. So we are retooling our team to make serving the young adults their north star rather than optimizing for the larger number of older people. Like everything, this will involve  in our products and that will likely mean that the rest of our community will grow more slowly than otherwise would have. But it should also mean that our services become stronger for young adults. This shift will take years, not months to fully execute. And I think it's the right approach to building our community and Company for the long term. Our next product priority is commerce. Helping people discover new products that they're interested in and reach customers inside our apps. We're going to unlock a lot of opportunity. As Apple's changes makes e-commerce and customer acquisition less effective on the web, solutions that allow businesses to setup shop right inside our apps will become an increasingly attractive and important to them. We built solutions like ads that can dynamically point to either a business's website, or their shop on our platforms depending on what will perform better for them. And that will help more businesses navigate this challenging dynamic and environment. Building a full-fledged commerce platform is a multiyear journey. Marketplace is already at scale and lots of people rely on it, especially now with supply chain issues and they get harder to get new products. Shops are getting more developed. And we have an exciting program planned for this holiday season, where we're working closely with a number of the businesses that have invested the most in shops to identify what works to find new customers and grow their businesses even fast. And our plan is to then scale those solutions more broadly in 2022. Beyond Reels and commerce, I also want to share some thoughts on our longer-term efforts to build the next computing platform and help bring the metaverse to life. This is a major area of investment for us and an important part of our strategy going forward. And I believe this work is critical to our mission because delivering a sense of presence, like you're right there with another person, that's the holy grail of online social experience. Over the next decade, these new platforms are going to start to unlock the kinds of experiences that I've wanted to build since before I even started Facebook. Along with those social experiences, I expect a massive increase in the creator economy and amount of digital goods and commerce. If you're in the metaverse every day, then you'll need digital clothes and digital tools and different experiences. Our goal is to help the metaverse reach a billion people, and hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce this decade, and strategically helping to shape the next platform should also reduce our dependence on delivering our services for competitors. Building the foundational platform for the metaverse will be a long road. We just released the 128 gigabyte Quest Q, replacing the 64 gigabyte model for 299. With EssilorLuxottica, we released our first smart glasses and they are off to a strong start as well. But bringing this vision to life isn't just about building one glasses product. There is a whole ecosystem. We're building multiple generations of our VR and AR products, same time as well as a new operating system and development model, a digital commerce platform, content studios, and of course, a social platform. So to reflect the significance of this for our business, today we're announcing a change to our financial reporting. Starting next quarter, we will begin disclosing financial metrics for Facebook Reality Labs separately from our family of apps. And this will provide investors with additional visibility into the investments that we're making in augmented and virtual reality. In 2021, we expect these investments to reduce our overall operating profit by approximately $10 billion. And I expect this investment to grow even further for each of the next several years. Dave will share more about this later, but I encourage you all to tune into connect on Thursday to hear more about our vision and our work here in more detail. I recognize the magnitude of this bet on the future, and I am grateful for the support of our investors, a creative community, and the thousands of talented people working on this effort inside our Company to bring this inspiring future to life. And with that, to Sheryl."
META,2021-10-25,2021-10-26,,2021-10-25,2021-10-25T21:08:06-04:00,0,2021-10-25,prepared,,Sheryl Sandberg,"Thanks, Mark and hi everyone. This quarter, our total revenue was 29 billion up 35% year-over-year. We saw solid revenue growth across all regions, and we continue to grow our user base. We felt the impact of some big external factors in Q3. I want to explain some of the revenue softness we've seen, and what we're doing to mitigate the headwinds and help businesses over the crucial holiday period and beyond. To start, let's take a step back. Over the past decade, we've seen more and more businesses chuffed online. When the pandemic hit, this digital transformation accelerated. We've invested in tools and products over many years to help businesses make this chuffed. So this acceleration drove very strong growth for us throughout the last few quarters. We've been open about the fact that there were headwinds coming, and we've experienced that in Q3. The biggest is the impact of Apple's iOS 14 changes, which has created headwinds for others in the industry as well, major challenges for small businesses, and advantaged Apple's own advertising business. We started to see that impact in Q2, but adoption on the consumer side ramped up by late June, so it hit critical mass in Q3. As a result, we've encountered 2 challenges. One is that the accuracy of our ads targeting decreased, which increased the cost of driving outcomes for our advertisers. And the other is that measuring those outcomes became more difficult. On targeting, we focused on improving campaign performance even with the increased limitations facing our industry. We're building commerce tools to help businesses reach more new customers, and get more incremental sales. And over the longer term, we're developing privacy enhancing technologies in collaboration with others across the industry to help minimize the amount of personal information we process, while still allowing us to show relevant ads. Progress in these areas will take time and will be a focus for us throughout 2022 and beyond. On measurements, as we brought in a recent blog post, we believe we are under-reporting IOS web conversions. This means real-world conversions like sales and app installs are higher than what's being reported for many advertisers, especially fall advertisers, we're making good progress fixing that. We think we'll be able to address more than half of the under-reporting by the end of this year. And we'll continue to work on this into 2022. Another external factor is flowing e-commerce growth. The strong e-commerce growth in recent quarters was driven in part by the acceleration of the digital transformation that is now tapering off. I think most people see this in their own lives. There was a period of time when many people who are able to stay at home and order things online and much more. But now in many places, things have opened up and people are increasingly making purchases in person. That doesn't mean e-commerce has stopped growing. Businesses are still making the shift to online, but e-commerce is no longer growing at the pace it was at the height of the pandemic. These factors have been compounded for many advertisers by major global supply chain issues and labor shortages, which have left many consumer businesses with less inventory. This has reduced their appetite to generate demand from consumers, which has impacted advertising spend. Businesses in every region and across a range of verticals have been affected. At the same time, we've also seen some impact from COVID surges around the world in places like Southeast Asia. Overall, if it wasn't for Apple's IOS 14 changes, we would've seen positive quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. And while we and our advertisers will continue to feel the effect of these changes in future quarters, we will continue working hard to mitigate them. Despite the headwinds, we remain confident about our future. We believe Facebook and Instagram are the best places for people to connect with their friends and families, build communities, and starting to grow businesses. And we believe they're still the best platforms for advertisers to reach people where they are and get measurable outcomes. Our focus remains where it has always been, building products that help people connect and businesses grow. Mark talked about video a moment ago. Not only is this a growing area for us overall, but we're also continuing to get better at monetizing it. More than 60% of video revenue now comes from mobile-first video, meaning videos that are shot vertically or are under 15 seconds. Over 2 billion people per month now watch videos that are eligible for in-stream ads, which are ads shown before, during, or after videos. And we're expanding access to Reels ads on Instagram to more advertisers with automatic placement in new creative formats. Another area we're seeing good progress is in lead generation. Our products helped businesses generate quality leads at scale and meet customers where they are on their preferred channel of communication, whether it's messaging forms or calls. In April, we started rolling out a new conversion with optimization goal for higher-quality leads. And advertisers can also integrate their CRM with Facebook via our conversions API. The tests show that on average, advertisers see a 20% increase in lead to sale conversion rate when they use both the optimization goal and the integration. Q4 is the most important quarter of the year for many businesses, large and small. As always, we're focused on making the holiday season a success for them. We are working to fix the measurement issues they are experiencing, and deliver the tools and products they need to grow. And we're rolling out a range of holiday shopping experiences to help people find great deals, support small businesses, and get causes and shop with local and black-owned businesses. We're bringing exclusive gifts to shops that will be available when people checkout on Facebook or Instagram, by 20% off your first purchase and free shop -- shipping. Starting next week, we'll host daily lad shopping experiences of companies large and small, brands like Walmart, Macy's, Benefit Cosmetics, and Paintbox Nails to educate shoppers and share exclusive deals. And we're bringing back one of my favorite campaigns ever, BuyBlack Friday, to showcase black-owned small businesses during the holidays. It includes things like BuyBlack collections and a Facebook and Instagram shop tab, and a weekly BuyBlack Friday show with live shopping segments from up-and-coming black-owned small businesses. I want to close by saying how grateful I am to our partners around the world, and to our incredible teams who are working so hard to help people and businesses throughout this period. Now, here's Dave."
META,2021-10-25,2021-10-26,,2021-10-25,2021-10-25T21:08:06-04:00,0,2021-10-25,prepared,,Dave Wehner,"Thanks, Sheryl and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid results in the third quarter in the face of the challenging mobile platform landscape and an involving macroeconomic environment. Let's begin with our community metrics. Our global community continued to grow even as we lapped elevated user growth in the third quarter of last year related to the pandemic. We estimate that approximately 2.8 billion people used at least one of our services on a daily based basis in September, and that approximately 3.6 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. Facebook daily active users reached 1.93 billion, up 6% or a 110 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 66% of the 2.91 billion monthly active users in September. MAUs grew by a 170 million or 6% compared to last year. Turning to the financials, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q3 total revenue was $29 billion up 35% or 34% on a constant currency basis. We benefited from a currency tailwind and had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q3 of last year, total revenue would have been $259 million lower. Q3 ad revenue was $28.3 billion up 33% or 32% on a constant currency basis. On a user geography basis, year-over-year ad revenue growth was strongest in rest-of-world at 50%, Europe, North America, and Asia Pacific grew 35%, 31%, and 28% respectively. Europe, Asia Pacific, and rest of World benefited from currency tailwinds, though to a lesser degree than in the prior quarter. In Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 9%. The average price per ad increased 22%. Impression growth was driven primarily by developing markets, especially in Asia Pacific. Pricing growth benefited from advertiser demand in lapping COVID -related pricing weakness during the third quarter of last year. Though as Sheryl noted, growth was hindered by 3 primary headwinds. First, advertising spend was negatively impacted by performance in measurement headwinds related to Apple's changes. Second, we are seeing some macro headwinds as growth in online commerce has moderated from the elevated levels experienced earlier in the pandemic, and businesses faced supply chain disruptions. Third, COVID resurgences in Southeast Asia have led to additional lockdowns in a curtailment of economic activity. Other revenue was $734 million, up a 195% driven by strong Quest 2 sales. Turning now to expenses. Q3 total expenses were $18.6 billion, up 38% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 38% driven mostly by consumer hardware costs, core infrastructure investments, and payments to partners. R&D increased 33%, driven primarily by hiring to support our core products and consumer hardware efforts. Marketing and sales increased 32%, mainly driven by marketing spend in higher-end. Lastly, G&A expenses increased 65% driven primarily by higher legal-related costs and employee related costs. We added over 4700 net new hires in Q3, primarily in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 68,100 full-time employees, up 28% -- up 20% compared to last year. Third quarter operating income was $10.4 billion, representing a 36% operating margin. Our tax rate was 13%. Net income was $9.2 billion or $3.22 per share. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $4.5 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities. Free cash flow is $9.5 billion and we ended the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repurchased $14.4 billion of our Class A common stock in the third quarter, and had 8 billion remaining on our prior authorization as of September 30th. Today, we announced a $50 billion increase in our stock repurchase authorization. Turning now to the outlook, starting with our results for the fourth quarter of 2021, we plan to breakout Facebook Reality Labs or FRL as a separate reporting segment. As we've discussed, we're dedicating significant resources towards our augmented and virtual reality products and services, which are an important part of our work to develop the next-generation of online social experiences. The new segment disclosures will provide additional information on the performance of FRL, and the investments we're making. Under this reporting structure, we will provide revenue and operating profit for 2 segments. The first segment, family of apps, will include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services. The second segment, Facebook Reality Labs, will include augmented and virtual reality related hardware, software, and content. As Mark noted, we expect our investment in FRL to reduce our overall operating profit in 2021 by approximately $10 billion. We are committed to bringing this long-term vision to life, and we expect to increase our investments for the next several years. Ahead of the fourth-quarter earnings call, we will share additional details about the reporting format of our segments financials. Turning now to the revenue outlook; we expect fourth-quarter 2021 total revenue to be in the range of 31.5 billion to $34 billion. Our outlook reflects the significant uncertainty we faced in the fourth quarter in light of continued headwinds from Apple's iOS 14 changes and macroeconomic and COVID-related factors. In addition, we expect non-ads revenue to be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we lap the strong launch Quest 2 during last year's holiday shopping season. As previously noted, we also continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations. Turning now to the expense outlook, we expect 2021 total expenses to be in the range of $70 billion to $71 billion updated from our prior outlook of $70 billion to $73 billion. We anticipate our full-year 2022 total expenses will be in the range of $91 billion to $97 billion, driven by investments in technical and product talent and infrastructure-related costs. We expect 2021 capital expenditures to be approximately $19 billion updated from our prior estimate of $19 billion to $21 billion. For 2022, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $29 billion to $34 billion, driven by our investments in data centered servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities. A large factor driving the increase in CapEx spend is an investment in our AI and machine learning capabilities, which we expect to benefit our efforts in ranking and recommendations for experiences across our products, including in feed and video, as well as improving ads performance and relevance. We expect our Q4 2021 tax rate to be in the high teens absent any changes to U.S. tax law; we would expect our full-year tax rate in 2022 to be similar to the full-year 2021 rate. Please note that our outlook for 2022 expenses, capital expenditures, and tax rate are preliminary estimates as we have not yet finalized our 2022 budget. In closing, this was another solid quarter for our business, despite facing some headwinds. And we believe the investments we're making in our current services, as well as new products and experiences will enable us to remain the best place for people to connect and for businesses. It’s advertised both now and in the years ahead with that, France, let's open up the call for questions."

It sounds like it’s a pretty important part of long term adoption. Curious to hear about anything you'll share about current user adoption, current engagement, or more color on the demographics of people who are using Reels now. Then the second one, just a little more question on Apple and the ATT changes. I appreciate the color on accuracy and measurement improvements. Any more specifics you can share about where you've made the most progress from your investment to date, and some of the areas where you're seeing more challenges, you need to continue to invest to really improve, to navigate through this more challenging environment. Thanks."

On Reels, that's been a bright spot or for Instagram and currently we are seeing good growth globally, strengthened a number of different markets. But we've, we've been making a lot of progress on Reels and have been happy with it on Instagram. In terms of the launch on Facebook, that's earlier stage on the monetization front, we're just starting to rollout ads in Instagram, so it's earlier on that front and we really haven't gotten to a Monetization point with Reels on Facebook. Sheryl, do you want to take the iOS 14 question?"
META,2021-10-25,2021-10-26,,2021-10-25,2021-10-25T21:08:06-04:00,0,2021-10-25,qa,,Sheryl Sandberg,"Yeah, I can take that. When you start at the top of this, you really have to think about what personalized ads are. And we think they're better for people and businesses, and they're especially important to small businesses. They also can be delivered, can be done in a very privacy, safe way. There are 2 big challenges coming from this iOS changes. One is targeting and one is measurement. I'm taking the second one first. On measurement, we think we can address more than half of that under reporting by the end of the year and make more progress in the years ahead. We estimate we're underreporting iOS web conversions. We believe that real-world conversions like sales and app installs are higher. And so we have to do the work to help clients measure these properly in order for them to really understand the outcomes they're getting and improving performance. And again, we think we can get a good chunk of that done this year and more in the next year. Targeting is a longer-term challenge. Our direct response products are built on user level conversions. And as a result of the IOS changes, we don't see the same level of conversion data coming through. So we have to rebuild our targeting and optimization systems to work with less data. So this is a multiyear effort, we're developing privacy enhancing technology to minimize the amount of personal information we learn, and using more aggregate or anonymized data, while still allowing us to show those relevant personalized ads and measure ads effectiveness. In order for this to really work and benefit all businesses, team requires some cross industry collaboration and more commerce tools. And those are going to be longer-term efforts."

Maybe Sheryl, following up there, in terms of thinking in terms of quarters or years, on both the targeting and the measurement piece. Can you help us just go one level lower in terms of what you're building, in terms of what's in your control to put on into the advertising ecosystem, versus what might just take time for advertisers to adopt and get comfortable with and better understand the data that drive their business outcomes and how they allocate advertising budget, that would be for you. And then Dave, maybe if I could follow up on OpEx and CapEx, just how should we be thinking about the elements of core Facebook versus some of the things you're trying to build against Mark's vision for the long term with Reality Labs, and how that might be a driver of permanent versus transient nature of OpEx and CapEx in the years ahead. Thanks so much."

We build AI, we make continued investments in AI that help us maintain or improve long-term performance data. We're building some of our own commerce tools. And those are tools we can build that we need other people to adopt. And then some of the targeting opportunities, we see , tools we can build -- or tools we can build in industry collaboration. We're really working as part of several industry collaborative groups on what those tools will look like, and how those get adopted. So those obviously take more partnership and are less on our direct control."

On the outlook on expenses in 2022, it's obviously early, but we wanted to give an initial outlook of our expected expense range since we typically do that in Q3. Mark outlined we have a lot of priorities that we're investing against across the business that includes a lot of areas in the core sort of Family of Apps, but also in FRL. We've got a lot of priorities in advertising, AI, commerce, privacy. So when you pull all these things together, we've got a pretty robust spending plan next year. The primary driver is going to be accelerating headcount growth in 2022, so that's going to be something you'll see, headcount coming in above 20%, obviously that we have this quarter. And we also expect to have higher expenses from office operations and travel once larger parts of the workforce are returning to the office in 2022. We're not providing a specific breakdown at this point for segment expense."

Mark, just given the significant investments in both P&L expenses and CapEx. And clearly, you were talking about the heavy focus on metaverse over the long term. Just hoping you could help us recap the 1-year, 3-year, and then 5-year aspirations from a product perspective, as you've done in the past. And then Dave, just on the 2022 expenses, which is about 29% to 38% growth. Do you have any commentary on revenue growth in '22 to go along with that. Thanks."

So for the next 1 and 3 years, especially, I think what you'll see is us putting more of the foundational pieces into place. This is not an investment that is going to be profitable for us anytime in the near future. But we basically believe that the metaverse is going to be the successor to the mobile Internet that it's going to enable social experiences that are the ultimate expression of what we try to build, which is allowing people to feel really present with the people they care about, no matter where they actually are. And we think it's going to unlock a massively larger creative economy of both digital and physical good that would exist today and allow millions of people to be able to do work doing what they love, and enabling a whole different economy around that but I think there's going to be another important pillar of our business over the next decade. So on the next one to three years, I almost I wouldn't focus on the sort of business outcome there quite as much as I would just the product and the infrastructure that we're putting in place. So there's a new platform, there's hardware components, there's the whole virtual reality product line. There's Augmented Reality product line. We're kind of starting with those pieces in place. There's the operating system and development models for all these new creative tools. There's the commerce parts of what we're doing around this, and how they  a broader commerce efforts across family of apps. And then there's all the social platform work that we're doing with our Horizon effort that touches a bunch of different areas of what we're doing. But I think you'll see all of those pieces start to get built out and starts to mature a bit over the next few years. And then if we do a good job on this, and I would say later in this decade is when we would sort of expect this to be more of a real business story, but I think what we think about for the near-term as we delivering the product experiences that are completely groundbreaking, and that people try and may just think this is amazing. And can see the glimpse of where this is going. And that will pave the way for the future. And the business north star that I mentioned in my opening remarks there, we hope that by the end of the decade that we can help a billion people use the metaverse and support hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce. And I think if we can do that then this will be a good investment over that -- over the long term."

We continue to see opportunities to grow both, impressions and price next year, but we're obviously coming off an incredibly strong year of revenue growth in 2021. So we do expect deceleration in growth in 2022 from the full-year 2021 rate. And this -- there's uncertainty implied in our range for Q4 revenue, and I think that holds true for the 2022 outlook as well. There's a lot of factors at play, including advertisers working their way through the impact of the Apple platform changes. We're obviously navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment. We'll have a better sense of how these things work together as we get through the holiday season. But yeah, given the expense growth that we outlined, which is implied in the 30 -- north of 30%, we don't expect revenue growth at that level, so we would expect 2022 margins to be lower than 2021. France, we go to the next question."

I wonder if you could maybe outline some of your strategies to kind of get some progress there. I know its multi-quarter. And then Dave, in your guidance for Q4, can you help us on the IDFA impact? Is it contemplated to be about the same as 3Q, a little bit better as you work on your measurement or is a little bit more of a headwind in Q4? Thank you."

Our products are obviously widely used by young adults and we remain focused on building out those product capabilities and continuing to focus on making our products relevant for that audience. I think Reels is a big part of that strategy. And we've now got that -- we've got that rolled out in over a 100 countries since launching in August of last year. And we're continuing to invest in that experience and make ongoing product enhancements. And so that's probably one of our -- one of our big focus points that I would point to in terms of the IDFA."

I think that this is going to be very meaningful, qualitative change in how people use a lot of different products across the engine. I think every once in a while if format comes along, that allows new types of contents, right? We saw this with News Feed. We saw it with stories, and I think Reels is, from everything I've seen, has the potential to be something of that scale, where there are different flavors of it in different apps. But I think as a format, it can be very fundamental. And I think we are still closer to the beginning of that journey than we are to its maturity in terms of just having rolled out some of the initial tests and experiences and rolled it out in Facebook. And I mean, you mentioned all the countries that have been in Instagram, but it's just continuing to grow very quickly. So I think that that's going to be a big part of focus here. And I think we'll -- I'm excited over the next year or two to see how that growth, and I would bet will be like Stories is in our products today. Sorry, Dave. Go for it."

The bulk of iOS 14 updates were completed as we entered Q3, which contributed to this step-up in the impact from Q2 to Q3. Since iOS 14 is now widely adopted, we don't expect a similar step-up in Q4. But importantly, we haven't gone through a holiday season with these changes, and prices are higher during the holidays given strong demand, and so there's uncertainty how that will intersect with the challenges on targeting and measurement coming from the iOS changes. So I think that brings some uncertainty into the Q4 outlook that's reflected in our guidance range. We can go to the next question, France."

So I was hoping you can provide us an update on the Horizon. This is the social app where people can create games and experiences to share together. When will that finally come out of the closed beta? I think it's been in for the last 2 years. It seems to us that to move Facebook into the metaverse successfully, you really need to have a VR social app that's obviously cool and successful. And the other question is around, again, this focus on 18-29. Can you maybe just speak to the current trends in engagement at both Facebook and Instagram among millennials and younger audiences? I know you're speaking about a focus on going forward, but how has it been trending of late? Thank you."

The first let me say I think we have -- on Thursday connects, we're going to be going into quite a bit of detail about our vision for the metaverse and how we think we can help contribute to building this side. I encourage all of you to tune in. Part of that that we are going to talk about is Horizon, how that fits into this. And we've been steadily working on this and on boarding more creators and more people to it. And we're adding more worlds all the time. And I think you're right, I think this is going to be a critical part of at least our platform and the work that we're doing here. We released Workrooms recently. I'm really excited about how that experience has come together. And I think it's your point, you mentioned it's important to have a VR social experience. I actually think it's important to have an experience that goes across all of the platforms. I don't think we're going to end up with is just a -- coming out like a VR social network, I think you want to be able to have these experiences where you can feel present with people and have this immersive experience. It's going to be best secure in VR or in AR and your hologram. But it needs to be able to work everywhere, it needs to be able to work across our whole Family of Apps, it needs to be able to work on the web, and on phones, and on computers. So there's a lot to do. And whether we call it beta or not, I think the reality is we're going to be -- this is kind of similar to the question before about where we're going to be in a year, 3 years, there's a lot of foundational infrastructure that just needs to get built up here. And part of what we're trying to reflect in the segment reporting and all that is we're committed to doing this work. It's going to be a big investment. We want to be transparent about it. But we think it's very exciting and a huge opportunity for the future, and I encourage you to tune in on Thursday to hear more."

Our products are widely used by teens, but we are facing tough competitions from the likes of TikTok particularly and Snapchat.

On the iOS changes, is it fair to say that that's the majority -- that accounts for the majority of the headwinds that you saw in Q3 and expect to see in Q4? And then secondly, a question for Mark, just on the application of artificial intelligence to help, moderate content is the wrong word, but to try to make sure that inappropriate content is removed from Facebook and Instagram, etc. Where do you think you are in terms of getting that to be where you want it to be? I know it's been a multi-year investment journey experience. Here we are several years later, is this a specificity in task?

Yes, the Apple platform changes were the largest factor in terms of Q3 headwinds. I mean, it was really the first full quarter impact of those new ATT policy changes following just the increase consumer adoption ramp of the iOS updates. And if it really weren't for that, we would have expected sequential growth Q2 to Q3. So that was the largest headwind in the quarter."
META,2021-10-25,2021-10-26,,2021-10-25,2021-10-25T21:08:06-04:00,0,2021-10-25,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Sure. And I can speak a bit to AI. My answer is yes, I think it's made a big impact. We issued these quarterly transparency reports, which I should add we're industry-leading on this and both in terms of just finding that and in terms of the depth of what we outlined, that people can hold us accountable and kind of see the breakdown on how we're actually doing, but what we measure in those reports and disclose, is what percent of the content that we act on is our AI or  systems finding rather than people haven't reported. I'm convinced we have a lot of people who use our products, if they find something that's problematic and they report stuff to us and they used to be before the last several years, but most of what we did for community integrity was just respond to incoming reports. But we decided, hey, we should really try to get in front of this and build really sophisticated systems that we're not just relying on people to tell us when there are issues, but we can proactively go address that. And in most of these categories, and we're basically gotten to the point now where 90 plus percent of the content, we're basically -- that we act on, we're identifying largely through the AI systems and it varies a bit by category. So for categories like nudity, where it's relatively good year to train a computer to identify that. The numbers are very high. Some of the categories. like hate speech that have been harder because, first of all, we're operating and it's around 150 languages around the world. I also think there's a lot of cultural nuance in there, where you want to make sure you understand the innuendo in all those languages. And that you want to make sure that people can say and denounce racism. If someone is saying something racist to encourage someone to do something hateful that's bad. But if someone wants basically say, hey, I saw this person doing this and people shouldn't be doing that, then you don't want to censor people doing that. So it ends up being a very challenging problem. And for the first couple of years of working on this, and we're still at a relatively low recall rate. Where our AI systems had 10%, 15% of the content that we were addressing, we were dealing with proactively. But the recent years, the AI progress has been very impressive. We're now above 90% of the content that we take an action on there is also practice even with hate speech. So overall, let me take this question slightly different direction, which is I know that there's a lot of scrutiny of our efforts and I guess I just wanted to say to the team and the people who work on this. So I'm really proud of the progress that they've made. I think we have the best people in the world and we're doing the best job of it, I believe across any Company in the industry. And I think this is an important area. There should be scrutiny on it, but I also think that any honest account of what's actually going on here should take into account that a huge amount of progress has been made and will continue to be made by a lot of talented people who are working on that."

Since we're now all focusing on the 2-year CAGRs for the guidance for the high end of the fourth quarter revenue, actually has an acceleration on the 2-year CAGR. So I know we're talking about headwinds and IDFA and supply chains and everything like that, but the sequential growth looks normal. And then that 2-year CAGR is accelerating. I guess where is the strength coming from and would you call that a strong 4Q environment? And then Sheryl, you talked about overhaul and targeting longer-term to have less focus on users or userbase targeting and more contextual and other things. I guess high level. How do you think that will impact the overall return on ad spend compared to pre - IDFA levels. And how you look at Facebook's competitive position in the digital ad market, versus some of the other large platforms. Like any impact on the long-term as you kind of retool the targeting. Thanks a lot."

I think if you look at the range, it's from a sequential growth basis on a seasonal basis, Q3 to Q4. It's lower sequential growth than we've seen historically. So I do think that reflects some of the uncertainty that we're seeing out there as it relates to how IDFA -- sorry, the iOS 14 and ATT and IDFA impacts play into pricing during the holidays. And also the macroeconomic factors like the supply chain issues. So I do think the seasonal sequential growth is lower than we've seen in the past and with the range, I think that reflects that uncertainty."

I think it's hard to say here and decide exactly where we're going to end up at the all of this. It is going to be a multiyear effort. We've definitely seen a hit already, and we're definitely focused on tools to help advertisers. We think we have opportunities to strengthen targeting ourselves. Both by the work we do ourselves and as part of industry consortium. You're right in your question in that advertisers have to make a choice of where they advertise. So the question for us is how good our targeting can be compared to others. I think our targeting can suffer compared to others like Apple, who has the direct data themselves. But I think our targeting still remains, I think in very, very -- many ways, very good for advertisers. When you compare us on ROI, we've always performed well, we still do. Even though we've taken a hit and we're focused on continuing to do that for businesses."

First on the macro, are you already seeing supply-chain issues impacting 4Q ad revenue or do you expect them -- the issues to be more impactful later in the quarter. And then second question on Instagram, given the rise of Reels, is it cannibalizing engagement on the other Instagram services. Thank you."
META,2021-10-25,2021-10-26,,2021-10-25,2021-10-25T21:08:06-04:00,0,2021-10-25,qa,,Dave Wehner,"Yes, John, I mean, it's -- we're not the macroeconomic authority on all things. I would tell you that what we're hearing from advertisers is they are seeing supply chain issues that was true in Q3 and had an impact there as well as we expect that to continue to carry over into Q4. There also -- obviously that intersects with the challenges with the targeting and measurement headwinds from iOS 14. So it's hard to parse exactly how the platform issues and the macroeconomic factors will play into Q4. But I think those are the 2 biggest factors driving the range of potential outcome that we have outlined in our guidance. In terms of Reels and other IG services, I can take a crack at that, and then Mark and Sheryl want to add anything. Whenever we launch new experiences, this was true with Stories, it was true with Facebook Watch, and you’re always going to see some amount of shifting of people's time and attention to the new areas. And we do think that that benefits the experience overall, and we think that makes the overall experience more engaging over time. And we do think that it's -- we're able to with Reels drive incremental engagement with Instagram and Facebook. So that's why we're investing to do that."

And I know previously you've shared kind of merchant and user adoption metrics, but any progress you could share on that product as it relates to activity or our users are embracing it. And then the second question kind of more broadly around recruiting. I know the recent posts to create kind of 10,000 jobs, guide to the metaverse in Europe. Any particular kind of rational for how you're thinking about recruiting globally? Thanks."

People are discovering lots of products through our feed and Stories ads. This is our largest ad vertical and COVID really accelerated it, but it's also been one of the fastest growing verticals over a 5-year period. We believe we tried hundreds of billions of dollars of offsite e-commerce, gross merchandise volume today through our ads business. And we think commerce tools will be billed and layered on top of that to help businesses reach more new customers and drive more incremental sales. In these commerce efforts we'll focus on 3 areas. Continuing to be the best place to advertise, making it easier to sell on the platform, and improving the customer experience. And I think we're in different places on those in the first in terms of continuing to be the best place to advertise, we are a great place to find customers. We think that ROI is very strong and continues to be competitive. In terms of making it easier the second to sell on the platform. Here we are catching up to other mobile and web shopping experiences. And I think we have some work to do there. And in the third, improving the consumer experience to encourage people to shop. I think we're also making progress there, but we've got some room to grow."

We're going to have to do that globally. We're looking to build technical talent. We're going to be hiring people to do more remote work and focusing on that, we're going to be investing in headcount outside of the bay area and continuing to focus on building our technical and product capabilities across the globe. Europe is an important part of that, and that's why it was outlined in that announcement."

I mean, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our 2022 outlook really reflects the -- a significant increase in our plan investment in areas like AI machine learning. And a lot of that will be dedicated to investing in areas where we can use machine learning to improve ranking and recommendations to power experiences across our products. In areas like feed and in emerging areas like Reels we'll also be dedicating that to ads as we work to improve ads relevance, and leveraging. Machine learning and AI to help balance out the loss of signal that we've experienced from some of the platform changes. So we think that we can, as part of, sort of making our ads even more effective, make up for that loss with large investments on machine learning and AI side. And I think our position gives us a good ability to do that. So that's really part of the logic behind the big increase in the CapEx budget next year."

META,2022-02-02,2022-02-03,,2022-02-02,2022-02-02T20:36:03-05:00,0,2022-02-02,prepared,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining today. This was a solid quarter for our products and business. It was also an important one for our company. In October, we announced that Meta would be our new name and we laid out our vision for the metaverse. And when we shared our plans to Connect, I said this is not something we’re going to do on our own. The metaverse will be built by creators and developers, it will be interoperable, and it will touch many different parts of the economy. In the months since, it’s been exciting to see lots of other companies share their own plans for the metaverse and how their experiences and products might show up too. And I look forward to partnering with a lot of them as we work to bring this to life together.  Now last year was about putting a stake in the ground for where we’re heading, and this year is going to be about executing. And today, I’m going to discuss our seven major investment priorities for 2022: and they’re Reels, community messaging, commerce, ads, privacy, AI, and of course the metaverse. And these are the areas that we’re putting a lot more talent and budget towards. But before I get to that, I want to briefly touch on our Q4 results, which I know Sheryl and Dave are going to go deeper on. I’m proud of the work that our teams did here. We shipped products, our community continued to grow, and businesses of all sizes turned to us to help them reach people. But there are two things that I want to call out that are having an impact on our business.  The first is competition. People have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time and apps like TikTok are growing very quickly. And this is why our focus on Reels is so important over the long-term, as is our work to make sure that our apps are the best services out there for young adults, which I spoke about on our last call. The second area, and related to this, is that we’re in the middle of a transition on our own services towards short-form video like Reels. So as more activity shifts towards this medium, we’re replacing some time in News Feed and other higher monetizing services. So as a result of both competition and the shift to short-form video as well as our focus on serving young adults over optimizing overall engagement, we’re going to continue to see some pressure on impression growth in the near-term. Now I’m confident that leaning harder into these trends is the right short-term tradeoff to make in order to get long-term gains. We’ve made these types of transitions before with mobile feed and Stories, where we took on headwinds in the near-term to align with important trends over the long-term.  And while video has historically been slower to monetize, we believe that over time short-form video is going to monetize more like feed or Stories than like Watch. So I’m optimistic that we’ll get to where we need to be with Reels, too. Ultimately, our continued success relies on building new products that people find valuable and enjoy using. And in a competitive marketplace, we're focused on understanding the areas that we need to deliver on for people and executing against this strategy. Dave is going to share more on these impacts to the business in a minute. But before we get to that, I want to discuss our investment priorities for 2022. The first one is Reels. It’s clear that short-form video will be an increasing part of how people consume content moving forward, and Reels is now our fastest-growing content format by far. It’s already the biggest contributor to engagement growth on Instagram and it’s growing very quickly on Facebook, too. And as we continue to improve the tools for creators, ranking for the people watching, and as we roll out the product everywhere across the world, we expect that this will continue growing quickly. So looking ahead, we’re investing in simplifying video across Instagram, building more great creative and monetization tools for creators, and helping more people discover and interact with relevant Reels.  The next investment priority is community messaging, which is about chatting with groups of people that you have something in common with, whether that’s a shared community, interest or experience. We already run some of the world’s most popular messaging platforms where people connect one on one or in groups with friends, family and colleagues. And we’re seeing people increasingly want to share more things in messages that they would’ve previously maybe posted to feed. So I think the popularity that we’re seeing with apps like Slack in the workplace, or Discord or Telegram reflects this trend, too. So we’re going to help people on WhatsApp better organize their group chats and make it easier to find information for the communities that they’re a part of like parent groups or neighborhoods. And we’re also building Community Chats on Facebook and Messenger for real-time conversations within those groups and communities. Now I also want to call out business messaging, since it’s an area where there’s real momentum here. We estimate that there are more than 1 billion users are connecting with a business account across our messaging services every week. And we’re partnering with companies like Uber and JioMart to help people book a ride or have their groceries delivered right from a chat. And we’re building new tools to make buying online better for people and easier to manage for businesses. And we believe that this can be an important business for us in the years to come.  We're also making good progress on our broader commerce efforts. We already help a lot of businesses reach new and existing customers with personalized ads, and our commerce tools are an extension of that. It’s a seamless way for people and businesses to buy and sell through our apps. And our strategy here since introducing Shops a year-and-a-half ago has been to make it as easy as possible for people to make a purchase after discovering a new brand or product, without having to switch over to a browser or reenter their payment info. And Sheryl will share more about our progress here, including some of the success we saw over the holidays.  Next up is ads. With Apple’s iOS changes and new regulation in Europe, there’s a clear trend where less data is available to deliver personalized ads. But people still want to see relevant ads, and businesses still want to reach the right customers. So we’re rebuilding a lot of our ads infrastructure so we can continue to grow and deliver high-quality personalized ads. The next two investment priorities that I want to discuss focus on the infrastructure that underpins all our products.  The first is privacy. We’ve made huge investments in strengthening our approach to privacy, including rebuilding our privacy program and our privacy review process. So we made updates to bring greater privacy to our products, including end-to-end encrypted backups and disappearing messages on WhatsApp, and end-to-end encrypted voice and video calling on Messenger. Over the next few years, we’re focused on building out a major privacy infrastructure project that will encode our privacy commitments at a deeper level of our technical foundation to make them more durable and make product development faster in this evolving environment.  Now onto AI, this is one of the areas where we’ve routinely seen stronger returns on our investments over time than we’ve expected. Advances in AI enable a lot of the experiences that I’ve talked about so far, it enables us to deliver better ads to people while using less data; it’s core to our safety and security work; it’s meaningfully improved the relevance of Reels and overall content ranking in general; and it plays a big role in our commerce efforts. Artificial intelligence is also going to play a big role in our work to help build the metaverse. We just announced our AI Research SuperCluster, which we think will be the world's fastest supercomputer once it is complete later this year. This is going to enable new AI models that can learn from trillions of examples and understand hundreds of languages which will be key for the kinds of experiences that we’re building. Looking ahead, we’re focused on further scaling our computing power and transforming our AI infrastructure through advances in foundational research, as well as improvements to data center design, networking, storage, and software.  Now the last investment priority here is the metaverse. We’re focused on the foundational hardware and software required to build an immersive, embodied internet that enables better digital social experiences than anything that exists today. On the hardware front, we’re seeing real traction with Quest 2. People have spent more than $1 billion on Quest store content, helping virtual reality developers grow and sustain their business. We had a strong holiday season and Oculus reached the top of the App Store for the first time on Christmas Day in the U.S. We’re working towards a release of a high-end virtual reality headset later this year and we continue to make progress developing Project Nazare, which is our first fully-augmented reality glasses. As for software, Horizon is core to our metaverse vision. This is our social VR world-building experience that we recently opened to people in the U.S. and Canada. And we’ve seen a number of talented creators build worlds like a recording studio where producers collaborate or a relaxing space to meditate. And this year, we plan to launch a version of Horizon on mobile too, that will bring early metaverse experiences to more surfaces beyond VR.  So while the deepest and most immersive experiences are going to be in virtual reality, you’re also going to be able to access the worlds from your Facebook or Instagram apps as well, and probably more over time. This will enable us to build even richer social experiences where you can connect with friends in the metaverse whether they're in VR or not. We’re also focused on avatars, which will be how you represent yourself in Horizon and across other developers’ experiences in the metaverse. In December, we rolled out our Meta Avatars SDK to all Unity developers on Quest, Rift and Windows-based VR platforms, letting developers bring Meta Avatars to their own VR experiences. We just announced an update that lets you further customize your avatar to better express yourself and we’re introducing digital clothing too, starting with an NFL partnership so you can cheer on your favorite team. You can use your avatar across Quest, Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. So it serves as another bridge between our 2D social apps and 3D immersive virtual reality experiences. And we have a bunch of work ahead to make avatars as expressive and high-fidelity as they need to be to fully represent us and help us feel present with one another. But I am very excited for the advances that we’re making here.  Now making meaningful progress across all seven of these areas is going to improve the services we offer today and will help power a more social, intuitive, and entertaining metaverse, where people, businesses and creators can all thrive. And this fully realized vision is still a ways off. And although the direction is clear, our path ahead is not perfectly defined. But I'm pleased with the momentum and the progress that we've made so far and I’m confident these are the right investments for us to focus on going forward.  2022 is the first page of the next chapter for our company. I’m grateful for all the talented teams at Meta and our partners for executing on this important work. And of course for all of you who are on this journey with us. And now, here’s Sheryl."
META,2022-02-02,2022-02-03,,2022-02-02,2022-02-02T20:36:03-05:00,0,2022-02-02,prepared,,Sheryl Sandberg,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. Our total ad revenue in Q4 was $32.6 billion, which is up 20% year-over-year. The close of the year also marked the first time our business generated more than $100 billion in annual revenue. I want to congratulate our teams and thank our partners for helping us reach this milestone. Throughout 2021, we saw solid growth, which continued in Q4. But there were a number of dynamic factors that created headwinds for us this past quarter in addition to those Mark described around competition and our shift to short-form video. We were lapping a period of strong demand in 2020 that benefited from very strong growth in online commerce, which has since slowed. Q4 was also the first holiday season after Apple's iOS changes, which have had an impact on businesses of all sizes, especially small businesses who rely on digital advertising to grow. This will continue to be a factor in 2022. We've also heard from advertisers about other macro trends that contributed to the headwinds in Q4, including global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and inflationary pressures. A number of industry reports have pointed to people shopping earlier in the holiday season to avoid potential supply chain issues and shipping delays. This is in line with the behavior we saw from advertisers, many of whom front-loaded their spend earlier than usual. Mark talked about 7 areas of investment. I'd like to talk about our progress in 3 of those: ads, commerce and messaging. First, ad. Like others in our industry, we faced headwinds as a result of Apple iOS changes. As we described last quarter, Apple created 2 challenges for advertisers: one is that the accuracy of our ads targeting decreased, which increased the cost of driving outcomes; the other is that measuring those outcomes became more difficult. These challenges are complex and interrelated. We're working to try and improve things, for example, by making progress in closing the underreporting gap for iOS web conversions and by introducing tools like our aggregated event measurement solutions to deliver better insights for advertisers. These efforts will help to mitigate some of the challenges. But we expect the overall targeting and measurement headwinds to moderately increase from Apple's changes and from regulatory changes in Q1 and throughout 2022. On the shift to short-form video, I want to emphasize that while we’re going through a transition, we’re optimistic. Right now, Reels monetizes at a lower rate than Feed and Stories, but we expect this to improve over time. We’ve made successful transitions before the shift from web to mobile, and then another shift from Feed to Stories. We have a playbook here. The experience we have from monetizing Stories is directly applicable, so we’re not starting from scratch. We think that over the long term this shift will be a success for us and our partners too.  Second, commerce. We launched a number of new tools in Q4. We released new features like ratings, reviews and community replies to product questions, and significantly improved Checkout stability. We brought Shops to Groups, and we started testing Live Shopping for creators, an early glimpse of the immersive shopping experiences that will be possible in the metaverse. Our commerce strategy remains focused on three areas: continuing to be the best place for advertisers to find customers and get strong ROI; making it easier to sell on our platform; and improving the customer experience.  We still have a lot of work to do compared to other mobile and web shopping experiences, but we’re seeing promising early signs. It’s great to see businesses and consumers using social and immersive shopping experiences like Product Tags, Drops, and Live Shopping. A good example is The Laundress, a premium fabric care and home cleaning brand from Unilever that wanted to build awareness of a new line it developed with the musician John Mayer. In November, they launched exclusively on Instagram for 24 hours, and hosted a Live Shopping event: a conversation between John Mayer and Laundress Co-Founder Lindsey Julia Boyd, where people could buy the new products as they talked about them live. The hour-long event generated more than $40,000 in sales. Overall, we’re pleased with the engagement we saw with our commerce tools over the holiday season and view Q4 as a promising milestone in our multi-year journey.  Third, business messaging. Our focus is on helping businesses and consumers connect. Our largest monetization effort is Click to Messaging ads, where you click on an ad in your Facebook or Instagram feed and it opens a chat with the business in Messenger, Instagram Direct or WhatsApp. It’s a great way for businesses to drive engagement. And we’ve seen lots of demand from consumers who want to use our messaging apps for everyday services like utilities, financial services, education and travel.  In Q4, we expanded the types of information people can choose to receive from businesses and the formats in which they can interact. We’re continuing to invest in new tools to make it easier for people to get help and make purchases right from a chat. More than 150 million users globally now view a business catalog on WhatsApp each month. And new features like Collections on WhatsApp help businesses organize their products and make it straightforward for people to find things to buy.  As we enter 2022, our focus is where it has always been: building products that help people connect and businesses grow. We’re making long-term investments to evolve our business and continue to drive real value for our partners. In the coming year, we’ll continue to invest in things that improve ad performance for our clients, in short-form video like Reels, and in making the commerce experience better for consumers and marketers on our platforms. As ever, I’m grateful to our partners around the world – big and small – who we learn from every day. And to our teams at Meta who work so hard to help businesses through the holiday season and beyond. Now, here’s Dave."
META,2022-02-02,2022-02-03,,2022-02-02,2022-02-02T20:36:03-05:00,0,2022-02-02,prepared,,David Wehner,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. As we announced in October, beginning this quarter we are reporting revenue and operating income in two segments: Family of Apps and Reality Labs. I will begin by discussing our consolidated results before moving to segments and ending with our outlook. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. We delivered solid results in the fourth quarter, ending a strong year for our business as full year 2021 total revenue grew 37% to nearly $118 billion. Q4 total revenue was $33.7 billion, up 20% or 21% on a constant currency basis. Unlike the first three quarters of 2021, we experienced a currency headwind in Q4 and had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q4 of last year, total revenue would have been about $307 million higher. Q4 total expenses were $21.1 billion, up 38% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items: Cost of revenue increased 22%, driven primarily by Reality Labs hardware costs, core infrastructure investments, and payments to partners. R&D increased 35%, driven primarily by hiring to support Family of Apps and Reality Labs as well as increased Reality Labs R&D operating costs. Marketing & Sales increased 34%, mainly driven by marketing spend and hiring.  Lastly, G&A increased 107%, driven primarily by legal-related costs and employee-related costs.  We added over 3,700 net new hires in Q4, the majority in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 71,900 full-time employees, up 23% compared to last year. Fourth quarter operating income was $12.6 billion, representing a 37% operating margin. Our tax rate was 19%. Net income was $10.3 billion or $3.67 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $5.5 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. Free cash flow was $12.6 billion. We repurchased $19.2 billion of our Class A common stock in the fourth quarter and we ended the quarter with $48.0 billion in cash and marketable securities.  Moving now to our segment results. I’ll begin with the Family of Apps segment. Q4 Total Family of Apps Revenue was $32.8 billion, up 20%. Q4 Family of Apps ad revenue was $32.6 billion, up 20% or 21% on a constant currency basis. On a user geography basis, year-over-year ad revenue growth was strongest in Asia Pacific at 31%. Rest of World, Europe, and North America grew 28%, 20%, and 15%, respectively. Currency was a modest headwind in all international regions.  In Q4, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 13% and the average price per ad increased 6%. Impression growth was primarily driven by Asia Pacific and Rest of World, while impressions in North America declined 6% year-over-year. On a global basis, impression growth benefited from ad load increases and user growth. This was partially offset by engagement-related headwinds as we faced increased competition for people's time and a shift of engagement within our apps to video surfaces like Reels, which show fewer ads than Feed or Stories today. Pricing growth was broad-based across regions. Worldwide pricing growth slowed from the third quarter as we lapped stronger growth in the year ago period and faced currency headwinds. Pricing was also negatively impacted by advertisers facing challenges from macroeconomic factors and measurement and targeting headwinds.  Family of Apps other revenue was $155 million, down 8% due to a decline in payment revenue earned from games. Family of Apps expenses were $16.9 billion, up 35% due to higher legal-related costs, employee-related expenses, marketing, infrastructure-related costs and payments to partners. Family of Apps operating income was $15.9 billion, representing a 48% operating margin. We estimate that approximately 2.8 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in December, and that approximately 3.6 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. Facebook daily active users were 1.93 billion, up 5% or 84 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 66% of the 2.91 billion monthly active users in December. MAUs grew by 115 million or 4% compared to last year. Facebook user growth was impacted by a few headwinds in the fourth quarter. In Asia-Pacific and Rest of World, we believe COVID resurgences during prior periods pulled forward user growth. User growth in India was also limited by an increase in data package pricing. In addition to these factors, we believe competitive services are negatively impacting growth, particularly with younger audiences.  Within our Reality Labs segment, Q4 revenue was $877 million, up 22%, driven by strong Quest 2 sales during the holiday season. Reality Labs expenses were $4.2 billion, up 48%, driven by employee-related costs, R&D operating expenses and cost of goods sold. Reality Labs operating loss was $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2021, Reality Labs operating loss was $10.2 billion.  Turning now to the outlook. We expect first quarter 2022 total revenue to be in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion, which represents 3% to 11% year-over-year growth. We expect our year-over-year growth in the first quarter to be impacted by headwinds to both impression and price growth.  On the impressions side, we expect continued headwinds from both increased competition for people’s time and a shift of engagement within our apps towards video surfaces like Reels, which monetize at lower rates than Feed and Stories.  On the pricing side, we expect growth to be negatively impacted by a few factors. First, we will lap a period in which Apple’s iOS changes were not in effect and we anticipate modestly increasing ad targeting and measurement headwinds from platform and regulatory changes. Second, we will lap a period of strong demand in the prior year and we’re hearing from advertisers that macroeconomic challenges like cost inflation and supply chain disruptions are impacting advertiser budgets. Finally, based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency to be a headwind to year-over-year growth. In addition, as noted on previous calls, we also continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations.  Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect 2022 total expenses to be in the range of $90 billion to $95 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $91 billion to $97 billion. Our anticipated expense growth is driven by investments in technical and product talent and infrastructure-related costs. We expect 2022 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $29 billion to $34 billion, unchanged from our prior estimate. Our planned capital expenditures are primarily driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities. As we discussed previously, this range reflects a significant increase in our AI and Machine Learning investments, which will support a number of areas across our Family of Apps. While our Reality Labs products and services may require more infrastructure capacity in the future, they do not require substantial capacity today and, as a result, are not a significant driver of 2022 capital expenditures.  Onto tax. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full year 2022 tax rate to be similar to the full year 2021 rate. Separately, today, we announced that our Class A common stock will begin trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol META in the first half of 2022. The new ticker symbol aligns with our rebranding from Facebook to Meta.  In closing, 2021 was a strong year for our business and an important year for the company as we aligned our corporate identity with our long-term ambition to build the next generation of online social experiences. We are investing aggressively in 2022 to support our product road map as we work to deliver new and engaging experiences for people and support the businesses and creators who rely on our services.  With that, Frans, let’s open up the call for questions."

META,2022-02-02,2022-02-03,,2022-02-02,2022-02-02T20:36:03-05:00,0,2022-02-02,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on the Reels transition. You all talked about how you've been through other transitions in the past with Mobile and Stories, et cetera, and you successfully navigated through. Is there anything that's unique or more challenging about the Reels transition that makes you think it could take potentially longer to sort of scale those ad products for this format as opposed to other formats in the past? Then the second one, Dave, when you sort of talk about the headwinds around ad targeting and measurement becoming larger in the first quarter and in 2022, is there anything other than sort of year-on-year data comps there? Or are you expecting other changes from a signal perspective? And maybe help us understand any further changes you expect to come on the signal loss perspective? Thanks."
META,2022-02-02,2022-02-03,,2022-02-02,2022-02-02T20:36:03-05:00,0,2022-02-02,qa,,David Wehner,"Yes. Thanks, Brad. I can probably take both of those -- or yes. So on Reels, I mean I think there's a lot of the characteristics of Reels that makes it quite similar to the transitions that we've gone through before. As in the past when we were focused on Stories, we're really focused on consumer experience and really making short-form video work effectively on both Instagram and Facebook, and we're already seeing that to be the biggest driver of growth on Instagram, and it's growing very quickly on Facebook. So we're really encouraged by what we're seeing. But we're really focused on making the consumer experience right. And over time, we do think it's a format that will work effectively for advertising, and we think the experience that we have for Stories will really lend itself well in the Reels format. So we're confident in our ability to monetize over time. But right now, there's relatively few ads in story -- sorry, relatively few ads in Reels today. So it's definitely something that from an impression growth and monetization perspective is going to be a headwind. On iOS 14, we saw the revenue impact with iOS 14 -- sorry, iOS just in general, in Q4, and that was in line with our expectations and similar to the Q3 headwind. But obviously, as we go into 2022, we're going to be lapping a period in which in Q1 and Q2, those headwinds were not in place in the year ago period. So that definitely makes for a tough comp in the first half of the year. And we believe the impact of iOS overall as a headwind on our business in 2022 is on the order of $10 billion, so it's a pretty significant headwind for our business. And we're seeing that impact in a number of verticals. E-commerce was an area where we saw a meaningful slowdown in growth in Q4. And similarly, we've seen other areas like gaming to be challenged. But on e-commerce, it's quite noticeable -- notable that Google called out, seeing strength in that very same vertical. And so given that we know that e-commerce is one of the most impacted verticals from iOS restrictions, it makes sense that those restrictions are probably part of the explanation for the difference between what they were seeing and what we were seeing. And if you look at it, we believe those restrictions from Apple are designed in a way that carves out browsers from the tracking prompts Apple requires for apps. And so what that means is that search ads could have access to far more third-party data for measurement and optimization purposes than app-based ad platforms like ours. So when it comes to using data, you can think of it that it's not really apples-to-apples for us. And as a result, we believe Google Search ad business could have benefited relative to services like ours is based a different set of restrictions from Apple. And given that Apple continue to take billions of dollars a year from Google Search ads, the incentive clearly exists for this policy discrepancy to continue."

I think when we've gone through these transitions before, you've talked a little bit about what you're seeing from an engagement standpoint about Reels and how levels of engagement compared to other forms of engagement from a consumer perspective on the property and what the differential might be in terms of wallet's early innings in terms of differential ad pricing and how you think to close that gap. Is there any willingness you're able to give us on both engagement levels or pricing differential, so we can think through what the transition scope might need to be? And then, Sheryl, on the last call, if I remember correctly, you talked about elements of as we move into Q1 in the first half, some of the workaround efforts that the team were trying to implement would start to show some efficacy. Can you give us an update on where you stand internally on workarounds and broader advertiser community acceptance of some of the workarounds on targeting and measurement as we move into the first half? Thank you."
META,2022-02-02,2022-02-03,,2022-02-02,2022-02-02T20:36:03-05:00,0,2022-02-02,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Sure. I can start with your first question on some of what we're seeing on engaging -- engagements. Reels and short-form video overall are very engaging. And a lot of what we're seeing is that there is -- people are spending a lot more time. And I think I mentioned this in my script upfront that it's growing very quickly. This is already the biggest contributor to engagement growth on Instagram. I think it's one of the biggest contributors that we're seeing to positive engagement on Facebook too already. But I think, going back to the last question, there was a question on what -- are there any factors here that will -- what are the similarities and differences to what we've seen in the past. The big similarity is that this is certainly not the first time that we've gone through a major format evolution. And what these transitions all had in common from Desktop Feed to Mobile Feed, Feed to Stories and now to Reels in the beginning, our ad system and business are not as tuned for the new format. So as the engagement of the new thing starts to replace some of the engagement and the old thing, it creates a near-term headwind for revenue, but it's not that part - at this point now, is not that big of a concern for us. I mean it makes some of the stuff not as clear in the near term, but over the long-term, we're pretty optimistic about that. The dynamic that I think is actually a little bit different with Reels than what we've seen with Stories and Mobile Feed in the past. And with Reels, I would say that the teams are executing quite well, and the product is growing very, very quickly. The thing that is somewhat unique here is that TikTok is so big as a competitor already and also continues to grow at quite a faster rate off of a very large base. And so that -- to the question that was asked before around are we like -- that was asked before around, is there anything that's going to make it so that we -- it takes us longer to kind of get to where we want on this, is that even though we're compounding extremely quickly, that's -- we also have a competitor that is compounding at a pretty quick rate, too. But overall, back to the question, Reels, it's extremely engaging. I think overall engagement will grow as a part of this. And that's why we're optimistic about the future, but there's a lot of work to do here."
META,2022-02-02,2022-02-03,,2022-02-02,2022-02-02T20:36:03-05:00,0,2022-02-02,qa,,David Wehner,"And then, Sheryl, were you going to take the second part of the question on the mitigation front?"
META,2022-02-02,2022-02-03,,2022-02-02,2022-02-02T20:36:03-05:00,0,2022-02-02,qa,,Sheryl Sandberg,"Yes. So when we talked about mitigation, we've said there are 2 key challenges from the iOS changes: targeting and measuring performance. On targeting, it's very much a multiyear development journey to rebuild our ads optimization systems to drive performance while we're using less data. And as part of this effort, we're investing in automation to enable advertisers to leverage machine learning to find the right audience with less effort and reduce reliance on targeting. That's going to be a longer-term effort. On measurement, there were 2 key areas within measurement, which were impacted as a result of Apple's iOS changes. And I talked about this on the call last quarter as you referenced. The first is the underreporting gap. And what's happening here is that advertisers worry they're not getting the ROI they're actually getting. On this part, we've made real progress on that underreporting gap since last quarter, and we believe we'll continue to make more progress in the years ahead. I do want to caution that it's easier to address this with large campaigns and harder with small campaigns, which means that part will take longer, and it also means that Apple's changes continue to hurt small businesses more. The second area underneath the measurement challenge is really -- are really data delays. As part of the iOS changes, we and many other ad platforms, we receive less granular conversion data on a delayed basis. And what advertisers shared with us that this makes real-time decision-making, especially difficult, and that's particularly important during the holiday period, where people are often spending a lot and really monitoring their ads and adjusting spend not even on a daily basis, but often on an hourly basis. And that was one of the challenges we faced during this holiday quarter."

META,2022-02-02,2022-02-03,,2022-02-02,2022-02-02T20:36:03-05:00,0,2022-02-02,qa,,Justin Post,"A couple. Mark, just on a big picture basis, you're adding a lot of short-form video and maybe the content shifting from content from your friends to general content, what does that mean for Facebook? I'm sure you've thought about a lot of it. But how do you think about the evolution of Facebook as a platform? And then for Dave, as you think about the measurement and targeting challenges, when we get out to September and October, should we be effectively lapping the issues? Or is there the reason to think it could actually get worse in the second half, just thinking about revenue growth kind of reaccelerating?"
META,2022-02-02,2022-02-03,,2022-02-02,2022-02-02T20:36:03-05:00,0,2022-02-02,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"I can take the first one. So for Facebook, I think content from your friends is always going to be an important part of the experience. And so we'll be discussing stuff that you find with friends, whether it's in a group or community or public content or Reels or news or different content like that. But I think overall, you're right, that the balance of content that people see in Feeds is shifting a little bit more towards stuff that isn't coming from their friends, which you may discuss with your friends, but it is kind of shifting towards more public content. I think, at the same time, we're seeing this trend where if you can do your day-to-day behavior on a lot of this stuff, this pattern may resonate with you. But a lot of people now are taking a lot of the content that they may have previously shared in a Feed and sending it to friends over Chats, whether it's one-on-one or through group chats. And this is one of the reasons why I called out community messaging as one of the major priorities for us. Because if you look at the overall constellation of services, a lot of the kind of personal sharing is sort of shifting towards messaging. And a lot of the -- what we're seeing in Feeds is just basically this content consumption and a lot of just really highly engaging content that forms the basis for conversations, whether it's in Chat or in common trends in those Feed apps. But that that type of creative work is a lot more of what we're seeing across the Feed apps, so whether that's Facebook or Instagram."
META,2022-02-02,2022-02-03,,2022-02-02,2022-02-02T20:36:03-05:00,0,2022-02-02,qa,,David Wehner,"Justin, it's Dave. On the second part of your question, it's really about sort of what's the landscape of headwinds look like as it relates to targeting and measurement. And there, I think what we're seeing is kind of 2 things going on: we've got incremental headwinds coming from things like iOS 15, which provides some additional sort of targeting and measurement headwinds. But those are far less significant than the changes made with iOS 14.5, which really started to have an impact more seriously on the business in the second half of last year. So I think that lapping effect is going to be very pronounced in the first half of the year where we're lapping periods that didn't have that impact. So that's where we're going to see the biggest impact from the lapping. But we're continuing to fix more headwinds as it relates to like iOS 15 and also further regulatory headwinds that restrict the use of data for targeting purposes in regions like Europe. So we're continuing to see headwinds. I think we're working to mitigate those. But the biggest lapping effect will be in the first half of the year where we didn't have the big iOS 14 headwinds in the same period last year."

Can you just talk about where you are in that process? Clearly, we've seen some just curious if there's more in the product pipeline and could that deeper integration potentially have even greater drag on revenue going forward? And then, Dave, just curious if you're willing to comment on a Reality Lab spend or a loss number in '22?"
META,2022-02-02,2022-02-03,,2022-02-02,2022-02-02T20:36:03-05:00,0,2022-02-02,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"I didn't talk about the first piece. I mean, I think we're probably a little further along than just the beginning, but I'd say we're closer to the beginning than the end of the trend on Reels. There's a big flywheel here where more creators share more content. And because we have a mix of content in the Feeds from all different types, we're only going to show Reels or recommend them. If we feel like there's high-quality content to show as there's more high-quality content, we show more of it. There certainly will be a lot more. We think it's growing -- it is going to grow a lot going forward, we believe. And engagement on both of those platforms. So yes, I mean I think that we probably will see as we're forecasting. And I think Dave has talked about here, the relative monetization rate of Reels for the next, I don't know, for whatever the foreseeable future is, will be lower than Feeds as we kind of displace some of that with this. But over time, we think that there's a potential for a tremendous amount of overall engagement growth and we think that in a steady state over time, we think that Reels should monetize closer to Feeds or Stories than other longer-form video. So I think we're optimistic about it. And I think that that's -- we think it's definitely the right thing to lead into this and to push us hard to grow real as quickly as possible and not hold on the brakes at all, even though it may create some near-term slower growth than we would have wanted. That's kind of -- that's the picture that I see. I don't know if you want to add anything to that?"

That's what's kind of factored into the guidance we’re providing specifically for Q1. And then, Doug, on the expense outlook, we're not breaking out expenses by segment. But I probably can give some color here. We're expecting accelerated headcount growth in 2022 to be the biggest contributor of expense growth and that's largely in tech and product roles to support the 7 product priorities that Mark laid out: Reels, community messaging, commerce, ads, probably AI in the metaverse. And the -- a number of those investment priorities map to our Family of Apps segment, and we expect Family of Apps to continue to drive the majority of expense growth in 2022. Though we do expect Reality Labs operating loss to increase meaningfully in '22, and that's incorporated into our outlook."

Could you just -- there's been a series of steps that have been taken, reducing the ability to do political targeting, the introduction of the Take a Break feature within Instagram, and maybe a few other things that arguably have been put out there to kind of address some of the ESG concerns. Where do you think you are in terms of addressing some of those that we've heard in the investment community?

So if you kind of aggregate the changes that we're seeing across iOS, that's sort of the order of magnitude. We can't be precise on this. It's an estimate. We've got ranges on the impact to our business. So we think it's a substantial -- the substantial headwind to work our way through. And obviously, we're working hard to mitigate those impacts and continue to make ads relevant and effective for users. I don't have anything specific on the ESG front.

I know it may be early, but any color maybe to share on growth on users and engagement by maybe age groups? And then probably another question for you. I'm curious about when you think we can start seeing the kind of the mesh in of apps like Instagram with AR and VR and the interoperability of these apps. Is that something where you think we're going to see gradually evolve? Or something that gets kind of opened only once the matter is sufficiently built up whenever that is?"

I think what we said about overall kind of user growth is we're certainly seeing an impact from strong competition, particularly with younger audiences. So that's true, and we're kind of seeing that globally. If you look at kind of the overall user growth landscape for the fourth quarter, we're seeing MAU and DAU in the U.S. and Canada sort of bounce around at sort of expected and indicated given our high level of penetration. And then if you look at the Rest of World, we've seen some headwinds there, kind of a little bit unique in the quarter in areas like India, where we saw data plan pricing increase lead to slower growth there. So that's another kind of some unique elements of the quarter on that front."

And in terms of when there's some aspects to the metaverse showing up, I mean I talked about avatars in my remarks at the beginning and how we're making it to kind of increasingly both expressive and eventually, and we've shown some demos around photorealistic avatars of yourself that you can show up in all the different apps and your avatar can show across Facebook and Instagram and Messenger as well in Quest, and we'll expand that further. And I think I also commented before about our goal for 2022 to make it so that Horizon works not just in immersive VR but on 2D screens as well. Something you could potentially jump into those kind of worlds from Facebook or Instagram or different apps as well. So I think you're seeing some of that stuff will -- is already there. Some of it will come over the course of this year. Of course, the ability to message across apps is something that we've been working on for a while. You can already do that across Messenger and Instagram and there's more there that that we'll roll out over time as well.

How has Reels differentiated versus TikTok, YouTube Shorts and other short-form video services? And one for Sheryl, any further color on how SMBs are changing ad spend budget since the iOS changes? And is it slowing adoption of new SMB advertisers on Facebook?"
META,2022-02-02,2022-02-03,,2022-02-02,2022-02-02T20:36:03-05:00,0,2022-02-02,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Sure. So I can start with Reels. One of the things that I think we've seen is that there are some fundamental formats in social media like Feeds and Stories, and now I think this Reels short-form video format, that within the context of a different network or community, the same format will take on different characteristics. So for example, the kind of discussions that you might have in a feed on Twitter or on Pinterest are different from what you would do in Facebook or Instagram, even given a relatively similar format. So I think, to some degree, even if a creator chooses to reshare their content across the number, you'll have different discussions with your friends across the different services based on who's there. And then there's a social dynamic where friends and different communities create these as well. So seeing somewhat different Reels across Facebook and Instagram, and I'm sure you see different stuff across TikTok too. But what we're seeing is that this is all growing incredibly quickly. So it's hard to know exactly where this is going to settle in the end, but we just think the appetite that people have -- there's been this long-term trend that I commented on a number of times where over the time that I've been running this company, 18 years this week, basically, we've gone from text being the primary way that people share and consume content online at the beginning of the early 2000s to -- until we got cameras on our phones and photos became the primary thing. And now that mobile networks are starting to get -- gotten really good, video is really becoming the primary thing, and it is a lot more natural and engaging. This is partially, by the way, why I think that an even more immersive format around virtual reality and augmented reality is going to be the kind of next step after video and why we're so invested there. But definitely, what we're seeing with short-form video is it's the next step from the kind of visual feeds that we have and the amount of engagement and content that people want to share and interact with and whether it's taking it and sending it to a friend in messaging or commenting online or just having fun watching it themselves. It's -- in general, we're seeing people spend a lot more time on this than what we've seen from apps so far. And that's also reflected in the success that other apps like TikTok have had. So there's a lot more to go here. We think we will have competitors across the industry. But as we've seen with some of these other formats too, it will feel different depending on the context in which it's implemented and the content from your friends."

So it's a good question because as we've said, the iOS changes definitely hurt advertisers across the board, but they're much harder for SMBs. The progress we made on the measurement gap, which I talked about before, we've made more progress with larger clients than we have with SMBs. It's also the case that personalized ads are more important for SMBs. And SMB really needs to buy a very small targeted audience that they're looking for and the larger the business, the more you're able to personalize the ad less. So we're definitely seeing that this has more of an impact for SMBs. We do feel, over the long run, that we believe we have strong benefits for SMBs and using our ad system. We are going to continue to work on these measurement gaps and continue to make sure SMBs can use it. We're also working hard on SMBs adopting some of our commerce tools and some of our other solutions like business messaging and seeing some success there. But you are right that this remains a challenge."

Mark, if we look at short-form video, how do you feel right now about the state of your content and you're matching algorithm relative to where you want it to be? I mean do you have the content you need? Are you getting it in front of the right users? Or is there a lot of room to improve this and drive more engagement? And then, Sheryl, where exactly are you in terms of rebuilding the ad product? And what are the key things you need to see to kind of roll out or what do our customers either need to adopt or do on their end to really start to see improvement to reel ads and a return on that budget? Like are there certain features like  that you need to get adopted? Are there tools in the pipeline? Are there things they need to do on their end? And what do we need to see to see that come back?"

But I think sometimes when we say that there's -- that we're closer at the beginning, what that means is that we still have a lot of kind of fundamental questions to overcome in order to make progress to get where we're going. With this product, what we see is, there is very clear product market fit, and it is growing incredibly quickly. It -- we face a competitor in TikTok that is a lot bigger, so it will take a while to compound and catch up there. But fundamentally, we think that there's a lot of potential for it to continue growing.  So to your question, do we have the content that we need, it's a flywheel. So the better tools that we can build for creators and the better monetization we can offer them, which tends to be an advantage that we have over other competitors is how effective our monetization and ad systems are, then I mean the bigger it gets, the more it will attract more creators, and it will kind of build on itself. And we think that we're earning at a scale where we're seeing that flywheel really kick in and start to grow. And if it keeps on compounding at the rates that it's growing at, this is going to grow extremely quickly over the next year and potentially beyond that. But yes, I think that's kind of the best summary that I can give of where we are. Clear product market fit, growing quickly, a long way to go to catch up to be the biggest in the space. But I think the pieces are in place and the focus is certainly there at this point to really go after that. It's just that as this grew, it is -- at least for the coming quarters, it's going to monetize at a somewhat lower rate, which is reflected in the guidance that Dave gave. But again, I think this is clearly the right strategy for us to push on. This is what people want. They enjoy the product. We're going to -- so we're just going to roll it out as quickly and as well as we can."

In the short run, as I talked about, we're working on measurement, we're rolling out new to help businesses continue to measure campaigns using Apple's SK ad network, API and Meta's aggregated events measurement and conversion modeling. So we have specific products that people can adopt that help us. Over the longer term, we need to develop privacy-enhancing tech to help minimize the amount of personal information we learn and we use. Use more aggregate, use more anonymized data while still allowing us to show relevant ads and that's going to take us time. But one thing I do want to point out is there are also a lot of things that small businesses and large businesses can do to take advantage of the many targeting and measurement tools we have. So while we have seen an impact from these changes, we also didn't start from a place where 100% of our millions and millions of advertisers are using the tools that are available. So while we continue to get those that were all the way on the adoption curve to learn and adapt to these changes, there are also advertisers out there can continue to work on and improve their performance. We still believe there's a lot of performance improvement left in the system."

This hasn't come up yet, but it was down about 6 points year-on-year. And I know that you had kind of forecasted the expense growth that you came in at for '21. But I think that downtick is coming as a bit of a surprise for some folks who thought your ad business had fairly stable margins. So any more color on what's driving that? Is that just the revenue headwinds that you're experiencing or any other lumpy items? And then related to that, as you build out short-form video, how has your thinking evolved around paying rev share like YouTube does? Or other things like that to catalyze the shift? Any thoughts on that?"

I think in terms of lumpy items, I mean, you will see that G&A was up a pretty substantial amount in Q4, so a part of that is related to legal-related expenses. Those tend to be lumpy, so there was a factor there. I think, in general, as it relates to Family of Apps and margin, I'd come back to the commentary that I made on the investments that we're making in Family of Apps being an area where we're investing heavily in 2022 across the priorities that Mark outlined, including Reels, messaging, commerce and ads. There's a big investment that we're making on the CapEx side that's primarily geared towards AI and machine learning for the family of apps business, so -- segment. So there's a lot of investments that we're making there. What was, I'm sorry, the second question? Oh, yes, in terms of payments to partners, that clearly will play into the expense profile as we grow that -- as we grow short form, so that's also reflected as part of the guidance for expenses. So over time, that will be an impact as well, and that's part of the investment that we're making on the Reels side and is factored into the 2022 outlook."

We made progress this quarter across a number of our priorities, and our community continues to grow. More people use our services today than ever before, and I'm proud of how our products are serving people across the world during what has been a difficult period for a lot of people. I talked last quarter about some of the near-term challenges facing our business. Some are specific to Meta, like our transition to short-form video, which doesn't monetize as well for now, but which we're quite optimistic about over the long-term. Some are specific to our industry, like signal loss resulting from Apple's iOS changes, which is a meaningful headwind, but we also expect that with the right technology investments, we'll navigate okay over time. Other challenges are broader macro trends, like the softness in e-commerce after the acceleration we saw during the pandemic. The war in Ukraine, which is a real tragedy on a humanitarian level, has also had an impact on our business. We've been blocked in Russia and we decided to stop accepting ads from Russian advertisers globally. We've also seen effects on business globally following the start of the war. Taking a step back, I want to share some thoughts on our business trajectory and operating philosophy. First, I think it's useful to level-set on our business trajectory over the last few years. After the start of COVID, the acceleration of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth, but we're now seeing that trend back off. However, based on the strong revenue growth we saw in 2021, we kicked off a number of multi-year projects to accelerate some of our longer-term investments, especially in our AI infrastructure, business platform, and Reality Labs. These investments are going to be important for our success and growth over time, so I continue to believe that we should see them through. But with our current business growth levels, we're now planning to slow the pace of some of our investments. Dave will give more detail in his commentary. I also want to share how I'm thinking about investments and margins. Last year, we began looking at our business as two segments, Family of Apps and Reality Labs. On the Family of Apps side, I am confident that we can return to better revenue growth rates over time and sustain high operating margins. In Reality Labs, we're making large investments to deliver the next platform that I believe will be incredibly important both for our mission and business are comparable in value to the leading mobile platforms today. Now I recognize that it's expensive to build this, it's something that's never been built before and it's a new paradigm for computing and social connection. So over the next several years, our goal from a financial perspective is to generate sufficient operating income growth from Family of Apps to fund the growth of investment in Reality Labs while still growing our overall profitability. Unfortunately, that's not going to happen in 2022, given the revenue headwinds, but longer-term that is our goal and our expectation. Of course, our priority remains building for the long-term, so while we’re currently building our plans to achieve this, it’s possible that prolonged macroeconomic or business uncertainty could force us to trade off against shorter-term financial goals. But we remain confident in our long-term opportunities and growth. Now with that, I want to dive deeper on what we're seeing in three of our main investment priorities that I expect to drive this growth: Reels, Ads and the Metaverse. So let's start with Reels. There are two key trends that we're seeing here: first, the increasing popularity of short-form video; and second, the advancement of AI recommendations driving more of our feeds rather than just social content. On the first point, since I started Facebook 18 years ago, we've seen multiple shifts in the media types that people use. We started as a website primarily with text. Then people got phones with cameras, and the main format became images on mobile apps. In the last several years, mobile networks have gotten faster and now video is the main way that people experience content online. Short-form video is the latest iteration of this, and it's growing very quickly. Reels already makes up more than 20% of the time that people spend on Instagram. Video overall makes up 50% of the time that people spend on Facebook, and Reels is growing quickly there as well. The second point is that while we're experiencing an increase in short-form video, we're also seeing a major shift in feeds from being almost exclusively curated by your social graph or follow graph to now having more of your feed recommended by AI, even if the content wasn't posted by a friend or someone you follow. Social content from friends and people and businesses you follow will continue being a lot of the most valuable, engaging and differentiated content for our services, but now also being able to accurately recommend content from the whole universe that you don't follow directly unlocks a large amount of interesting and useful videos and posts that you might have otherwise missed. Overall, I think about the AI that we're building not just as a recommendation system for short-form video, but as a Discovery Engine that can show you all of the most interesting content that people have shared across our systems. In Facebook, that includes not just video but also text post, links, group posts, reshares and more. In Instagram, that includes photos as well as video. In the future, I think that people will increasingly turn to AI-based Discovery Engines to entertain them, teach them things, and connect them with people who share their interests. I believe our investments in AI, all the different types of content we support, and our work to build the best platforms for creators to make a living will increasingly set our services apart from the rest of the industry and drive our success. We're also finding that having an ambitious vision around building the world's Discovery Engine is attracting a lot of the most talented AI folks to work on this program. Next, let's talk about Ads. Sheryl will discuss this in more detail, but I want to highlight that this is also a large AI investment for us. There are three main trends to highlight in our ads business right now. First, we're managing headwinds from the shift to short-form video that I just mentioned. In the near-term, this is a drag on revenue because Reels monetization is less than feed or Stories, but I expect that will improve over time. We've seen this type of media format transition multiple times before. Back in 2012 when we transitioned from desktop feed to mobile feed, we saw mobile feed growing massively but not monetizing well yet, and we leaned into it, went through some tough quarters, and then it became the foundation of our business today. Similarly, in 2018, when people started using Stories more instead of Feed, but Stories didn't monetize as well as Feed yet, we still doubled down on Stories, had another tough period, but came out stronger than ever. So we've run this play before and we're running it again now. We're focused on growing Reels as a major part of the Discovery Engine vision, and we expect that this expansion in engagement to shift from a short-term headwind to a tailwind at some point. Now while this is playing out, we're also managing the headwinds from signal loss that we've discussed a lot recently. This means growing first-party understanding of what people are interested in by making it easier for people to engage with businesses in our apps, whether that's completing purchases on Facebook or Instagram, or messaging businesses on WhatsApp or Messenger. It also means making sure that we build the best privacy enhancing technologies to provide accurate targeting and measurement to advertisers even when purchases aren't happening within our apps. We're making major AI investments to build the most advanced models and infrastructure in the industry. Over the next year or two, we hope that this drives better recommendations for people, higher returns for advertisers, and increases our revenue growth even in the face of signal loss. Over the longer term, I think that these large technology investments can provide a sustainable competitive advantage over others in the industry. The last priority that I want to discuss today is the metaverse. While we're focusing on the biggest opportunities and challenges of today, I think it's important to build the foundation for the next era of social technology as well. The centerpiece of our strategy is the social platform that we're starting to build with Horizon. It's still early but as we build out the experience, the next focus will be on growing the community. We plan to launch a web version of Horizon later this year that will make it easy for people to step into metaverse experiences from a lot more platforms, even without needing a headset. I think the best experience will be on virtual and eventually augmented reality platforms and especially on our platforms like Quest, where in an upcoming release, from the moment you put on your headset you’re going to be embodied with your Meta avatar and ready to interact in Horizon with your friends right from your Quest home. But making this available everywhere will mean you can interact with anyone on whatever device or platform that they want to use. Our other focus for Horizon is building out the metaverse economy and helping creators make a living working in the metaverse. We expect to be meaningfully better at monetization than others in this space, and we think that should become a sustainable advantage for our platforms as they develop. On the hardware side, Meta Quest 2 continues to be the leading virtual reality headset. Later this year, we'll release a higher-end headset, codenamed Project Cambria, which will be more focused on work use cases and eventually replacing your laptop or work setup. This premium device will have improved ergonomics and full color passthrough mixed reality to seamlessly blend virtual reality with the physical world. We're also building in eye tracking and face tracking so that your avatar can make eye contact and facial expressions, which dramatically improves your sense of presence. It's also a good example of why we're developing hardware in addition to the social platforms. We're bringing Horizon to more platforms, but if you want to be able to make eye contact or have your physical facial expressions just automatically get translated to your avatar in real-time, then our hardware will provide the best metaverse experience, whether you're playing a game or meeting with co-workers in Horizon Workrooms. We'll share more details about Project Cambria in the months ahead as we get ready to launch it. I believe the areas we've discussed today are the right places for us to be doubling down on our work. The questions we face are not going to be resolved overnight, but we've also faced a number of these challenges before so I'm confident that we can navigate this period while continuing to invest in our future. I'm grateful for everyone on our team executing on this important work, for our partners, and for our investors who believe in us and the future that we're building together. And now, here's Sheryl."
META,2022-04-27,2022-04-28,,2022-04-27,2022-04-27T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-04-27,prepared,,Sheryl Sandberg,"Thanks Mark, and hi everyone. Our total ad revenue in Q1 was $27 billion, which is up 6% year-over-year. We saw solid growth in APAC and Rest of World, but a more challenging environment in North America and Europe. Despite the headwinds Mark described a moment ago, we saw meaningful growth in areas like video ads and Click-to-Messaging ads. The changes to the ads landscape over the last year have caused significant disruptions to the ways many businesses advertise online. Our teams are working closely with our partners to help them navigate this new environment so they can continue to get great return-on-investment. And we’re focused on building products and tools that grow their businesses and ours over the long-term. I want to pick up on what Mark said about our ads strategy. As he described, it’s focused on three main areas. One, growing video monetization, especially short-form video like Reels, two, evolving our ad systems to do more with less data and three, investing in AI and machine learning to support our ads infrastructure. First, video. Half of the time spent on Facebook is video, and video surfaces on Facebook were a significant source of revenue growth in the first quarter. People already watch a lot of longer form video content that’s eligible for in-stream ads, which we monetize well. Stories monetization continues to grow across Facebook and Instagram. And with Reels growing quickly, there’s also a big opportunity as we get better at monetizing short-form video over time. We’ve accelerated our efforts to improve the Reels ads format. Our experience monetizing Stories is directly applicable here. Sorry. We’re leveraging what we learned with Stories ads to create ads for Reels that have a native format, perform well, and are easy for advertisers to create. We’re working closely with our partners to help them make the most of the opportunity with video, like experimenting with new formats and with campaigns that utilize multiple types of video ads. A great example is the U.S. restaurant chain Wendy’s. They used a range of video formats across feed, Stories, Reels and in-stream to promote their March Madness campaign, driving consumers to the first virtual Wendy’s restaurant in Horizon Worlds. We also worked with them to promote the campaign in Horizon Worlds itself, with a virtual welcome screen directing people to what they called the Wendyverse. The campaign was a big success, reaching 52 million people, and improving Wendy’s brand and message awareness across a number of metrics. Second, evolving our ads system. Our focus is on paving the way for the next era of personalized advertising, and there’s work we’re doing over the near, medium and long-term. In the near-term, we’re working closely with advertisers to help them navigate the new landscape, while we evolve and improve our ad solutions. For example, we’re encouraging partners to integrate with our conversions API to create a direct, reliable, and privacy-safe connection between their marketing data and Meta. And we’ve recently introduced a faster and easier way for SMBs to integrate with it called the Conversions API Gateway. One way we’re helping advertisers get better insights with less data is with conversion modeling. This can help them understand measurement and campaign performance, even when we’re not able to see or aggregate certain conversions. We’re also helping businesses connect directly with customers and grow more onsite data conversions through products like Click-to-Message ads. This is where you click on an ad in your Facebook or Instagram feed and it opens a chat with the business in Messenger, Instagram Direct or WhatsApp. It’s already a multi-billion dollar business, with healthy double digit year-over-year growth in Q1. A great example is Deichmann, Europe’s largest footwear retailer. They built a fully automated virtual Shoe Assistant to give customers personalized footwear recommendations, and promoted it through Click-to-Messenger ads on Facebook. They had an 85% click-through rate and saw 30% more incremental purchases than with their usual link ads. In the medium-term, we see an opportunity to grow other onsite conversion products like Lead ads, which make it easier for businesses to generate leads, and Shop ads, which direct you to a brand’s digital storefront on Facebook or Instagram. It’s still very early for Shop ads, but we think driving people to shops can be a compelling objective for commerce advertisers as we continue to improve our onsite commerce tools. Over the longer run, we’re also developing privacy-enhancing technologies which will help us minimize the amount of personal information we process, while still allowing us to show people relevant ads and measure performance for advertisers. And we’re collaborating across our industry on these and other standards that will support this next era of personalized advertising. Third, AI and machine learning, which are crucial components of these privacy-enhancing technologies and will drive improvements over time to our ads ranking and measurement capabilities. We’re significantly increasing our investment in AI and machine learning across the company this year and a large portion of this is going towards ads. We continue to innovate in order to deliver better performing ads in general, and these investments will help us do that while processing less individual level data. We also have a range of automated tools to make it easier for advertisers to create, manage and improve the performance of their ad campaigns. We’re constantly working to improve these tools and make them simpler for advertisers to use. Taken together, we think our range of solutions can help advertisers get better results now and over the longer term. We’re confident our apps will continue to be the best places for advertisers to reach people where they get measurable outcomes long into the future. As ever, I want to say thank you to our partners, large and small. And to our teams who are working so hard to deliver great results for businesses everywhere. Now, here’s Dave."

All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $27.9 billion, up 7% or 10% on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q1 of last year, total revenue would have been about $893 million higher. Q1 total expenses were $19.4 billion, up 31% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items: Cost of revenue increased 17%, driven primarily by core infrastructure investments, payments to partners and content-related costs. R&D increased 48%, mainly driven by hiring to support Family of Apps and Reality Labs. Marketing and sales increased 16%, mainly driven by hiring and marketing spend. And lastly, G&A increased 45%, driven mainly by legal-related costs and employee-related costs. We added over 5,800 net new hires in Q1, the majority in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 77,800 full-time employees, up 28% compared to last year. First quarter operating income was $8.5 billion, representing a 31% operating margin. Our tax rate was 16%. Net income was $7.5 billion or $2.72 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases were $5.5 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. Free cash flow was $8.5 billion. We repurchased $9.4 billion of our Class A common stock in the first quarter and we ended the quarter with $43.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now moving to our segment results. I’ll begin with the Family of Apps segment. Q1 total Family of Apps revenue was $27.2 billion, up 6%. Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $27 billion, up 6% or 10% on a constant currency basis. Growth decelerated from the fourth quarter due to a variety of factors. Prior to the war in Ukraine, we faced expected headwinds related to the continued slowdown in our online eCommerce vertical, which had grown quickly during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as ongoing targeting and measurement challenges impacting advertising spend. We experienced a further deceleration in growth following the start of the Ukraine war due to the loss of revenue in Russia as well as a reduction in advertising demand both within Europe and outside the region. We believe the war introduced further volatility into an already uncertain macroeconomic landscape for advertisers. Foreign exchange rates were also a headwind to growth in the quarter. On a user geography basis, year-over-year ad revenue growth was strongest in rest of world and Asia Pacific at 21% and 20%, respectively. North America grew 1% and Europe was flat year-over-year. Europe advertising revenue was disproportionately challenged by the factors related to the war in Ukraine. In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 15% and the average price per ad decreased 8%. Impression growth was driven primarily by Asia-Pacific and rest of world. The year-over-year decline in pricing was driven primarily by the ongoing mix shift in ad impressions towards regions and surfaces that monetize at lower rates. Family of Apps other revenue was $215 million, up 9% as revenue growth from the WhatsApp Business API offset a decline in payments-related revenue earned from games. Family of Apps expenses were $15.7 billion, up 27% driven mainly by employee-related expenses, infrastructure costs and legal costs. Family of Apps operating income was $11.5 billion, representing a 42% operating margin. We estimate that approximately 2.9 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March, and that approximately 3.6 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. Facebook daily active users were 1.96 billion, up 4% or 82 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 67% of the 2.94 billion monthly active users in March. MAUs grew by 83 million or 3% compared to last year. Europe DAUs and MAUs declined sequentially and were negatively impacted by the loss of users in Russia following the government’s block of Facebook in the country. We expect this trend to continue in the second quarter and this will likely cause Global MAU to be flat to down sequentially. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $695 million, up 30%, driven by Quest 2 sales. Reality Labs expenses were $3.7 billion, up 55%, driven by employee-related costs, R&D operating expenses and cost of goods sold. Reality Labs operating loss was $3 billion in the first quarter. Turning now to the outlook. We expect second quarter 2022 total revenue to be in the range of $28 billion to $30 billion. This outlook reflects a continuation of the trends impacting revenue growth in the first quarter, including softness in the back half of the first quarter that coincided with the war in Ukraine. Our guidance assumes foreign currency will be approximately a 3% headwind to year-over-year growth in the second quarter, based on current exchange rates. In addition, as noted on previous calls, we continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations, and we are pleased with the progress on a political agreement. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect 2022 total expenses to be in the range of $87 billion to $92 billion, lowered from our prior outlook of $90 billion to $95 billion. We expect 2022 expense growth to be driven primarily by the Family of Apps segment, followed by Reality Labs. We expect 2022 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $29 billion to $34 billion, unchanged from our prior estimate. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full year 2022 tax rate to be above the Q1 rate and in the high teens. In closing, our advertisers are adjusting to a new digital advertising landscape brought about by recent mobile platform changes while navigating a complex set of macroeconomic challenges. Given the resulting revenue headwinds, we have adjusted our plans for hiring and expense growth this year. We continue to see a lot of opportunity across our investment priorities and remain committed to dedicating additional talent and capital towards these areas while ensuring our investment plans are appropriately calibrated to the operating environment. With that, France, let’s open up the call for questions."

META,2022-04-27,2022-04-28,,2022-04-27,2022-04-27T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-04-27,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on Reels engagement. Appreciate the color about the percentage time it’s going through Reels. I wanted to ask about the incrementality of that time. Maybe can you talk to us a little bit about what you’re seeing on total time spent on both core Facebook, as well as Instagram in the U.S., as you’re seeing this really strong Reels engagement moving through the overall user base. And then the second one, Dave, I wanted to ask you about CapEx. Understanding this year there’s investments in AI and machine learning, et cetera. How should we think about how much of this year’s CapEx is sort of one-time-ish, they may not persist on a multi-year basis? Or is it better to think of it as maybe the capital intensity of the business could just be structurally higher going forward? Thanks."
META,2022-04-27,2022-04-28,,2022-04-27,2022-04-27T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-04-27,qa,,Dave Wehner,"Brian, I’ll take a crack at both of those, and then Mark can add any color if he wants. In terms of cannibalization, Reels does pull time away from other surfaces, but we do believe it’s additive to overall engagement. And we’ve seen that in the past with other products like Stories. And so we’re seeing a similar pattern there. In terms of overall engagement for both Facebook and Instagram, there’s a lot of complexity with kind of looking through the period of COVID because that tends to create a lot of different peaks and troughs in engagement. But if you look back, engagement for both Facebook and Instagram, remain above the levels they were at pre-pandemic and that’s true both globally and in the U.S. So I think we’re pleased with that. On the CapEx front, let me just sort of address the overall ramp. It’s true we are investing significantly in AI and machine learning investments to power ranking and recommendations for things like Ads, Reels and Feed. And so that does add to the CapEx intensity of the business. And we do think there is additional capital intensity of the business as we make significant investments in AI and machine learning on top of just additional capacity growth. We’re not sharing an outlook beyond 2022 at this point. France, you can go to the next question. Go ahead."

Mark, I think one of the questions we get the most from investors is when you think about where you’re trying to go with the Metaverse longer term, how do you think about the investment cycle versus the monetization cycle when you think about creating hardware, both on the physical side and the distribution layer for hardware versus the content and the creator cycle you need to solve for on the Metaverse over the medium to long-term? And second, I don’t know if I missed it or not, but I think last quarter, you called out on the Apple privacy changes, that the headwind might get worse in Q1 than it was in Q4. Can you give us an update on how those headwinds continue to evolve? And whether what you built over the last couple of years have somewhat future-proofed against future changes that Apple might make in the iOS ecosystem? Thanks so much."
META,2022-04-27,2022-04-28,,2022-04-27,2022-04-27T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-04-27,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes, I can give some context on the first one, and then Dave can speak to the second question. I think that the cycle here between investment and meaningful enough revenue growth to be near or very profitable is going to be long. I think it’s going to be longer for Reality Labs than for a lot of the traditional software that we’ve built. And if you think about – just a bit of context that may be useful on why we’ve ramped expenses so much is especially with the success that we’ve seen with Quest 2, we’re now basically funding product teams to be building our future products two or three versions into the future. Because when you’re designing hardware, these are multiyear plans that you’re building and kind of figuring out all the pieces that are going to go into that. So we have multiple teams in parallel that we’ve sort of now spun up. This goes for VR as well as augmented reality and the other work that we’re doing and is sort of driven by the success that we feel like we’re seeing in the markets and the technology is starting to be ready to really ramp up. So those expenses, we’re experiencing today. I mean, having those teams operating is something that you see weigh on the results and is one of the reasons why I think the growth rates and expenses have been so high, and I think we’ll continue investing more over some period. But at some point, we will have all those product teams fully staffed for a few versions into the future and then the growth rates there will come down. But it’s not going to be until those products really hit the market and scale in a meaningful way and this market ends up being big that this will be a big revenue or profit contributor to the business. So that’s why I’ve given the color on past calls that I expect us to be later this decade, right? Maybe primarily, this is laying the groundwork for what I expect to be a very exciting 2030s when this is like – when this is sort of more established as the primary computing platform at that point. I think that there will be results along the way for that, too. But I do think that this is going to be a longer cycle. Some of the software parts of what we’re doing in the Metaverse will, I think, have near-term opportunities to monetize. And I think we’ll see how that goes. Certainly, Horizon will roll out across all platforms and there will be a number of things that we can do there that will have shorter cycles that might resemble a little bit more what we’re used to with apps. But overall, I think that’s kind of the context that I want everyone to have on that."
META,2022-04-27,2022-04-28,,2022-04-27,2022-04-27T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-04-27,qa,,Dave Wehner,"Eric, I’ll take the second part – the second question that you had. We expect – we’ve expected ongoing privacy headwinds from the iOS changes, and we continue to see them. Those are obviously factored into our Q2 outlook, along with the impact on demand that we’re seeing from things like the war in Ukraine. More specifically, ATT continues to be a headwind, but we’re also seeing incremental headwinds from iOS 15 and other regulatory changes. And again, we factored all of those headwinds into our Q2 outlook. Of course, any outlook on platform headwinds depends in part on the platforms themselves and how they write and enforce their policies. So I’d sort of put that caveat in as well. When you look at what we’re doing to mitigate those near-term, we’re working on improvements to our current solutions and Sheryl talked about some of those like privacy-enhanced technologies. Medium-term, we see the opportunity to move clients more toward on-site conversions. We’re seeing a lot of success in things like Click-to-Messaging ads, lead gen ads and then more nascent effort in Shop Ads. And then longer-term, we’re rebuilding our ads stack to employ more machine learning and AI to be more effective at ads with less data. So we think we’ve got a response that we’re building into the new environment, and we’re optimistic about the future."

You gave an outlook for maybe $10 billion headwind this year. Is it fair to assume a decent chunk of that in Q1 and when you lap that in Q4, you could see progress? And then I think there is a lot of concern for the social companies on Apple 16 potential changes with IP addresses and other factors. In the past, you’ve been able to call out potential headwinds. In the future, I’m wondering if you have – if you can say anything about iOS 16 or how you’re thinking about potential future Apple changes? Thank you."
META,2022-04-27,2022-04-28,,2022-04-27,2022-04-27T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-04-27,qa,,Dave Wehner,"Yes, sure. On the $10 billion impact, we shared our estimated $10 billion impact on ATT last quarter to give a sense of the order of magnitude, and we believe it’s still to be that order of magnitude on the expected impact. It’s not a precise point estimate and we don’t plan to update it. Also worth noting, it’s – that’s not a – it’s not a lapping. There was an impact from ATT in the second half of last year as well. So that’s not a – all in the increment. There was an impact last year. Also beyond ATT, we expect to see additional targeting and measurement headwinds from iOS 15 and other regulatory changes. I don’t think we have anything at this point to share about 16. And then I think also, Justin, you asked about sort of the second half, we would expect the growth rate in Q3 to be modestly higher than the Q2 rate since we will be lapping the first full quarter impact of ATT in Q3, but there’s obviously a lot of uncertainty baked into our Q2 outlook, and that implies uncertainty in the second half as well."

First for Mark, just curious as AI curation of content takes over from social cues, I was hoping you could talk about what some of the biggest changes will be to the user experience and then perhaps monetization as well long-term? And then second, in terms of Reels, how do you think about the timing for turning on ads more? And what needs to happen in the product for that to happen? Thanks."
META,2022-04-27,2022-04-28,,2022-04-27,2022-04-27T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-04-27,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes. So I can talk about the AI-driven recommendations and discovery engine part. And I mean, maybe I can start to give some context on the ads too, and then someone else can jump in there. I think the biggest shift here is that now the universe of content that are candidates to show in a person’s feed is way bigger. It used to just be, okay, here are the people, here are the friends or businesses or pages that you follow. Maybe it was on the order of 1,000 or a few thousand potential posts a day that we could show and we built news feed system that could help rank those to show the most interesting ones to you at the top. But fundamentally, that was more a challenge of ranking a relatively small number of posts in the order that would be optimal. Now it’s a much more open-ended thing. There are millions of pieces of content that we could potentially show a person. And as our understanding of people and our understanding of content gets better through AI, we’re now better able to, across all different content types, text, links, photos, short-form videos, long-form videos, everything basically built to understand what the content is about, match it more with what people are interested in, which just means that there’s a lot more candidates to show people. The social content from your friends, I think will continue being a lot of the most unique and valuable content in the system, so that will still be there. But in addition to that, you’ll now have a lot of other interesting content. So overall, what does that mean? I think it will – this will be a – it will make the services more interesting. It will mean that there’s more interesting stuff to consume and interact with, both in Facebook and in Instagram, which should contribute to engagement over time. The parts of this that are about Reels, I think have some specific monetization questions where we need to ramp up that format. But the parts of this, which are just about showing better content in feed, should actually monetize quite naturally. And that’s something that I think we’re going to – we’re starting to see that kind of ramp-up in Facebook and Instagram already as a part of the experience. On the Reels monetization side, I mean, I think the main question here is, there’s the cycle, which – I mean, Sheryl should probably jump in and talk a little bit more about this. It just takes some time for all the advertisers to optimize the creative, right? It’s like when we started doing Stories, they had ads that were designed for news feed. And it just took some time for them to create effective content for Stories. And I think we’re going to see the same thing for Reels. And the way we think about the pacing of this is that we do show ads with Reels, but we’re going to show more as the content gets better and as that ramps up to not be a big kind of pain point in the user experience, where we basically match this, so that way as the ads get better across all these different formats, we’re willing to show more of them. And that’s why improving the quality of ads has also been really important for our business. So I’m not sure if there’s anything else you want to add on that, though, Sheryl."
META,2022-04-27,2022-04-28,,2022-04-27,2022-04-27T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-04-27,qa,,Sheryl Sandberg,"No, I think it’s a really important thing to think about because it’s something we’re very optimistic about. We have great consumer engagement on Reels. We have fast growth. And we have a playbook for taking that kind of consumer engagement and rolling out ads into the experience. This is going to be a multiyear journey like Stories, but it’s one we’re very optimistic about. And as Mark said, it’s about helping advertisers create the format of ads that matches the content. Now what we’ve learned over time is the more we do for our advertisers, the better off we are, the more we automate it, the more we can help them target, the more we can help them form the creative and the experience we have putting ads and Stories is directly applicable. But the other reason we’re really optimistic is we think this can create great results for advertisers. And at the end of the day, advertisers are chasing ROI, they’re going to go where they get a return on their investment. And while this still monetizes at a lower rate versus feed and Stories, advertisers who are using it are seeing really promising results. I’ll share an example. Prose is a direct-to-consumer hair care brand, and they A/B tested adding a Reels ad placement to their usual campaign, they saw a 23% lower cost per purchase, a 52% higher unique audience reach and 3x higher video completion. So what that says is that this format works not just for this advertiser, but we’re hearing this from many across the board and we think we can help a lot of advertisers adopt this in the coming years."

First, Mark, on the regulatory front, it looks like European and U.S. regulators are getting more aligned on how to proceed to address issues like antitrust and interoperability, the news on the transatlantic data transfers seems pretty positive. Just stepping back and looking at the new environment that seems to be formed, particularly between European and U.S. regulators, do you see this as being more favorable or less favorable to Facebook? And then maybe this is for Dave. With the stock down so much, can you maybe talk about employee retention and how you think about cash comp versus stock-based comp in the current environment? Thank you."

Now is a really critical and interesting time in regulation for our industry because the rules that are governing the Internet are being rethought and rewritten, certainly in Europe but increasingly around the world. You spoke about the DMA. We expect DMA to have significant challenges for our industry. We’re working with European regulators on these rules. They are largely in the range of what we were expecting, but the final text has not been released yet, and the details on this will matter. But overall, the regulatory environment is a real challenge for our industry. One, we think we are well set up to meet working closely with regulators and doing things in our technology like privacy-enhancing technologies to do more with less data. But we expect this to can be – this to continue to be a significantly challenging time, not just for us, but across our whole industry."

So on the retention and recruiting front, I mean, I’d say we continue to have success in recruiting as demonstrated by the 5,800 net new hires this quarter. So we're pleased with our ability to do that. Also on the retention front, attrition, which has stepped up since what we experienced during the pandemic is really still broadly consistent with levels that we had seen pre-pandemic. So it's definitely something that we're tracking and obviously, the stock price is something that we watch, but the trends are relatively in line with expectations. So from that sense, we feel like we're doing okay."

The first, just on the strength that you saw over in kind of APAC and Rest of the World, can you share some color? Is that just less exposure to the macro? Is it the new users or something else? And then the second question, Mark, last quarter, you kind of gave us your priorities for the year. With the operating expense guidance down a little bit, any color you can share on how perhaps that's affected prioritization? Any changes in kind of spending intensity on some of the longer-term initiatives like the Metaverse versus some of the near-term stuff like business messaging? Thank you."

So growth slowed in all regions due to pricing headwinds, currency was obviously a headwind in all the international regions. Europe decelerated very meaningfully, and the existing headwinds were compounded by the effects of obviously, the Ukraine war. In North America, we have a relatively higher exposure to off-site objectives. So the targeting and measurement challenges continue to impact growth in that region more. Also, I'd note that in North America, impressions were down year-over-year in Q1. So ad impressions were down year-over-year, though the rate improved from Q4. So it was primarily a demand-driven deceleration. When we look at APAC and the Rest of World, it benefited from strong demand in products like Click-to-Messaging ads. In Rest of World, growth decelerated the least of all regions. Macro conditions in Brazil improved a bit after softness in the second half of 2021. And then in APAC, it was – relative strength was pretty broad-based, but I'd call out particular strength in India and that's benefiting from good supply tailwinds in terms of impression growth."
META,2022-04-27,2022-04-28,,2022-04-27,2022-04-27T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-04-27,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes. In terms of priorities, it's – our priorities are broadly consistent with what I've outlined on the last call. It was the beginning of the year, so I outlined a lot of the basic focus areas for the company, whereas on most earnings calls, I'll talk about a few areas that I've been particularly focused on. I think we're pacing some of the investments across each of these areas. But I think more importantly, we're shifting the bulk of the energy inside the company toward those high-priority areas, away from other areas. So we're a big company at this point. It's not just all about recruiting and adding new people from the outside. A lot of it is we have a lot of awesome people here and a lot of the decisions that we had to make on a day-to-day basis are how do we direct the really talented people who are already at the company, and we want to make sure that rather than just always relying on just getting more and more new people from the outside, which we're going to keep on doing, we're recruiting a lot, I want to make sure that our teams are disciplined about reprioritizing internally. One thing that I want to add just as a bit of cultural commentary on the attrition question is I don't think that this sort of volatility that companies face is always that unhealthy for making sure that you have the right people at companies. I mean during COVID, we saw the attrition levels go down a lot because people didn't want to get new jobs, which probably meant that there were people who were staying at the company who didn't care that much about what we were doing as compared to what we would have wanted. And I'm just trying to lead the company in a way where we're positioning ourselves as the premier company for building the future of social interaction and the Metaverse. If you care about those things, I think we're getting the best people to come work here. If you care about doing awesome AI work on stuff like the discovery engine, across all of these different types of formats, we're the only place that's doing that. And that's a great problem. And that we're just seeing attract a lot of talent. And I know that sometimes people are critical of the ads model, but it drives a lot of value for businesses and people around the world. And I think the people who believe in that and want to see that continue to grow, I want them here, too. So yes, I mean, I think we'll see attrition go up and down over time. I think we're doing okay now, as Dave says, but I don't necessarily think that periods like this, where we're prioritizing a little bit more where we're focusing and growing is going to be unhealthy over the long-term. I actually think it's going to make us a better company."

Can you give us a quantification, if you could, on the impact of revenue from not – from having more Reels but not monetizing at the same rate or speed of traditional News feed and Stories? So those are my questions. Thanks."

We're working through mitigations on both. They are both a multifaceted challenge and they're interconnected because better measurement leads to better targeting for advertisers. On the first, we are improving our systems as we test and learn and supporting advertisers with best practices and we're working on automating tools that will help advertisers target better and we have to do it with less data. We have to do more with more aggregated and anonymous data. On measurement, we've been able to close a good part of the underreporting gap and shared that with advertisers, but the rest of the gap will take us longer to close. This is a particularly big challenge for small businesses, because we have to work with them. We have to work with them obviously, in a longer tail and more resource-intensive way."

So I don't know if I have a whole lot that's additive, but it now makes up a meaningful portion of people's time on Instagram. Mark gave the stat that it's over 20% of people's time on Instagram. So that speaks to there being a good opportunity as we ramp ads in Reels, but it's very early days in terms of ads in Reels. But that being said, it's going to take – it's going to be, as Sheryl said, a multiyear journey. If you look at Stories, Stories, we really began ramping in 2018. And at the end of last year, we mentioned that in developed markets, Stories on a sort of per time basis was monetizing at a similar rate as feed. So it took many years for that gap to close and there's still work to be done across the world on that front. But Reels is going to be a similar opportunity, but also it will take time for us to close that gap. But given that it's a good amount of time that people are spending in Reels, that is a good opportunity for us over that time period."

So now that we're in this world where no one can use mobile IDs for targeting. There seems like there's a lot of interesting new ideas kicking around the industry around like cohort-based targeting or contextual or other kind of ID-free, privacy-centric targeting techniques. So my question is, given the size of Facebook and all the first-party data that you have, how do you think some of these new techniques are going to perform relative to the rest of the industry? And when do you expect them to kind of show up in a more meaningful revenue way? So I guess what I'm asking is, is the opportunity here to claw back some of that $10 billion of lost revenue? Or do you think looking forward, your competitive advantage, maybe even broader and you might be able to open up more ad dollars to Facebook with these new techniques? Any thought on that? Thanks a lot."

When you think about how we mitigate some of these challenges, there's a couple of things to think about. One, what are the solutions we have that can be on site. So as we develop some of our commerce products as people are using things like Click-to-Messaging ads, Click-to-Messaging ads are a good example of to close the loop, at least to the point where you're connecting directly with a customer, happens on our service. If our commerce efforts are successful over the longer term, we'll be able to close that loop directly on our end service. The other thing that was interesting and your question is you're right that this is about relative comparative advantage in a very highly competitive space that we have been able to use data, I think, in a privacy safe but very efficiently. Some of the data we've relied on has changed that's causing some near-term challenges and headwinds for us. But over the long run, once that settles out, advertisers are going to go where they get the best return. So we have highly engaged platforms, we still have very important data that is first-party that we are able to use to target. We're working on measurement solutions and we're also working on things without the industry. So we think while these times are challenging, over the long run, we do have a very strong competitive advantage when you look across the opportunities advertisers have to advertise both offline and online."

And then the second question we get is just on Reels budgets. Are they incremental to overall spend? Or are you seeing advertisers repurpose from Stories and feeds into Reels? Thanks."
META,2022-04-27,2022-04-28,,2022-04-27,2022-04-27T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-04-27,qa,,Sheryl Sandberg,"I can take those. So on the first, it is the process I've described, which is that we know that if there's a consumer product that consumers are enjoying, we are able to move advertisers into that product if a couple of things are true. As Mark talked about, the format of the ads fits into the format of the product. Reels, which is short-form video, which is text, which is pictures, is a great format for us because those are all things we've already done well, both on the consumer front but importantly on the ads front. So we are able to create the format of the ads and offer that to advertisers. Then we need to help advertisers create compelling ads and we need to help them place across our different properties. We have a lot of places you can place ads. We have a lot of experience in this, and we are on a ramp. It is a multiyear ramp, but we've learned things, make it as automated as possible. For example, rather than ask advertisers create the perfect ad, the more you can ask advertisers to give you the components of that ad and create it for them, the better. Things will work on over time. On targeting try to figure out what are the advertisers' real end goals and then we can suggest the products that fit for those end goals. So if you tell us you're trying to get to on-site conversions or you tell us you're trying to get people to message you, we can then put you into different placements across our ad offerings. And Reels is a very compelling part of that. On the incrementality of budgets, it's always both. When we roll out a new product, there's always some of the budgets, which are just being reallocated from other parts of our own platform because there are people who will have a Meta budget or a Facebook budget or an Instagram budget. Over time, our goal is to grow those budgets. And we do that the same way. It is our large teams, feet on the street, working with our global advertisers and our largest clients, and it's our online ability to sell and monetize and grow that I think we are industry leading on working with SMBs, where we have to show them the returns and win their budgets. And when we roll out new products and partially, it's incremental as long as we're really delivering great ROI compared to what they can get off of our platform, over time, those budgets can continue to grow."

Dave, can you just confirm, did you say MAUs would be down sequentially in 2Q? And Mark, last quarter, you spoke – you were quite open about the competitive issues on TikTok, which seemed to be impacting the whole industry now. Any way of quantifying how much you think TikTok is impacting Facebook? Thank you."

And we think that will feed over into overall global because I think that will tip it to be flat to down. Just as a reminder, government restrictions on Facebook access in Russia were implemented in late February through early March. So some Russian users were still on our service as active users during our Q1 calculation. So part of that is just the way we calculate MAUs the last month of the quarter. And so that's going to spill over into Q2. I think it's clear that short-form video is a massive opportunity for the industry broadly, and we're very pleased about the offering that we have with Reels and the opportunity for us to compete for share and time in the market. Obviously, other competitors are – have strong offerings like TikTok, but we're pleased with what we've got with Reels and the efforts that we're making to grow that important product."

Our family of apps continues to grow even as we navigate a challenging macro environment. We now reach more than 3.6 billion people monthly across our services. The number of people using Facebook daily continues to grow, including in the U.S., although we saw an expected decline in monthly actives due to Internet blocks related to the war in Ukraine. Engagement trends on Facebook have generally been stronger than we anticipated, and strong real growth is continuing to drive engagement across Facebook and Instagram. That said, we seem to have entered an economic downturn that will have a broad impact on the digital advertising business. And it's always hard to predict how deep or how long these cycles will be, but I'd say that the situation seems worse than it did a quarter ago. In this environment, we're focused on making the long-term investments that will position us to be stronger coming out of this downturn, including our work on our discovery engine and Reels, our new ads infrastructure and the metaverse. And we're also focused on being rigorous about measuring returns and sizing these investments correctly. Now on our last call, I discussed that based on the revenue growth we were seeing in 2021, we kicked off a number of multiyear projects to accelerate our business. And I still believe that these projects are important. But given the more recent revenue trajectory that we're seeing, we are slowing the pace of these investments and pushing some expenses that would have come in the next year or 2 off to a somewhat longer time line. And given the continued trends, this is even more of a focus now than it was last quarter. Our plan is to steadily reduce headcount growth over the next year. Many teams are going to shrink so we can shift energy to other areas inside the company. And I want to give our leaders the ability to decide within their teams where to double down, where to backfill attrition and where to restructure teams while minimizing thrash to the long-term initiatives. The fact that we hired a lot of people earlier this year means that our reported year-over-year headcount growth will still be substantial for the next few quarters, but it should continue to decline over time. Now this is a period that demands more intensity, and I expect us to get more done with fewer resources. We're currently going through the process of increasing the goals for many of our efforts. Previously challenging periods have been transformational for our company and helped us develop our next generation of leaders. And I expect this period to be no different. I expect that we're going to find a way to keep investing in our top priority areas. And I think we're going to come through this period as a stronger and more disciplined organization. Now next, I want to discuss how we're doing in our high-priority areas. To understand where we're going, it's important to keep in mind that there are two major technological waves that we're riding in our business. The first wave of driving our business today is AI. And then the second longer-term wave is the emergence of the metaverse. One of the main transformations in our business right now is that social feeds are going from being driven primarily by the people and accounts you follow to increasingly also being driven by AI-recommending content that you'll find interesting from across Facebook or Instagram, even if you don't follow those creators. Social content from people you know is going to remain an important part of the experience and some of our most differentiated content. But increasingly, we'll also be able to supplement that with other interesting content from across our networks. Reels is one part of this trend that focuses on the growth of short-form video as a content format. But this overall AI trend is much broader and covers all types of content, including text, images, links, group content and more. And building a recommendation system across all these types of content is something that we're uniquely focused on. Right now, about 15% of content in a person's Facebook feed and a little more than that of their Instagram feed is recommended by our AI, from people, groups or accounts that you don't follow. And we expect these numbers to more than double by the end of next year. As our AI finds additional content that people will find interesting, that increases engagement and the quality of our feeds. And since we're already efficient in monetizing most of these formats, this should increase our business opportunity over that period as well. Reels engagement is also growing quickly. I shared last quarter that Reels already made up 20% of the time that people spend on Instagram. This quarter, we saw a more than 30% increase in the time that people spent engaging with Reels across Facebook and Instagram. AI advances are driving a lot of these improvements. And one example is that after launching a new large AI model for recommendations, we saw a 15% increase in watch time in the Reels video player on Facebook alone. So I think that there are many improvements like this that we're going to be able to continue to make. As we are building out our discovery engine though, I want to be clear that we are still ultimately a social company focused on helping people connect. One social trend that we're seeing is that instead of people just interacting in comments in their feeds, most people find interesting content in their feeds then they message that content to friends and interact there. And this creates this flywheel of discovery and then social connection and then inspiring those people to create more content themselves. In Instagram, for example, we see the Reels makes up more than half of content reshared into messages. So our strategy isn't about public versus social content and interaction. It's really about enabling a flywheel that compounds both. All right. Next on to ads. We faced a number of challenges here in the near term, but the investments that we're making should give us a comparative advantage over the longer term. One near-term challenge is the growth of short-form video. Reels doesn't yet monetize at the same rate as feed or stories. So in the near term, the faster that Reels grows, the more revenue that actually displaces from higher monetizing surfaces. Now in theory, we could mitigate the short-term headwind by pushing less hard on growing Reels, but that would be worse for our products and business longer term since we're confident that Reels will grow engagement overall and quality and will eventually monetize closer to Feed. Our work on ads monetization efficiency for Reels is actually making faster progress than we'd expected. We've now crossed a $1 billion annual revenue run rate for Reels ads, and Reels also has a higher revenue run rate than Stories did at identical times post launch. So the bottom line is I think we're on track here and we just need to push through this one. The second challenge that we face here is the signal loss from Apple's iOS changes. And as I've discussed before, our approach here is to grow first-party understanding of people's interests by making it easier for people to engage with businesses in our own apps, whether that's through business messaging, shops or new ad products. For example, click to messaging as part of our business messaging strategy that's grown quickly with 40% of our advertisers already using this format. The AI wave that we are riding is a tailwind for all of these solutions. Advances in AI enable us to deliver better personalized ads while using less data. So it powers automated messaging and creation tools to let businesses run better performing campaigns, which is particularly important for small businesses that don't have big marketing departments and that have been hit hard by Apple's policy changes. Now overall, there's a lot of work to do here and a lot of the investment is in AI compute CapEx. But I'm confident that if we invest in building the new infrastructure that we need, then we're going to come out of this downturn with even more superior ad products and a meaningful technology advantage over other industry players. Now of course, the third challenge that we're facing here is the macro economy. And we can't control the timing of when things will bounce back, but I'll note that periods like this are when marketers reevaluate their budgets and are even more focused on finding the highest-performing advertising. And in the last recession, we invested in our Ads business through the downturn and came out stronger on the other side, and I'm focused on making sure that we do the same today. Now if AI is the major technological wave that we're riding today, then the last priority that I want to discuss is about the metaverse technological wave that is currently building. And the metaverse is a massive opportunity for a number of reasons. Most importantly, it enables deeper social experiences, where you feel a realistic sense of presence with other people, no matter where they are. Whether you're playing games or working for hours at a time or if you're just jumping in for just a minute at a time to say hi to a friend or collaborate on a project quickly. By helping to develop these platforms, we're going to have the freedom to build these experiences the way that we and the overall industry believe will be best rather than being limited by the constraints that competitors place on us and on our community and on small businesses. And given some of the product and business constraints that we face now, I feel even more strongly now that developing these platforms will unlock hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions, over time. This is obviously a very expensive undertaking over the next several years. But as the metaverse becomes more important in every part of how we live from our social platforms and entertainment to work and education and commerce, I'm confident that we're going to be glad that we played an important role in building this. The next milestones to look out for here are the continued expansion of Horizon, our social metaverse platform, and the continued improvement of our Avatars platform, how you express yourself and interact in the metaverse as well as the commerce around that. These are some of the areas that we're most focused on. And we're going to be launching a web version of Horizon that will be accessible on all platforms later this year, which should dramatically increase the number of people who can use Horizon. And we also just launched our Avatars store with digital clothes from leading fashion houses. And we're going to continue expanding that selection and the fidelity of our Avatar system overall. On the hardware front, later this year, we'll release Project Cambria, and the experience here is getting pretty awesome. It will be a high-end device focused on professional users and work with high-resolution color mixed reality. I'm really looking forward to getting this one out. This is just one milestone in the long-term path, but I think people are going to be pretty blown away by this. All right. So those are the areas that I'm most focused on right now and that I think are going to have the greatest impact on our products and business over the next few years and much longer. Periods like this can be tough, but I really think that the additional focus and discipline are going to make us stronger over time. Now in addition to our business, this is also a period of transition for our leadership team. And before I hand it over to Sheryl for what will be her last earnings call, I want to thank her for everything that she has done for Meta, for our community and for so many small businesses around the world. It's really hard to overstate how big of an impact that Sheryl has had on so many different parts of what we do and on me personally. At the same time, Javier and Marne are our talented leaders who I've worked with closely for many years. They're the type of people who I've kept giving more and more responsibility to and they just keep crushing it, so the expanded roles are well deserved. And I think that they're going to do a great job carrying our business forward and expanding it in some exciting new ways. And we also shared the news this afternoon that Dave Wehner will be transitioning into a new role as our Chief Strategy Officer, overseeing our strategy and corporate development teams. Dave has done great work as our CFO, and I'm really looking forward to continuing to work with him in this new role. And as part of this, we're also promoting Susan Li to be Meta's new Chief Financial Officer starting later this year. Susan is an incredibly talented executive and I think she'll be an excellent CFO. She already runs our financial planning process and plays an important role on our leadership team, and this transition is something that we've been working on for years.  All right. With that, I'm going to hand it over to Sheryl."
META,2022-07-27,2022-07-28,,2022-07-29,2022-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,2,2022-07-29,prepared,,Sheryl Sandberg,"Thank you, Mark, for those kind words and for being a great leader and friend for the last 14 years. It has been an enormous privilege to work for you to help build this remarkable company. I'd like to focus on Q2 before making some wider observations about the business. Our total revenue in Q2 was $28.8 billion, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Foreign exchange trends had a significant impact in Q2, in particular, the depreciation of the euro relative to the dollar. On a constant currency basis, we would have seen 3% revenue growth year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, we saw solid growth in APAC and other parts of the world outside of North America and Europe, where it's been a more challenging environment. These continue to be turbulent times for the global economy. Many of the macro factors having an impact on our revenue are continuations of things we've seen in previous quarters, such as the continued impact of the war in Ukraine and the normalization of e-commerce after the pandemic peak. But there are also new challenges with rising inflation and uncertainty around a looming recession. We know that recessions put pressure on marketers to make sure their ad budgets are spent in the smartest way possible. We're focused on helping them run efficient marketing campaigns to get the best possible return on investment, including helping them shift their ad strategies on our platform in line with user trends and our own evolving ad solutions. I want to pick up on some of the themes Mark just touched on that show how we're doing this. Reels monetization, evolving our ad system and AI and machine learning. First, Reels monetization. We launched Ads and Reels last year. It's growing quickly and we see it as an area where there is significant potential for growth in the future. It's going to take time but we have a playbook from our experience with Stories. Our focus right now with Reels is ramping up ad load, improving performance and making sure the ads are easy for advertisers to create. We're also using AI to better understand the content being published in Reels, so users can connect to the content that is most relevant to them and marketers can also show more relevant ads. A good example of a brand seeing results with Reels ads is Wild Alaskan Company, a sustainable seafood delivery business that is consistently adopting and testing our latest ad tools. When they tested adding Reels to their campaign, they saw a 36% increase in return on ad spend, a similar uplift in new subscribers and a 26% lower cost per new subscriber. Second, adapting our ad system to do more with less data. In the short and medium term, we're working to improve and evolve our ad solutions. We're helping advertisers improve the performance of their ads by growing on-site data conversions with products like lead ads, which make it easier for businesses to generate leads and with business messaging products like click-to-message ads, where you click on an ad in your Facebook or Instagram feed and it opens a chat with the business in Messenger, Instagram or WhatsApp. Business messaging is an area where we see big potential. We estimate that 1 billion users are messaging with a business each week across WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram. Click-to-message is already a multibillion-dollar business for us and we continue to see strong double-digit year-over-year growth. These ads are proving particularly popular with SMBs in emerging markets like Brazil and Mexico, many of whom are new advertisers to Meta who come to us to advertise solely in this format. We're making it easier to create these ads directly from the WhatsApp Business app, which will help small businesses looking to find customers and grow. And big brands are incorporating business messaging into their campaigns like Paramount Studios, who used Click-to-Messenger to promote their blockbuster movie Top Gun: Maverick and drive ticket sales. As more brands turn to messaging, paid messaging provides new ways to sell, support and market right on the chat thread. We're also investing in privacy-safe ways to improve targeting and measurement. For example, we're continuing to invest improving our conversions API, which creates a direct, reliable and privacy-safe connection between advertiser's marketing data and Meta. And over the longer term, we're developing privacy-enhancing technologies to help minimize the personal information we process while still allowing us to show relevant ads and measure performance. One example is Private Lift, which we're currently beta testing with a number of large advertisers. This is a measurement solution, which helps advertisers understand how their campaigns are performing while adding extra layers of privacy to limit the information that can be learned by the advertiser or Meta. While we develop these solutions, we're also collaborating across our industry on technologies and other standards that will support privacy-safe personalized advertising over the long term. Third, on AI and machine learning. I want to emphasize Mark's point that this is a really important part of how we improve our ads ranking and measurement capabilities. AI-driven products like advantage detailed targeting and advantaged look-alikes help to increase the audience for an ad campaign if it's likely to improve performance. AI is also an important part of how we continue to grow video monetization. A moment ago, I touched on how we're using it in Reels. We've also launched AI-based tools to make it simpler to create video ads for Instagram Stories, and we're continuing to test ways for advertisers to transform static images with music and motion so they appear more like video. Turning to the business more broadly. There's no doubt that we're going through a transition period and doing so at a time of global economic uncertainty. But despite the current challenges, I'm very confident for the long term. We're facing a cyclical downturn but over the long run, the digital ad market will continue to grow. Advertisers will go where they get the highest return on investment and ability to drive their business. We believe we will continue to show up very favorably compared to other advertising options. Meta is a company that has shown extraordinary resilience. We have demonstrated time and time again that we are prepared to move quickly and at scale to respond to changes in consumer behavior, the macroeconomic landscape and the needs of our advertising partners.

META,2022-07-27,2022-07-28,,2022-07-29,2022-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,2,2022-07-29,prepared,,Dave Wehner,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $28.8 billion, down 1% or up 3% on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q2 of last year, total revenue would have been approximately $1.3 billion higher. Q2 total expenses were $20.5 billion, up 22% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue decreased 4% as growth in core infrastructure investments and content-related costs were more than offset by a reduction in Reality Labs loss reserves as a result of the announced price increase of Quest 2. R&D increased 43%, mainly driven by hiring to support Family of Apps and Reality Labs. Marketing and sales increased 10%, mainly driven by hiring and marketing spend. Lastly, G&A increased 53%, mainly driven by legal-related and employee-related costs. We added over 5,700 net new hires in Q2, the majority in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 83,500 full-time employees, up 32% compared to last year. Our second quarter growth rate reflects our hiring progress earlier this year. However, we anticipate headcount growth will slow throughout the rest of the year due to the reduction in our hiring plans. Second quarter operating income was $8.4 billion, representing a 29% operating margin. Our tax rate was 18%. We recorded a loss of $172 million under interest and other expenses, driven mainly by unrealized losses and equity investments. Net income was $6.7 billion or $2.46 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $7.7 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. The big step-up in CapEx, both year-over-year and sequentially related to server spend, including for our AI infrastructure. Sustainability remains a key focus of our infrastructure efforts. And in June, we published our third annual sustainability report. The report demonstrates continued progress on our sustainability initiatives. Free cash flow was $4.5 billion. We repurchased $5.1 billion of our Class A common stock in the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with $40.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with the Family of Apps segment. Q2 total Family of Apps revenue was $28.4 billion, down 1%. Q2 Family of Apps revenue was $28.2 billion, down 1% or up 3% on a constant currency basis. Advertising revenue growth slowed throughout the second quarter as advertiser demand softened. The deceleration has been broad-based across verticals, and we believe businesses are lowering their advertising spend in response to the increased economic uncertainty. Foreign currency headwinds also increased throughout the second quarter. While it wasn't a factor contributing to the deceleration in Q2, we're also continuing to face targeting and measurement headwinds such as Apple's iOS changes, which we believe are contributing to the growth challenges across the digital advertising industry. On a user geography basis, year-over-year ad revenue growth was strongest in Asia Pacific and Rest of World at 13% and 11%, respectively, with both regions benefiting meaningfully from strong growth in click-to-messaging ads. North America and Europe declined 4% and 12%, respectively. Foreign currency was a headwind in all international regions, with Europe and Asia Pacific experiencing the largest impacts. In Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 15% and the average price per ad decreased 14%. Impression growth was driven by Asia Pacific and Rest of World. The year-over-year decline in pricing was driven by a reduction in advertiser demand, the mix shift in ad impressions towards lower monetizing services in regions and foreign currency depreciation. Family of Apps other revenue was $218 million, up 14%, driven by the WhatsApp business API. Family of Apps expenses were $17.2 billion, up 23%, driven mainly by employee-related expenses, legal costs and infrastructure costs. Family of Apps operating income was $11.2 billion, representing a 39% operating margin. We estimate that approximately 2.9 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in June and that approximately 3.6 billion people used at least 1 on a monthly basis. Facebook daily active users were 1.97 billion, up 3% or 60 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 67% of the 2.93 billion monthly active users in June. MAUs grew by 39 million or 1% compared to last year. Europe DAUs and MAUs declined sequentially and were negatively impacted by the loss of users in Russia and Ukraine. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q2 revenue was $452 million, up 48%, driven primarily by Quest 2 sales. Reality Labs expenses were $3.3 billion, up 19% due to growth in employee-related costs and R&D operating expenses that were partially offset by the previously mentioned reduction in loss reserves. Reality Labs' operating loss was $2.8 billion in the second quarter. Turning now to the outlook. We expect third quarter 2022 total revenue to be in the range of $26 billion to $28.5 billion. This outlook reflects a continuation of the weak advertising demand environment we experienced throughout the second quarter, which we believe is being driven by broader macroeconomic uncertainty. We also anticipate third quarter Reality Labs revenue to be lower than second quarter revenue. Our guidance assumes foreign currency will be an approximately 6% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth in the third quarter based on current exchange rates. In addition, as noted on previous calls, we continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect 2022 total expenses to be in the range of $85 billion to $88 billion, lowered from our prior outlook of $87 billion to $92 billion. We've reduced our hiring and overall expense growth plan this year to account for the more challenging operating environment while continuing to direct resources towards our company priorities. We expect 2022 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases to be in the range of $30 billion to $34 billion, narrowed from our prior range of $29 billion to $34 billion. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full year 2022 tax rate to be above the Q2 rate and in the high teens. In closing, we're in the midst of an economic cycle that is having a broad impact on the digital advertising business. We're being disciplined on spending while still investing in those areas that will position to drive growth as the economic environment improves. Before opening up the call for questions, I want to say how pleased I am that Susan Li will serve as our next CFO when I step into my new role in November. Susan and I have worked side-by-side for the last 10 years, and she is an outstanding leader for the team. With that, France, let's open up the call for questions."

Mark, you guys are making a lot of changes around AI and Reels, et cetera. It's encouraging to hear the stats about 30% increase in time spent with Reels across Facebook and Instagram. As you're studying those users that are using more Reels, are you seeing total time among those users grow? Said another way, are all these changes proving to be incremental? That's the first one. And the second one on headcount growth. Understanding we're expecting a slowing of headcount in the back half, but Mark, to kind of go to your points about at some point, you see headcount decline. Should we think about '23 as being a year in which headcount declines for the company?"
META,2022-07-27,2022-07-28,,2022-07-29,2022-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,2,2022-07-29,qa,,Dave Wehner,"Yes. Brian, I can take both of those and then Mark can add any color if he would like. Reels is additive to time spent. But obviously, it does have a cannibalistic impact as well but the net impact is positive. There is some engagement that we think is coming out of surfaces like Feed and Stories, and we're getting that engagement on Reels. And that's been part of our explicit strategy to get reels in front of more users. But overall, it is incrementally beneficial to time spent. And then on headcount growth, we're not putting any markers yet out for 2023. But we're -- as Mark said, we're reducing our headcount growth rates, and we plan to be more focused on maintaining a lot of discipline on headcount growth as we go into 2023. So as we get closer to that and the setting of the budget, we'll be giving more explicit guidance on that, Brian."

Are you seeing any dollars or advertisers pull that could be moving over there for maybe lower CPMs? Any thoughts on competitive headwinds? And then second, just a quick question on guidance. Is there contemplated pressure on quarter revenue in 3Q versus 2Q because of the Reel usage increases?"
META,2022-07-27,2022-07-28,,2022-07-29,2022-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,2,2022-07-29,qa,,Sheryl Sandberg,"I'll take the first question. We exist in a really competitive advertising market, where advertisers have broad opportunities to advertise both offline and online and there are almost endless options. So we know we have to earn our share and continue to deliver great ROI and be able to measure results. And that's why we're focused on the continual product improvements that we talk about in these calls quarter-over-quarter and we'll continue to do going forward."
META,2022-07-27,2022-07-28,,2022-07-29,2022-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,2,2022-07-29,qa,,Dave Wehner,"And Justin, let me make sure I got that question. I think you were asking about Q3 and just pressure on Q3 because of Reels usage. Mark mentioned that we are really excited that the run rate on Reels crossed $1 billion, but it is overall because engagement is shifting to Reels. It is an overall headwind on the business. We haven't specifically quantified that, but there is a headwind on the business as Reels grows. In the long run we, of course, believe that this will be a tailwind on revenue but that's not happening in 2022. We're optimistic that it can be in the long run. But in general, the pressure that we're seeing on Q3 is overwhelmingly a macro one, where we're seeing sort of broad-based weakness across most of the verticals."
META,2022-07-27,2022-07-28,,2022-07-29,2022-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,2,2022-07-29,qa,,Operator,Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.

One, in terms of honing the focus on investments inside the company and reexamining the cost side. How should we think about the mix between Reality Labs and Family of Apps and what the impact might be on relative loss or margin structure of the 2 segments as you hone the cost structure of the company and think about that investment cycle in both areas of the business? That would be number one. And number two, maybe just following up on Justin's question and broadening out a little bit. Is there any way to unpack some of the impact of macro, which is clearly outrunning some of the easier comps you'll be facing in Q3? Because we're lapping IDFA from a year ago, there was an easier comp on top of just IDFA and yet implied is that the rate of growth continues to sort of weaken in Q3 versus Q2. So maybe unpacking a little bit some of the headwinds versus tailwinds in Q3 to Q2 would be helpful."
META,2022-07-27,2022-07-28,,2022-07-29,2022-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,2,2022-07-29,qa,,Dave Wehner,"Yes, Eric, I can take those. And again, if anybody has color, they can add. On the investment focus, I would say broad-based, we're really focusing the investments that the company is making on the key priorities. Now one of those key priorities is clearly the effort that we have behind the Metaverse and Reality Labs. So it remains an area in which we are going to be increasing investment. But we do plan to have discipline across the entire operating posture of the company. When looking at the Q3 comps, I think you're making an important point. As we headed into the back half of this year, we do get the benefit in our year-over-year growth rates from lapping the Apple iOS rollout, which happened -- was largely complete by Q3 and Q4 of last year. So we're getting the benefit of more favorable comps on the signals headwind. But that is being offset by the macro environment and the challenges we're seeing there. Now of course, there are some hard-to-unpack factors. That is at the first order, but of course, we're seeing just generally challenging environment for digital advertising. And there's several compounding factors. Of course, there's just the overall economic uncertainty that's reflected in the markets. There is the fact that we're lapping periods in which there was still a benefit from COVID in some of the sectors that are important to us, like e-commerce. And then finally, just the signals headwinds and the challenges that advertisers are facing on a second order basis may be affecting some spend. But at least on the first order, we think it's largely a macro environment that is offsetting the benefit that we would otherwise be getting from lapping the iOS 14 rollout last year."

The first remark, back to the discovery engine pivot, certainly a big change for the platform and certainly understand users' hesitancy on kind of any changes. But beyond the flywheel effect of sharing, any more color you can share on kind of what would differentiate the discovery platform here on Facebook and Instagram versus some other platforms would be much appreciated. And then secondly, on the buyback cadence, is there any right way to think about that? I know the buybacks kind of went down a little bit this quarter. And I've also noticed it kind of seems to trend along with free cash flow generation. Is that the right way to think about the buyback strategy going forward?"

Obviously, we look at a lot of factors when it comes to our buyback program. We are -- we still have a substantial amount remaining in the buyback program and then we expect to continue to have buybacks as part of our capital allocation strategy going forward. So no real change in posture to announce there. We'll continue to be looking at capital return opportunities over time."

And on the discovery engine thing, there are a few different pieces of context that I think are important here. One is the social content from the people you know is going to continue being very important. And obviously, following people is an important signal. If you go back 10 years ago, the AI to basically figure out what types of things you were interested in, other than having a signal of what you directly follow, didn't really exist. It wasn't good enough. So who you followed or who you're friends with was this sort of amazing signal. And it was more unique in a way. Whereas now increasingly, AI is able to identify things that you're interested in that might be from accounts that you're not following or might even be whole topics that you're not following anyone in that topic. And that just unlocks a bigger corpus of content that you're going to be interested in. So the social parts of what we do will always remain. I think that, that will be a very kind of differentiated and important part of what we're doing. On the discovery engine piece, I do think that we're seeing a different approach than some competitors in that we have a lot of different types of content formats. So I talked about this a little bit upfront in my opening remarks. But the AI that we're building here, it doesn't just apply to videos or it's certainly not just short-form video. It also works with text and links and photos and content and groups and discussions on comments and all of these different things. And actually, one of the really fascinating AI problems is to produce just like basically a very large model. The AI researchers call it an embedding that's basically trying to unpack basically like meaning or semantics or kind of what a post is about into this very high dimensional mathematical space. But that can work across all different content types. And being able to do that well, I think we'll end up producing a different experience on Facebook and Instagram compared to some of our other competitors that are just focused on 1 content format. And I think in that sense, what we're doing is going to be pretty unique and is going to create a lot of value. I don't think people are going to want to be constrained to just 1 format. And I certainly think that people are going to always continue caring about what's going on with their friends and family and people they know as well. So this is all going to be kind of a growing thing that makes it so there's more interesting content available. And basically, it makes the service more -- just better for people to engage with and other things. And then part of the business challenge is just we need to make sure we can monetize Reels well. Like I said in my opening remarks, that's sort of on track but less than the rest of Feed today, but we're optimistic that we'll get it there. So that way, as this ends up increasing the overall engagement on the platform, it will also end up being a tailwind for the business, too."

Sheryl, I was hoping if you could just talk about what inning you think you're in, in building out and implementing the ads than to do more with less data for advertising. And do you expect that over time, you'll ever be able to return to the levels of targeting and measurement from before the platform changes? And Dave, if macro slows down more into perhaps next year and even beyond or your revenue growth flattens even for other reasons, are you prepared to [dial down] overall expense growth to a similar level to preserve margins and profitability?"

I can do -- I can't do an exact inning and I'm kind of hoping inning is baseball. Is that right? Someone nod. Yes, it is. It is. There are 9 of them. But I don't know exactly which one we are. But I will say that we're really -- I think we're pretty early on this. I think in many ways, we use data very effectively and in a very privacy-safe way all along to build out very measurable results and very measurable personalized targeting for advertisers. And I think we led there. And now we're in a new era, where we have to do that same form of targeting, that same form of measurement using less data. And I think it's pretty early days in our ability to do that. We're going to do it by investing on our own, investing in AI, investing in machine learning. We're going to do it in rolling out products, like we have recently. That help us and advertisers measure where we're sharing less data between, as I talked about in my remarks. But we're also going to do it with our industry because it's worth noting that this is not a challenge we face alone. This is a challenge that anyone that's running on the Apple iOS platform has. And the industry is working together, I think, pretty collaboratively in -- not every player, but in a lot of players, many ways to get solutions."

It's just historically, macroeconomic challenges are often linked to some sort of cyclical effects. And we do know there's lots of things going on in the broader economy that point in that direction, including rate hikes and the like. So we do think there is a cyclical component of this. We know that advertising can be especially subject to these cyclical pressures. We do think that long term, digital within advertising continues to have a very positive future. And we think that we are positioned to continue to grow engagement nicely and build the best products in digital, in the market. So we're quite confident that as the market conditions improve, we'll continue to be able to return to nice levels of growth. But we also, I think, have demonstrated that we're willing to take into account the market environment as we plan our overall expense and capital base. So we'll continue to monitor that as we go into future budget and planning cycles."

Sheryl, I'm interested in this juxtaposition position that Reels grew faster than Stories did. You reached $1 billion. Yet at the same time, you're saying that it's a harder business to monetize. So what drove -- why do you think the adoption was faster? And then in terms of the sticking points, when you talk to advertisers, what are the things that they need to solve for in order to move money faster to Reels? And Mark, I think going to one of the earlier questions about your advantages at Facebook. The previous moat, we would argue, was just the social graph of billions of people, families and friends. Do you think what you're building now with AI and from digital, how all those content is even -- is a better moat, is a better business than the one you had before, which was a pretty high barrier to entry, just given the social effects of the network you built? So those are my questions."

On Reels, we have a playbook where we, I think, do a very good job building products that consumers love to use and then building ad formats which match those products so they can integrate nicely into the consumer experience. So we learned from Stories how to do that, and I think part of the faster adoption of Reels ads is that we are getting better at this. We know we need to make it really easy for advertisers to create that content. We know we need to create the ad formats. We know we need to give them measurable tools, and we've gotten better at selling the next product, and I think we'll continue to get better at that going forward. But as you do say, there are still some challenges. Video is harder than photos, than static photos. Small businesses are better at static photos than they are at video. So this is a new format that we have to help them use. I think we have a number of tools that are working. We have a number of tools in development. But the idea is to help businesses really easily create those Reels ads, really easily test them so they can iterate and keep improving as we do this. So I think it's very promising but we've got some hard work ahead of us."

And in terms of building sustainable competitive advantages, in terms of the social graph, right, which you cited from before, people have been able to get that from phones for more than a decade now, right? So I don't really think that, that's been the thing for us. I think it's -- we're a serious technology company. We invest a lot in building infrastructure. And culturally, we focus on moving and learning faster than everyone else. And I think that those are sustainable advantages. And so certainly, I think that the AI technology infrastructure that we're building, I think it can compound and be better than others in the industry and that will be an advantage and make the product better over time. But I think at the end of the day, what that really comes down to is just I try to push the company to be one that learns faster and just keeps iterating and moving faster than we did in the past and then others in the industry do. And I think if we can do that well, then we'll continue to succeed. But I think the moment that we stop doing that, then we'll basically fall behind. It's a very competitive field and we need to keep on pushing ahead. But I think the reason why we have succeeded and seen so good results with Facebook, Instagram and the other social apps is because we basically focus pretty relentlessly on just pushing to constantly improve them. And we're going to do that with AI, too. And I feel pretty good about the internal results that we've gotten on this. It's a big effort at this point. We have multiyear road maps in place, so it's not like back when I was in a dorm room and just shipping code every week. I mean some of these are we're touching billions of people's lives and building really deep technologies. These are long-term things. But I think the same principles basically still apply for how you want to build a company and stay ahead. And I think that, that's going to be the sustainable advantage. But yes, I do think AI, if we can do this better in terms of recommendation systems, that's going to make Facebook better. It's going to make Instagram better. It's going to make the ads better, which is why in my opening remarks, I talked about AI as one of the big technology waves that we're riding. I think it's certainly -- I think that's the truth. It's kind of a big underlying factor for our business, but we need to execute on that well, and I think we're starting to see a bunch of good results on that."

But just kind of stepping back, how far behind is monetization of Reels versus maybe Instagram Stories right now? I think you mentioned earlier that it's already tracking ahead versus when Instagram Stories were launched. Just trying to get a sense of how long before we get to parity. Is it a matter of several quarters or several years? And maybe how quickly did Stories get to parity with News Feed back in 2018? And Mark, how important is M&A to you accomplishing your vision of the metaverse? And I ask because one of the regulatory agencies just today announced a lawsuit to block your acquisition of Within, a seemingly pretty small VR fitness app."
META,2022-07-27,2022-07-28,,2022-07-29,2022-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,2,2022-07-29,qa,,Dave Wehner,"Yes. Youssef, I'll take those. So in terms of Reels monetization and the Stories journey that we went on, Stories really started rolling out in earnest in, I think it was 2018. It really wasn't until this year that we, at least in the developed markets, got to parity on a monetization basis, on a time spent basis with Feed. So it was a multiyear journey. I think we're still very early in that multiyear journey with Reels. So though we're proud of where we've gotten on a run rate basis, we're still very early in the trajectory of monetization. And we'll have to see. We're able to do a great job of closing that gap with Stories. I think there's always unique features in each different format that make an exact analogy imperfect, but we're optimistic on our ability to at least get a good ways on that journey towards closing the gap. In terms of M&A there’s -- M&A is definitely a component of our strategy, and we'll continue to look at acquisitions going forward. In terms of the specific announcement about the FTC looking to block the Within acquisition, I would refer you to our statement in the newsroom, but we believe that the acquisition of Within would be good for competition and expand the VR ecosystem and would attract new users to VR and make it a more productive space for new and existing developers. So we definitely take odds with the FTC's position on that."

Is it more -- is there a longer duration in this? Is there any sense you have and how you think about the duration of what we're all seeing right now?"

The -- I think it's really -- there's a lot of unique factors in the place we are in right now. One is that we're also comping against these very strong periods for online advertising during the pandemic that make the downturn sort of coincide with some reversion to offline behavior that exacerbates the impact of, I think, what is a cyclical sort of finance-driven downturn with the reversion to sort of more offline behavior. So I think you've got some unique things going on in the online ecosystem that do sort of exacerbate some of those cyclical effects because of the tough comps. And we've seen, obviously, not just us, but others kind of experience that. I think in terms of prognosticating on the cycle itself and the duration, I'll leave that for better economists than I to understand how that may play out. But obviously, the continued difficult environment is factored into our Q3 guidance."

It's kind of something others have already asked on this call but maybe we could flesh it out a little bit better. But you talk about medium term, gaining competitive advantage and gaining back market share on the revenue side. But I think some folks on this call are doubting that looking at the 2Q numbers, which obviously have like IDFA and Reels in there, but the 3Q guide compared to the likes of Google, Amazon, TikTok and the numbers that they're putting up. And if you look at previous times where you've gained competitive advantage, you also had a big data advantage that seemingly you may not enjoy post-IDFA anymore versus those other companies. So can you maybe flesh out either specific products that you are working on, that you're pumped up about that could drive that competitive advantage on the revenue side and when that might happen? Is this a 2023 event or is this more kind of like long term that we think will claw that back?"

So why don't I, at least, just take the components of it that I think that we can kind of address? I think Sheryl and Mark both outlined some of the areas that we're really focused on, on the revenue side. Reels is obviously, right now, a tailwind to revenue, but we're excited about continuing to grow engagement on Reels and then grow monetization on that over time. So we think that's a very interesting venue for our clients to explore and advertise on, and that's going to create some real opportunities for them and us over time. We're also investing in AI to make our ads products better and we're excited about what we can do there. And Sheryl talked about some of the different products there. So we think that, that will -- those are a couple of examples of things that will position us well. As it relates to kind of competitive dynamics, I think there's a lot of different things going on in the industry. Different companies are affected differently or not at all or not as significantly by things like the headwinds related to the iOS changes. There's also just different mixes of vertical businesses that affect how different companies are affected by the current economic climate and the COVID lockdown. So you've got a lot going on, but we're confident in our ability to continue to build the best products for users to be engaged as well as building great advertising products for businesses who want to reach those consumers."

Dave and Sheryl, just wanted to wish you best of luck going forward, and Sheryl, particularly want to congratulate you. I think $5 billion to $120 billion over 14 years, that's pretty damn impressive, so congratulations. Wish you all the best going forwards. Two questions. One on AI. Mark, you talked about the advantages of AI. Any update on how AI is done in terms of tackling content moderation issues? Do you feel like you've made some breakthroughs there? And then, Sheryl, you talked about this click-to-message marketing opportunity, and you've mentioned a couple of times over the last couple of calls, it's a couple of billion in revenue, but particularly strong, I think, in Latin America and the Rest of World. Any thoughts on the opportunity for that as a business within North America and Western Europe? Is it just culturally different or are there certain things that can be done to make it just as good, as strong in those markets as it is in the others?"

Yes, on content moderation, most of this is done through AI today. And every quarter, we release a community standards enforcement report, where basically, the main metric is what percent of the harmful content to our systems, identifying and taking an action on before someone has to report it to us. And those metrics are generally moving in the right direction and different things going on in the world make them sometimes fluctuate. But in general, we've made a lot of progress there over the last few years, and I'm quite proud of that. We focused a lot of AI efforts there. And at this point, a lot of the newer AI efforts that we have, and we're obviously going to continue that work as well. But a lot of the new efforts are focused on recommendations of content and in these large sparse models that can do better content and ads recommendations with a much larger model with even sparse data. So yes, pretty optimistic about that overall. All right. Sheryl?"
META,2022-07-27,2022-07-28,,2022-07-29,2022-07-29T17:00:00-04:00,2,2022-07-29,qa,,Sheryl Sandberg,"Mark, thank you for those kind words, and also thank you for this question because this will be the last one I take and it's exactly the note I'd like to end on because it's a part of our business we're so excited about. Click-to-Messaging ads is one of our fastest-growing ad format. It's already a multibillion-dollar business for us, growing at double digits. And that's because, again, I think it follows the playbook we've had of building a consumer engagement that businesses can be part of, having that consumer behavior happen first and then being able to work with businesses. So messaging is hugely -- sorry, growing hugely quickly everywhere in the world. And we have particularly engaged broad, very well-used messaging platforms and many of them. So when you think about consumers using it, we already know it, we already know that's happening. And then businesses are increasingly using it. And you're right that we've seen a lot of that behavior start in other parts of the world. But we are seeing that behavior in North America and Europe as well. And I think we're deep believers that, that behavior will continue to grow all over the world. So that means the click-to-messaging ads become the perfect opportunity. They help us move people from discovery to a direct relationship with a business. In a world where we're trying to do more with less data, they give businesses and consumers a direct connection, so it's much easier to measure ROI. And so we're investing heavily. You can message a business from Facebook and Instagram feed from Facebook, Instagram, Messenger Stories to WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram Direct. You can see how many entry points we have to drive real engagement and real demand. And I'll end with a case study. RoamHowl Creative, they're a small business consultancy. They used click-to-messaging ads for lead generation. And then they compared those to their normal ads, which were driving website conversions. And the Click-to-Messenger ads resulted in 2.3x more qualified leads. And this is important, a 57% lower cost per lead. And that doesn't even take into account the fact that it was measurable, that even if the return had been the same, they would have been able to measure it and attribute it more directly to our platform. So we are hugely optimistic about this area of our business, and I am very convinced it will work and is already working everywhere in the world."

We now reach more than 3.7 billion people monthly across our Family of Apps. And while we continue to navigate some challenging dynamics of volatile macro economy, increasing competition, ad signal loss and growing costs from our long-term investments, I have to say that our product trends look better from what I see than some of the commentary I have seen suggests. There has been a bunch of speculation about engagement on our apps. And what we are seeing is more positive. On Facebook specifically, the number of people using the service each day is the highest it’s ever been, nearly 2 billion and engagement trends are strong. Instagram has more than 2 billion monthly actives. WhatsApp has more than 2 billion daily actives, also with the exciting trend that North America is now our fastest growing region. Across the family, some apps maybe saturated in some countries or some demographics, but overall, our apps continue to grow from a large base. We are also seeing engagement grow, especially strong growth in Reels. And I’ll share more details about that when I discuss our product priorities shortly. In terms of our business, total revenue grew slightly this quarter on a constant currency basis. We are still behind where I think we should be, but we believe that we will return to healthier revenue growth trends next year. That said it’s not clear that the economy has stabilized yet. So we are planning our budget somewhat more conservatively. In 2023, we are going to focus our investments on a small number of high priority growth areas. So that means that some teams will grow meaningfully, but most other teams will stay flat or shrink over the next year. In aggregate, we expect to end 2023 as either roughly the same size or even a slightly smaller organization than we are today. Three of the primary areas we are going to focus on are our AI discovery engine that’s powering Reels and other recommendation experiences, our ads and business messaging platforms and our future vision for the metaverse. The internal indications I have seen suggest we are doing leading work and are on the right track with these investments. So I think that we should keep investing heavily in these areas. As I have shared before, our goal is to grow Family of Apps operating income such that even with our AI infrastructure and Reality Labs investments, we can still meaningfully grow our overall company operating income in the long-term. Our current surge in CapEx is largely due to building out our AI infrastructure and we would expect CapEx to come down as a percent of revenue over the long-term. We expect Reality Labs expenses will increase meaningfully again in 2023, with the biggest drivers of that being the launch of the next generation of our consumer Quest headset and hiring that has been done in 2022, but for which we are going to be paying the first full year of salaries next year. More broadly, beyond 2023, we expect to pace Reality Labs investments to ensure that we can achieve our goal of growing overall company operating income. Our capital allocation philosophy over the long-term is to allocate a portion of the profits generated from the Family of Apps towards these future-focused areas while enabling a greater return of capital to shareholders. Alright. Now I’d like to share some updates on the progress that we are seeing in these product areas. Our AI discovery engine is playing an increasingly important role across our products, especially as advances enable us to recommend more interesting content from across our networks and feeds that used to be primarily driven just by the people and accounts you follow. So this, of course, includes Reels, which continues to grow quickly across our apps, both in production and consumption. There are now more than 140 billion Reels plays across Facebook and Instagram each day. That’s a 50% increase from 6 months ago. Reels is incremental to time spent on our apps. The trends look good here and we believe that we are gaining time spent share on competitors like TikTok. Over time, I expect a few things to set our products apart here. First is that our discovery engine work allows us to recommend all types of content beyond Reels as well, including photos, text, links, communities, short and long-form videos and more. Second is that we can mix this content along posts – alongside posts from your family and friends, which can’t be generated by AI alone. And third is more social interactions move to messaging. We are developing a flywheel between discovery and messaging that are going to make these apps stronger. On Instagram alone, people already reshare Reels 1 billion times a day through DMs. Moving to monetization, I’ve discussed in the past how the growth of short-form video creates near-term challenges since Reels doesn’t monetize at the rate of Feed or Stories yet. That means that as Reels grows, we are displacing revenue from higher monetizing surfaces. And I think this is clearly the right thing to do, so Reels can grow with the demand that we are seeing, but closing this gap is also a high priority. Even with the progress we have made, we are still choosing to take a more than $500 million quarterly revenue headwind with this shift, but we expect to get to a more neutral place over the next 10 – sort of 12 to 18 months. I mentioned last quarter that Instagram Reels had crossed a $1 billion annual revenue run-rate. We continue scaling monetization across both Instagram and Facebook and the combined run-rate across these apps is now $3 billion. Beyond Reels, messaging is another major monetization opportunity. Billions of people and millions of businesses use WhatsApp and Messenger everyday and we are confident that we can connect them in ways that create valuable experiences. We started with click-to-messaging ads which lets businesses run ads on Facebook and Instagram that start a thread on Messenger, WhatsApp or Instagram Direct, so they can communicate with customers directly. And this is one of our fastest growing ads products with a $9 billion annual run-rate. And this revenue is mostly on click to Messenger today since we started there first, but click to WhatsApp just passed a $1.5 billion run rate and growing more than 80% year-over-year. Paid messaging is another opportunity that we are starting to tap into. And it continues to grow quickly, but from a smaller base. We are putting the foundation in place now to scale this with key partnerships like Salesforce, which lets all businesses on their platform use WhatsApp as the main messaging service to answer customer questions and updates and sell directly in chat. And we also launched JioMart on WhatsApp in India, and it’s our first end-to-end shopping experience that shows the potential for chat-based commerce through messaging. So between click-to-messaging and paid messaging, I am confident that this is going to be a big opportunity. The last area that I want to discuss today is the metaverse. We just had our Connect conference and announced Quest Pro, which we just started shipping. It’s our new high-end VR headset that delivers high-resolution mixed reality so you can blend virtual objects into the physical environment around you. It’s pretty amazing when you see it, and it’s going to enable all kinds of new experiences and socializing, gaming, fitness and work. And I am really looking forward to seeing what people build with this new capability. Work in the metaverse is a big theme for Quest Pro. There are 200 million people who get new PCs every year, mostly for work. And our goal for the Quest Pro line over the next several years is to enable more and more of these people to get their work done in virtual and mixed reality eventually even better than they could on PCs. And to deliver a great work and productivity experience, I am excited about the partnerships that we announced with Microsoft, bringing their suite of productivity and enterprise management services to Quest; Adobe and Autodesk bringing their creative tools; Zoom bringing their communication platform; Accenture building solutions for enterprises and more. There is still a long road ahead to build the next computing platform, but we are clearly doing leading work here. This is a massive undertaking. And it’s often going to take a few versions of each product before they become mainstream, but I think that our work here is going to be of historic importance and create the foundation for an entirely new way that we will interact with each other and blend technology into our lives as well as the foundation for the long-term of our business. So between the AI discovery engine, our ads and business messaging platforms and our future vision for the metaverse, those are three of the areas that we are focused on. I believe that the tougher prioritization, discipline and efficiency that we are driving across the organization will help us navigate the current environment and emerge an even stronger company. As always, I am grateful to everyone at Meta for your hard work and to all of you for being on this journey with us. And with that, I am going to turn it over to Dave."
META,2022-10-26,2022-10-27,,2022-10-26,2022-10-26T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-10-26,prepared,,Dave Wehner,"Thanks, Mark and good afternoon, everyone. Let’s begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q3 total revenue was $27.7 billion, down 4% or up 2% on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q3 of last year, total revenue would have been approximately $1.8 billion higher. Q3 total expenses were $22.1 billion, up 19% compared to last year. This includes a $413 million impairment of certain operating leases as part of our ongoing work to align our office facilities footprint with our anticipated operating needs. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue decreased 1% as a reduction in Reality Labs hardware costs was offset by growth in infrastructure and content-related expenses. R&D increased 45% mainly driven by hiring within Family of Apps and Reality Labs segments as well as Reality Labs technology development costs. Lastly, marketing and sales and G&A increased 6% and 15% respectively, mainly driven by headcount-related costs. Our pace of hiring slowed in the third quarter, consistent with our previously stated plans. We added 3,700 net new hires in Q3, down from our Q2 net additions of 5,700 despite Q3 typically being a seasonally stronger hiring period. We expect hiring to slow dramatically going forward and to hold headcount roughly flat next year relative to current levels, which I will cover in my outlook section. Third quarter operating income was $5.7 billion, representing a 20% operating margin. Our tax rate was 21%. Net income was $4.4 billion or $1.64 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.5 billion driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $173 million. We repurchased $6.5 billion of our Class A common stock in the third quarter and completed an inaugural debt offering of $10 billion. We ended the quarter with $41.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. Moving now to our segment results, I’ll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow. We estimate that approximately 2.9 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in September and that approximately 3.7 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. Facebook continues to grow globally and engagement remains strong. Facebook daily active users were 1.98 billion, up 3% or 54 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 67% of the 2.96 billion monthly active users in September. MAUs grew 48 million or 2% compared to last year. Q3 total Family of Apps revenue was $27.4 billion, down 4%. Q3 Family of Apps ad revenue was $27.2 billion, down 4%, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. Consistent with our expectations, the headwind to year-over-year growth from Apple’s ATT changes diminished in Q3 as we lapped the first full quarter post the launch of iOS 14.5. However, this was offset by weak advertising demand, which we believe continues to be impacted by the uncertain and volatile macroeconomic landscape. As a result, our Q3 constant currency growth rate was in line with our Q2 rate. The healthcare and travel verticals were the largest positive contributors to growth in Q3. However, this was offset by continued softness in other verticals, including online commerce, gaming, financial services and CPG. On an advertiser size basis, revenue growth from large advertisers remains challenged, while we have seen more resilience among smaller advertisers. Foreign currency was a significant headwind to advertising revenue growth in all international regions. On a user geography basis, year-over-year ad revenue growth was strongest in Asia-Pacific and rest of world at 6% and 3% respectively, with both regions continuing to benefit meaningfully from strong growth in click-to-messaging ads. North America and Europe declined 3% and 16% respectively. In Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 17% and the average price per ad decreased 18%. Impression growth was driven by Asia-Pacific and rest of world. The year-over-year decline in pricing was primarily driven by strong impression growth, especially from lower monetizing surfaces and regions, foreign currency depreciation and lower advertiser demand. Family of Apps other revenue was $192 million, up 9%, driven by strong business messaging growth from our WhatsApp business platform, partially offset by a decline in other line items. We continue to direct the majority of our investments towards the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q3, Family of Apps expenses were $18.1 billion, representing 82% of our overall expenses. FoA expenses grew 18% driven mostly by employee-related costs, infrastructure-related costs and the impairment of certain operating leases for office facilities that we plan to exit. Family of Apps operating income was $9.3 billion, representing a 34% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q3 revenue was $285 million, down 49% due to lower Quest 2 sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4 billion, up 24% due primarily to employee-related costs and technology development expenses. Reality Labs operating loss was $3.7 billion. Turning now to the outlook, we expect fourth quarter total revenue to be in the range of $30 billion to $32.5 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency will be an approximately 7% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth in the fourth quarter based on current exchange rates. Before turning to the expense outlook, I wanted to provide some context on the approach we are taking towards setting our 2023 budget. We are making significant changes across the board to operate more efficiently. We are holding some teams flat in terms of headcount, shrinking others and investing headcount growth only in our highest priorities. As a result, we expect headcount at the end of 2023 will be approximately in line with third quarter 2022 levels. We have increased scrutiny on all areas of operating expenses. However, these moves follow a substantial investment cycle, so they will take time to play out in terms of our overall expense trajectory. Some steps, like the ongoing rationalization of our office footprint, will lead to incremental costs in the near-term. This should set us up well for future years when we expect to return to higher rates of revenue growth. Turning now to the specific expense outlook for ’22 and ’23, we expect 2022 total expenses to be in the range of $85 billion to $87 billion updated from our prior outlook of $85 billion to $88 billion. This includes an estimated $900 million in additional charges in Q4 related to consolidating our office facilities footprint that we expect to record in the fourth quarter of 2022. We anticipate our full year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $96 billion to $101 billion. This includes an estimated $2 billion in charges related to consolidating our office facilities footprint. We expect the slight majority of our 2023 expense dollar growth to be driven by operating expenses, with the remaining growth coming from cost of revenue. We expect the percentage growth rate of 2023 operating expenses to decelerate meaningfully as we curtail non-headcount related expense growth and keep 2023 headcount roughly flat with current levels. Conversely, our growth in cost of revenue is expected to accelerate driven by infrastructure-related expenses, and to a lesser extent, Reality Labs hardware costs driven by the launch of our next generation of our consumer Quest headset later next year. Reality Labs expenses are included in our total expense guidance. We do anticipate that Reality Labs operating losses in 2023 will grow significantly year-over-year. Beyond 2023, we expect to pace Reality Labs investments such that we can achieve our goal of growing overall company operating income in the long run. Before turning to our CapEx outlook, I’d like to provide some context on our infrastructure investment approach. We are currently going through an investment cycle, which is being driven – which is primarily driven by two large areas of investment. First, we are significantly expanding our AI capacity. These investments are driving substantially all of our capital expenditure growth in 2023. There is some increased capital intensity that comes with moving more of our infrastructure to AI. It requires more expensive servers and networking equipment, and we are building new data centers specifically equipped to support next-generation AI hardware. We expect these investments to provide us a technology advantage and unlock meaningful improvements across many of our key initiatives, including Feed, Reels and Ads. We are carefully evaluating the return we achieved from these investments, which will inform the scale of our AI investment beyond 2023. Second, we are making ongoing investments in our data center footprint. In recent years, we have stepped up our investment in bringing more data center capacity online. And that work is ongoing in 2023. We believe the additional data center capacity will provide us greater flexibility with the types of servers we purchase and allow us to use them for longer, which we expect to generate greater cost efficiencies over time. These investments, along with revenue headwinds, are contributing to higher capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue in 2022 and 2023 than we expect over the long-term. Turning now to the specific CapEx outlook for ’22 and ’23. We expect 2022 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $32 billion to $33 billion updated from our prior range of $30 billion to $34 billion. For 2023, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $34 billion to $39 billion driven by our investments in data center servers and network infrastructure. An increase in AI capacity is driving substantially all of our capital expenditure growth in 2023. Turning to tax. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our fourth quarter 2022 and our full year 2023 tax rate to be similar to the third quarter 2022 rate. In addition, as noted on previous calls, we continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations. In closing, we are pleased with the growth of the community using our Family of Apps and the engagement improvements we are driving with efforts such as Reels and our AI-powered content recommendations. While we are facing near-term headwinds on revenue, the fundamentals are there for a return to stronger top line growth. We are approaching 2023 with a focus on efficiency and spending discipline, and I’m optimistic that these moves will set us up well to achieve our goal of driving operating income growth over the long-term while investing for future growth. On a personal note, I’ll be closing out a decade at Meta in the next couple of weeks, including the last 8 years as CFO. In my new role, I’m looking forward to continuing to help the company achieve its long-term mission and execute on its financial plan. I couldn’t be happier to hand off the CFO role to Susan Li, who is one of the most talented executives that I’ve had a chance to work with in my long career in finance and tech. And with that, Martin, let me open up the call for questions."

The first one is on CapEx and return on invested capital. The CapEx spend and forward expectations are remaining somewhat higher than investors expected. So Mark, can you maybe just give us some examples of what these new AI investments are going to enable you to do differently going forward than in the past? And what’s a reasonable period in which investors expect to see material incremental engagement or revenue from these? And then the second one is on engagement. I thought your comments about incremental time spent from Reels were interesting. But maybe just to sort of address the big topic around time spent, can you give us any update on what U.S. time spent trends look like just to sort of give investors some incremental confidence in the durability of the platform in your oldest market? Thanks."

So on time spent, we are really pleased with what we’re seeing on engagement. And as Mark mentioned, Reels is incremental to time spent. Specifically, in terms of aggregate time spent on Instagram and Facebook, both are up year-over-year and in both the U.S. and globally. So while we’re not specifically optimizing for time spent, those trends are positive. And we aren’t specifically optimizing for time spent because that would tend to tilt us towards longer-form video, and we’re actually focused more on short-form and other types of content. So just some color on time spent. And Susan, do you want to take the CapEx question?"

So as Dave mentioned in his script, we expect 2023 CapEx to be in the range of $34 billion to $39 billion, with our investments in AI driving all of that growth. We’re very focused on evaluating the ROI of our AI investments, and that’ll inform our level of future spend. But so far, we’ve seen continued strong impact on our recommendations products from advancing developments in our AI work. In the Q2 call, we had shared that a single AI advancement in scaling our recommendations models had led to a 15% watch time gain for Facebook Reels, and that gain has continued to grow. And we expect that there will be additional watch time improvements coming from that work. On the ad side, we’re also continuing to roll out more AI and ML improvements in some of the new ads offerings, and we’re encouraged by all of the early examples that we’ve seen. So this is something that we will be watching very closely. We think we’re early in this journey, but our level of CapEx investment will depend on the returns that we generate through these investments in AI. And if we generate significant engagement and revenue gains, we will continue investing here. And if we don’t, we will pace our spending accordingly."

Mark, the first one, you kind of mentioned in your opening remarks that you expect to get back to kind of revenue growth in 2023. Any color you can share on kind of the key drivers behind that? And how much of that is – excuse me, macro-driven versus some of these initiatives that you guys are working on? And then secondly, for Susan, as we think about kind of the operating expense guidance into 2023, I know historically, those numbers have tended to skew a bit conservative. How much conservatism is baked in there? And how much flexibility is there to kind of toggle some of those expenses depending on the health of core? Thank you."

Obviously, we’re continuing to see significant macro headwinds in the business. We do think there is a big cyclical factor here. So, some of it is just going to depend on the broader economy and recovery that we see. But we’re continuing to make progress in a number of areas in terms of growth, and Mark cited one of those, which is click-to-messaging ads, which has been a solid grower. It’s a $9 billion revenue run rate today, and we’re continuing to make good progress on click-to-messaging ads as a driver that’s especially been important in some of the developing markets. And overall, we’re focusing on a number of areas to grow revenue as we get through this tough cycle. And we’re seeing progress on a number of fronts, but it’s going to depend to some extent on what the overall macro climate is like. We’re not going to be facing as significant headwinds next year from the signals point of view as we are now lapping the big changes that were made on the iOS platform. So that’s going to also not factor in as strongly in our growth rates next year."
META,2022-10-26,2022-10-27,,2022-10-26,2022-10-26T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-10-26,qa,,Susan Li,"And I’ll take that second question on next year’s OpEx guide. One thing I’d point out first is just next year’s guide includes an estimated $2 billion in 2023 expenses that are one-time charges as part of our office facilities consolidation as we continue to rationalize our real estate footprint. We also expect a little over half of our expense dollar growth in 2023 to come from OpEx, with the rest coming from cost of revenue. On the OpEx side, the growth in 2023 OpEx is primarily driven by headcount-related costs from employees that we’ve already hired through 2022, and those hires have primarily been concentrated in technical and more senior roles. So we expect the slowdown in payroll growth in 2023 will be the result of the slowdown in headcount growth overall. As we mentioned, we expect to end 2023 with headcount roughly flat to where we are now. And on the cost of revenue side, we expect the growth rate of cost of revenue to accelerate in ‘23 driven by the increased depreciation that we’re seeing play through from the big CapEx investments that we’ve made so far and then as well as from Reality Labs with the launch of the next generation of the consumer Quest headset later next year."

When you think about that business, and people coming to the site, do you think – how does it compare to the News Feed as far as repeat rates or retention? And are you a little worried that it’s a little less proprietary than your prior content? And then second, I think there are a lot of questions on CapEx. Just wondering if the build here for this year and next is one-time to kind of get your capabilities in place, and then maybe you can go back to kind of a mid-teens level as a percentage of revenue or is just the transition in the business just a higher capital intensity business? Thank you."

So we are seeing a benefit from Reels to contributing to overall engagement on the platform. And it’s contributing to healthy engagement dynamics. And I’d say that, coupled with our recommendation engine, which is also increasing engagement on the platform, are both promising trends on the engagement front. From a monetization perspective, we are still working to close the gap between Reels and Feeds and Stories, but it’s going to take time before Reels becomes a tailwind to revenue. As Mark mentioned, we’re on about a $3 billion run rate today, but Reels was still negative overall to revenue by about $500 million in the quarter. So we expect that it should be a tailwind to the business eventually. And we’re sort of saying that’s probably in the 12 to 18-month timeframe. But overall, we are pleased with the impact that Reels has on the business, specifically on the engagement front."

On the AI side, which really is driving all of the CapEx growth in 2023, we will be pacing that future investment on the basis of the returns that we’re able to see and measure. So frankly, we’re hopeful that there will be a big opportunity to invest more here because we expect that this will be a high ROI area of investment for us. On the non-AI side, a lot of that spend is in ongoing investments on our data center footprint where we had stepped up our investment in recent years to build sort of ahead of our anticipated capacity needs, and that work continues in 2023. We do expect this component of our CapEx spend to become more efficient over time and we are actively looking for more efficiencies there. So I don’t know that we are benchmarking to an exact number on the combination of those two things. The future intensity, I think, is going to depend on the returns that we generate through those increased AI investments."
META,2022-10-26,2022-10-27,,2022-10-26,2022-10-26T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-10-26,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes. And maybe I’ll just add some color on how I’m seeing this, too, just because the Reels and discovery engine work is such a big part of what we’re spending our time and energy on right now. I think there are two comparisons to the things that we’ve done in the past year that are worth anchoring on. For Reels monetization specifically, any time we’ve had a new format, like when we added Stories or even before that when we were primarily on desktop and we shifted to mobile feed, we sort of had this dynamic where we focused on increasing engagement and growing demand for the product. But while that was happening, monetization efficiency for the new format lagged behind kind of the News Feed or mobile News Feed compared to Stories for some period while that was ramping up. And while it’s really hard for us to answer questions now that are like what is the eventual monetization efficiency going to be it’s really hard to predict that in advance. What I can say is I think on Stories, we’ve ended up achieving something that was way greater than what we even hope to achieve at the time, right, in terms of where we thought that Stories could net out. And a lot of the progress that we’ve been making on Reels monetization so far has been at a clip that we’ve been pretty happy with. So obviously, we want to close the monetization gap as quickly as possible. We want this to be a tailwind, not a headwind. I think we’re going to get there. It’s – but I think we’ve gone through a few of these transitions, and I think that’ll just take some time. On the engagement side, in terms of how incremental this is, the basic way to think about this is you have a set amount of inventory across the system. There is content from family and friends, which is quite differentiated and valuable and accounts that you follow. But now there is this whole larger corpus that we can use AI to effectively understand what the content means and understand individually what you might be interested in, just have access to a much bigger corpus of content to put into your feeds and increase engagement. And we’re seeing that start to work already and be incremental in terms of having more people use the services, having them to spend more time, having them spend – just engage more in feeds overall. So that part of things we think is going well. We think we will – we should be able to continue driving results. Some of the results already have been due to some of the AI investments and infrastructure that we’ve made. If our bets are correct, then the AI CapEx that we’re bringing online should be able to drive incremental engagement that’s pretty meaningful there. But we think qualitatively that investment makes just a lot of sense given the direction that the world seems to be going in. And I do think that our somewhat unique mix of both having the kind of social friends and family content and the ability to drive recommendations, which I agree with some – the premise of the question there, and that creators do want their content to be on multiple platforms, which I think is a little bit different from friend content where you want to, for the most part, share where your friends are, and you’re not trying to have it be everywhere. I think we should be able to do pretty well on both of those, and that should grow over time. But that’s – it’s hard for us to be more specific than that now, but I do think that these trends – I mean I get that this takes a little longer to play out than you would want. But we’ve been through a couple of these cycles before already, and I’m pretty confident this is going in a good direction."

Dave, you talked about the ATT impact diminishing in 3Q just as you lap the rollout. Curious if you’re seeing any meaningful improvements around ATT.

And does revenue sharing impact your margin structure versus the current ad formats and surfaces? Thanks."

So in Q2 of 2021, ATT had not been fully rolled out. It was largely rolled out by Q3 of ‘21. So the fact that we were lapping that period in the third quarter, we got a benefit relative to the second quarter, but that was offset by continued macro weakness. In terms of the efforts to attract content creators, and specifically as it relates to the overall cost structure, we don’t anticipate that, that’s going to have a meaningful impact to the cost structure. And obviously, it’s factored into our expense guidance."

Obviously, the company has faced a lot of headwinds from platform changes, competitive dynamics and a lot of macro impact, as we’ve talked about over the last 12 to 24 months. How much of this investment cycle is informed by your views around future-proofing the platform, so there are less externalities that can impact it and you’re in control more of your own destiny versus elements of curveballs that can be thrown at you that can cause volatility in the business in the medium to long-term? And then I’d love to ask one on the metaverse. Understood on the investment cadence in the metaverse over the next 2 years, even if qualitatively, how should investors think about the revenue opportunity over the next 3 to 5 years with between the hardware opportunity and the non-hardware opportunity as you see it as the metaverse evolves?"

META,2022-10-26,2022-10-27,,2022-10-26,2022-10-26T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-10-26,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes. Right. Okay. So, I think that, that’s a factor, but it’s not the primary thing that’s driving it. So, on the business side, I think certainly, you see dynamics like what Apple has done with ATT and continues to do in some ways with the policy that they announced yesterday, which are obviously big risks and we see as issues. But there are also other things that – like we just believe that – and we have invested so much in measurement over time because – since our ads help people higher up in the funnel than search ads, for example, we think that often, less of the value of sales is attributed to us than it should be. So, for all these reasons, having a funnel that’s more integrated where we do more commerce internally, this is a big part of what we hope to achieve with business messaging. And the fact that you can find a customer, have a thread directly with them in a business chat and be able to sell a product directly or to be able to do customer support and then help people out with the product and then maybe sell them something else. That kind of integration, I think is going to be valuable very broadly in terms of making sure that the value that we are creating for businesses and consumers can be more efficiently measured and attributed to our services. A lot of this, though, is it’s not just about fortifying against outside threats. A lot of this is just you can build new and innovative things by – when you control more of the stack yourself. So, I mean in the metaverse sense, a lot of the things that we are trying to enable, right, this feeling of presence, which in a lot of ways is sort of the ultimate social experience when you do it physically or eventually when – as you are doing it virtually, being able to design the hardwares, that way, you can have sensors that can help map your facial expressions and emotions to the avatar that you have. Virtually, I think is going to be just a very profound experience. And you can start to experience that with Quest Pro, which is out now. And it’s just not clear if we weren’t driving this forward than anyone else would be. So, I think that, that sort of integration and innovation is really helpful. Similarly, I think the fact that we can create a lot of the business and commerce platform around our messaging products, but then linked to them from Facebook and Instagram creates some unique experiences that I think would be very hard to create otherwise as well just in terms of having that kind of full loop in the product. So, that like enabling more experiences, I think is really the primary driver. And then the sort of fortification against external risks is certainly a strategic advantage over the long-term, but probably not the only reason why we are doing this."

We haven’t given revenue guidance yet for 2023, but our Q4 2022 guide is a range, and that range certainly encompasses, I think a wide variety of macro expectations. We are certainly in a period right now where we are seeing a slowdown in advertising demand, and that correlates with a lot of things that we are seeing outside of just our sector here, including rising inflation and supply chain issues sort of more broadly across the economy. So, with that in mind, we have undertaken a 2023 budget process that has applied higher scrutiny to almost all of the areas of our very broad investment portfolio, and we have taken what is an intentionally more conservative approach to our budget and our anticipated growth. You asked about the sort of fixed versus variable components of the 2023 OpEx guide. I think I had mentioned that over half – a little over half of that is coming from OpEx, the rest from cost of revenue. So, the cost of revenue piece that has the sort of the growth in depreciation, which is certainly fixed and is just playing through from prior year CapEx growth. Part of that is coming from Reality Labs and the launch of the next-gen consumer Quest headset. So, that sort of corresponds to the product launch. And then on the OpEx side, we – a lot of the growth in 2023 OpEx is coming from employees who we have already hired. We expect that we are going to have the same number of employees end of 2023. So, that’s an area where we are pretty focused on being disciplined also. And then finally, I would just mention, again, there is that $2 billion office facilities consolidation charge that’s also included in the ‘23 OpEx guide."

And in terms of metaverse efforts and kind of how we are doing compared to what I expected, it’s a pretty wide portfolio of things that we are working on, which I think is important to internalize because the – what I think most people see are the VR headsets, right. Because that’s sort of the first thing that we launched, and Quest 2 is the first mainstream VR headset. I kind of think about what we are doing. There is four major platforms that we are focused on developing. One is the kind of social metaverse platform where you see an early version of that with Horizon with the avatar system. And that’s an area where we are really – we are iterating out in the open, right. It’s a kind of a live early product platform, and that’s evolving quickly, but obviously has a long way to go before it’s going to be what we aspire for it to be. But that’s one important area that’s given what we do is sort of the social company that’s about people interacting, how you express yourself in all forms, kind of express avatars, the photorealistic avatars. We think we are doing some leading work there. But obviously, we need to take into the product and continue iterating on that. VR is the second major platform. And there, I think that there is going to be a consumer-focused product that probably will reach very large scale, but there is also, I think going to be a work-focused product that – it’s like you don’t do most of your work on a $500 device. We have computers and workstations that are much more powerful and have more technology in them. And I think that, that’s going to end up being similar here as well. So, we started that with Quest Pro, and that’s we are sort of at the start of the journey there. The two other areas, which are mostly – which are still internal, is a lot of the work on augmented reality, which is a quite a large effort, but we think is going to be just a huge part of the value that gets created over time. And there, we – a lot of what I am judging is how well are the R&D efforts going. There are some kind of basic things that we need to get right, some integration of things, some figuring out how to manufacture things and where we are making progress on that. And I would say a bunch of that is that there are some things that are going better than I expected, some things that seem like they might take a bit longer. But overall, I mean there is – none of the indications that I have would suggest that anyone else in the world is doing leading work ahead of us in those areas, even though we haven’t obviously shipped the AR glasses yet. And then the fourth platform after the kind of social platforms, VR and AR, is neural interfaces, which I think the kind of risk-based EMG interface, which is for all these computing platforms, there is going to end up being – input is a really important part, how do you basically control the computing platform. And we think by the time that you have glasses, and you are kind of walking down the street with glasses, you are not going to have controllers with that, you are not going to want to have your hands kind of like hovering in the air, and you are not always going to want to talk to the thing, even though that’s going to be one way that we use them a bunch of the time. Sometimes you are going to want something that’s more private. So, we think that having a discrete way to basically communicate with the device is going to be critical. And that’s also an area where, as far as I can see, the research that we are doing is really leading here. So, it’s a pretty big surface. I know that sometimes when we ship a product, there is a meme where people say, “Hey, you are spending all this money, and you have produced this thing,” and it’s – I think that, that’s not really the right way to think about it. I think there is a number of different products and platforms that we are building where we think we are doing leading work that will become – launching consumer products and then eventually mature products at different cadences in different periods of time over the next 5 years to 10 years. And in all of these areas, I think the teams are making very good progress. And I think that this will be fundamentally important for the future. Nothing that we are seeing suggests that, that’s not going to be the case. We are pacing a bunch of the investments given the kind of macroeconomic environment and the rest of the business performance. But ultimately, I mean look, I get that a lot of people might disagree with this investment. But from what I can tell, I think that this is going to be a very important thing, and I think it would be a mistake for us to not focus on any of these areas, which I think are going to be fundamentally important to the future. So, we are going to try to do this in a way that is responsible and matches the way that the rest of the business is growing over time. And I think we have built up the team to a point now where I think we will be able to kind of match that growth with the rest of the business more going forward. But over time, I think that these are going to end up being very important investments for the future of our business. And I think it’s some of the most historic work that we are doing that I think people are going to look back on decades from now and talk about the importance of the work that was done here."

And I am trying to figure out how much of a priority is for the company and how long the company thinks it can take to kind of recover or to create a new, I don’t know, probabilistic ad attribution model, probabilistically based ad targeting model. This is something that took $10 billion maybe out of your business. I mean it had a material financial impact. And listening to the call, I just don’t hear it as a major investment priority. So, the challenge – the question is, is it a major investment priority, or is it that, that goal is just elusive, and it’s better to focus on other things? Thanks a lot."

We have continued our broader work to rebuild meaningful elements of our ad tech. So, our system can improve performance and measurement with – and we have been making investments in the short and the medium-term and over the long-term. In the short and the medium-term, what we have been very focused on is evolving our ad system by growing on-site conversions with products like lead ads and ads that click to message. And we are continuing to make investments in AI and machine learning to improve measurement targeting and delivery. We have been pleased with our progress that we have made this quarter to help advertisers improve performance, targeting and measurement. I would be remiss if I didn’t talk about how AI and ML is really helping advertisers. One example of this is Advantage+ Shopping. We launched it in August. It’s a product that’s enabled by machine learning that helps clients test, learn and optimize their campaigns faster. It’s early, but a recent test across a cross-section of advertisers found that those using Advantages+ Shopping campaign saw a 32% increase in return on ad spend. Over the longer term, we are focused on investing in privacy-enhancing technologies, both our own portfolio of solutions, but also working with the industry to do that. And all of this is in the spirit of investing in this technology to help advertisers get more value."

I am curious if you can just add more color why you don’t feel these are experimental. You feel like they pay off. There is obviously a lot of focus on the investment side and I think everyone love to hear why you think this pays off.
META,2022-10-26,2022-10-27,,2022-10-26,2022-10-26T17:00:00-04:00,0,2022-10-26,qa,,Dave Wehner,"Yes. Let me take at least part of that. I mean we are making a number of investments across the portfolio. Marne outlined some that we are making in the ad space. Obviously, the investments that we are making in product areas like Reels and the business messaging platform at WhatsApp are ones that we think will have a significant payoff for the – in business, both in terms of engagement and monetization. So, we are making a wide portfolio of bets. Still, the majority of our spending is directed towards our Family of Apps investment, and those are across both engagement and monetization, leveraging AI in many cases. And we are making good progress on those fronts and then leveraging as well what is today a fairly under-monetized resource in terms of our messaging platforms, building more scale around those as being a source of future revenue growth. We have already proven it out with our business – our click-to-message ads with a $9 billion business today. We think we can build a substantial sized business around paid messaging, which will complement that as well. So, I think we have got a lot of bets across the Family of Apps portfolio in addition to the work that we are doing on Reality Labs and the metaverse."

I mean I just say that there is a difference between something being experimental and not knowing how good it’s going to end up being. But I think a lot of the things that we are working on across the Family of Apps are we are quite confident that they are going to work and be good. The Reels work, the discovery engine work, all the ads work on signals, the business messaging work, we can’t tell you right now how much – how big they are going to scale to be. But I think that each of these things are kind of going in the right direction. Obviously, the metaverse work is a longer term set of efforts that we are working on. But I don’t know. I think that, that is going to end up working, too. So, yes, I think that, look, there are a number of different – there are a lot of things going on right now in the business and in the world. And so it’s hard to have, like, a simple we are going to do this one thing, and that’s going to solve all the issues. I mean there is macroeconomic issues. There is a lot of competition. There is ads challenges, especially coming from Apple. And then there are some of the longer term things that we are taking on expenses because we believe that they are going to provide greater returns over time. And I think we are going to resolve each of these things over different periods of time. And I appreciate the patience. And I think that those who are patient and invest with us will end up being rewarded."

And what they are focused on given the economic uncertainty is getting a strong return on investment. Going back to the Family of Apps and services, Reels continues to be the fastest-growing format on Instagram and Facebook, and it is a great way for people to discover new interest creators and connect with businesses. What we are focused on is making sure that businesses get a strong ROI on Reels. And one example that shows that we are delivering on this in terms of our investments is Corkcicle, which is the insulated drinkware brand that added Reels to its business-as-usual strategy and saw a 34% higher return on ad spend and a 34% higher sales. So, we are making progress with our investments and helping advertisers find that ROI that they are looking for."

Hey, everyone and thanks for joining us today. 2022 is a challenging year, but I think we ended it having made good progress on our main priorities and setting ourselves up to deliver better results this year as long as we keep pushing on efficiency. And I said last quarter that I thought our product trends look better than most of the commentary out there suggests. And I think that’s even more the case now. We reached more than 3.7 billion people monthly across our Family of Apps. On Facebook, we now reached 2 billion daily actives and almost 3 billion monthly. The number of people daily using Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is the highest it’s ever been. Now before getting into our product priorities, I want to discuss my management theme for 2023, which is the Year of Efficiency. We closed last year with some difficult layoffs and restructuring some teams. And when we did this, I said clearly that this was the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end. And since then, we have taken some additional steps, like working with our infrastructure team on how to deliver our roadmap while spending less on CapEx. Next, we are working on flattening our org structure and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster as well as deploying AI tools to help our engineers be more productive. As part of this, we are going to be more proactive about cutting projects that aren’t performing or may no longer be as crucial. But my main focus is on increasing the efficiency of how we execute our top priorities. So I think that there is going to be some more that we can do to improve our productivity, speed and cost structure. And by working on this over a sustained period, I think we will both build a stronger technology company and become more profitable. I am very focused on doing this in a way that helps us build better products. And because of that, even if our business outperforms our goals, this will stay our management theme for the year since I think it’s going to make us a better company. Now at the same time, I am also focused on delivering better financial results than what we have reported recently and on meeting the expectation that I outlined last year of delivering compounding earnings growth even while investing aggressively in future technology. And next, I want to give some updates on our priority areas. Our priorities haven’t changed since last year. The two major technological waves driving our roadmap are AI today and over the longer term, the metaverse. So first, let’s talk about our AI discovery engine. Facebook and Instagram are shifting from being organized solely around people and accounts you follow to increasingly showing more relevant content recommended by our AI systems. And this covers every content format, which is something that makes our services unique. But we are especially focused on short-form video since Reels is growing so quickly. And I am really proud of our progress here. Reels plays across Facebook and Instagram have more than doubled over the last year, while the social component of people resharing Reels has grown even faster and has more than doubled on both apps in just the last 6 months. The next bottleneck that we are focused on to continue growing Reels is improving monetization efficiency or the revenue that’s generated per minute of Reels watched. Currently, the monetization efficiency of Reels is much less than Feed. So the more that Reels grows, even though it adds engagement to the system overall, it takes some time away from Feed and we actually lose money. But people want to see more Reels though. So the key to unlocking that is improving our monetization efficiencies that way we can show more Reels without losing increasing amounts of money. We are making progress here and our monetization efficiency on Facebook has doubled in the past 6 months. In terms of the revenue headwind, we are still on track to be roughly neutral by the end of this year or maybe early next year. And then after that, we should be able to profitably grow Reels while keeping up with the demand that we see. In our broader ads business, we are continuing to invest in AI and we are seeing our efforts pay off here. In the last quarter, advertisers saw over 20% more conversions than in the year before. And combined with the decline in cost per acquisition, this has resulted in higher returns on ad spend. We continue to be excited about the monetization opportunity with Business Messaging, too. Facebook and Instagram are the first two pillars of our business. And in the next few years, we hope to bring Messaging Online as the next pillar. One way of doing this is click-to-message ads, which is now the $10 billion run-rate. And paid messaging is the other piece of this. We are earlier here, but we continue to onboard more businesses to the WhatsApp Business Platform where they can answer customer questions and updates and sell directly in chat. So for example, Air France has started using WhatsApp to share boarding passes and other information, other flight information, in 22 countries and 4 languages. And businesses often tell us that more people open their messages and they get better results on WhatsApp than other channels. AI, it’s the foundation of our discovery engine and our ads business. And we also think that it’s going to enable many new products and additional transformations in our apps. Generative AI is an extremely exciting new area with so many different applications. And one of my goals for Meta is to build on our research to become a leader in generative AI in addition to our leading work in recommendation AI. The last area that I want to talk about is the Metaverse. We shipped Quest Pro at the end of last year. I am really proud of it. It’s the first mainstream mixed reality device. I mean, we are setting the standard for the industry with our Meta Reality system. As always, the reason why we are focused on building these platforms is to deliver better social experiences, than what’s possible today on phones. And the value of MR is that you can experience the immersion and presence of VR while still being grounded in the physical world around you. We are already seeing developers build out some impressive new experiences like Nanome for 3D modeling, molecules and drug development; Arkio for architects and designers to create interiors; and of course, a lot of great games. The MR ecosystem is relatively new, but I think it’s going to grow a lot over the next few years. Later this year, we are going to launch our next-generation consumer headset, which will feature Meta Reality as well. And I expect that this is going to establish this technology as the baseline for all headsets going forward and eventually, of course, for AR glasses as well. Beyond MR, the broader VR ecosystem continues growing. There are now over 200 apps on our VR devices that have made more than $1 million in revenue. We are also continuing to make progress with avatars. We just launched avatars on WhatsApp last quarter and more than 100 million people have already created avatars in the app. And of those, about 1 in 5 are using their avatar as their WhatsApp profile photo. I thought that, that was an interesting example of how the Family of Apps and Metaverse visions come together, because even though most of our Reality Labs investment is going towards future computing platforms, glasses, headsets and the software to run them, as the technology develops, most people are going to experience the Metaverse for the first time on phones and then start building up their digital identities across our apps. Alright. So those are the areas we are focused on, AI, including our discovery engine, ads, business messaging and increasingly generative AI and the future platforms for the Metaverse. And from an operating perspective, we are focused on efficiency and continuing to streamline the company so we can execute these priorities as well as possible and build a better company while improving our business performance. And as always, I am grateful to our teams for your work on all of these important areas and to all of you for being on this journey with us. And now over to Susan."
META,2023-02-01,2023-02-02,,2023-02-01,2023-02-01T17:00:00-05:00,0,2023-02-01,prepared,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Mark and good afternoon everyone. Let’s begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q4 total revenue was $32.2 billion, down 4% or up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q4 of last year, total revenue would have been approximately $2 billion higher. Q4 total expenses were $25.8 billion, up 22% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 31%, driven mostly by a write-down of certain data center assets as well as growth in infrastructure-related costs. R&D increased 39%, marketing and sales increased 4%, and G&A decreased 7%. Operating lease impairments and employee-related costs were the largest contributors to growth for all three expense lines. However, growth in marketing and sales was partially offset by lower marketing spend and growth in G&A was more than fully offset by a decrease in legal-related expenses. We ended the fourth quarter with over 86,400 employees, which includes a substantial majority of the approximately 11,000 employees impacted by our previously announced layoffs who remained on payroll as of December 31 due to applicable legal requirements. We expect the vast majority of the impacted employees will no longer be captured in our reported headcount figures by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter operating income was $6.4 billion, representing a 20% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 24%. Net income was $4.7 billion or $1.76 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.2 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $5.3 billion and we ended the year with $40.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $6.9 billion of our Class A common stock, bringing our total share repurchases for the full year to $27.9 billion. We had $10.9 billion remaining on our prior authorization as of December 31. And today, we announced a $40 billion increase in our stock repurchase authorization. Moving now to our segment results. I will begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow. We estimate that approximately 2.96 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in December and that approximately 3.74 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. Facebook continues to grow globally and engagement remains strong. We reached 2 billion Facebook daily active users for the first time in December, up 4% or 71 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 67% of the 2.96 billion monthly active users in December. MAUs grew by 51 million or 2% compared to last year. Q4 total Family of Apps revenue was $31.4 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Q4 Family of Apps ad revenue was $31.3 billion, down 4%, but up 2% on a constant currency basis. Consistent with our expectations, Q4 revenue remained under pressure from weak advertising demand which we believe continues to be impacted by the uncertain and volatile macroeconomic landscape. The financial services and technology verticals were the largest negative contributors to the year-over-year decline in Q4, but both have relatively smaller shares of our revenue. Growth remained negative in our largest verticals, online commerce and CPG, though the pace of year-over-year decline in online commerce has slowed compared to last quarter. The largest positive contributors to year-over-year growth in Q4 were the travel and healthcare verticals, though both are relatively smaller verticals in absolute share. Foreign currency remained a significant headwind to advertising revenue growth in all international regions. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World at 5%. North America was flat, while Asia-Pacific and Europe declined 3% and 16% respectively. In Q4, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 23% and the average price per ad decreased 22%. Impression growth was primarily driven by the Asia-Pacific and Rest of World regions. The year-over-year decline in pricing was primarily driven by strong impression growth, especially from lower monetizing surfaces and regions, lower advertiser demand and foreign currency depreciation. While overall pricing remains under pressure from these factors, we have continued to make improvements to our ads targeting and measurement that we believe are driving more conversions and better returns for advertisers. Family of Apps’ other revenue was $184 million in Q4, up 19%, with strong business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp business platform partially offset by a decline in other line items. We continue to direct the majority of our investments towards the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q4, Family of Apps expenses were $20.8 billion, representing 81% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps’ expenses were up 23% due primarily to restructuring-related expenses and growth in infrastructure-related costs. Family of Apps’ operating income was $10.7 billion, representing a 34% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q4 revenue was $727 million, down 17% due to lower Quest 2 sales. Reality Labs expenses were $5 billion, up 20% due primarily to employee-related costs and restructuring-related expenses. Reality Labs operating loss was $4.3 billion. Before turning to the outlook, I’d like to discuss our work to grow profitability by scaling monetization and improving our operational efficiency. There are two primary levers to increasing monetization: growing supply and growing demand. Growing ad supply gives businesses more opportunities to get in front of people and we are focused on enabling that in a couple of ways. First and foremost, we remain focused on building engaging experiences for the people who use our apps. We are coming into 2023 with a strong foundation as Reels continues to scale and we are seeing in-feed recommendations contribute to engagement as we help people discover new content in their feeds. We will continue to invest in making these experiences best-in-class. The other side of growing supply comes from more effectively monetizing the surfaces within our apps, including those that have a lower level of ads today. In the nearer term, ramping Reels monetization remains a primary focus. Over the longer term, we see opportunities to continue improving Facebook and Instagram monetization while also scaling revenue contributions from our messaging platforms. Growing advertiser demand is the other focus and a big effort here is around continuing to drive advertiser performance. While we are still contending with the broader macro uncertainty and signals landscape weighing on advertiser demand in the near-term, we are making good progress on our roadmap and are already seeing improvements to add performance and measurement from the investments we have made. We see opportunities for continued gains in the near and medium-term, with our AI investments powering a lot of this work as we continue to improve ads ranking and enable increased automation for advertisers to make it easier for them to run campaigns and use our systems to optimize their performance. Another opportunity we have is to further scale onsite conversions through products like click-to-message, lead ads and shop ads. Click-to-message ads continue to grow quickly and we believe they are bringing incremental demand onto our platform, with over half of click-to-message advertisers exclusively using click-to-messaging ads on our platform. We see further opportunity as we continue to scale click-to-WhatsApp ads and are investing in growing newer formats like shop ads. Over the long-term, we are investing heavily in AI to develop and deploy privacy-enhancing technologies and continue building new tools that will make it easier for advertisers to create and deliver more relevant and engaging ads. Moving now to our efficiency work, we took significant actions in 2022 to operate more efficiently. In Q4, we made the difficult decision to layoff employees while deprioritizing certain projects and curtailing non-headcount-related expenses. We have applied the same scrutiny to our physical assets. We identified opportunities to consolidate our office facilities and we have streamlined our future data centers to a new architecture, which we believe will be more cost efficient and more flexible that provides us optionality to support both AI and non-AI workloads. In Q4, we recorded $4.2 billion of total restructuring costs in connection with all of these efforts and expect there to be some additional costs in 2023 in areas like office facilities impairments as we continue this work. As Mark has said, these actions are just the beginning of our efficiency efforts, and we remain keenly focused on this in 2023. We are working across the company to deprioritize lower ROI work, move faster, increase productivity and reduce costs across the business. As part of this, we are carefully scrutinizing our hiring needs, actively reevaluating projects and reducing management layers. I’m confident that our company-wide focus on efficiency will position us to be an even more productive organization going forward. Turning now to the revenue outlook, we expect first quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $26 billion to $28.5 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency will be an approximately 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth in the first quarter based on current exchange rates. Turning now to the expense outlook, we anticipate our full year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $89 billion to $95 billion, lower from our prior outlook of $94 billion to $100 billion due to slower anticipated growth in payroll expenses and cost of revenue. We now expect to record an estimated $1 billion in restructuring charges in 2023 related to consolidating our office facilities footprint. This is down from our prior estimate of $2 billion as we recorded a portion of the charges in the fourth quarter of 2022. We may incur additional restructuring charges as we progress further in our efficiency efforts. Turning now to the CapEx outlook for 2023, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $30 billion to $33 billion, lowered from our prior estimate of $34 billion to $37 billion. The reduced outlook reflects our updated plans for lower data center construction spend in 2023 as we shift to a new data center architecture that is more cost efficient and can support both AI and non-AI workloads. Substantially, all of our capital expenditures continue to support the Family of Apps. On to tax. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full year 2023 tax rate percentage to be in the low 20s. In addition, as noted on previous calls, we continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations. In closing, 2022 was a challenging but pivotal year for our business. We made important progress on our priorities and have taken significant steps to improve our efficiency and productivity. We are set up well to build on this work in 2023 as we continue investing for future growth while remaining focused on delivering strong financial performance.

META,2023-02-01,2023-02-02,,2023-02-01,2023-02-01T17:00:00-05:00,0,2023-02-01,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Mark, one for Susan. Mark, the first one is on generative AI. I sort of wanted to dig a little more into how you think about your blue-sky potential user and advertiser use cases of generative AI? And how do you think about the timeline foresee some glimpses of those on the platform? And then the second one for Susan, just anymore color on the new data center architecture and how we should think about the long-term capital intensity of the business, whether it’s CapEx per minute, CapEx per DAU? How big of a long-term benefit could this change be to the overall cash flow? Thanks."
META,2023-02-01,2023-02-02,,2023-02-01,2023-02-01T17:00:00-05:00,0,2023-02-01,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes, I can start with generative AI. Yes, I think this is a really exciting area. And I mean, I’d say the two biggest themes that focused on for this year and one is efficiency and then the kind of the new product area is going to be the generative AI work. We have a bunch of different work streams across almost every single one of our products to use the new technologies, especially the large language models and diffusion models for generating images and videos and avatars and 3D assets and all kinds of different stuff across all of the different work streams that we’re working on, as well as over the long-term, working on things that could really empower creators to be way more productive and creative across the apps and run a lot of different accounts. So I know there is some really exciting stuff here. I want to be careful not to kind of get too far ahead of the development of it. So I think you’ll see us launch a number of different things this year, and we will talk about them, and we will share updates on how they are doing. I do expect that the space will move quickly. I think we will learn a lot about what works and what doesn’t. A lot of the stuff is expensive, right, to kind of generate an image or a video or a chat interaction. These things we’re talking about, like cents or fraction of a cent. So one of the big interesting challenges here also is going to be how do we scale this and make this work more efficient so way we can bring it to a much larger user base. But I think once we do that, there are going to be a number of very exciting use cases. I realize this is a pretty high-level answer for now, but I think that we will be able to share more details over the coming months."
META,2023-02-01,2023-02-02,,2023-02-01,2023-02-01T17:00:00-05:00,0,2023-02-01,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Brian. On your questions about CapEx, so your first question was about the new data center architecture that we talked about, which is underpinning the lower CapEx outlook. So we’re shifting our data centers to a new architecture that can more efficiently support both AI and non-AI workloads. And that’s going to give us more optionality as we better understand our demand for AI over time. Additionally, we’re expecting that the new design will be cheaper and faster to build than previous data center architecture. Along with the new data center architecture, we’re going to optimize our approach to building data centers. So we have a new phased approach that allows us to build base plans with less initial capacity and less initial capital outlay, but then flex up future capacity quickly if needed. We’re still planning to grow AI capacity significantly, and that connects, I think, to a lot of the things that Mark was describing earlier in his question. In terms of longer-run capital intensity, we certainly expect that the lower CapEx outlook will have some incremental benefit to CapEx as a percent of revenue, and that’s still really something that we are focused on over the longer term. The current surge in CapEx is really due to the building out of AI infrastructure, which we really began last year and are continuing into this year. We will be measuring the ROI of these AI investments, and their returns will continue to inform our future spend. Our intention is still to bring CapEx as a percent of revenue down, but capital intensity in the nearest term is really going to depend, in part, on the revenue outlook and our needs to further build AI capacity for future demand."

Mark, you always had this philosophy of letting the user sort of continue to grow engagement, and monetization has always lagged sort of consumer adoption of new products. How do you think about going a little bit deeper on the mixture of letting the engagement of short-form video continue to build versus eventually sort of continuing to drive higher levels of monetization against that product? Second, can you give us a little bit of color of how advertiser conversations continue to evolve around short-form video and the adoption of the Canvas and the utilization of that as a means to deliver a mixture of brand and DR messages? And then lastly would just be, can you quantify at all the gap that still exists between the engagement around short-form video and the monetization and how that might close as we look out over the next couple of years? Thanks so much."
META,2023-02-01,2023-02-02,,2023-02-01,2023-02-01T17:00:00-05:00,0,2023-02-01,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes. I mean the way I’ve always looked at – I can take the first part of this, is that for these consumer products, often building up and scaling the product use case is a somewhat different discipline than working on the monetization. So it’s such a kind of hard problem to build these new types of products that you want to give the teams as much clarity and as simple of goals as possible. So in the beginning, just saying, okay, just let’s make something that works for people. And then once we get to many hundreds of millions of people or billions of people using it, then we will focus on ramping up the monetization, which has been a formula that’s worked for us. That’s the general approach. Now with Reels, we do have a lot of people using it now. So I think at this point, the question is, is there any strategic advantage to letting it scale further than will be – than would be profitable to do? And I think at the scale that it’s at right now, it’s not clear that there is much strategic advantage. I mean there are certain flywheels, and you get certain more feedback or data points from a little bit more distribution. But at this point, we’re at pretty good scale. So I think for now, the right thing to do is to work on monetization efficiency. And we know that there is demand to see some more Reels. And as we naturally improve the monetization efficiency, which I have confidence in because the teams are doing good work, and that’s been working, I shared the stat about it, the efficiency doubling over the last 6 months on Facebook, I think as we can continue some of those trends, then we will naturally just unlock the ability to show more and more Reels, and we will continue to grow from there. But that’s the overall approach. I do think that our philosophy of building these consumer products, focusing on getting them to hundreds of millions or billions of people and then focusing on monetization beyond that and bringing that in as the balance is the right approach. It served us well. You can expect us to continue doing that on future things that we do, including some – hopefully, some of the new generative AI products or some of the new Metaverse stuff that we’re doing. We’re going to take the same approach there as well."

We continue working on enabling more advertisers to participate in Reels app, more formats, more objectives, more tools to create them. And we’ve been making good progress with now over 40% of our advertisers use Reels across our apps. And between Direct Response versus brand, we are actually seeing progress with both, but Direct Response continues to be where advertisers are focused. And just as an example, Outletcity, which is a German fashion retailer, developed – created specifically for Reels to test the impact of conversions. And they found that Reels resulted in a 19x higher ROIs, 89% lower cost per purchase, and 9x higher lift in sales. So overall, very good results."

We know it took us several years to bring the gap close between Stories and Feed Ads. And we expect that this will take longer for Reels. Having said that, we are still roughly on track to bring the overall Reels revenue headwind to a neutral place by the end of this year or early next year and we are planning to do that through both improving Reels monetization efficiency and growing incremental engagement from Reels."

As we think about – I appreciate the color on improving conversion rate. Would it be fair to say that you’re kind of through the other side of some of those IDFA headwinds we’ve been talking about for the last year or so? And any more color just kind of that journey of the AI-driven adage would be appreciated. And secondly, Mark, kind of diving in that annual theme of efficiency and following on Buzz’s post. What’s the right way to think about long-term investment intensity in Reality Labs and kind of balancing that with the ambition to build the next computing platform. Is this the right intensity of kind of where you’re at right now to think about? Or are there any milestones we should be looking for? Thanks."
META,2023-02-01,2023-02-02,,2023-02-01,2023-02-01T17:00:00-05:00,0,2023-02-01,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks Mark. So on your first question, we are continuing to make progress in mitigating the impact from the ATT change. But this is more generally just the reality of the online advertising environment that we operate in now. So we’re continuing to work on building tools that mitigate the impact of those changes, and we see strong adoption of those tools, including tools we’ve talked about before like CAPI Gateway, etcetera. We’re also investing in ways to bring conversions on site, and we have a lot of ad formats that have been instrumental in doing so across both click-to-messaging ads, leads ads – lead ads and shop adds being formats that bring conversions on site. And then over the longer run, we’re continuing to invest in our privacy-enhancing technologies to more fundamentally enable us to deliver more performance and privacy-safe ads to advertisers. Javi, is there anything you want to add on that?"
META,2023-02-01,2023-02-02,,2023-02-01,2023-02-01T17:00:00-05:00,0,2023-02-01,qa,,Javier Olivan,"Yes. And I think, Susan, you touched on most of it, I think if you look at the strategy on ads, we really have two parts, which is continue investing in AI and that’s where we are seeing a lot of the improvement in ads relevance. And as Mark was saying, we saw over 20% more conversions than in the prior year, which, combined with the decline in cost per acquisition, results on high ROIs. We also use it for automated experiences for the advertisers, improvements on measurement, which allow advertisers to do better decisions. But the second part is bringing more conversions onsite, which are also obviously helping offsetting this Signal loss. Indeed, we are reframing the column of the Signal growth opportunity. And one example we believe that where just to give another example, IRIS [ph], which is an online marketing and sales automation agency in Italy for hotels and resorts. They use this app to collect a higher volume of qualified links at a lower cost, so basically compared to offsite leads [indiscernible]. They managed to achieve a 2x more final bookings with onsite leads, 4x more qualified leads than onsite based on a 2.7x lower cost per lead with onsite versus the alternative option in the lead acquisition offsite."
META,2023-02-01,2023-02-02,,2023-02-01,2023-02-01T17:00:00-05:00,0,2023-02-01,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Alright. And I can give some color on – and I think there was a question about how we’re thinking about this efficiency theme as it applies to Reality Labs over time. I guess there are two ways that I think this applies. The first thing is, I think it’s important to not just think about Reality Labs as one thing, right? There are like three major areas, right? There is the augmented reality work long-term, which is actually the biggest area, but hasn’t – but it’s still a large research problem. There is a lot of work there that we haven’t actually shipped the product yet. VR, which is starting to ramp, right, Quest 2, I think, did quite well. We have multiple product lines there with the Quest Pro. And then the smallest by kind of budget size today is the Metaverse software program. And that’s – it doesn’t reflect the importance of it. I think the software and social platform might be the most critical part of what we’re doing, but software is just a lot less capital intensive to build than the hardware. So it’s the smallest part of the program. And within each of those areas, there are a lot of different things that we’re doing. So just like any project that we would run we’re constantly learning from how the products that we’ve shipped are doing, how the market is evolving overall, how competitors are doing, and what reaction they are seeing to different things, and what experiments are being played out. And we’re kind of constantly tuning the road map. And obviously, some of these are longer-term things, right? So you start planning out the hardware that you’re going to ship 2, 3 years in advance. But we’re kind of constantly looking at the signals and learning and making decisions about what it makes sense to do forward. So that’s definitely going to continue. And we will – even though I’m – none of the signals that I’ve seen so far suggests that we should shift the Reality Lab strategy long-term. We are constantly adjusting the specifics of how we adjust – of how we execute this. So I think that we will certainly look at that as part of the ongoing efficiency work. The other piece is just different tactics, things like trying to flatten the org, things like that. Those are going to apply across the whole company. So we expect that within the road map that we’re trying to execute, both on Reality Labs and Family of Apps, we just want to focus on making all of our work more efficient. A lot of the time, when people talk about efficiency, there is a lot of focus on prioritization and which big things can you cut. But I actually think what makes you a better company over time is being able to execute and do more things because you’re operating more efficiently, and you can get things done with fewer resources. So I’d like to kind of get us to that mode more, which I guess gets me to a higher level point in this, which is I just think we’re in – we’ve entered somewhat of a phase change for the company, where we just grew so quickly for like the first 18 years of the company’s growth. And it’s very hard to really crank on efficiency while you’re growing that quickly. And I just think we’re in a different environment now where we have a bunch of areas that, I mean, you’re still extremely exciting and growing quickly for the future, where I think the right strategy will be to focus on kind of top line growth. But I think a lot of what we do, it really just makes sense to really focus on the efficiency a lot more than we had previously and making sure that we can do that work more effectively. For what it’s worth, I think if we do that well, it will be – I think we will be able to do better product work. And I think it will be a more fun place for people to work because I think they are going to get more stuff done. So I’m pretty committed to this, and it’s going to go across all of the different things that we’re doing."

I was just hoping you could talk about some of the areas where you may be able to get increased efficiency still? And then what does the new expense outlook suggest for hiring levels in ‘23? And then separately, I was hoping you could comment on the issues in Europe around Meta’s use of first-party data to target ads. How could this get resolved? And how should we think about the risk to Meta? Thanks."

So, the primary components of the reduction in the 2023 expense outlook are across three areas. The first is slower payroll growth. So, we are continuing to scrutinize how we allocate resources across the company on this. We have a broad hiring freeze in place right now. And we continue to expect a slower pace of hiring in the year as we evaluate what roles we are going to open. I will role in the answer to your second question here, which is this is an ongoing process for us. We don’t presently have a hiring target to share for the end of the year. The second component of the lower expense outlook is on cost of revenue. We are expecting slower growth. Depreciation here is impacted by us extending the useful lives of non-AI servers in Q4. And then the third component is our outlook now reflects an estimated $1 billion in facilities’ consolidation charges. That’s down from the prior $2 billion estimate that we gave in the last guidance range since a portion of the previously estimated charges were already recognized in Q4 2022. So, those are really the big – those are really the primary issues as it pertains to the lower expense outlook. Your second question was on the issues in Europe around Meta using data to target ads. So, I think if you are referring to the EU DPC ruling that we have to change our approach regarding our reliance on contractual necessity as a legal basis for ads in Europe, that’s a decision. We don’t agree with it. We believe that our current approach is GDPR compliant, and we are appealing the substance of the rulings and the fines. We don’t expect that those decisions are going to affect our ability to provide personalized advertising in the EU, and that advertisers should be able to continue to use our platforms to reach customers and grow their businesses."

On ATT, I think what I would say is there is still certainly an absolute headwind to our revenue number. That is the impact of the ATT changes being in place. Having said that, we are lapping its rollout and adoption and we are making progress in mitigating the impact due to a lot of the work that both Javi and I just talked about, including the different advertiser tools, including ad formats that bring conversions on-site and including the longer term AI investments in privacy-enhancing technologies. The second part of your question was on, oh, anything from Android and other headwinds. On Android, it’s too early to know where this will land. I think Google is taking an approach that is collaborating with the industry, which we think is critical, and we will have updates as more time elapses there. And then your third – the third part of your question, I think was on regulatory issues in the EU, I think this was on DSA. We are expecting – we have been preparing for some time to comply with DSA and meet the compliance deadlines that we expect to come into effect this year. Those are meaningful but manageable segment of costs. We have been preparing for a long time, and those costs have been factored already into our total expense guidance."

Just staying on the theme of the efficiency and with all the adjustments to your cost basis lately, can you maybe just speak to the relationship you are trying to build between revenue growth and OpEx, CapEx growth over time? I think the last time we saw them move in tandem or close to each other was back in 2017. So, are you at a point where you would want them to grow much closer to each other, or are we still in an investment mode and therefore, potentially margin compression mode beyond just 2023? And then maybe, Mark, can you just provide an update on kind of the health of the broad digital ad space, especially for the SMB side and DR. Just curious if coming out of Q4, you are incrementally bullish or you are still as cautious as that you are three months or six months ago? Thank you."

So certainly, the lower expense outlook and CapEx outlook puts us in a better position in terms of financial performance for this year. We are I think still – we are focused on the goal that Mark outlined, I think last quarter of delivering compounding earnings growth, while enabling aggressively in the future technology. And that continues to be the principle by which we are – by which we are guiding our financial plans. The second question is on update – oh, on the health of the broader digital ad space. I can take – I can start with this and Javi, you should feel free to jump in if you want to add more color. Q4, for us, we saw that the holiday season, for us, fell mostly within our range of expectations. Trends in online commerce modestly improved for us, which is encouraging, but again, the growth was still negative year-over-year. So, overall, I think this is still a pretty volatile macro environment. It’s early in the year to know how this will shape up for 2023. And if there is anything, Javi, you would like to add, you can jump in."

Mark, I wanted to talk a little bit more around the progress on the AI discovery engine in Reels. And we are seeing it in our own usage in terms of content and categories and just getting more insights and content that we would like to see.

But in general, a lot of the gains that we are seeing on the discovery engine overall, which we basically used to refer to our AI recommendation system across Facebook and Instagram across all different content types of which Reels is sort of a special case, and that’s growing the fastest with short-form video. But a lot of this is – I mean there is not like one specific data type that’s useful. A lot of the trends that we are seeing here is, we are using larger models, which require more computation. We have shifted the models from being more CPU-based to being GPU-based. We have seen big improvements in the amount of time and engagement that we have gotten. And we – it’s a little bit hard for us to predict exactly how much we will be able to continue tuning those and improving. But from the experience that we have had so far, I would bet that there is still pretty significant upside there. I know that you kind of asked about specific data points, but I think that that’s really the theme that we are seeing. And that applies across Reels and the rest of the discovery engine. The – one thing that I would add, it’s a little bit separate from your question, but we do spend most of the time talking about Reels, so maybe it’s worth giving some color on the rest of the discovery engine work, which is, it has also been doing quite well and is much more incremental to the rest of the business because if people end up being able to discover additional photos or links or groups or things like that in Facebook or just interesting content across Instagram, then they are just more engaged in the product. And we already know how to monetize that content. So, that ends up being really helpful both for the overall engagement, not very cannibalistic at all and already profitable. So, that’s – we have spent less time talking about that because I get that Reels is sort of the faster-growing area. But we do still expect that as a percent of the overall feeds in Facebook and Instagram, recommended content will continue growing. I don’t know if it will be a majority by the end of this year, but maybe it will be 30%-ish, 40%, something in that zone, and continuing to grow because we can just find content that people are going to be interested in that may not be from accounts that they have followed directly. So, hopefully, that’s some useful color on what we are seeing across those efforts."

Sorry, I will go ahead and take the first question about Realty Labs, and Javi, you can take the second question on shop ads. On Reality Labs, we still expect our full year Reality Labs losses to increase in 2023, and we are going to continue to invest meaningfully in this area given the significant long-term opportunities that we see. It is a long-duration investment, and our investments here are underpinned by the accompanying need to drive overall operating profit growth while we are making these investments. I will turn it to Javi on the shop ads."

So, in Q4, we continued to test shop ads in the U.S., and we are seeing increased performance by helping direct the consumer to the place where they are most likely to purchase. So, it’s early to know, but we really finally saw product market fit in the test. It’s off a small base. But to just give you a sense, we saw triple-digit growth in both revenue and adoption across Q4. And we expect this growth to normalize to a lower level in 2023. And the shop ads beta has a revenue run rate in the hundreds of millions of dollars. So, that gives you a small base. It’s a small revenue run rate yet, but it’s growing rapidly. And we expect it to continue, but normalize to more lower levels in 2023."

How do you think about the growth path for that going forward? And do you find that that’s bringing in brand-new advertisers to Meta that you hadn’t seen before? Like who is coming in on that? And does that give you a new growth path? And then, Mark, if I could just ask you. This year of efficiency, it’s almost like there has been a journey going on since early last year when you talked about – talking about driving the business for growing operating profit. And I guess I just want to ask the why question. I mean it’s – the markets obviously like what they are hearing from you today and the changes. But why the much greater focus on efficiency, not just tonight, but kind of over the last 9 months or 12 months with maybe a few hiccups. Like what – is it just the maturity of the business? Is it just trying to take on advantage of a crisis, but there is a crisis out there in terms of the economy, and maybe that forced minds to think this way. Just a little bit more color on the why. Thanks a lot."
META,2023-02-01,2023-02-02,,2023-02-01,2023-02-01T17:00:00-05:00,0,2023-02-01,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks. This is Susan. On the click-to-messaging ads, so we are – this is one of our fastest-growing ads products. And we believe that they are bringing incremental demand onto our platform. I mentioned in my script that over half of click-to-message advertisers exclusively use click-to-message ads on our platform. In terms – you asked how we are going to scale and I think there are a couple of dimensions. In terms of demand, I think the biggest piece here is getting more businesses to adopt click-to-messaging ads via creating more entry points, simplifying creation flows. We are trying to integrate with partners who can help smaller businesses scale. So, there is a lot of work going on there. On the performance side, we are continuing to focus on just driving up the ROI that advertisers get from click-to-messaging ads. We are trying to give advertisers the ability to do more down-funnel optimization, create better in-thread experiences and simplify flows that help them drive conversion. And then ultimately, we are always focused on growing supply and in this case, growing the business messaging ecosystem by creating more ways for people and businesses to connect across our messaging app. So, I think an example of that would be something like business direct research on WhatsApp. So, it’s an opportunity we are very excited about and we have invested a lot in and we have seen very healthy growth. I will turn it to Mark on the efficiency question."
META,2023-02-01,2023-02-02,,2023-02-01,2023-02-01T17:00:00-05:00,0,2023-02-01,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes. So, I mean on the efficiency point, I think we come to it from a few places. I mean one is just like the journey of the company. And for the first 18 years, I think we grew at 20%, 30% compound or a lot more every year, right. And then obviously, that changed very dramatically in 2022, where our revenue was negative for the growth for the first time in the company’s history. So, that was a pretty big step down. And we don’t anticipate that, that’s going to continue, but I also don’t think it’s going to necessarily go back to the way it was before. So, I do think this is a pretty rapid phase change there that I think just forced us to basically take a step back and say, okay, we can’t just treat everything like it’s hyper growth. There are going to be some areas that are going to be very rapidly growing or that are very kind of future investments that we want to make. But we also have a lot of things now that are – just kind of have a lot of people using them and support large amounts of business and that we think we should operate somewhat differently. So, there is that piece of it. But the other part of it that I would say is that as we started doing the work, I actually think it makes us better, right. And that was somewhat unexpected, right. I kind of historically would have thought that this would just occupy some amount of our mind space and that, that would be more of a trade-off against how we are able to build products and get things done. But at this point, I am actually fairly optimistic that there are a pretty good roadmap of things that we can do that will just make us more efficient and actually better able to build the things that we want. Not all of them will help save money, right. So, for example, focusing on AI tools to help improve engineer productivity, it’s not necessarily going to reduce costs. Although over the long-term, maybe it will make it so we can have fewer – we just hire less, right, and stay a smaller company for longer. But I do think things like reducing layers of management just make it so information flows better through the company and so you can make faster decisions. And I think ultimately, that will help us not only make better products, but I think it will help us attract and retain the best people who want to work in a faster-moving environment. And so that honestly was a little bit surprising, right, that as we started digging into this that the company would actually start to feel better to me. And I don’t know how long that will – like how long the roadmap is, if things that what we can continue to do where that will be the case. But I do think we have a good amount of things like that. So, that’s why I am really focused on this now. And I do want to continue to emphasize the dual goals here of making the company a better technology company and increasing our profitability. They are both important, but I think it’s also really important to focus on the first one of just making it a better company because that way, even if we outperform our business goals this year, I just want to communicate, especially the people inside the company that we are going to stick with this, because I think it’s just going to make us a better company over the long-term. So, I think that’s it for now."

For – I mean for Q1, we are – our guidance range of $26 billion to $28.5 billion corresponds to negative 7% to plus 2% year-over-year growth. And it reflects a wide range of uncertainty given the continuation of the general macro environment that we have been operating in. Again, we are pleased with the core engagement trends that we have talked about and the performance improvements that we are delivering for advertisers with our monetization work and our investments in AI. And we expect FX to be less of a headwind to year-over-year growth in Q1 than it was in Q4. But again, we are keeping a close eye on advertising demand and on the ongoing macroeconomic volatility."

This was a good quarter and we're seeing growing momentum in our products and business. Our community reached the milestone that now more than 3 billion people use at least one of our apps each day. Facebook also reached the milestone of 200 million daily actives in the U.S. and Canada after last quarter reaching 2 billion daily actives worldwide.  Now in a moment, I'll talk more about the results in our business and the opportunities that I'm excited about. But first I want to share an update on our efficiency work. The goals of our efficiency work are to make us a stronger technology company that builds better products faster, and to improve our financial performance to give us the space in a difficult environment to execute our ambitious long-term vision.  When we started this work last year, our business wasn't performing as well as I wanted. But now we're increasingly doing this work from a position of strength. Even as our financial position improves, I continue to believe that slowing hiring, flattening our management structure increasing the percent of our company that is technical, and more rigorously prioritizing projects will improve the speed and quality of our work. I also believe that a stronger financial position will enable us to weather a volatile environment, while remaining focus on our longer term priorities.  So far, we've gone through two of the three waves of restructuring and layoffs that we have planned for this year, in our recruiting and our technical groups. In May, we're going to carry out our third wave across our business groups. And this has been a difficult process. But after this is done, I think we're going to have a much more stable environment for our employees. And then for the rest of the year, I expect us to focus on improving our distributed work model, delivering AI tools to improve productivity and removing unnecessary processes across the company.  Now moving on to our products and business. We're seeing strong engagement growth across our apps and good progress on monetization efficiency, which combined to drive good business results. Reels continues to grow quickly on both Facebook and Instagram, Reels also continue to become more social with people resharing Reels more than 2 billion times every day, doubling over the last six months. Reels are also increasing overall app engagement, and we believe that we're gaining share in short form video too.  Now a key theme that I want to discuss today is AI. I've emphasized for a number of these calls now that there were two major technological waves driving our roadmap, a huge AI wave today, and a building Metaverse wave for the future. And our AI work comes in two main areas. First, the massive recommendations and ranking infrastructure that powers all of our products, from feed to Reels, to our ad system, to our integrity systems and that we've been working on for many, many years. And second, the new generative foundation models that are enabling entirely new classes of products and experiences.  Our investment in recommendations and ranking systems has driven a lot of the results that we're seeing today across our discovery engine, Reels and ads, along with surfacing content from friends and family. Now, more than 20% of content in your Facebook and Instagram feeds are recommended by AI from people groups or accounts that you don't follow. Across all of Instagram, that's about 40% of the content that you see.  Since we launched Reels, AI recommendations have driven a more than 24% increase in time spent on Instagram. Our AI work is also improving monetization. Reels monetization efficiency is up over 30% on Instagram and over 40% on Facebook quarter-over-quarter. Daily revenue from Advantage+ shopping campaigns is up 7x in the last six months.  Our work to build out business messaging as the next pillar of our business is making progress too. I shared last quarter that click to message ads reached a $10 billion revenue run rate. And since then, the number of businesses using our other business messaging service paid messaging on WhatsApp has grown by 40% quarter-over-quarter. Our success here depends on delivering results for other businesses, and at our scale that can have macroeconomic effects.  We recently did a study with economists at UC Berkeley to understand the impact that our services make. And they concluded that every dollar spent on our ads drives on average $3.31 in revenues for our advertisers in the U.S. That means over $400 billion in economic activity annually is linked to supply chains relying on our platforms, supporting more than 3 million jobs.  Beyond recommendations, the other major focus of our AI work is foundation models to enable a lot of new use cases, including Generative AI. That's been a pretty amazing year of progress on this front. And the work happening now is going to impact every single one of our apps and services. And I'm incredibly excited to ship more of the things that we're building over the coming months.  Now I want to share a little bit about our approach and what you can expect to see from us. And the specifics are going to come into focus as we ship more these things. So these are just themes for now. But first for our product, we're always focused on connection and expression. And I expect that our AI work will reflect that. I think that there's an opportunity to introduce AI agents to billions of people in ways that will be useful and meaningful. We're exploring chat experiences and WhatsApp and messenger, visual creation tools for posts and Facebook and Instagram and ads, overtime video and multimodal experiences as well. I expect that these tools will be valuable for everyone from regular people to creators to businesses.  For example, I expect that a lot of interest in AI agents for business messaging, and customer support will come once we nail that experience. Now over time, this will extend to our work on the metaverse to where people will much more easily be able to create avatars, objects, worlds and code to tile them together.  All right, next, let's talk about the technology platform to enable this. Right now most of the companies that are training large language models have business models that lead them to a closed approach to development. And I think that there's an important opportunity in the industry to help create an open ecosystem. And if we can help be a part of this, then much of the industry, I think will standardize on using these open tools and help improve them further. So this will make it easier for other companies to integrate with our products and platforms as we enable more integrations. And that will help our product stay at the leading edge as well.  Our approach to AI and our infrastructure has always been fairly open. We open source many of our state-of-the-art models so people can experiment and build with them. This quarter we released our LLaMa LLM to researchers. It has 65 billion parameters but outperformed larger models and has proven quite popular. We've also open sourced 3 other groundbreaking visual models along with their training data and model weights, Segment Anything, DINOv2 and our animated drawings tool, and we've gotten some positive feedback on all of those as well. Now finally, let's talk about AI infrastructure and the CapEx. This has been a major investment for us. A couple of years ago, I asked our infra teams to put together ambitious plans to build out enough capacity to support not only our existing products but also enough buffer capacity for major new products as well. And this has been the main driver of our increased CapEx spending over the past couple of years.  Now at this point, we are no longer behind in building out our AI infrastructure. And to the contrary, we now have the capacity to do leading work in this space at scale. As these new models and use cases continue scaling, we're going to need to continue investing in infrastructure, although we'll have a better idea of the trajectory of that investment later in the year once we can gauge usage of some of the new products we'll launch. Now beyond AI, the other major technology wave that we're focused on is the metaverse. A narrative has developed that we're somehow moving away from focusing on the metaverse vision. So I just want to say upfront that, that's not accurate. We've been focusing on both AI and the Metaverse for years now, and we will continue to focus on both. The two areas are also related. Breakthrough in computer vision was what enabled us to ship the first stand-alone VR device.  Mixed reality is built on a stack of AI technologies for understanding the physical world and blending it with digital objects. Being able to procedurally generate worlds will be important for delivering compelling experiences at scale. And our vision for AR glasses involves an AI-centric operating system that we think will be the basis for the next generation of computing. Metaverse technologies will also help deliver AI as well. For example, embodying AI agents will take advantage of the deep investment that we've made in avatars over the last several years. Building the Metaverse is a long-term project, but the rationale for it remains the same, and we remain committed to it. Now in the near term, we've reached a few milestones that I think are worth calling out. More than 1 billion Meta Avatars have now been created. Since last year, the number of titles in the Quest store with at least $25 million in revenue has doubled. And more than half of Quest daily actives now spend more than an hour using their device. The next milestone is that we're gearing up to launch our next-generation consumer virtual and mixed reality device later this year. We launched Quest 2 almost three years ago at this point. It was a very big step forward for VR. And I'm really excited to show the world all of the improvements in new technology that we have developed since then at a price point that will be accessible for lots of people. All right. So that's what I want to cover today. We're seeing good momentum in our products and business. We have incredibly exciting opportunities ahead in our Family of Apps, AI and the Metaverse. I'm confident that our efficiency work will improve our ability to execute on all of this. As always, I'm grateful for our teams for all of your work. I know that this has been a challenging period, but I'm proud of the work that you're doing. And I'm also grateful for all of you for being on this journey with us.  And now over to Susan."
META,2023-04-26,2023-04-27,,2023-04-26,2023-04-26T19:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-26,prepared,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $28.6 billion, up 3% or 6% on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q1 of last year, total revenue would have been about $816 million higher.  Q1 total expenses were $21.4 billion, up 10% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 2%, driven by infrastructure-related costs that were partially offset by lower Reality Labs cost of goods sold. R&D increased 22%, driven primarily by restructuring charges related to facilities consolidation and severance expenses and headcount-related costs from our Reality Labs and Family of Apps segments.  Marketing and sales decreased 8% due mainly to lower marketing spend and headcount-related expenses. And G&A increased 22% due primarily to restructuring charges related to severance and facilities consolidation expenses and legal-related expenses. We ended the first quarter with over 77,100 employees, down 11% from the fourth quarter as our reported headcount no longer includes substantially all of the employees impacted by the November layoffs. Employees that were impacted by layoffs in March are still included in the first quarter headcount.  First quarter operating income was $7.2 billion, representing a 25% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 22%. Net income was $5.7 billion or $2.20 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $7.1 billion driven by investments in data centers, servers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $6.9 billion, and we repurchased $9.2 billion of our Class A common stock in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with $37.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow. For the first time, we surpassed 3 billion people using at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March, and approximately 3.8 billion people use at least one on a monthly basis.  Facebook continues to grow globally as well, and engagement remains strong with DAU and MAU growing sequentially across all regions in the first quarter. Facebook daily active users were 2.04 billion, up 4% or 77 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 68% of the 2.99 billion monthly active users in March. MAUs grew by 53 million or 2% compared to last year.  Q1 total Family of Apps revenue was $28.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $28.1 billion, up 4% or 7% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth followed by health care and entertainment and media. Online commerce benefited from strong spend among advertisers in China reaching customers in other markets. However, other verticals remain challenged with financial services and technology verticals being the largest negative contributors to year-over-year growth.  On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World at 9%, followed by North America and Asia Pacific at 6% and 4%, respectively. Europe declined 1%. Foreign currency remained a headwind to advertising revenue growth in all international regions. In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 26% and the average price per ad decreased 17%.  Impression growth was primarily driven by Asia Pacific and Rest of World. The year-over-year decline in pricing was primarily driven by strong impression growth, especially from lower monetizing services and regions, foreign currency depreciation and lower advertising demand. While overall pricing remains under pressure from these factors, we believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers. Family of Apps other revenue was $205 million in Q1, down 5%, as strong business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp business platform was more than offset by a decline in other line items. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q1, Family of Apps expenses were $17.1 billion representing approximately 80% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 9% due primarily to restructuring charges and growth in infrastructure-related costs. Family of Apps operating income was $11.2 billion, representing a 40% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $339 million, down 51% due to lower Quest 2 sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.3 billion, up 18% due mostly to employee-related costs and restructuring charges. Reality Labs operating loss was $4 billion. Next, I'll discuss our ongoing monetization work. As I mentioned last quarter, there are two primary levers to increasing monetization, growing supply and demand. On the ad supply side, our foremost focus remains on building engaging experiences for our community, and we're continuing to make encouraging progress on our product priorities. Our investments in the discovery engine are delivering results.  In Feed, recommendations are contributing to engagement, and we've seen real time become more incremental to overall engagement on our services as we continue to improve our recommendation system. This is an important signal because it demonstrates that people are finding added value from the content we're helping them discover.  Beyond that, we continue to focus on further narrowing the gap in monetization efficiency or monetization per time between Reels and our more mature surfaces, Feed and Stories. There are structural supply constraints with the Reels format as people view a reel for a longer time than a piece of Feed or Stories content, which results in fewer opportunities to serve ads in between posts. That will make it likely more challenging to close the monetization efficiency gap than it was with Stories.  However, the overall economics of Reels will be determined by a combination of our ability to continue growing monetization per time on Reels and our ability to drive incremental engagement from Reels. As Mark noted, we have seen a 24% increase in overall time spent on Instagram from our ranking improvements since launching Reels globally. We continue to expect that Reels will become neutral to overall revenue by end of this year or early next year. The other side of monetization is growing advertiser demand. One area of focus is around driving advertiser performance, and we are seeing continued strong conversion growth for advertisers, which we believe, coupled with lower cost per action, is driving higher return on investment.  We remain focused on continuing to improve ads ranking and measurement with our ongoing AI investments while also leveraging AI to power increased automation for advertisers through products like Advantage+ shopping, which continues to gain adoption and receive positive feedback from advertisers. These investments will help us develop and deploy privacy-enhancing technologies and build new innovative tools that make it easier for businesses to not only find the right audience for their ad, but also optimize and eventually develop their ad creative. Scaling on-site conversions is another important part of our work, and click-to-message ads continue to grow and bring incremental demand onto our platform. This format is mostly used by smaller advertisers today in Southeast Asia and Latin America, and one of the exciting opportunities ahead is to expand adoption to larger advertisers in more markets by investing in increased automation and reporting to help businesses more easily manage messages and measure results at scale. Before turning to our revenue outlook, I'd also like to talk about our operating philosophy given the recent significant changes to our investment plans. We believe increasing our organizational efficiency is vital to our long-term success. This will increase the speed of our execution and agility to ensure that we are constantly innovating for the people who use our services. Narrowing the scope of the projects that we are working on allows us to increase our focus on the highest leverage opportunities for the company, including AI today and the Metaverse longer term. It also enables us to invest in these areas while maintaining a strong financial position.  As we look forward, I also expect that we will modestly evolve our capital structure over time to improve our overall cost of capital. We expect to do so through periodically accessing the debt markets to diversify our funding sources while still maintaining a positive or neutral net cash balance over time. In addition, we continue to monitor ongoing regulatory developments. We expect the IDPC to issue a decision in May in its previously disclosed inquiry relating to transatlantic data transfers of Facebook EU EEA user data, including a suspension order for such transfers and a fine. Our ongoing consultations with policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic continue to indicate that the proposed new EU-U.S. data privacy framework will be fully implemented before the deadline for suspension of such transfers, but we cannot exclude the possibility that it will not be completed in time. We will also evaluate whether and to what extent the IDPC decision could otherwise impact our data processing operations even after a new data privacy framework is in force. Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect second quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $29.5 billion to $32 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency headwinds will be less than 1% to year-over-year total revenue growth in the second quarter based on current exchange rates. Turning now to the expense outlook. We anticipate our full year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $86 million to $90 billion, updated from our prior outlook provided in March. This outlook includes $3 billion to $5 billion of restructuring costs related to facilities consolidation charges and severance and other personnel costs. We continue to expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023. Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $30 billion to $33 billion, unchanged from our prior estimate. This outlook reflects our ongoing build-out of AI capacity to support ads, Feed and Reels, along with an increased investment in capacity for our generative AI initiatives. On to tax. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full year 2023 tax rate percentage to be around 20%. In closing, Q1 was a solid quarter for our business. Our global community continued to grow. We made important progress on our company priorities and improved the efficiency of our operations while strengthening the financial position of the company which sets us up well to execute on the opportunities ahead.  With that, Dave, let's open up the call for questions."

Mark, first one for you is on generative AI and how you think about generative AI and some of the division models and your large language models potentially impacting your long-term advertising business and finding ways to deliver more value for advertisers over the next two, three, five years? How do you see gen AI impacting advertising? Then the second one for Susan. Just as we're thinking about hiring expectations for '24 and beyond. I think there's been some ink in the press about potential 1% to 2% hiring going forward. Can you just talk to us about that a little bit? And how does using AI internally factor in your thoughts about long-term hiring? Thanks."

Although there aren't that many details that I'm going to share at this point, more of this will come in focus as we start shipping more of these things over the coming months.  But I do think that there's a big opportunity here. You asked specifically about advertisers, but I think it's going to also help create more engaging experiences, which should create more engagement, and that, by itself, creates more opportunities for advertisers. But then I think that there's a bunch of opportunities on the visual side to help advertisers create different creative. We don't have the tools to do that over time, eventually making it.  So we've always strived to just have an advertiser just be able to tell us what their objective is and then have us to be able to do as much of the work as possible for them and now being able to do more of the creative work there and ourselves for those who want that, I think, could be a very exciting opportunity. I also think that there's going to be a very interesting convergence between some of the AI agents in messaging and business messaging, where right now, we see a lot of the places where business messaging is most successful are places where a lot of businesses can afford to basically have people answering a lot of questions for people and engaging with them in chat. And obviously, once you light up the ability for tens of millions of small businesses to have AI agents acting on their behalf, you'll have way more businesses that can afford to have someone engaging in chat with customers. So I think that, that could be a pretty big opportunity, too. So those are just a few of the things that we're looking at. I think this is very broad. Like I said, I think this is literally going to touch every single one of our products and services in multiple ways. So -- and this is just a very big wave and new set of technologies that's available, and we're working on it across the whole company."
META,2023-04-26,2023-04-27,,2023-04-26,2023-04-26T19:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-26,qa,,Susan Li,"Hi, Brian, it's Susan. Thanks for the question. You were asking about the 1% to 2% head count growth stat that's been out there. And I thought it was worth clarifying. So that comes from something Mark mentioned in a recent internal employee Q&A that he had expected company head count to increase only 1% to 2% year-over-year.  And I want to clarify that Mark was actually speaking to employees about head count budgets that have already been allocated. What we've also said previously is we have been in a broad-based hiring freeze for the last half year. And as we complete our layoffs in April and May, we will resume hiring, and we would expect head count growth in excess of 1% to 2% in 2024 as a result as we ramp up those recruiting pipelines. But our long-term focus is very much on efficiency. And as hiring resumes, you'll find the biggest areas that we are hiring in will be to support priority areas like generative AI, ads, infrastructure, Reality Labs, some of the areas that we've been talking about. And you also asked about using AI internally and how that factors into our thoughts on long-term hiring. We certainly don't have enough visibility yet into how AI will make our workforce more productive, but it's something we're excited about. And I think we will have more clarity on that as more tools begin getting developed to enhance employee productivity across the industry."

Mark, I was intrigued by your comment about open source and open systems with respect to AI. Obviously, we're coming off of Web2 in mobile, where there are a lot more walled gardens and ecosystems. Can you talk a little bit about what you might want to try to do, either from a priority or an investment standpoint to be a driver of more open-ended systems in AI compared to what we saw with Web2? And then maybe for Susan. You introduced the concept last quarter about revisiting your data center architecture over the medium to long term. Is there any update there for us in terms of how to think about AI as a driver of data center architecture medium to long term or what that might mean for capital intensity? Thanks so much."
META,2023-04-26,2023-04-27,,2023-04-26,2023-04-26T19:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-26,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yeah, I can take the first one. I think that there's an important distinction between the products we offer and a lot of the technical infrastructure, especially the software that we write to support that.  And historically, whether it's the open compute project that we've done or just open sourcing a lot of the infrastructure that we've built, we've historically open sourced a lot of that infrastructure even though the products themselves are obviously -- we're not -- we haven’t open sourced the code for our core products or anything like that.  And the reason why I think why we do this is that unlike some of the other companies in the space, we're not selling a cloud computing service where we try to keep the different software infrastructure that we're building proprietary. For us, it's way better if the industry standardizes on the basic tools that we're using. And therefore, we can benefit from the improvements that others make and others use of those tools can, in some cases, like Open Compute, drive down the costs of those things, which make our business more efficient, too. So I think to some degree, we're just playing a different game on the infrastructure than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon, and that creates different incentives for us. So overall, I think that, that's going to lead us to do more work in terms of open sourcing some of the lower-level models and tools. But of course, a lot of the product work itself is going to be specific and integrated with the things that we do.  So it's not that everything we do is going to be open. Obviously, a bunch of this needs to be developed in a way that creates unique value for our products. But I think in terms of the basic models, I would expect us to be pushing and helping to build out an open ecosystem here, which I think is something that's going to be important."
META,2023-04-26,2023-04-27,,2023-04-26,2023-04-26T19:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-26,qa,,Susan Li,"Hi, Eric, so I think your question had 2 parts. The first was an update on the data center architecture that we announced last quarter. And we're progressing with construction there, but the new data centers that we're building are intended really for future year capacity. So they won't come online for a few years. So we don't have too much more to share there, except that, that work is ongoing. And the second part of your question was really, I think about how AI might drive capital intensity over the next few years. So you can really think about our CapEx investment as having 3 broad buckets. The first, we've talked about before, non-AI compute needs. We do have ongoing general compute and storage needs to support the existing business, but this is an area where we've become much more efficient in terms of capital intensity and are very much focused on continuing to do so over time. The second area is in our core AI investments, which is really most of our AI investment today, and that's supporting the building of the discovery engine, ranking unconnected organic content, ranking ads, and we're focused on measuring the return of those investments and making sure that we feel good about the ROI of our spend there, and that really will drive our future plans in terms of that core AI spend. And then the third bucket is really around CapEx investments now to support gen AI. And this is an emerging opportunity for us. We're still in the beginning stages of understanding the various applications and possible use cases. And I do think this may represent a significant investment opportunity for us that is earlier on the return curve relative to some of the other AI work that we've done. And it's a little too early to say how this is going to impact our overall capital intensity in the near term. So to the extent that we spend more on CapEx in the near future, I expect it mostly to be to power this work. But I want to emphasize that we remain focused overall in striking the right balance between building out the AI capacity we need and being efficient with our CapEx spend."

But if we compare where Meta is today kind of pre-IDFA cookie-application type of world, how do you see the relative competitive position in digital advertising? In light of all of these technical integrations and AI tools because I think the prevailing view is that privacy will level the playing field, but it certainly doesn't seem that way. And then second, for Susan, I certainly appreciate the outlook on the revenue guidance. But in light of some of the commentary we've been hearing about U.S. consumers trading down, is there any additional color you can share about kind of where you're seeing strengths and weaknesses effectively quarter-to-date and beyond? Thank you."
META,2023-04-26,2023-04-27,,2023-04-26,2023-04-26T19:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-26,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Mark. I can go ahead and take both of those. So your first question was about the post ATT landscape and how we're positioned. In terms of our ads business, we've talked really a great deal, of course, about this over the last few years. We're making progress certainly in mitigating the direct impact from ATT's platform changes. But this is really, I think, just the reality of the online advertising environment that we're in now.  And we've invested across not only sort of the direct mitigations that we've talked about in the past, including things like conversions API, but really, I think now we're focused on improving ad performance in the current signals landscape with our investments, both in increasing the volume of ads with on-site objectives; and then second of all, with our AI investments that have really, I think, enhanced the performance of our ads as well as enable us to introduce new tools and features for advertisers. So I think we're quite well positioned here in terms of on-site conversions. We have a lot of offerings that have been growing very well for us. I think we've talked a lot about click-to-messaging ads and what that has meant in terms of driving growth for our business and new business opportunities.  Other formats that have been, I think, performing well in terms of on-site conversions are lead ads, shops ads, so there are different ad formats that we're working on there. And then we've just really been investing in using AI for a long time to improve our ad systems, including ranking, to improve our modeling and measurement and again, support the introduction of new AI-powered tools and products. So I think we feel quite good about our relative position. Again, this is just work that we've been doing for a long time that, I think, in conjunction with seeing some stabilization in the macro environment, has enabled us to see that work pay off. And then your second question was about strengths and weaknesses in sort of the Q1 revenue performance as well as in our outlook. In terms of the Q1 revenue performance and the acceleration relative to Q4, we certainly saw stronger demand, including the impact of lapping the Ukraine war, which began in Q1 of 2022. And in particular, we saw acceleration among advertisers in China targeting users in other markets, which we believe was due, in part, to dropping shipping costs and easing COVID lockdowns for those advertisers. And then you've seen FX play a part there as well. Looking forward to Q2 and the back half of the year, it's certainly an easier compare there as there are tailwinds to year-over-year growth coming from lapping a weaker demand period and then moving into the first full quarter in Q2 without Russia revenue in terms of the comparison relative to Q2 2022. And we certainly expect that currency is also going to be less of a headwind than it was in the first quarter.  With that said, there's a broad range of expectations captured in our Q2 outlook. And it reflects that we feel it remains a volatile macro environment. The market has absorbed a lot of new developments over the last year with inflation, higher interest rates, banking and stability, et cetera. And it's hard to have perfect visibility on how those dynamics will impact the broader economy and specifically in the advertising markets for Q2 and for the rest of the year.  It also continues to be a challenging regulatory environment. So that's something that we're continuing to monitor closely. But on the other hand, we've been pleased with the performance we're delivering for advertisers and how those investments have paid off. Core engagement trends remain strong. And Reels is a revenue headwind today that we expect will become revenue neutral by the end of the year or early next year. Again, we expect FX will be a tailwind. And again, we're lapping relatively softer comps. So lots of puts and takes as we look beyond -- as we look into Q2 and beyond."

Susan, you've talked about the goal of building the muscle for long-term financial discipline. Just given the restructuring that we've seen across the business so far, how far along are you in building this muscle? And what gives you the confidence that it's durable and sustainable long term even in a better macro environment, especially given all the work ahead on AI and the Metaverse?"
META,2023-04-26,2023-04-27,,2023-04-26,2023-04-26T19:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-26,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Doug. I think there are a couple of components to this. A lot of this efficiency work that we've been undertaking and especially this year, is driven not sort of by solely financial imperative, but really with the focus of increasing operational efficiency. So that's been, I think, one of the foremost goals, and a lot of the work has been architected around that.  And that really includes more carefully scrutinizing road maps, winding down projects that are no longer at the top of our priority list, reprioritizing investments. That's really a muscle that, I think, we have spent a lot of time building over the last half year, and I expect that we will be carrying that discipline into the way that we assess our product road maps going forward. Similarly, I think a lot of the work that we've done around increasing operational efficiency, around making sure that we feel good about management spans and layers and all that work, I think, is also in service of making us a company that can build more and ship faster. And we would expect to sort of continue to make sure that we think our organizational posture is really in service, again, of building and shipping product.  And as we move forward, including out of the sort of the layoffs that we've been implementing in the direct restructuring work, we're going to continue focusing on efficiency work, including in other areas like helping investors -- sorry, helping developers build and ship quality products faster. We're going to be investing in tooling where we can to increase the velocity of product development. And we'll continue streamlining cross-functional or processes that might tax the development process or slow us down and make sure that we're really focused on also increasing the quality and frequency of collaborative and in person time to build relationships across the organization and get things done faster. So this is all -- I think I expect this to all be very much ongoing for us in the years to come."

I think really interesting stat on the Instagram time you gave. But just wondering how you'd characterize the health of the Facebook user base and usage on the site? Obviously, DAUs went up to 68% this quarter. I think Asia was really strong. But what are you seeing there? And is there kind of a catch-up here where the real content could certainly helping Facebook time spend as well as you saw with Instagram. But just stepping out, I think there is an area of that usage could be flat or down. Just wondering what your thoughts there. And what you're seeing on the core Facebook. Thank you."

In terms of core Facebook user growth, we've been pleased with the growth of the community and the engagement trends that we've been seeing. In particular, I think in Q1, DAU growth benefited from strong product execution. But I should also note that Q1 is a seasonally strong engagement quarter for us, so that has some benefit in terms of quarter-over-quarter growth.  You mentioned sort of whether the work in Reels is driving incremental -- or is driving engagement in Facebook, and what I would say there is that more broadly sort of the discovery engine work for us and the investments we've made ranking on connected content is expansive beyond Instagram, and I think it's certainly a part of what is also driving growth on Facebook as well."

I guess relative to OpEx guide from Q3 of last year, the new guide at the midpoint imply something like $10 billion to $15 billion lower adjusted for the restructuring costs. How does this impact your expectations for growth well beyond 2023? I'm not talking about this year. I'm just talking about the next, say, two to three years. Is it trying to get a sense of, is it all about efficiency? Or are we potentially cutting into the bone? And then on the regulatory front, can you just help explain how changes to the transatlantic data transfer rules may impact your European business as it goes into effect? Just trying to get a sense if we have potentially an IDFA situation with a signal loss here again. Thank you."

So for your first question, how much sort of has the -- the total expense guidance coming down, especially since we sort of issued our first passive guidance in Q3 last year, how has that downward sort of trend impacted our expectations beyond 2022 in the next two or three years.  So we certainly haven't shared expense guidance for the out years. And frankly, that's something that we are ourselves working on internally as we lay our long term as we undergo our long-term planning exercise. But I do think that a lot of the muscle that we're building with regard to efficiency is going to translate into the longer run road map. And so I expect that we have really improved our cost structure over the last six months, and that's going to form the basis, along with an increased focus on operating efficiency going forward.  I think that's going to form the basis for sort of our future outlook. And making sure that we are kind of constantly evaluating our investment road map to make sure that we are investing against the highest priority work and deprioritizing and winding down investments again where we don't see the ROI or we don't see a compelling opportunity. So again, we don't have guidance to share yet on the out years, but I do expect the overall efficiency ethos very much to be a part of the coming years. On your second question on what the potential impact to our European business is of the transatlantic data transfer rule. So first, I want to emphasize, we continue to be hopeful that the new EU U.S. privacy framework will be implemented before a deadline for suspension. But if it comes to that, there's a lot that we don't know in terms of the specifics of a final order and how long a suspension order would last, which would be important variables in determining the overall impact.  What we do know is that roughly 10% of worldwide ad revenue comes from ads delivered to Facebook users in EU countries. But there are more details that we would need to understand, including the impact on advertisers in EU countries before we'd be able to really provide a more accurate or fulsome estimate of that impact."

Are there any restructuring charges still to be had, Susan, in Q2 or beyond that $3 billion to $5 billion that you talked about? Did we pretty much see all of that in Q1? And then secondly, I wonder if I could just get back to the broader opportunity around click-to-message. You've had -- Facebook has had these two wonderful assets or just three now messaging assets, but really leading off with WhatsApp for quite some time. It's always sort of undermonetized versus some of the other leading assets, but that seems to have really started to change. The numbers are becoming material.  You mentioned that there's a real power alley in terms of marketers in Latin America and Southeast Asia. How can you take what is really a differentiated product and really kind of blow it out more? How do you -- is there anything -- are there steps you can take to really get more advertisers to realize the opportunity just given the kind of cultural shifts, if you will, towards embracing messaging?

So on your first question about restructuring charges, Q1 restructuring charges are in the range of $1.1 billion, and then we gave a range of $3 billion to $5 billion for the full year. So we do expect that we will be recognizing further restructuring charges throughout the year.  And then the second question about the sort of opportunity in click-to-messaging ads and particularly in WhatsApp, what does the opportunity look like there? This is an area that we -- I mean, we're very excited about. We've invested a lot. We see continued opportunity to scale click-to-message, particularly in WhatsApp and the click to Instagram direct area. Both of those are earlier on the growth curve. And we're investing in a few areas to continue making it easier for people and businesses to connect.  First, we're really investing in trying to make it easier to create ads. So in the last year, we've invested in a revamped experience in ads manager, native ad creation experiences directly in WhatsApp. We're also scaling partners. So with the cloud-hosted API, we now have hosted API solutions across WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram so that our ecosystem of developers can help build good best-in-class experiences for businesses.  And then we're also working on making these ads more performance by driving more action further down funnel. So we're working on ranking and optimization to yield better conversion from these ads and introduce new ways to drive outcomes. We've introduced new features like in-thread payments and other commerce tools.  So we think that there's a big opportunity here. We're trying to make every part of the experience for advertisers, easier, better and more performance. And we're excited to also see growth beyond the core markets here in Southeast Asia and Latin America, where messaging is already common as a way for businesses to engage with customers and for businesses to engage with customers and their customer prospects. But we're hopeful that we'll see this also take off in other markets. We're seeing strong growth in the U.S. and Canada, but it's just earlier there today."

Or do you think there could be other, call it, business models that come out of that like APIs and other types of partnerships? Just any thoughts on that? And then second question is the -- back to the 24% increase in time spent on Instagram from Reels and content ranking. Pretty incredible. So how much of that was like lost engagement from folks like TikTok that you're now recouping? And how do you think about how much more runway you have to increase that?

So if you look at what we've done with PyTorch, for example, which is -- has generally become the standard in the industry is a tool that a lot of folks who are building AI models and different things in that space use, it's generally been very valuable for us to provide that because now all of the best developers across the industry are using tools that we're also using internally. So the tool chain is the same. So when they create some innovation, we can easily integrate it into the things that we're doing.  When we improve something, it improves other products, too. Because it's integrated with our technology stack, when there are opportunities to make integrations with products, it's much easier to make sure that developers and other folks are compatible with the things that we need and the way that our systems work. There are a lot of advantages, but I view this more as a kind of back-end infrastructure advantage with potential integrations on the product side, but one that should hopefully enable us to stay at the leading edge and integrate more broadly with the community and also make the way we run all this infrastructure more efficient over time. There are a number of models. I just gave PyTorch as an example, Open Compute is another model that has worked really well for us in this way, both to incorporate both innovation and scale efficiency into our own infrastructure. So there's -- our incentives, I think, are basically aligned towards moving in this direction.  Now that said, there's a lot to figure out, right? So I mean you asked if there are going to be other opportunities. I hope so. I can't speak to what all those things might be now. This is all quite early in getting developed. The better we do with the foundational work, the more opportunities, I think, that will come and present themselves. So I think that, that's all stuff that we need to figure out. But at least, at the base level, I think we're generally incentivized to move in this direction. And we also need to figure out how to go in that direction over time. I mean I mentioned LLaMA before. And I also want to be clear that while I'm talking about helping contribute to an open ecosystem, LLaMA is a model that we only really made available to researchers. And there's a lot of really good stuff that's happening there, but a lot of the work that we're doing, I think we would aspire to and hope to make even more open than that. So we'll need to figure out a way to do that."

So we certainly aren't quantifying the kind of the expected engagement growth, but we're very pleased with what we've seen Reels drive in terms of incremental engagement to the platform so far.  And we've talked about how the incrementality has grown over time, and that's important as we've continued to improve ranking because we're very focused not only on the absolute growth of Reels, but on increasing the incremental engagement, and that's something where we're very pleased with the trends that we've been seeing. As it comes to the plays, watch time, re-shares reactions, all of the metrics that we keep an eye on, we're seeing meaningful growth in Reels. It's clear that people value short-form video and recommendations. It's also unlocking an entirely new content pool, which we think creates an engagement opportunity as we help people discover more interesting posts. And then that's really valuable on top of the social graph, and we're seeing the sharing flywheel take off with the growth of Reels reshares which has doubled over the last 6 months. And then more broadly in terms of how the discovery engine is driving incremental engagement across the platform. Our in-feed recommendations certainly go well beyond Reels. They cover all types of content, including text, images, links, group content, et cetera. And on Facebook, we see that AI-driven recommendations are continuing to grow and contribute to increasing engagement on the app. So again, we're not quantifying this, but it's a place where I think we are both pleased with our progress and see significant opportunity for us to do better."

The first is, Susan, I appreciate the confidence about Reels monetization going forward. But can you share a bit what's giving you the confidence that it goes from a headwind to a neutral to a tailwind down the line? Anything you can share on data points about ROAS or adoption? And then just quickly, all the updates on Messenger are really -- were great to hear. Do you think the adoption is also being driven by maybe loss of Signal? And how does messaging improve marketers' ability to basically retarget post-IDFA? So anything on Signal loss and how messaging helped you marketers regain that? Thanks."
META,2023-04-26,2023-04-27,,2023-04-26,2023-04-26T19:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-26,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Michael. So on Reels, we have shared for, I think, a while now that we're working through -- we're working down the headwind to revenue from the growth of Reels cannibalizing some time that is spent on our more mature ad surfaces, Feed and Stories. And basically, we have been balancing the two factors here, which is the degree to which Reels is driving incremental engagement on the platform versus the lower monetization efficiency of Reels relative to the Feed and Stories engagement that it cannibalizes.  And ultimately, the overall economics of Reels is really going to be determined by the combination of those two things. The thing that I would -- so while we're -- we're on track to Reels becoming neutral to revenue by end of year or early next year. But I do think it's important to call out that Reels is structurally different from Feed and Stories.  And so we don't have line of sight of getting Reels to monetization parity per time with Feed or Stories anytime soon because of those structural differences. But because it drives incremental engagement, we expected we will continue -- and we expect we will continue to improve its monetization from current levels. So we expect the combination of those things will get us to revenue neutral by end of this year or early next, and positive to revenue beyond that despite that it doesn't monetize as efficiently. The second part of your question was updates on messaging and how does messaging improve marketer ability to retarget and face a signal loss. So click-to-messaging ads are a really important part of our overall ad strategy in terms of on-site objectives. And so it is a big part of the sort of first-party data playbook. And so I think from that perspective, it really has -- is both sort of a first-party data ads format, which I think in a signal-challenged landscape is important for us. And then, of course, it's a way for us to both monetize messaging behavior that's happening on our platform and create robust avenues of communication for businesses directly with their consumers which we hope to broaden with broader business messaging offerings over time. So we're very excited. We're really excited with the progress that click-to-messaging ads have shown and the business opportunity that we have going forward there."

We're seeing strong engagement trends across our apps. There are now more than 3.8 billion people who use at least one of our apps every month. Facebook now has more than 3 billion monthly actives with daily actives continuing to grow around the world, including in the US and Canada. In addition to our core products performing well, I think we have the most exciting roadmap ahead that I've seen in a while. We've got continued progress on Threads, Reels, Llama 2 and some groundbreaking AI products in the pipeline, as well as the Quest 3 launch coming up this fall. We're heads-down executing on all this right now and it's really good to see the decisions and investments we've made start to play-out. On Threads briefly, I'm quite optimistic about our trajectory here. We saw unprecedented growth out-of-the-gate. And more importantly, we're seeing more people coming back daily than I'd expected. And now we're focused on retention and improving the basics. And then after that, we'll focus on growing the community to the scale that we think is going to be possible. Only after that we are going to focus on monetization. We've run this playbook many times before with Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Stories, Reels and more. And this is as good of a start as we could have hoped for. So I'm really happy with the path that we're on here. One note I want to mention about the Thread launch related to our year of efficiency is that, the product was built by a relatively small team on a tight timeline. We've already seen a number of examples of how our leaner organization and some of the cultural changes that we've made can build higher-quality products faster and this is probably the biggest example so far. The year of efficiency was always about two different goals, becoming an even stronger technology company and improving our financial results, so we can invest aggressively in our ambitious long-term roadmap. Now that we've gotten through the major layoffs, the rest of 2023 will be about creating stability for employees, removing barriers that slow us down, introducing new AI-powered tools to speed us up and so on. Over the next few months, we're going to start planning for 2024 and I'm going to be focused on continuing to run the company as lean as possible for these cultural reasons, even though our financial results have improved. I expect that we're still going to hire in key areas, but newly budgeted headcount growth is going to be relatively low. Now that said, as part of this year's layoffs, many teams chose to let people go in order to hire different people with different skills that they need. So, much of that hiring is going to spill into 2024. The other major budget point that we're working through is what the right level of AI CapEx is to support our roadmap. Since we don't know how quickly our new AI products will grow, we may not have a clear handle on this until later in the year. Now moving on to our product roadmap, I've said on a number of these calls that the two technological waves that we're riding are AI in the near-term and the Metaverse over the longer-term. Investments that we've made over the years in AI, including the billions of dollars we've spent on AI infrastructure are clearly paying-off across our ranking and recommendation systems and improving engagement and monetization. AI recommended content from accounts you don't follow is now the fastest-growing category of content on Facebook's feed. Now, since introducing these recommendations, they've driven a 7% increase in overall time spent on the platform. This improves the experience because you can now discover things that you might not have otherwise followed or come across. Reels is a key part of this discovery engine and Reels plays exceed 200 billion per day across Facebook and Instagram. We're seeing good progress on Reels monetization as well with the annual revenue run-rate across our apps now exceeding $10 billion, up from $3 billion last fall. Beyond Reels, AI is driving results across our monetization tools, through our automated ads products, which we call Meta Advantage. Almost all our advertisers are using at least one of our AI driven products. We've also deployed Meta Lattice, a new model architecture that learns to predict an ads performance across a variety of datasets and optimization goals. And we introduced AI Sandbox, a testing playground for generative AI powered tools like automatic text variation, background generation and image outcropping. Business messaging is another key piece of our monetization strategy and we recently announced that the 200 million users of our WhatsApp Business app will now be able to create Click-to-WhatsApp ads for Facebook and Instagram without needing a Facebook account. This is a pretty big unlock, particularly in countries where WhatsApp is often the first step to bring their business online. Paid messaging is a bit earlier, but it's also showing good adoption. The number of businesses using our paid messaging products has doubled year-over-year. While we're on messaging, I mentioned that we started rolling out channels on WhatsApp last month. It's a simple, reliable and private way to receive important updates from people and organizations. And I'm quite excited for more people to try it as we bring the product to more countries through the rest of this year. Beyond the recommendations and ranking systems across our products, we're also building leading foundation models to support a new generation of AI products. We partnered with Microsoft to open-source Llama-2, the latest version of our large language model and to make it available for both research and commercial use. We have a long history of open-sourcing our infrastructure and AI work from PyTorch, which is the leading machine-learning framework to models like segment anything, image bind and DINO to basic infrastructure as part of the open compute project. And we found that open-sourcing our work allows the industry, including us, to benefit from innovations that come from everywhere. And these are often improvements in safety and security since open-source software is more scrutinized and more people can find and identify fixes for issues. The improvements also often come in the form of efficiency gains, which should hopefully allow us and others to run these models with less infrastructure investment going forward. So I'm really looking forward to seeing the improvements that the community makes to Llama-2. We are also building a number of new products ourselves using Llama that will work across our services. I'm going to share more details on that later this year, but you can imagine lots of ways that AI can help people connect and express themselves in our apps, creative tools that make it easier and more fun to share content, agents that act as assistance, coaches or that can help you interact with businesses and creators and more. And these new products will improve everything that we do across both mobile apps and the Metaverse, helping people create worlds and the avatars and objects that inhabit them as well. Our investments in AI continue. We remain fully committed to the Metaverse vision as well. We've been working on both of these two major priorities for many years in parallel now. And in many ways, the two areas are overlapping and complementary. The next big thing on the Reality Labs side is the launch of our Quest 3 mixed reality headset at Connect. It's our most powerful headset yet with better displays and resolution and next-gen Qualcomm chipset with twice the graphics performance. It will also have the best immersive content library out there and it's 40% thinner than Quest 2. Its mixed reality seamlessly blends your physical world and the virtual one by intelligently understanding the physical space around you. We pioneered mixed reality with our Quest Pro headset and Quest 3 takes that to the next level. Now others in the industry are, of course, working on bringing mixed reality to the market too, but Quest 3 is going to be the first mainstream accessible device that we expect many millions of people will get to experience this technology with. The Metaverse content and software vision continues coming together as well. We recently announced that Roblox is coming to Quest with an open beta on App Lab. For Horizon, the team is focused on retention right now and we're making good progress on that. We made big improvements on avatars as well and that's going to be a bridge between our mobile apps and our VR and mixed reality experiences. We have a lot more to share on both our Metaverse and AI work coming up at our Connect conference, which we're going to be hosting in Hacker Square at our headquarters on September 27. It's going to be a good one, so I hope you'll tune in. Alright, to wrap up, I just wanted to say that I'm really proud of our teams for everything that we've accomplished so far this year. It's been a tough year in a lot of ways, but it's also been an impactful one. I'm quite optimistic about the road ahead and I'm grateful to all of you for being on this journey with us. And now, I'm going to hand it over to Susan."
META,2023-07-26,2023-07-27,,2023-07-26,2023-07-26T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-07-26,prepared,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $32 billion, up 11% or 12% on a constant currency basis. Q2 total expenses were $22.6 billion, up 10% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 15%, driven primarily by infrastructure related costs. R&D increased 8%, driven mainly by headcount-related costs from our Reality Labs and Family of Apps segments, as well as restructuring costs. Marketing and sales decreased 12%, due mostly to lower marketing spend and payroll-related costs. And G&A increased 39%, due primarily to an increase in legal accruals, which was partially offset by lower payroll-related costs. We ended the second quarter with over 71,400 employees, down 7% from the first quarter. Our second quarter headcount still included roughly half of the approximately 10,000 employees impacted by the 2023 layoffs. We expect that our third quarter headcount will no longer include the vast majority of impacted employees. Second quarter operating income was $9.4 billion, representing a 29% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 16%. This is lower than our previous full-year outlook as our higher share price provided a higher tax deduction and lowered our taxes. Net income was $7.8 billion or $2.98 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases were $6.4 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers and network infrastructure. Free-cash flow was $11 billion, significantly benefiting from a deferral of income taxes that we expect will be paid in the fourth quarter. We repurchased $793 million of our Class-A common stock in the second-quarter and ended the quarter with $53.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow. We estimate that approximately 3.07 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in June and that approximately 3.88 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. Facebook continues to grow globally and engagement remains strong. For the first time, we crossed 3 billion monthly active users with Facebook MAU ending at 3.03 billion in June, up 3% or 96 million compared to last year. Facebook's daily active users were 2.06 billion, up 5% or 96 million. DAUs represented approximately 68% of MAUs. Q2 total Family of Apps revenue was $31.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Q2 Family of Apps ad revenue was $31.5 billion, up 12% or 13% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by entertainment and media and CPG. Online commerce benefited from strong span among advertisers in China, reaching customers in other markets. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World at 16%, followed by Europe, North-America and Asia-Pacific at 14%, 11% and 10%, respectively. Foreign currency was a headwind to advertising revenue growth in all international regions. In Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 34% and the average price per ad decreased 16%. Impression growth was primarily driven by Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The year-over-year decline in pricing was driven by strong impression growth, especially from lower monetizing surfaces and regions. While overall pricing remains under pressure from these factors, we believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers. Family of Apps other revenue was $225 million in Q2, up 3% as strong business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp business platform was partially offset by a decline in other line items. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q2, Family of Apps expenses were $18.6 billion, representing approximately 82% of our overall expenses. FoA expenses were up 8% due primarily to legal-related expenses and restructuring charges, partially offset by a decrease in non-headcount related operating expenses, including marketing. Family of Apps operating income was $13.1 billion, representing a 41% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q2 revenue was $276 million, down 39% due to lower Quest 2 sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4 billion, up 23% due to lapping a reduction in Reality Labs loss reserves in Q2 of last year, as well as growth in employee-related costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $3.7 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance; our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community; and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, overall engagement within Facebook and Instagram remained strong. Reels continues to grow and drive incremental engagement. On Facebook feed, in particular, recommended content from accounts you don't follow has increased significantly over the past year, while also becoming more incremental to engagement, demonstrating that people are getting added-value from discovering content from unconnected accounts. Looking-forward, we are optimistic about our ability to increase that value even further by leveraging advanced AI techniques to improve recommendations. In addition to improving the value people get within our Family of Apps today, we're also investing in entirely new experiences for the future. We're standing up infrastructure to support new AI-powered products across our services, which will give people more tools to express themselves and connect. And we've been pleased with the initial reception of our new standalone app Threads since its launch earlier this month. Our focus now is on further developing this into a product that will be valuable for a large set of people over-time. Moving to the other driver of revenue, improving monetization. Here, we're focused on improving monetization efficiency of products that monetize at lower rates today like Reels and our messaging services and more broadly, driving measurable performance and returns for our advertisers. On Reels, we are making good progress on monetization with more than three quarters of our advertisers now using Reels ads. We remain focused on further reducing the Reels revenue headwind and narrowing the monetization efficiency gap with our more mature surfaces. However, we continue to expect time on Reels will monetize at a lower rate than Stories and Feed for the foreseeable future since people scroll more slowly through video content. Within messaging, billions of people and millions of businesses use our messaging services every day to connect. We see a significant opportunity to build tools and functionality for businesses to help facilitate those interactions and are seeing early but promising progress with WhatsApp's paid messaging solution today. In terms of our work to drive measurable performance for advertisers, it's concentrated in two primary areas, AI and onsite conversions. We're leveraging AI to move our systems towards using fewer larger models that enable us to leverage learnings across product surfaces and deploy improvements more quickly, broadly and efficiently. We're also leveraging AI to power advanced ads products like Advantage+ shopping, which continues to gain adoption. We're seeing this work translate into results for advertisers as conversion growth remained strong in Q2. In terms of driving on-site conversions, we continue to see strong results with click-to-messaging ads and are well positioned given our suite of messaging applications. Daily click-to-WhatsApp ads revenue continues to grow very quickly at over 80% year-over-year. We also recently started testing the ability to buy click-to-WhatsApp ads directly from the WhatsApp Business app, which now has more than 200 million monthly users. Looking ahead, we're focused on enabling businesses to optimize for conversions further down the funnel in our messaging applications. We're also investing in scaling other onsite objectives like lead generation and shops ads. Before turning to our revenue outlook, I'd also like to talk about our investment philosophy. We expect to bring the discipline and habits that we built during this year of efficiency with us as we plan for the future. At the same time, we remain focused on investing in the significant opportunities ahead. Part of supporting these initiatives will come from prioritizing them against other areas of work and shifting resources. However, in some cases, they will require incremental investment. This is particularly true in the areas we see the most significant opportunity, which include AI and the Metaverse. As I mentioned last quarter, we also remain focused on modestly evolving our capital structure over time. We were pleased to execute our second bond offering in May and expect a measured pace of future debt raises as we work toward improving our overall cost-of-capital, while maintaining a positive or neutral net cash balance. In addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape. With respect to EU-US data transfers, we saw a positive development with the European Commission's adoption of a final adequacy decision, which allows us to continue to provide our services in Europe. This is good news. Though broadly speaking, we continue to see increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect third quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $32 billion to $34.5 billion. Our guidance assumes a foreign currency tailwind of approximately 3% to year-over-year total revenue growth in the third quarter based on current exchange rates. Turning now to the expense outlook. We anticipate that our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $88 billion to $91 billion, increased from our prior range of $86 billion to $90 billion due to legal-related expenses recorded in Q2. This outlook includes approximately $4 billion of restructuring costs related to facilities consolidation charges and severance and other personnel costs. We expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023. While we are not providing a quantitative outlook beyond 2023 at this point, we expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024 as we continue to invest in our most compelling opportunities, including AI and the Metaverse. First, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs next year. Given our increased capital investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint. Second, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we evolve our workforce composition toward higher cost technical roles. Finally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in AR, VR, and our investments to further scale our ecosystem. Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $27 billion to $30 billion, lowered from our prior estimate of $30 billion to $33 billion. The reduced forecast is due to both cost-savings, particularly on non-AI servers, as well as shifts in CapEx into 2024 from delays in projects and equipment deliveries, rather than a reduction in overall investment plans. Looking ahead, while we continue to refine our plans as we progressed throughout the year, we currently expect total capital expenditures to grow in 2024, driven by our investments across both datacenters and servers, particularly in support of our AI work. On to tax, absent any changes to US tax law, we expect the tax rate for the rest of the year to be similar to Q2 2023. In closing, Q2 was a good quarter for our business. We're executing well across our core priorities and are continuing to make progress on delivering exciting new experiences for our community. With that, Dave, let's open up the call for questions."

META,2023-07-26,2023-07-27,,2023-07-26,2023-07-26T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-07-26,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Sure. So, I think the main thing that I'll say on this for now is, tune into Connect coming up in September, we're going to have a lot more to talk about on the road-map and products that we're launching. We wanted to get the Llama 2 model out now. That's going to be -- that's going to underpin a lot of the new things that we're building and now we're nailing down a bunch of these additional products and this is going to be stuff that we're working on for years, but I think a lot of the journey will kind of start later this year when we start rolling out some of these things. But overall, I think there are three basic categories of our products or technologies that we're planning on building with generative AI. One, our -- around different kinds of agents, which I'll talk about in a second. Two, were just kind of generative AI-powered features. So some of the canonical examples of that are things like in advertising, helping advertisers basically run ads without needing to supply as much creative or, let's say, if they have an image, but it doesn't fit the format, be able to fill-in the image for them. So I talked about that a little bit upfront in my comments, but there's stuff like that across every app. And then the third category of things, I'd say we're broadly focused on productivity and efficiency internally. It's everything from helping engineers write code faster to helping people internally understand the overall knowledge base at the company and things like that. So there's a lot to do on each of those zones. For AI agent specifically, I guess what I'd say is one of the things that's different about how we think about this compared to some others in the industry is, we don't think that there's going to be one single AI that people interact with, just because there are all these different entities on a day-to-day basis that people come across, whether they're different creators or different businesses or different apps or things that you use. So, I think there are going to be a handful of things that are just sort of focused on helping people connect around expression and creativity and facilitating connections. I think there are going to be a handful of experiences around helping people connect with the creators who they care about and helping creators foster their communities. And then the one that I think is going to have the fastest direct business loop is going to be around helping people interact with businesses. I mean, you can imagine a world on this where over time every business has an AI agent that basically people can message and interact with them. And it's going to take some time to get there, right. I mean, this is going be a long road to build that out. But I think that's going to improve a lot of the interactions that people have with businesses as well as if that does work, it should alleviate one of the biggest issues that we're currently having around messaging monetization is that in order to -- for a person to interact with the business, it's quite human labor intensive for a person to be on the other side of that interaction, which is one of the reasons why we've seen this take-off in some countries where the cost of labor is relatively low. But you can imagine in a world where every business has an AI agent that we can see the kind of success that we're seeing in Thailand or Vietnam with business messaging could kind of spread everywhere and I think that's quite exciting. But overall, I think, we're going to follow a playbook that's similar to what we normally do on products. In terms of how quickly some of these new products scale, that's one of the big unknowns for the business and one of the things that we're debating heavily when thinking through the amount of AI CapEx to bring online. Because the reality is, we just don't know how quickly these will scale and we want to have the capacity in place in case they scale very quickly, but because they're kind of brand new things and there aren't that many precedents for things like this, it's actually quite hard to forecast. So I don't know Susan, if there's anything on that last point that you want to jump-in on. But I think that's probably all I'll say on this for now. But I'm really excited about the segment. This is just going to be -- it fits into all the different products that we're building really well. I think this is going to both complement and touch and transform every single thing that we're doing and I'm really excited for it, so tune in to Connect."

Mark, just following up on Brian's question, I did want to ask just to draw that out a little bit more, how you think about the extensions of the developer community sort of growing up around a platform like Llama 2? And we were intrigued by the Microsoft announcement. You traditionally have been more of a consumer facing company with product. Could this provide you an avenue to be more of an enterprise facing company over the long-term? And is there a strategy there maybe we haven't seen from you in the past? I'd love to flush that out a little bit. And Susan just one for you, the VRL losses just continue to build and I think we continue to struggle a little bit of what the drivers of those losses are and how should we think about some of the components driving the losses versus elements of earning a return on those losses over the medium-to-long term as Mark sort of frame the timeframe around Metaverse. So any color there about sort of rate of change or components of the losses in VRL I think would be super helpful. Thanks so much to you both."
META,2023-07-26,2023-07-27,,2023-07-26,2023-07-26T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-07-26,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes, sure. I'll take a cut at both of those and Susan can jump into the second one, if there's any -- if there's anything that she wants to add there as well. All right. So Llama is an open-source project, which is a little bit different from building out a developer platform, although there will be an ecosystem around this. What we've seen around open-source work that we've done, which we've done a lot of in our core infrastructure work, design of servers and datacenters and basic infrastructure as well as in AI. And I pointed out some of these in my remarks upfront, like PyTorch and just a bunch of other models that we've released recently. One of the things that we've seen is that, when you release these projects publicly in open-source, there tend to be a few categories of innovations that the community makes. So, on the one hand, it's -- I think it's just good to get the community standardized on the work that we're doing that helps with recruiting, because a lot of the best people want to come and work at a place that is building the things that everyone else uses, makes it that people are used to these tools from wherever else they're working. They can come here and built here. But in terms of improvements that we expect to see from the community, there were really a few different types. One is specifically around safety and security. It's -- that's a very important issue in AI. In open-source software overall, we've just seen through the history here that open-source software gets scrutinized more and therefore ends up being more secure and safer. And we think that there's a very good chance and that's the likely outcome here. And whatever improvements that people make to harden it in the community, we will be able to roll that in to our work, both for the first-party products that we will launch, as well as making it easy to propagate that across the industry and make the AI that everyone uses safer. I would also hope to see efficiency improvements. I mean, even from the initial Llama that was just released as a research project, some of the improvements were around things like quantization and being able to run the model way more efficiently. Now, we're spending so much on AI CapEx that all the help that we can get from the community to make the stuff more efficient to run will be helpful, not just for individuals to be able to run powerful models on their laptop or locally or without a huge amount of compute, so individuals can afford it, but that should hopefully translate over-time into just a more efficient infrastructure for us, which hopefully could be quite a big savings. So that's more of what we're seeing there. We partnered with Microsoft specifically because we don't have a public-cloud offering. So this isn't about us getting into that, it's actually the opposite. We want to work with them because they have that and others have that and that was the thing that we aren't planning on building out. But one of the things that you might have noticed is, in addition to making this open through the open-source license, we did include a term that for the largest companies, specifically ones that are going to have public-cloud offerings that -- they don't just get a free license to use this, they’ll need to come and make a business arrangement with us. And our intent there is, we want everyone to be using that. We want this to be open. But if you're someone like Microsoft or Amazon or Google and you're going to basically be reselling their services, that's something that we think we should get some portion of the revenue for. So those are the deals that we intend to be making and we've started doing out a little bit. I don't think that that's going to be a large amount of revenue in the near-term, but over the long term hopefully that can be something. Not sure if there's anything else to add-on that, but Susan, you can jump-in if you want. On RL, let me just jump over to that for a second. I don't think we're going to break-out numbers right now, but I'll defer to Susan on that. I mean, one big thing for the next year is that the launch of [Quest 3] (ph), right. And basically, this is going to be the biggest headset that we've released since 2020 when we came out with Quest 2. And there's just a lot of expenses related to bringing that to market and I think that's at least in the near-term going to be one of the major drivers of this. So I think that's probably the main thing that I would point to there. We're continuing to -- continue to think, looking at the VR work that we're doing and the AR work, some of the neural interfaces work. I think we're leading in these areas. It's been good to see what others in the industry have done, because to some degree, it gives us more confidence that we're on the right track. And even though, I know from an investor standpoint, most people aren't investing on quite as long of a time horizon as we are here, so I kind of get that. A lot of investors might want to -- might want to see us spending less here in the near term. My view is that, we are leading in these areas. I believe that they're going to be big over time. We're -- I think we've shown that we can deliver good business results in the near-term while investing ambitiously in the long-term. So I'm planning on continuing to do that. And I do continue to believe that over-time we will be happy that we did that. So, I don't know Susan if there's anything you want to add there."
META,2023-07-26,2023-07-27,,2023-07-26,2023-07-26T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-07-26,qa,,Susan Li,"Sure, let me just add a couple of things. Very quickly on the first question, I just want to clarify that we don't expect that Llama is going to result in a separate topline enterprise revenue lines, so just making sure we're totally clear. On the second question about the growth in Reality Labs operating losses in 2024. Mark alluded to the fact that this is an ambitious long-term horizon multifaceted roadmap. There are lots of components to the Reality Labs portfolio across VR, AR, Metaverse, social platforms, neural interfaces. And we really have a long-term time horizon for evaluating the return on our investments here. So in the near-term, we're focused on growing adoption of the existing products and we're constantly learning more about demand and use cases that inform our future plans. But lot of the investment that's driving the growth here is around conducting the fundamental R&D to solve hard technology problems that are going to enable our vision here. A lot of is around clearing technical hurdles that will make subsequent devices smaller, cost less, weigh less, et cetera. So that's really on the Reality Labs side. Again, as we said, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year in 2024. In 2024 specifically, I think that will be driven by a combination of both headcount-related and operating costs. But again, our ambitions in Reality Labs haven't changed and it continues to be a significant long-term opportunity for us."

Mark, things move quickly, like a month ago, we weren't talking about Reels, a quarter ago we were talking about Llama, start of the year we were barely talking about AI. If you think back to kind of just how you are prioritizing your time at the start of the year and kind of where you are today and how that kind of changed? Would love to just get some color on kind of the changing priorities and really where you're spending your time. And then the second question, really impressive, obviously, acceleration in growth in kind of the core ad business. I would love to just get some color kind of be on the vertical contribution, what are you seeing in terms of kind of adoption of Advantage+ products really driving some of that improved growth, especially what we've seen relative to the rest of the sector? Thank you."
META,2023-07-26,2023-07-27,,2023-07-26,2023-07-26T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-07-26,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes, I can start with the first and then Susan can take the second. I actually think our priorities have been pretty consistent for a few years now. I think the way that people hear that might be different. But, for example, last year, I think we were getting quite a bit of critique for the volume of AI CapEx spending that we were doing and now, obviously, people want to understand where that's going and where we think that trajectory is going and want to make it as efficient as possible. But I think at this point, it's more well-understood that that -- I think that was a good investment and it's driving results in the near term and enabling us to build some of the new experiences that I think we all think are pretty fundamental. I don't think Reels is new, although maybe even Threads when you said that. Threads, I would say, it's not that -- Thread is like -- it's not a massive project. It was -- I thought for a while that the opportunity around public conversations and kind of a text-based product was bigger than what had been executed yet in the markets, so we had a relatively small team work on that. And this year, I think there have been two things that have been -- that have just vastly exceeded my expectations, one was Llama. The initial model we thought it was interesting, but the scale of adoption, even just for the research version really spurred us to go do Llama 2 and that was vastly more than we expected. And the second is, Threads has been dramatically more than we expected in terms of the adoption and the rate of that. We thought this was going to be kind of a project that we just -- we had a small team working on for a while, but it really kind of blew up and created a big opportunity immediately. But no, I mean, I think over-time you should expect that we're going to focus on AI and the Metaverse. AI includes both all of the ranking and recommendation systems that power the core apps, so all the content that you're seeing in Facebook and Instagram, all the ads content that you're seeing, it also underpins all the safety systems that we build and increasingly it's all the generative AI stuff. So, all the agents, all the generative features that we're going to be rolling out and a lot of the other work that's going under license, the efficiency stuff that we're doing internally. And then the Metaverse stuff I think we've talked about for a while. So I don't think there's much change there except that it's sort of signals that we're getting from the market are it certainly not getting adopted a lot faster than we expected. That's sort of the somewhat sobering signal, but on the other side, I think a lot of companies that otherwise are doing, we respect and do great work. We don't necessarily view is building things that are ahead of where we are, which gives us confidence that we think the long-term thesis still will hold there. We think that we're going to be the leaders in it and nothing that we're seeing from the market makes us rethink that in a fundamental way. So, I think we're going to continue focusing on AI in the Metaverse as the two big thrust of what we're doing and all the other things kind of fall out of that."
META,2023-07-26,2023-07-27,,2023-07-26,2023-07-26T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-07-26,qa,,Susan Li,"And Mark I will take the second question that you asked around the Q2 revenue acceleration. So, I think there were couple of parts. One was around the acceleration in the core ads business, the second was on the Advantage+ products. In terms of the Q2 revenue acceleration, I'd highlight there are few factors driving that. The first is, frankly we're lapping a weaker demand period, including the first full quarter of the war in Ukraine and the suspension of our services in Russia. Second, we saw increased supply and improvements to add performance including improved Reels monetization as we continue to work down the Reels revenue headwind. And third, there were lower FX headwinds for us in this quarter. So those were all three things that helps drive the revenue acceleration in Q2. In terms of the question about Advantage+ specifically, Advantage+ is one of multiple AI-powered ad products that we have right now in the market. With Advantage+ specifically, we're seeing strong adoption, in particular, success with the e-commerce and retail verticals and then we've seen good traction with other verticals like CPG, especially DTC brands and we're continuing to launch features to unlock use cases for advertisers and make it easier for them to adopt Advantage+ campaigns and measure their performance gains. So we've got a lot in the pipeline there that we're excited about. For both the Advantage+ shopping campaigns, specifically which were our first sort of foray into this area, but then the Advantage+ portfolio more broadly that basically enables us to take that same playbook of helping advertisers iterate and test very quickly and imply it to many different steps of the end-to-end ad-buying experience. So the feedback and results that we've seen from advertisers is good and we think it's a really promising area that we're continuing to invest in, but it's one of many ways that we're using AI to continue to sort of help make our ads systems and recommendations and ranking engines, more performance to deliver better measurement and results to advertisers."

I just want to follow-up on Reality Labs, passing $40 billion in losses and increasing annually next year.

Thank you."

The primary way that I think about this is that, we've been able to show that we can I think been quite successful at building large scale social experiences within the constraints of platforms that often our competitors are defining. I think we're going to be able to do even better work and there is a lot of things that I would like to see us build that we just can't because we're -- the ways that we're constrained by the competitors who build these platforms. And over-time, the main way that I think about this just from a product admission perspective is, we're here to build awesome experiences that help people connect. I think helping to shape the next platform is going to unlock that in a profound way for decades to come. And that's what I'm here to do and I think what a lot of people are here to do. So that's kind of the first principles as part of this. From a business perspective, I think there is going to end up being a large business component of this that is Reality Labs specific, directly the products that we're building there and having that be a good business. But I also think that a lot of this is going to be that it unlocks a lot of value for the other experiences, the current apps that we have, when you think of as the Family of Apps where we -- currently just a lot of the potential value, whether it's just engagement that could be created, features that we would love to build that we're not allowed to because Apple or others just don't allow us to build those things. And I think that that's really unfortunate for the industry. I think that there's a lot of lost engagement that would have happened, a lot of the monetization value that gets created. I mean, just look at what happened with our tracking transparency, the massive value destruction for small businesses because of the rules that were set by another platform. And that's not -- that's not -- in a future version of the world, it's not -- that would be recognized not by device sales or some new like experience that we're building in Reality Labs. You'd basically see that accrue through more efficient monetization of the apps and experiences that we're building in other places. So, I think it's going to be both. But I think this is just a very fundamental thing, this is a very long-term bet. I at a deep level, I understand the discomfort that a lot of investors have with it because it's just outside of the model of, I think, even most long-term investors, how you would think about this. And look, I mean I can’t guarantee you that I'm going to be right about this bet. I do think that this is the direction that the world is going in. There are 1 billion or 2 billion people who have glasses today. I think in the future they're all going to be smart glasses. And like -- and the time that we spend on TVs and computers, I think that's going to get more immersive and looks something more like VR in the future. And I think that what we're seeing is richer ways for people to communicate across even the mobile apps that we have going from text, to photos to videos just continual trend towards being more immersive. So, like all of these trends line-up to make me think that this is the right thing, I think, we're going to be happy that we did this. So that's kind of how I think about it, both from kind of a mission and product perspective, a business perspective and investment timeframe perspective. But I also understand the discomfort that some folks have with something that I can't put exact numbers on a near-term time horizon around."

I mean, I'm -- on the one-hand, we've tried a bunch of standalone experiences over-time. And in general, we haven't had a lot of success with building kind of standalone apps. The biggest exception to that of course is Messenger, but that started-off its functionality inside Facebook and was spun out. So pardon me wonders if this is just a kind of classic venture capital portfolio question where you try a bunch of things and a bunch of them don't work. And then every once in a while, one hits and is a much bigger success. It could be that or it could just be that this is such an idiosyncratic case because of all the factors that are happening around Twitter or X, I guess, it's called now. So it's hard to say. I mean, but I think when something works or doesn't you can often point to the reason why you did or didn't and there I think is an interesting intellectual question of whether you could have known that our priority, but that was actually going to be the case. But -- so I'm not sure, but also rather than trying to kind of analyze that, I'd say we have a lot of work to do to really make Threats to reach its full potential, that's not a foregone conclusion yet, even though I think we're off to a great start and I'm optimistic that over-time this could be a fifth-grade app in the Family of Apps, but we've a lot of -- we've lot of basic work to do. And we have a basic playbook here, which is build an experience, it's got to be something that people like, [indiscernible] product market fit. Once you get that, it's not always retentive, so a lot of people might like an experience, but you need to kind of tune it, that way the numbers works that people who use it are continuing. We feel like we're getting to a good place on that with Threads. There's still lot of basic functionality to build. Once we feel like we're in a very good place on that, then I'm highly confident that we're going to able to pour enough gasoline on this to help it grow once we get to the point where we feel good that everyone who is using it and going to continue using it at a high-rate. And then few years, once we get to the point where it's at hundreds of millions of people, if assuming we can get there, then we'll worry about monetization. But, I mean, that's basically the playbook that I'm -- that we're focused on. And so, rather than thinking about right now, like what does this mean for other things like it that we can build. I'd say we're really just focused on taking this opportunity, which is an awesome one that we didn't expect to this -- the scale and making sure we make the most of this and execute it. But I do think it has been sort of these weird anomalies thing in the tech industry that there hasn't been an app for public discussions like this that has reached to billion people. When I look at all the different social experiences, it just seems like there should be one like this. I think there were a lot of reasons that you can point to why that might have not been the case historically, but it's awesome that we get a chance to work on this and I'm really optimistic about where we are. But it's going to be a long road ahead."

So I'll start with 2023. The reduced forecast that we gave for 2023, I mentioned on the call, is driven both by some cost savings, particularly on non-AI servers where we previously had some underutilized capacity and we've been identifying ways to be more efficient in the way that we allocate that capacity towards all of our various needs, as well as shifts in CapEx in 2024 that's coming from delays in data center projects and server deliveries and that'll just push that associated CapEx, which we were planning for in 2023 into 2024. We're still working on our 2024 CapEx plans. We haven't yet finalized that and we'll be working on that through the course of this year. But I mentioned that we expect that CapEx in 2024 will be higher than in 2023. We expect both data center spend to grow in 2024 as we ramp-up construction on sites with the new data center architecture that we announced late last year. And then we certainly also expect to invest more in servers in 2024 for both AI workloads to support all of the AI work that we've talked about across the core AI ranking recommendation work along with the next gen AI efforts. And then, of course, also our non-AI workloads as we refresh some of our servers and add capacity just to support continued growth across the site."

Mark, you touched on this little earlier, but there is this open-source versus close- source debate going on with Meta as one of the companies on one-side of it with Llama and Llama 2 how do you see this market evolving over-time. Do you see one approach has been potentially superior to the other and therefore you will be likely to garner greater adoption, or is this really a win-win situation, just considering how early we are in this process and how large the potential [indiscernible]. And then, Susan, your guidance for Q3 implies at the midpoint of that at 20% growth, which is a pretty steep acceleration from Q2 of 11% or 12%, could you maybe just help us understand the drivers of that acceleration? And as we look into Q4, the comp remain pretty easy, is that sustainable into year-end. Thank you."
META,2023-07-26,2023-07-27,,2023-07-26,2023-07-26T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-07-26,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes, I can speak briefly to the first one. I do think that there will continue to be both open and closed AI models. And there were a bunch of reasons for this. There obviously a lot of companies that their business model is to build a model and then sell access to it. So for them, making it open would undermine their business model. That is not our business model, we want to have to -- we view the model that we're building, sort of the foundation for building products. So by sharing it we can improve the quality of the model and improve the quality of the team that we have that is working on that. That’s a win for our business of basically building better products. So, I think you'll see both of those models. There are also some important safety questions that, I think, we will need to continue thinking about over-time. There are a number of people who are out there saying that once the AI models get past a certain level of capability it can become dangerous for them to become just in the hands of everyone openly. I think what I think is pretty clear that, we're not at that point today. I think that there is consensus generally among people who are working on this in the industry and policy folks that were not at that point today and it's not exactly clear at what point you reach that. So I think there are people who were kind of making that argument in good faith, who are actually concerned about the safety risks. So I think that there are probably some businesses that are out there making that argument, because they want it to be more close, because that's their business, so I think we need to be wary of that. But I think for both of those reasons, the business reasons and the safety reasons. I think there will be continued to be a mix of opened and closed models, and it's not just going to be like one thing is whatever end-users. I think different businesses will use different things for different reasons. And by open sourcing Llama now we're not -- on the second question around safety. We intentionally did not go out there and say we're going to open-source every single thing in the future, because we do want to have the space to be able to look at how the safety landscape evolves and if we think that we do cross some kind of critical threshold in the future and may not be the right thing to open-source it in the future, but for our business model, at least, since we're not selling access to the stuff, it's a lot easier for us to share this with the community because it just makes our products better and other people's and that I think it's a really healthy dynamic for the industry."
META,2023-07-26,2023-07-27,,2023-07-26,2023-07-26T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-07-26,qa,,Susan Li,"And thank you, Youssef. For your second question, which I will take. You asked about our Q3 revenue outlook and maybe also what that implies looking forward into Q4. So, on the further acceleration that we've guided to in Q3. First of all, I'd just point out that Q3 2022 revenue declined 4.5% year-over-year. So we're really lapping a much weaker demand period a year-ago. And we've certainly seen demand this year stabilize. And so, it's really a much easier compare. We also are expecting that currency is going to flip to a three point tailwind from a one point headwind last quarter. And finally, as I've mentioned earlier on this call, we've been investing for a long time and I think executing really well across our core monetization work and continuing to grow engagement. And I think we're going to benefit from all of the investments that we've made in those historical and key priorities for us. In terms of what this means for Q4. We're not sharing a Q4 revenue outlook yet, there are obviously some tailwinds to year-over-year growth in Q4, again, the same point about a weaker compare applies and at current rates FX would be a larger tailwind in Q4 than we're expecting it to be in Q3. But we've had sizable fluctuations in advertiser demand over the last year. It's been a pretty volatile period. So, while we're seeing strong advertiser demand now and that's certainly informing our outlook, it's harder to predict as we look further forward. And there are a wide range of possible outcomes in Q4."

Just in that planning process, you keep alluding to for the 2024 CapEx outlook. I think lot of your commentary here implies that new product, it sounds like you're going to be really central to instructing that number. Just curious how dependent it also is based on just view the revenue growth in 2024 and the relationship there? Thanks."
META,2023-07-26,2023-07-27,,2023-07-26,2023-07-26T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-07-26,qa,,Susan Li,"Yes. Thank you, Brad. I can go-ahead and take that one. So our growth in AI investments is really the thing that is driving the growth in our 2024 CapEx outlook. And I think there are a couple of components to that. There is both the core AI work, which powers our ranking and recommendation systems, which underpins both a lot of our content ranking and engagement growth, as well as the monetization work and that's an area where we're able to measure the ROI of our investments there, and we feel-good about the ROI of those investments and we want to continue investing appropriately to drive revenue growth. At the same time, being mindful of our desire to over the long-term decreased capital intensity. There is also another component, which is the next-generation AI efforts that we've talked about around advanced research and Gen AI and that's a place where we're already standing of training clusters and inference capacity, but we don't know exactly what will need in 2024 since we don't have any at-scale deployments yet of consumer business facing features and the scale of the adoption of those products is ultimately going to inform how much capacity we need. We think these are both going to be compelling investment opportunities and some of the AI capacity is fungible. So if we don't need end-up needing some of the capacity for our Gen AI work will be able to allocate it to our core AI work supporting ads and engagement, but we're really still working on our 2024 plans, we will have a clearer and more quantitative outlook as those planned shape up. But we are mindful of our intention to reduce the capital intensity of these investments over time."

This was a good quarter for our community and our business. We estimate that there are now more than 3.9 billion people who use at least one of our apps every month. The big product news this quarter is that we just held our annual Connect conference and we discussed Quest 3, which is the first mainstream mixed reality device, and the next generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which are the first smart glasses with our Meta AI built in. There continues to be a ton of innovation in AI. And we used Connect to describe and start launching a lot of the new consumer AI experiences that we expect to become meaningful parts of all of our apps and our business over the coming years. We started rolling out Meta AI, our new assistant that you can access across all our messaging experiences and smart glasses to answer questions, get access to real-time information, and generate photorealistic images. We started launching our AI Studio platform that enables people to create and interact with lots of different AIs for help getting things done and just having fun. We rolled out Emu, our image creation model that produces high quality images and stickers fast. We launched an early alpha of business AIs so that eventually every business can have an AI to interface with customers to do sales and support. And we let out the plan to launch creator AIs next year, so every creator can have an AI their fans can engage with to help them build out their community. And that's just a snapshot of some of the AI work that we're doing. The experiences that we start rolling out at Connect are going to transform the way that people use all our services, feeds, messaging, hardware, advertising, business messaging, interacting with creators and more. But it's going to take time to tune all these experiences before hundreds of millions or billions of people are going to use them. And I expect that dialing in these products and the vision that we articulated at Connect is going to be our theme for much of the next year. And I think that it's going to be a very exciting 2024. As we are looking ahead and planning for next year, I want to share a few thoughts on what I'm expecting. I've been happy with our results this year so far, and we are planning to continue focusing on operating efficiently going forward, both because it creates a more disciplined and lean culture and also because it provides stability to see our long-term initiatives through in a very volatile world. Now, in terms of investment priorities, AI will be our biggest investment area in 2024, both in engineering and compute resources. But I want to avoid allocating a lot of new headcount. So we're going to continue deprioritizing a number of non-AI projects across the company to shift people towards working with AI instead. On the recruiting front, one dynamic that I want to flag is that we have a sizable hiring backlog right now since part of our layoffs earlier this year included teams swapping out certain skill sets for being able to hire others. And we're still going to be hiring those roles into 2024. So that means that even though we're going -- even though we're planning to grow headcount at a much slower rate going forward, the actual rate next year may temporarily be faster as we work through this hiring backlog. All right. Now, let's get into our product updates. Let's start with Reels, which continues to do very well. We estimate that with all the ranking and product improvements that we've made, Reels has now driven more than 40% increase in time spent on Instagram since launch. We also reached a monetization milestone earlier than expected. And we estimate that Reels is now net neutral to overall company ad revenue. In many ways, Reels has now graduated from being an early initiative to now being a core part of our apps. So going forward, and we're going to continue focusing on Reels, but we'll also look at growing it as part of our overall portfolio of video services, which make up more than half of the time that is spent on Facebook and Instagram. And There's a lot more to do across all of these. All right, AI. AI advances are driving a lot of our product and business performance. Generative AI will increasingly be important going forward. I outlined our product roadmap earlier. And on top of that, we're also building foundation models like Llama 2, which we believe is now the leading open source model with more than 30 million Llama downloads last month. Beyond that, there was also a different set of sophisticated recommendation AI systems that powers our feeds, Reels, ads, and integrity systems. And this technology has less hype right now than generative AI, but it is also very important in improving very quickly. AI-driven feed recommendations continue to grow their impact on incremental engagement. This year alone, we've seen a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram as a result of recommendation improvements. Our AI tools for advertisers are also driving results with Advantage+ shopping campaigns, reaching a $10 billion run rate and more than half of our advertisers using our Advantage+ creative tools to optimize images and text in their ads creative. Business messaging also continues to grow across our services and I believe will be the next major pillar of our business. There are more than 600 million conversations between people and businesses every day on our platforms. To give you a sense of what this could look like when it's scaled globally, every week now, more than 60% of people on WhatsApp in India message a business app account. A revenue from click to message ads in India has doubled year-over-year. Now I think that this is going to be a really big opportunity for new business AIs that I talked about earlier that we hope will enable any business to easily set up an AI that people can message to help with commerce and support. Today, most commerce and messaging is in countries where the cost of labor is low enough that it makes sense for businesses to have people corresponding with customers over text. And in those countries like Thailand or Vietnam, there's a huge amount of commerce that happens in this way. But in lots of parts of the world, the cost of labor is too expensive for this to be viable. But with business AIs, we have the opportunity to bring down that cost and expand commerce and messaging into larger economies across the world. So making business AIs work for more businesses is going to be an important focus for us into 2024. I want to give a quick update on Threads. We're three months in now, and I'm very happy with the trajectory. There are just under 100 million monthly actives at this point. And we're now getting to the point where we're going to be focusing on growing the community further. From what we can tell, people love it so far. I've thought for a long time that there should be a billion person public conversations app that is a bit more positive. And I think that if we keep at this for a few more years, then I think we have a good chance of achieving our vision there. Now finally, in addition to AI, our other major long-term focus is the metaverse. And we just launched Quest 3, our most powerful headset yet, at a very competitive price. We packed a lot of improvements in there, including a next generation chipset with 2x the graphics performance, our best display as yet, and a form factor that's 40% thinner than Quest 2. But the most important breakthrough for Quest 3 is that it's the first mainstream mixed reality device. And that means that when you put on the device, you see your physical room around you, and you can bring digital objects and games into your physical space, whether that's a ping pong table, your workstation, a big screen TV to play Xbox games on, or your friends as holograms. The early reviews have been great, and it's been fun to see how people respond to this. We also launched the next generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. They're upgraded from the first generation in basically every way. Better camera, clearer audio, they're lighter, they have more styles, and you can now even live stream video from them. But most importantly, these are the first smart glasses shipping with Meta AI built in. So you can ask your glasses questions throughout the day. It'll answer them right in your ear. And in many ways, glasses are the ideal form factor for an AI device because they enable your AI assistant to see what you see and hear what you hear. Again, it's good to see the early reviews, they're so positive, and I'm looking forward to this space evolving quickly over the coming years. We are also making progress on software for the metaverse too. Horizon is now growing faster. There's more new worlds like Super Rumble and Citadel come online. We also started testing Horizon for phones, tablets, and PCs, which is going to be an important part of how we build out the metaverse across devices. And we've had a couple of important milestones with avatars as well, both for our expressive avatars and the latest codec avatars that I showed off recently. Now, as I said at Connect, I think one of the most interesting questions for our industry over the coming decades is going to be how we bring together our physical and digital worlds into a coherent and good experience. I think we're starting to see some of the building blocks come together between mixed reality for bringing digital objects into the physical world, our AI studio work for enabling interactions with all kinds of different AIs, and eventually smart glasses to bring all this together into a stylish form factor. So I am very excited about the roadmap ahead. All right. That is my update for today. This was a good quarter. I'm pleased with our progress on efficiency this year. We're a leaner organization, shipping faster and advancing the state-of-the-art in all of our long-term initiatives. And while investing heavily for the future, we also just recorded our highest operating margin in two years. So I'm looking forward to carrying this product momentum and operating discipline forward. As always, thank you to everyone on our team and all of you who are on this journey with us. And now, here's Susan."
META,2023-10-25,2023-10-26,,2023-10-25,2023-10-25T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-25,prepared,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q3 total revenue was $34.1 billion, up 23% or 21% on a constant currency basis. Q3 total expenses were $20.4 billion, down 7% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 9%, as higher infrastructure-related costs were partially offset by lower content costs. R&D increased 1%, as higher headcount-related costs from Family of Apps and Reality Labs were partially offset by lower non-headcount related Reality Labs operating expenses. Marketing & Sales decreased 24%, due primarily to lower marketing spend and headcount-related costs. G&A decreased 39%, due primarily to lower legal-related expenses. We ended the quarter with over 66,100 employees, down 7% from the second quarter. Our third quarter headcount no longer included the substantial majority of the employees impacted by the previously announced layoffs. Third quarter operating income was $13.7 billion, representing a 40% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 17%. Net income was $11.6 billion or $4.39 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $6.8 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Capital expenditures were below the prior year levels primarily due to lower server and data center construction spend as we prepared to shift to our new data center design, as well as payment timing. Free cash flow was $13.6 billion, benefitting from a deferral of income taxes which was paid in the fourth quarter. We repurchased $3.7 billion of our Class A common stock in the third quarter and ended the quarter with $61.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt. Moving now to our segment results. I’ll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow. We estimate that approximately 3.14 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in September, and that approximately 3.96 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis. Facebook continues to grow globally and engagement remains strong. Facebook daily active users were 2.09 billion, up 5% or 101 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 68% of the 3.05 billion monthly active users in September. MAUs grew by 91 million or 3% compared to last year. Q3 Total Family of Apps revenue was $33.9 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Q3 Family of Apps ad revenue was $33.6 billion, up 24% or 21% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by CPG and gaming. Online commerce and gaming benefited from strong spend among advertisers in China reaching customers in other markets. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and Europe at 36% and 35%, respectively, followed by Asia Pacific at 19% and North America at 17%. Foreign currency was a tailwind to advertising revenue growth in all international regions. In Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 31% and the average price per ad decreased 6%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The year-over-year decline in pricing was driven by strong impression growth, especially from lower monetizing surfaces and regions. While overall pricing remains under pressure from these factors, we believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers. Family of Apps other revenue was $293 million in Q3, up 53%, driven by strong business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q3, Family of Apps expenses were $16.4 billion, representing approximately 81% of our overall expenses. FoA expenses were down 9% as growth in infrastructure-related costs was more than offset by lower legal-related expenses, marketing, and headcount-related costs. Family of Apps operating income was $17.5 billion, representing a 52% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q3 revenue was $210 million, down 26% due primarily to lower Quest 2 sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.0 billion, flat year-over-year as higher headcount-related expenses were offset by lower non-headcount related operating expenses. Reality Labs operating loss was $3.7 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance. Our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, overall engagement on Facebook and Instagram remains strong. Reels, and video content more broadly, continues to grow and drive incremental engagement. AI- recommended content from unconnected accounts in Feed continues to become increasingly incremental to engagement, including in the US & Canada. These gains are being driven by improvements to our recommendation systems and we see additional opportunities to advance our systems even further in the future as we deploy more advanced models. We’re also developing entirely new experiences for our community. Our investments in AI capacity in recent years have enabled us to support leading Generative AI research and we’re meaningfully accelerating the pace of bringing that research into our products. We launched our first consumer Gen AI experiences last month that are built on top of our foundation models and are excited to learn from how people use these tools to make them increasingly valuable over time. Aside from Generative AI, Threads also remains a compelling long-term opportunity and we’re excited to build on the strong product momentum we have going into next year. Turning to the second driver, improving monetization. Here, our focus is on continuing to drive marketing performance for businesses, including through business messaging. There are four areas of this work, improving Reels monetization; creating engaging on-platform ad experiences; making it easier for advertisers to connect their marketing data, and increasingly leveraging AI across our ads systems and products. On Reels, we have continued to improve monetization and are now at a level where Reels is neutral to overall revenue. We’ve made tremendous progress over the last year building and scaling Reels as a consumer product, and it has now become part of the core experience on Instagram and Facebook. As such, we don’t anticipate quantifying the net revenue contribution from Reels going forward. We will still work to further improve Reels ads performance through ranking improvements and making Reels ads increasingly interactive, while also growing supply to give businesses more opportunities to get in front of people. We anticipate this ongoing work will help Reels be a modest tailwind to revenue in 2024 while we continue to strike the right balance between engagement and revenue growth. But our focus going forward will be on growing revenue and engagement on overall video, and more holistically across our product lines within Instagram and Facebook. Next, onsite experiences. We’re seeing sustained momentum with Click-to-Message ads. Click-to-WhatsApp ad revenue continues to grow very quickly in particular and is already at a multi-billion dollar annual run-rate. We’re progressing on our work to enable further down the funnel conversions, and longer-term, we’re excited about the potential of AI to help businesses message with customers more efficiently at scale. We’ve recently started testing AI capabilities with a few partners and will take our time to get the experience right, but we believe this will be a big unlock for business messaging in the future. We’re also excited about the potential for paid messaging, which serves as a nice complement to click-to-messaging ads by helping businesses develop ongoing relationships with customers once they’re in a messaging thread. Outside of business messaging, we’re seeing good early traction with Shops ads and in the third quarter we announced expanded commerce integrations with third party services to make it easier for businesses to set up a Facebook or Instagram Shop and run Shops ads. The third piece of our work is making it easier for advertisers to connect their marketing data. We’re investing in ways to make it easier for advertisers to adopt our Conversions API, understand its impact, and use it across a broader set of objectives. In addition to our existing support for AWS, in September, we announced the support of Google Cloud for the Conversions API Gateway. We’ve also introduced enhanced reporting and rolled out Conversions API for Business Messaging so click-to-message advertisers can now better understand the value of WhatsApp and Messenger and improve their performance. Last, AI. We are leveraging AI across our ads systems and suite of products, which is driving improved performance for advertisers. We’re increasingly adopting the use of larger, more advanced ads models and using AI to power ads products that provide increased automation to advertisers. We’re seeing strong traction with our Advantage+ Shopping solution, particularly around online commerce and CPG advertisers looking to drive online sales. And we’re continuing to invest in several other products within our Meta Advantage+ suite to help advertisers optimize and automate more of their campaigns. Before turning to our revenue outlook, I’d like to provide color on our hiring plans as we look to 2024. One important point to note is that we are currently operating with a significant underrun against our 2023 budgeted headcount. For much of late 2022 and early 2023, we had instituted a broad-based hiring freeze as we undertook our restructuring efforts. In addition, as part of those restructuring efforts, many teams elected to make deeper headcount reductions in order to hire different skill sets that they need. We have since resumed hiring but expect that much of our hiring that was originally planned for and budgeted in 2023 will occur in 2024. As part of our 2024 budget, we plan to selectively allocate incremental headcount toward four key company priorities, AI, infrastructure, Reality Labs, and monetization as well as toward our regulatory and compliance needs. Of those areas, we expect AI to be the largest area of increased investment as we further invest in Generative AI across our core products, internal tooling, and research efforts. We aim to offset some of this growth by continuing our efficiency focus and reducing planned hiring in other areas across the company in 2024. The net effect of our efforts to close out our 2023 hiring underruns and our efficiency-focused 2024 budgeting process is that we expect to end next year with reported, in-seat headcount meaningfully higher than our current headcount, but to grow at a slower rate beyond that. We also expect a step-up in infrastructure-related expense growth next year as we recognize higher depreciation and operating costs from running an expanded infrastructure footprint. In addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. Of note, the FTC is seeking to substantially modify our existing consent order and impose additional restrictions on our ability to operate. We are contesting this matter, but if we are unsuccessful it would have an adverse impact on our business. Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect fourth quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5 billion to $40 billion. Our guidance assumes a foreign currency tailwind of approximately 2% to year-over-year total revenue growth in the fourth quarter, based on current exchange rates. Turning now to the expense outlook. We anticipate that our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $87 billion to $89 billion, lowered from our prior range of $88 billion to $91 billion. This outlook includes approximately $3.5 billion of restructuring costs related to facilities consolidation charges and severance and other personnel costs. We expect Reality Labs operating losses to increase year-over-year in 2023. We are also sharing a preliminary outlook for 2024 expenses, CapEx and our tax rate. We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $94 billion to $99 billion. We continue to expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024. First, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs next year. Given our increased capital investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint. Second, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we work down our current hiring underrun and add incremental talent to support priority areas in 2024, which we expect will continue to shift our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles. Finally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in AR/VR and our investments to further scale our ecosystem. Turning now to the capex outlook. We expect 2023 capital expenditures to be in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion, updated from our prior estimate of $27 billion to $30 billion. We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $30 billion to $35 billion, with growth driven by investments in servers, including both non-AI and AI hardware, and in data centers as we ramp up construction on sites with the new data center architecture we announced late last year. On to tax. Absent any changes to US tax law, we expect our fourth quarter 2023 and full-year 2024 tax rates to be similar to the third quarter of 2023. Please note that our outlook for 2024 expenses, capital expenditures and tax rate are preliminary estimates. In the future, we expect to provide our forward -- our initial forward year expense, capex and tax rate outlooks on the fourth quarter call. In closing, this was a good quarter for our business as our efficiency efforts are translating into improved financial results and we’re seeing momentum across our company priorities. We’re excited to build on this work in 2024 as we invest in areas that have the potential to meaningfully transform how people engage with our services and each other in the years ahead. With that, Dave, let’s open up the call for questions."

META,2023-10-25,2023-10-26,,2023-10-25,2023-10-25T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-25,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Great. Thanks for taking our questions. I have two. The first one, Mark, just wanted to ask you about the open source model strategy. You've been a leader in developing a lot of unique open source AI models. You've got some high-profile distribution partners now. How do you think about the strategic opportunity for Meta from the growing open source model adoption? And then the second one, Susan, just on the operating losses at Reality Labs. I understand there’s product development and efforts to scale the ecosystem. Can you help us understand or give us examples of expenditure going on within Reality Labs that could also be ported and used over at Family of Apps perhaps over time?"
META,2023-10-25,2023-10-26,,2023-10-25,2023-10-25T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-25,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Sure, okay. I can start with the AI models. We have a pretty long history of open sourcing parts of our infrastructure that are not kind of the direct product code. And a lot of the reason why we do this is because it increases adoption and creates a standard around the industry, which often drives forward innovation faster so we benefit, our products benefit, as well as there's more scrutiny on kind of security and safety-related things so we think that there's a benefit there. And sometimes, more companies running models or infrastructure can make it run more efficiently, which helps reduce our costs as well, which is something that we've seen with open compute. So I think there's a good chance that, that happens here over time. And obviously, our CapEx expenses are a big driver of our costs, so any aid in innovating on efficiency is sort of a big thing there. The other piece is just that over time with our AI efforts, we've tried to distinguish ourselves as being a place that does work that will be shared with the industry and that attracts a lot of the best people to come work here. So a lot of people want to go to the place to work where their work is going to touch most people. One way to do that is by building products that billions of people use. But if you're really a focused engineer or researcher in this area, you also want to build the thing that's going to be the standard for the industry. So I know that's pretty exciting and it helps us do leading work. While at the same time, a lot of the secret sauce that goes into our product has specific product logic on top of the model, and we're also able to further train the models with data that we have internally. So I think it's a good balance of improving the quality of what we do and improving the economics around it and improving recruiting while still enabling us to build a leading product."
META,2023-10-25,2023-10-26,,2023-10-25,2023-10-25T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-25,qa,,Susan Li,"And Brian, I'll go ahead and take your second question, which is on the operating losses at Reality Labs and whether there's any benefit to Family of Apps from some of that work. So first, I should clarify, the majority of our Reality Labs costs are direct costs in headcount, operating expenses and product costs for the Reality Labs work. The remainder of the Reality Labs total costs are indirect costs such as facilities that get allocated based on our estimate of their benefit to Reality Labs. Now, as you alluded to, Reality Labs is working to build the future of online interactions. And we do expect you'll see some interesting ways that translate into work with the Family of Apps in the near term. For example, with avatars, you've already seen 1 billion avatars created so far. We expect that this will become increasingly important across the Family of Apps. And we're also starting to see how our hardware can help create unique content for Facebook and Instagram today with our Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses making it easier to capture and share to Family of Apps, including live-streaming, and we think that will obviously create more engaging content for the content ecosystem. Longer term, obviously, we think there's a lot of value from operating our Family of Apps experiences on top of a new computing platform that we helped develop, for example, having glasses on that enable you to have our Meta AI assistant with you at all times. And as glasses scale, they'll make it increasingly easy to capture compelling content from a first person point of view while you're staying in the moment or the activity that you're doing and sharing that content should enrich our content ecosystems even further. But again, the operating losses that are occurring within the Reality Labs segment are really driven by the Reality Labs work directly. And we think that over the sort of arc of the years ahead, there will be increasing shared benefits to our Family of Apps experiences."

One, when you see maybe a wider divergence than we thought in terms of some of the regional performance of the advertising businesses, anything to call out region by region in teams of either macroeconomic conditions or levels of product initiatives having been rolled out in different parts of the world that might led to a wider divergence in operating performance in the ad business across the globe would be number one? And then two, Susan, you introduced this concept a couple of quarters ago about data center architecture, and you said it's now being deployed in the way you're allocating capital into the business. Is there any update on how we should be thinking about that on a multiyear view in terms of achieving additional capital efficiencies and be able to deploy less CapEx but maybe with a higher throughput or output on those dollars spent? Thank you."
META,2023-10-25,2023-10-26,,2023-10-25,2023-10-25T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-25,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Eric. So your first question, I think, was about regional trends or regional themes in our ad revenue, which as you saw this quarter accelerated across all regions. To give you a little bit of color, in North America, we saw accelerate by 7 points due primarily to strong demand from China advertisers. Note that North America didn't experience the same currency tailwinds that drove acceleration in year-over-year growth for the other regions. In the EU or in our EU region, we saw that accelerate 21 points. There was a broad-based acceleration in the region, including demand from China advertisers and some benefit from currency tailwinds after facing currency headwinds in Q2. Asia Pacific accelerated 9 points. We benefited from stronger demand in Southeast Asian countries, and again, the flip to currency tailwinds versus headwinds in Q2. Rest of World accelerated 20 points. We saw both stronger pricing and the same currency dynamic there. Brazil was a strong contributor to the region's acceleration due in part to increased advertisers' demand from China advertisers targeting users in Brazil. Your second question was around the impact of the new data center architecture on our CapEx investments in the years to come. We are still relatively early on this. We had to pause some of our existing data center construction work to switch over to the new data center architecture that played through in some of our 2023 CapEx dynamics. And going forward, as I think we said when we introduced the concept of this architecture, we expect it to be more cost efficient for us. We expect it will give us greater fungibility in the way that we plan for CPU and GPU capacity. So we expect that we'll be realizing the cost benefits and efficiencies and the planning flexibility that the architecture gives us in the years to come."
META,2023-10-25,2023-10-26,,2023-10-25,2023-10-25T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-25,qa,,Operator,And your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.
META,2023-10-25,2023-10-26,,2023-10-25,2023-10-25T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-25,qa,,Mark Shmulik,"Yes. Hi, thanks for taking the questions. The first is, this month, you started to roll out some of those first kind of gen AI tools for ad creative. I'd love to hear a little bit about kind of how that's going. Are advertisers using this? And really, is it creating better ads on their behalf? And then secondly, as we kind of look ahead here to the fourth quarter, there's certainly been a lot of unfortunate geopolitical kind of activity around the globe. Would love to just understand some color on how that affects kind of Meta's ad business. Thank you."
META,2023-10-25,2023-10-26,,2023-10-25,2023-10-25T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-25,qa,,Susan Li,"Hi, thanks, Mark. I can take both of those. So your first question was around gen AI tools, especially for advertisers and you'll see that we have been increasingly testing these in our AI sandbox. And then as they become more mature, we incorporate them into our ads manager directly. We've incorporated them into some of our Advantage+ solutions. A few that I would highlight that we're rolling out this quarter are text variations, so generating multiple versions of ad text based on an advertiser's original copy that helps highlight the selling points of their products and services, giving them multiple text options to better reach their audience. Another one is image expansion, which helps adjust creative assets to fit different aspect ratios across multiple services like Feed or Reels. That allows advertisers to spend less time themselves trying to repurpose their creative assets in these different formats. Another one is background generation, creating multiple backgrounds to complement the advertisers' product images, allowing advertisers to tailor their creative assets for different audiences. And we're making this available actually through Advantage+ catalog ads. And so we really feel like we've introduced quite a lot of new ads products and features. You asked about the gen AI one specifically. So those are the ones I highlighted. We've actually introduced a number of others that are related to other dimensions of the ad creation experience that we expect will help improve our advertising performance, will help advertisers drive sales, especially over the holidays and especially in the Advantage+ shopping suite. So we're very excited about all of those upcoming launches, and we think that the early advertiser feedback has been very positive. Your second question was on looking ahead in Q4 and the impact of some of the geopolitical activity that we've seen around the world and how that might be affecting our business. So first, I think I should start by saying that our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by the horrific violence in the Middle East, and we know that our services can be a vital tool for information and connection and expression at a moment like this. And we're continuing to monitor the situation and are doing everything we can to keep people safe and to keep our services secure. Now in terms of how this translates into impact on the Q4 business, first of all, I should say that coming into Q4, we've been seeing continued strong advertiser demand in key segments, including online commerce and gaming. But having said that, we are also seeing more volatility at the start of the quarter. That's in part why we widened our guidance range to capture that uncertainty. And so for instance, while we don't have material direct revenue exposure to Israel and the Middle East, we have observed softer ad spend in the beginning of the fourth quarter, correlating with the start of the conflict, which is captured in our Q4 revenue outlook. It's hard for us to attribute demand softness directly to any specific geopolitical event. Historically, we have seen broader demand softness follow other regional conflicts in the past such as in the Ukraine war. So this is something that we're continuing to monitor. We've reflected the latest trends and advertiser reaction that we've seen into our Q4 outlook, which again, we think, reflects the greater uncertainty and volatility in the landscape ahead. I want to add here, too, that we are pleased with the fundamentals of the business and with our execution. We've seen promising engagement trends. We're continuing to drive ad performance improvements. We're executing well on our company priorities. So we'll continue to stay focused in those areas, and we'll also remain disciplined with our investment approach as we navigate a volatile environment."

META,2023-10-25,2023-10-26,,2023-10-25,2023-10-25T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-25,qa,,Doug Anmuth,"Thanks for taking the questions. One for Mark and one for Susan. Mark, I was hoping you could talk more about the gen AI-driven vertical chatbots and Meta AI assistant rolled out of Connect a few weeks ago. How do you think about the potential for these products to improve both engagement and monetization over time? And then Susan, I know it's early but I was hoping you could talk a little bit qualitatively about some of the puts and takes to 2024 revenue growth. And then in particular, whether you'd expect revenue to grow faster than expenses off a normalized revenue base backing out restructuring? Thanks."
META,2023-10-25,2023-10-26,,2023-10-25,2023-10-25T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-25,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Sure. I could talk about some of the AI launches first. We launched Meta AI, which is sort of an AI assistant that you can ask different questions and get access to real-time information as well as generating images. And we also launched the first version of AI Studio with several initial AI characters that you can interact with. And part of the idea here is that we think that having a basic assistant is really important, but we think that people are going to -- there are going to be lots of different AIs that people interact with. We think ultimately, most creators are going to want one to help grow and engage their community. We think most businesses are going to want one to help support their customers and help drive commerce. So we think that there are going to be a lot of different AIs. In terms of engagement, the first order effect is, I think at scale, I think that this is going to be one of the ways that people use our messaging apps and communicate with, and you're going to talk to people and you'll talk to AIs. What the mix of that is, I think, will kind of shift over time and I don't think anyone can really predict that. But this is a new use case that doesn't take away from people interacting with people. If anything, it should -- we're designing these to make it so that they can help facilitate and encourage interactions between people and make things more fun by making it so you can drop in some of these AIs into group chats and things like that just to make the experiences more engaging. So this should be incremental and create additional engagement. The AIs also have profiles in Instagram and Facebook and can produce content, and over time, going to be able to interact with each other. And I think that's going to be an interesting dynamic and an interesting, almost a new kind of medium and art form. So I think that will be an interesting vector for increasing engagement and entertainment as well. So I'm excited about that. Of course, whenever there's more engagement in the apps, that creates the opportunity for more monetization, so there's that on the monetization side. And then the other big opportunity on monetization, which I talked about upfront is just business messaging. One of the big things that I think is a key unlock for making the business messaging -- for making that business model work around the globe is effectively making it so that businesses in countries where there's a higher cost of labor can have an AI that can respond to messages from people so that way, it's not cost prohibitive for them to engage in that type of interaction with customers. So I think that if we can -- as we are able to roll out the business AIs, I think that, that can really unlock and grow the business -- messaging business in a big way, but we have a lot of work to do to get there. So that's kind of a basic view on how I think this will affect the engagement in business."
META,2023-10-25,2023-10-26,,2023-10-25,2023-10-25T17:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-25,qa,,Susan Li,"I'm happy to take the second question. Thanks, Doug. We obviously have not shared a 2024 revenue outlook yet. You asked about what are some of the significant puts and takes, and I'd maybe point back to what I said earlier about the Q4 outlook just to highlight what a volatile macro environment we believe we're in. I think that will obviously have a big impact on the advertising market next year, and it's something we'll be keeping a very close eye on. But ultimately, we're very subject to volatility in the macro landscape. Certainly, our own ads performance is an area where we have invested a lot, and we've seen a lot of increased value that we've been driving for marketers. We've been increasing the conversions we deliver, higher -- and offering higher return on their ad spend so we think that will be an important factor. We're continuing to enroll a lot of new features, both gen AI and not in our ads tool, and we're continuing to improve the ranking and delivery models that underlie our ads infrastructure. We'll also be obviously lapping stronger periods, especially in -- as you saw with this quarter's results. So all of those factors, I think, will play into the 2024 revenue outlook. You also asked about the kind of the expense philosophy next year, whether expense growth will be tied to revenue growth. Obviously, the revenue outlook is uncertain. We talked a little bit about the -- what's going into the preliminary expense guide for 2024. The big components there are around infrastructure expenses. We do expect, given the increased capital investments that we have made in recent years, that depreciation expenses in 2024 will increase by a larger amount than in 2023. And we expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint. The second big driver is on payroll. We anticipate payroll growth driven by the spillover of hiring that we had intended for 2023 into 2024. And we do expect that Family of Apps will be a larger source of payroll expense growth than Reality Labs in 2024. Additionally, hiring will generally be concentrated in technical roles, which will continue to shift our workforce composition towards a higher cost basis. And of course, the final piece being Reality Labs operating losses, which we expect to increase in 2024 across both the expense growth from higher payroll costs as well as higher non-headcount cost to support the development of our next-gen VR and AR products. How the expense and revenue outlook come together? Obviously, that's -- as we get more information on the revenue outlook for next year, that will influence that. Ultimately, we have talked about the framework that we introduced in the past. We recognize that we have very ambitious investments on the horizon, including over a long-time horizon with our Reality Labs work and newer, equally ambitious investments we've added in the gen AI road map more recently. And we recognize that we have to earn the ability to invest in all of those things by delivering consolidated operating income growth over time. So that's something we're very much focused on."

I guess I'll ask about the DSA and DMA and also press reports that there could be a subscription offering in Europe. Maybe, Mark, how do you think about subscription usage for Facebook? Maybe an update on how Meta Verified is going and how you're thinking about the evolution of the model in Europe. Maybe we'll start with that. And then for Susan, I know you've talked a lot about Chinese advertisers. How do you think that could affect the growth as you comp that next year? Thanks a lot."

I think there are multiple parts there and I will do my best to address all of them, but of course, let me know if I miss anything. So the first question was sort of around operating in Europe, in particular, the legal basis for ads. So as we announced in August, we intend to evolve our legal basis for processing personal data for ads to a consent model in the EU, the EEA in Switzerland, given the recent regulatory developments in those regions. We don't have any further details to share on the exact implementation at this time. We're continuing to engage with the DPC and other regulatory authorities on our proposed consent model, but we're committed to making this move as soon as possible, and we will provide an update when we have it. The second question you asked was about Meta Verified. So we're still, I think, quite early here but we've rolled out Meta Verified for creators to most markets globally. We continue to hear positive feedback from creators as we've helped them more easily establish their presence on Facebook and Instagram. We also have recently begun testing Meta Verified for businesses on Facebook and Instagram in select countries, and we have plans to expand that to businesses on WhatsApp in the future. And this will allow businesses to more easily stand out on our apps and build confidence with their customers and let their customers know that they're chatting with the right business. So we're encouraged by the early signs that we're seeing there, but again, very early and not a lot more to share right now. The third part of your question was around Chinese advertisers. So spend from Chinese advertisers further accelerated for us in Q3. We have benefited from strong investments from a few of our larger clients. We've also seen generally broader-based strength from other China advertisers, and we believe factors such as lower shipping costs and easing regulations on the gaming industry have served as tailwinds here. But I think there has been a broader story of improved growth across all advertiser regions in Q3, and even excluding China advertisers, revenue growth has accelerated nicely. And you kind of alluded to whether there's -- the sustainability of the China advertising revenue. And even though we've seen particularly strong growth this year, I would say that there has been a longer-term trend of overall growth with this segment dating back to past years and also periods of volatility in the past, like in the last two years, we've seen periods with higher shipping costs with lockdowns, with regulation weighing on demand. So we recognize there's the potential for volatility in the future as well and especially given that there are so many macro factors at play that are quite hard to predict.

First, can you share any early read into demand for Quest 3? It's been out for 10 days but I think you've been taking orders from these last three weeks? And is it priced to be at least gross profit breakeven or not necessarily? And then second, Susan, for 2024 as we think about growth, can you speak maybe about political spend contribution that you've had back in 2020 and how that may inform how we should think about its contribution for 2024? Thank you."

We are not sharing any explicit expectations for Quest 3, either Q4 Reality Labs revenue, unit sales, et cetera. But we are very excited to have Quest 3 in market, in particular, during the holiday shopping period. We think early reviews have been great. And we're very excited to have a product out there that are going to introduce a lot of people to mixed reality experiences for the first time. So it's very early. I think we don't have very many more specifics. But again, we're quite excited to have it in the market and to have it in particular during the holiday marketing season. Your second question was about political spend. And so this is a place where I would say we saw acceleration of positive year-over-year growth in all verticals this quarter really except politics, which is lapping the lead-up to the 2022 US midterms last year. So I will say though that this is also just a very small vertical for us so there's not too much more to add there."

I know it's early but how would you rank the overall strategy here around these AI agents and AI Studio compared to other big initiatives that Meta has made in FoA over the years? Is this bigger than or as big as the Stories transition or the Reels transition? And any thoughts just kind of high level on that? And then the cost of serving up responses, especially stickers and images is a little bit more expensive than your core business of aggregating the News Feed. So how much more expensive, I guess, is the question? And are there things you can do to bring that cost down? Thanks a lot."

In terms of how big this is going to be, it's hard to predict because I don't think that anyone has built what we're building here. I mean, there's some analogy is like what OpenAI is doing with ChatGPT, but that's pretty different from what we're trying to do. Maybe the Meta AI part of what we're doing overlaps with the type of work that they're doing, but the AI characters piece, there's a consumer part of that, there's a business part, there's a creators part. I'm just not sure that anyone else is doing this. And when we're working on things like Stories and Reels, there were some market precedents before that. Here, there's technology which is extremely exciting. But I think part of what leading in an area and developing a new thing means is you don't quite know how big it's going to be. But what I predict is that I do think that the fundamental technology around Generative AI is going to transform meaningfully how people use each of the different apps that we build. I think for the Feed apps, I think that over time, more of the content that people consume is going to be either generated or edited by AI. Some of it will be creators will now have all these tools to make content more easily and more fun. And I think over time, maybe we'll even get to the point where we can just generate content directly for people based on what they might be interested in. I think that, that could be really compelling. On the messaging side, I think that the way that we're looking at these AIs kind of ties into that directly where you'll be able to message with Meta AI or any of these different AIs for whether it's for fun, you have a question about something, you want to help doing something, you want to play a game or you want to message with a business for commerce or you want to engage with your favorite creator and they wouldn't normally otherwise have time to message you back, but now they have an AI representing them that can. I think that will accrue to kind of to messaging behavior. It's going to change advertising in a big way. It's going to make it so much easier to run ads. Businesses that basically before would have had to create their own creative or images now won't have to do that. They'll be able to test more versions of creative, whether it's images or eventually video or text. That's really exciting, especially when paired with the recommendation AI. On the hardware side, I mean, obviously, the smart glasses that we just rolled out, we sort of thought were a precursor to eventually getting to displays and holograms for augmented reality, and I think we will eventually get there still. It's not that far off. But I think that now the ability to deliver AI through smart glasses may end up being a killer use case for that even before you get to the kind of augmented reality type of use cases. So I think you're basically seeing that there are going to be -- this is a very broad and exciting technology. And frankly, I think that this is partially why working in the technology industry is so awesome, right, is that every once in a while, something comes along like this, that like changes everything and just makes everything a lot better and your ability to just be creative and kind of rethink the things that you're doing to be better for all the people you serve. I mean, I just think that's a lot of what is energizing and fun around building companies like this. But yes, it's hard sitting here now to be able to predict like the metrics are going to be around, like what's the balance of messaging between AIs and people or what the balance and Feeds between AI content and people content or anything like that. But I mean, I'm highly confident that this is going to be a thing and I think it's worth investing in. To the question about efficiency and costs, I think initially, it's most important to focus on getting to product market fit. And we obviously care a lot about efficiency, right? I mean, the CapEx costs for our company are very significant, and it's one of the main things that weighs on the economic model of the company. So on the one hand, as we can improve the efficiency, we're able to do things like train bigger models and serve more people, which currently, right now, we're going to be bottlenecked on based on the amount of infrastructure that we have as this gets to the scales that we aspire to get to. So in the near term, the efficiency wins will primarily just be to deliver better products to more people. But over time, we're going to continue working on that. And I think we've been able to do pretty good work on efficiency on our hardware and compute. And over the long term, once we kind of have more of an understanding about what these products want to be, then we'll be able to drive the economic model based on that. But we'll work on that all throughout, but I think we're still in the pretty early part of that curve."

META,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T16:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,prepared,,Mark Zuckerberg,"All right. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This was a good quarter, and it wrapped up an important year for our community and our company. We estimate that there are more than 3.1 billion people who use at least one of our apps each day. 2023 was our year of efficiency, which focused on making Meta a stronger technology company and improving our business to give us the stability to deliver our ambitious long-term vision for AI and the metaverse.  And last year, not only did we achieve our efficiency goals, but we returned to strong revenue growth, saw strong engagement across our apps; shipped a number of exciting new products like Threads, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and mixed reality in Quest 3; and of course, established a world-class AI effort that's going to be the foundation for many of our future products. I think that being a leaner company is helping us execute better and faster, and we will continue to carry these values forward as a permanent part of how we operate.  Now moving forward, a major goal, we'll be building the most popular and most advanced AI products and services. And if we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with.  I also think that everyone will want a new category of computing devices that let you frictionlessly interact with AIs that can see what you see and hear what you hear, like smart glasses. And one thing that became clear to me in the last year is that this next generation of services requires building full general intelligence. Previously, I thought that because many of the tools were social-, commerce- or maybe media-oriented that it might be possible to deliver these products by solving only a subset of AI's challenges.  But now it's clear that we're going to need our models to be able to reason, plan, code, remember and many other cognitive abilities in order to provide the best versions of the services that we envision. We've been working on general intelligence research and FAIR for more than a decade. But now general intelligence will be the theme of our product work as well. Meta has a long history of building new technologies into our services, and we have a clear long-term playbook for becoming leaders.  And there are a few key aspects of this that I want to take some time to go through today. The first is world-class compute infrastructure. I recently shared that, by the end of this year, we'll have about 350,000 H100s, and including other GPUs, that will be around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute. We're well positioned now because of the lessons that we learned from Reels. We initially underbuilt our GPU clusters for Reels. And when we were going through that, I decided that we should build enough capacity to support both Reels and another Reels-sized AI service that we expected to emerge so we wouldn't be in that situation again.  And at the time, the decision was somewhat controversial, and we faced a lot of questions about CapEx spending, but I'm really glad that we did this. Now going forward, we think that training and operating future models will be even more compute-intensive. We don't have a clear expectation for exactly how much this will be yet, but the trend has been that state-of-the-art large language models have been trained on roughly 10x the amount of compute each year.  And our training clusters are only part of our overall infrastructure, and the rest, obviously, isn't growing as quickly. But overall, we're playing to win here, and I expect us to continue investing aggressively in this area. In order to build the most advanced clusters, we're also designing novel data centers and designing our own custom silicons specialized for our workloads.  The second part of our playbook is open-source software infrastructure. Our long-standing strategy has been to build an open-source general infrastructure while keeping our specific product implementations proprietary. In the case of AI, the general infrastructure includes our Llama models, including Llama 3, which is training now, and it's looking great so far, as well as industry standard tools like PyTorch that we've developed.  And this approach to open source has unlocked a lot of innovation across the industry, and it's something that we believe in deeply. And I know that some people have questions about how we benefit from open sourcing, the results of our research and large amounts of compute. So I thought it might be useful to lay out the strategic benefits here.  The short version is that open sourcing improves our models. And because there's still significant work to turn our models into products because there will be other open-source models available anyway, we find that there are mostly advantages to being the open-source leader, and it doesn't remove differentiation for our products much anyway. And more specifically, there are several strategic benefits.  First, open-source software is typically safer and more secure as well as more compute-efficient to operate due to all the ongoing feedback, scrutiny and development from the community. Now this is a big deal because safety is one of the most important issues in AI. Efficiency improvements and lowering the compute costs also benefit everyone, including us.  Second, open-source software often becomes an industry standard. And when companies standardize on building with our stack, that then becomes easier to integrate new innovations into our products. That's subtle, but the ability to learn and improve quickly is a huge advantage. And being an industry standard enables that.  Third, open source is hugely popular with developers and researchers. And we know that people want to work on open systems that will be widely adopted. So this helps us recruit the best people at Meta, which is a very big deal for leading in any new technology area. And again, we typically have unique data and build unique product integrations anyway, so providing infrastructure like Llama as open source doesn't reduce our main advantage. This is why our long-standing strategy has been to open source general infrastructure and why I expect it to continue to be the right approach for us going forward.  The next part of our playbook is just taking a long-term approach towards the development. While we're working on today's products and models, we're also working on the research that we need to advance for Llama 5, 6 and 7 in the coming years and beyond to develop full general intelligence. It's important to have a portfolio of multiyear investments in research projects, but it's also important to have clear launch vehicles like future Llama models that help focus our work.  We've worked on general intelligence in our lab, FAIR, for more than a decade, as I mentioned, and we produced a lot of valuable work. But having clear product targets for delivering general intelligence really focuses this work and helps us build the leading research program.  Now the next key part of our playbook is learning from unique data and feedback loops in our products. When people think about data, they typically think about the corpus that you might use to train a model upfront. And on Facebook and Instagram, there are hundreds of billions of publicly shared images and tens of billions of public videos, which we estimate is greater than the common crawl data set. And people share large numbers of public text posts and comments across our services as well.  But even more important in the upfront training corpus is the ability to establish the right feedback loops with hundreds of millions of people interacting with AI services across our products. And this feedback is a big part of how we've improved our AI systems so quickly with Reels and Ads, especially over the last couple of years when we had to re-architect it around new rules.  Now that brings me to the last part of our playbook for building leading services, which is our culture of rapid learning and experimentation across our apps. When we decide that a new technology, like AI-recommended Reels, is going to be an important part of the future, we're not shy about having multiple teams experimenting with different versions across our apps until we get it right. And then we learn what works and we roll it out to everyone.  And there used to be this meme that we'd probably launch Stories on our Settings page at some point. And look, I think it's kind of funny because it gets to a core part of our approach. We start by learning and tuning our products until they perform the way we want, and then we roll them out very broadly.  And sometimes, occasionally, products will blow up before we're ready for them to, like Threads, although I'll note that Threads now has more people actively using it today than it did during its initial launch peak. So that one is, I think, on track to be a major success.  But normally, we learn and we iterate methodically. And we started doing that with our AI services in the fall launching Meta AI, our assistant; AI Studio, which the precursor to Creator AIs; our Alpha with Business AIs; and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. And we've been tuning each of these, and we're getting closer to rolling them out more widely. So you should expect that in the coming months.  From there, we'll focus on rolling out services until they reach hundreds of millions or billions of people. And usually, only when we reach that kind of scale do we start focusing on what monetization will look like. And although in this case, the way the business AIs will help business messaging grow and WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram is pretty clear. But that's our basic approach, and I'm really excited about pointing our company at developing so many of these awesome things.  Now we have 2 major parts of our long-term vision, and in addition to AI, the other part is the metaverse. We've invested heavily in both AI and the metaverse for a long time, and we will continue to do so. These days, there are a lot of questions more about AI that I get, and that field is moving very quickly. But I still expect that this next generation of AR, VR and MR computing platforms to deliver a realistic sense of presence that will be the foundation for the future of social experiences and almost every other category of experiences as well.  Reality Labs crossed $1 billion in revenue in Q4 for the first time with Quest having a strong holiday season. Quest 3 is off to a strong start, and I expect it to continue to be the most popular mixed reality device. With Quest 3 and Quest 2 both performing well, we saw that the Quest app was actually the most downloaded app in the App Store on Christmas Day. I want to give a shout-out to Asgard's Wrath2, which was developed by one of our in-house studios and received IGN's 10 out of 10 masterpiece rating, making it one of the best-rated games out there, not just in VR, but of any game on any platform ever.  So it's a really good sign that we're able to deliver that quality of work at Meta. Horizon is growing quickly, too. It is now on Top 10 Most Used Apps on Quest, and we have an exciting road map ahead. This is another example of applying the long-term playbook that I discussed earlier with AI but in another area. We take the time to build up the core technology and tune the experience. And then when it's ready, we're good at growing things. Now our focus for this year is going to be on growing the mobile version of Horizon as well as the VR One.  Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are also off to a very strong start, both in sales and engagement. Our partner, EssilorLuxottica is already planning on making more than we both expected due to high demand. Engagement and retention are also significantly higher than the first version of the glasses. The experience is just a lot better with Meta AI in there as well as there's a higher resolution camera, better audio and more. And we also have an exciting road map of software improvements ahead, starting with rolling out multimodal AI and then some other really exciting new AI features later in the year.  I said this before, but I think that people are going to want new categories of devices that seamlessly engage with AIs frequently throughout the AI without having to take out your phone and press a button and point it at what you want to see. And I think that smart glasses are going to be a compelling form factor for this, and it's a good example of how our AI and metaverse visions are connected.  In addition to AI in the metaverse, we're continuing to improve our Apps and Ads businesses as well. Reels and our discovery engine remain a priority and major driver of engagement, and Messaging continues to be our focus for building the next revenue pillar of our business before our longer-term work reaches scale. But since I went a bit longer in the other areas today, I'm just going to mention a few highlights here.  Reels continues to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook. People re-share Reels 3.5 billion times every day. Reels is now contributing to our net revenue across our apps. The biggest opportunity going forward is unifying our recommendation systems across Reels and other types of video that will help people discover the best content across our systems no matter what format it's in.  WhatsApp is also doing very well. And the most exciting new trend here is that it is succeeding more broadly in the United States, where there's a real appetite for a private, secure and cross-platform messaging app that everyone can use. And given the strategic importance of the U.S. and its outsized importance for revenue, this is just a huge opportunity.  Threads is also growing steadily with more than 130 million monthly actives. And I'm optimistic that we can keep the pace of improvements in growth going and show that a friendly, discussion-oriented app can be as widely used as the most popular social apps.  All right. That's what I wanted to cover today. Our communities are growing, and our business is back on track. Once again, a big thank you to all of our employees, partners, shareholders and everyone in our community for sticking with us and for making 2023 such a success. I'm looking forward to another exciting year ahead.  And now here's Susan."
META,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T16:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,prepared,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q4 total revenue was $40.1 billion, up 25% or 22% on a constant currency basis. Q4 total expenses were $23.7 billion, down 8% compared to last year.  In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue decreased 8%, 0driven mainly by lower restructuring costs that were partially offset by higher infrastructure-related costs. R&D increased 8% driven primarily by higher head count-related costs from Family of Apps and Reality Labs as well as higher non-head count-related Reality Labs operating expenses, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs.  Marketing and sales decreased 29% due mainly to lower marketing spend and restructuring costs. G&A decreased 26% due mainly to lower restructuring expenses. We ended the fourth quarter with over 67,300 employees, down 22% from a year ago while up 2% from Q3 as our hiring efforts have resumed. Fourth quarter operating income was $16.4 billion, representing a 41% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 17%.  Net income was $14 billion or $5.33 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $7.9 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $11.5 billion, which reflects a $1.6 billion payment of income taxes deferred from prior quarters of 2023. We ended the year with $65.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt.  In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $6.3 billion of our Class A stock, bringing our total share repurchases for the full year to $20 billion. We had $30.9 billion remaining on our prior authorization as of December 31. And today, we announced a $50 billion increase in our stock repurchase authorization.  Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. In Q4, we saw continued community growth across the Family of Apps as well as Facebook, specifically. We're sharing today that as previewed when we first introduced our family metrics, we are transitioning away from reporting Facebook-specific metrics.  As part of this transition, we will no longer report Facebook daily and monthly active users or family monthly active people. In Q1, we will instead begin reporting year-over-year changes in ad impressions and the average price per ad at the regional level while continuing to report family daily active people.  For full year 2023, Family of Apps total revenue was $133 billion and ad revenue was $131.9 billion, each up 16% year-over-year. The largest contributors to year-over-year ad revenue growth were the online commerce, CPG, entertainment and media and gaming verticals. The online commerce and gaming verticals benefited from strong demand by advertisers in China reaching people in other markets. In 2023, revenue from China-based advertisers represented 10% of our overall revenue and contributed 5 percentage points to total worldwide revenue growth.  Turning back to Q4 results. Q4 total Family of Apps revenue was $39 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Q4 Family of Apps ad revenue was $38.7 billion, up 24% or 21% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by CPG and gaming.  On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Europe and Rest of World at 33% and 32%, respectively, followed by Asia Pacific at 23% and North America at 19%. Foreign currency was a tailwind to advertising revenue growth in all international regions.  In Q4, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 21%, and the average price per ad increased 2%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia Pacific and Rest of World. Pricing growth was driven by advertiser demand and currency tailwinds, which were partially offset by strong impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing services and regions.  Family of Apps other revenue was $334 million in Q4, up 82%, driven by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q4, Family of Apps expenses were $18 billion, representing approximately 76% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were down 13% due to lower restructuring expenses. Family of Apps operating income was $21 billion, representing a 54% operating margin.  Within our Reality Labs segment, Q4 revenue was $1.1 billion, up 47%, driven by Quest 3 sales during the holiday season. Reality Labs expenses were $5.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year due primarily to higher head count-related expenses and non-head count-related R&D spend. Reality Labs operating loss was $4.6 billion.  Turning now to the business outlook. There are 2 primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, we remain pleased with engagement trends and have strong momentum across our product priorities. We're seeing sustained growth in Reels and Video overall as daily watch time across all video types grew over 25% year-over-year in Q4, driven by ongoing ranking improvements.  In-feed recommendations of posts from accounts you're not connected to also continue to drive incremental engagement as we increasingly personalize recommendations, and we expect to deliver further improvements this year. On Instagram, we're making strong progress increasing the freshness of recommended content. And a big focus for Facebook this year will be unifying our video experiences and ranking across the app, which should create a more seamless user experience and deliver increasingly relevant video recommendations.  On WhatsApp, community growth remains strong, and we're seeing good traction with our Channels product, which has quickly scaled to over 500 million monthly active users since we rolled it out globally in September. We are also making good progress in areas that have the potential to grow people's engagement with our products in the longer term, such as Threads and generative AI.  On Threads, we're coming into 2024 with strong product momentum and remain focused on introducing additional valuable features and further scaling the community this year. With generative AI, we fully rolled out our Meta AI assistant and other AI chat experiences in the U.S. at the end of the year and began testing more than 20 GenAI features across our Family of Apps.  Our big areas of focus in 2024 will be working towards the launch of Llama 3, expanding the usefulness of our Meta AI assistant and progressing on our AI Studio road map to make it easier for anyone to create an AI. For the experiences in our apps, we'll follow our typical approach of making them great before we lean into growth and eventually monetization. But this continues to be an exciting area that has the potential to transform how people engage on our services in the years ahead.  Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. There are 2 parts to this work. The first part is growing the level of ad inventory within organic engagement. Our approach to optimizing ad levels in our apps has become increasingly sophisticated over the years as we've developed a better understanding of the optimal place, time and person to show an ad, which has enabled us to adopt a more dynamic approach to serving apps. We expect to continue that work going forward, while services with relatively lower levels of monetization like video and messaging will serve as additional growth opportunities.  The other part to increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance. To do this, we're focused on 3 areas. The first is AI. We continue to leverage AI across our ad systems and product suite. We're delivering continued performance gains from ranking improvements as we adopt larger and more advanced models, and this will remain an ongoing area of investment in 2024.  We're also building out our Advantage+ portfolio of solutions to help advertisers leverage AI to automate their advertising campaigns. Advertisers can choose to automate part of the campaign creation setup process, such as who to show their ad to with Advantage+ audience, or they can automate their campaign completely using Advantage+ shopping, which continues to see strong growth. We're also now exploring ways to apply this end-to-end automation to new objectives.  On the ads creative side, we completed the global rollout of 2 of our generative AI features in Q4, Text Variations and Image Expansion, and plan to broaden availability of our background generation feature later in Q1. Initial adoption of these features has been strong, and tests are showing promising early performance gains. This will remain a big area of focus for us in 2024.  The second area of our work is helping businesses connect their marketing data and measure results. Here, we're continuing to invest in conversions API to make it easier for advertisers to not only adopt but maximize its impact. The last area is investing in new and engaging on-platform ad experiences.  Business messaging remains a priority here. Click-to-message ads continue to grow, and we're seeing advertisers increasingly use these ads to drive down funnel conversions. Paid messaging is growing quickly, and we are focused on broadening adoption in 2024 by making it easier for businesses to buy marketing messages and more easily adopt our Flows product to develop richer in-Thread experiences for consumers.  We're also progressing with our early testing on WhatsApp and Messenger of AIs for businesses that can provide conversational support in chat. We'll take our time to get these experiences right, but we think this will be a compelling opportunity that we're well positioned to deliver on. Outside of business messaging, we're making strong progress with our shops' ads products, which crossed a $2 billion annual run rate in Q4.  Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. We are in the fortunate position of being able to invest in many organic opportunities to improve the performance of our core business in the near term while also making 2 significant longer-time horizon investments in AI and Reality Labs.  AI is a growing area of investment for us in 2024 as we hire to support our road map. We are also investing more in our AI infrastructure capacity this year. And given many of our ambitious forward-looking plans will rely on having sufficient compute capacity, we expect this to be an area we invest more aggressively in over the coming years. Reality Labs is the other long-term initiative we continue to invest heavily in as we progress on our efforts to develop the next computing platform.  Aside from organic investments, returning capital to shareholders remains important to us. We believe our strong financial position and performance will enable us to invest in the business while also continuing to return capital to investors over time. We've historically done so through share repurchases. And while we expect to maintain an active share repurchase program, we are modestly evolving our approach going forward by returning a portion of capital through a regular dividend subject to quarterly Board approval.  In addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. Of note, the FTC is seeking to substantially modify our existing consent order and impose additional restrictions on our ability to operate. We are contesting this matter, but if we are unsuccessful, it would have an adverse impact on our business.  Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect first quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $34.5 billion to $37 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates.  Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $94 billion to $99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. We continue to expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024.  First, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs this year. Given our increased capital investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint.  Second, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we work down our current hiring underrun and add incremental talent to support priority areas in 2024, which we expect will further shift our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles. Finally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in AR/VR and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.  Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $30 billion to $37 billion, a $2 billion increase of the high end of our prior range. We expect growth will be driven by investments in servers, including both AI and non-AI hardware, and data centers as we ramp up construction on sites with our previously announced new data center architecture.  Our updated outlook reflects our evolving understanding of our AI capacity demands as we anticipate what we may need for the next generations of foundational research and product development. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect our ambitious long-term AI research and product development efforts will require growing infrastructure investments beyond this year.  On to tax. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In closing, this was a pivotal year for our company. We increased our operating discipline, delivered strong execution across our product priorities and improved advertising performance for businesses who rely on our services. We will look to build on our priorities in each of those areas in 2024 while advancing our ambitious longer-term efforts in AI and Reality Labs.  With that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions."

Let me ask you one about sort of the advertising business and all of the new machine learning and new GenAI ad tools that you built and rolled out the last year or so. Can you just talk about some of the largest areas of improvement your advertisers say is really driving this inflection of advertising? And what are the areas where you still get the most feedback on for further areas of improvement in the ad business that we should think about? And then, Susan, maybe, one, the first quarter guide, specifically on the acceleration implied. Anything on -- more color on which surfaces or ad units or regions are sort of giving you confidence in that type of acceleration at this point in the quarter?"
META,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T16:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Susan Li,"Thank you, Brian. I can take both of those. On your first question, what is driving strength in the Ads business, we certainly believe that we've been continuing to drive ad performance improvements and year-over-year conversion growth remains strong. And we see this reflected in the feedback that we hear from advertisers also. There are really three areas of our work here that we're very focused on and have been and will continue to be in 2024. First, just creating engaging on-platform ad experiences. We see that with formats like click-to-message ads, where we continue to see good momentum. Shops ads, we talked about the $2 billion annual run rate in Q4 after we just opened availability to all U.S. advertisers in Q2. Lead generation ads, another example. So we're really focused on creating engaging on-platform ad experiences. Second, we're really making it easier for advertisers to connect with their marketing data. We're continuing to invest in features like conversions API, like AEM and making these features easier to adopt, enhancing reporting and other performance. And we've seen, again, that those are -- we get very positive feedback on advertisers who use those tools. And then finally, continuing to really use AI in important ways across our ads platform. For a long time, we have invested in building larger and more advanced models that have resulted in more Accurate predictions of relevant ads for people and improved performance for advertisers. And then, of course, we're investing a lot in AI-powered tools and products. So we're really scaling our Advantage+ suites across all of the different offerings there, which really helped to automate the ads creation process for different types of advertisers. And we're getting very strong feedback on all of those different features, advantage+ Shopping, obviously, being the first, but Advantage+ Catalog, Advantage+ Creative, Advantage+ Audiences, et cetera. So we feel like these are all really important parts of what has continued to grow improvements in our Ads business and will continue to going forward. On your second question, which is about the Q1 year-over-year -- sorry, the Q1 revenue guide. This really just reflects a lot of the trends we saw in Q4, which is strong, broad-based advertising demand across verticals, particularly within online commerce and gaming. I'll also note that we get the benefit from having February 29 in this quarter. And again, just the improvements that we continue to accrue to the business from all of our investments in improving ad performance over time."

META,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T16:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Eric Sheridan,"Maybe two questions, if I can. Mark, coming out of a year like you had with the year of efficiency, what do you see as the key messages you want to share with investors about what you learned during the year of efficiency and how it might inform running an organization with the scale of ambition and just your organizational scale that Meta has on a long-term basis? That would be number one. And then Susan, I went back and looked, I don't think you've ever raised the high end of your CapEx guidance before, unless I'm mistaken. But with a wide range like that in CapEx, what should we be monitoring for what would push you towards either the lower end or the higher end of that CapEx guidance as you move through 2024?"
META,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T16:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"I'll take the first one. So the themes for the year of efficiency were to make us a stronger technology company by becoming leaner and more balanced towards our engineering work and more streamlined and to improve our financial performance, primarily with the goal of providing stability so we can invest in these long-term, ambitious visions around AI and metaverse over what we see as the coming decade or more as these things play out. And I think a lot of people looked at what we were doing as if it might have been some kind of short-term thing, which that's never really our focus. But the part about making the company leaner, I think, is the more important part to take forward, right? Because obviously, we're in a place now where the business is performing well. And I think the obvious question would be, okay, well, given that, should we just -- should we invest a lot more in things? And the biggest thing that's holding me back from doing that is that at this point, I feel like I've really come around to thinking that we operate better as a leaner company. So even though it's always -- there's always questions about like adding a few people here or there to do something. And I guess I just have more of an appreciation about how all of that adds up and in the near term, maybe makes you go a little bit faster. But over the long term, the discipline to kind of hold things to a more streamlined level actually improves the overall company performance. So I'm really focused on that. In 2024, we do have a big recruiting backlog from last year because part of the layoffs that we did included teams basically swapping out certain talent profiles for others. And we still need to hire some of the other talent profiles that we swapped people out for, and that will be ongoing through this year. But in terms of new head count that we added to the plan, it's relatively minimal compared to what we would have done historically.  And I sort of expect that for the next period of time going forward, Even beyond 2024. My operating assumption is that we will also try to keep it relatively minimal because I think that -- until we reach a point where we're just really underwater on our ability to execute, I kind of want to keep things lean because I think that's the right thing for us to do culturally. So that's kind of the best window into how I'm thinking about this. The other piece that, I guess, somewhat dovetails into what Susan is going to talk to you next is that a big part of why I wanted to improve our profitability is to give ourselves the ability to go through what is a somewhat unpredictable and volatile period over the next 5 or 10 years. There are different risk factors that are geopolitical or regulatory or different things, but also the technology landscape is somewhat unknown. And we want the ability to be able to surge investment on things like building out larger training clusters or just making different investments where that's necessary. And in order to make sure that we have the flexibility to do that, we want to make sure that we keep our cost structure to a point where we sort of have some extra space built in. So those are really the 2 points. That was the theme that I laid out at the beginning of the year of efficiency last year: make us a stronger technology company and give us the flexibility and stability to execute the long-term goals. And those remain, I think, the big focuses going forward on that."
META,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T16:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Susan Li,"And I can take the second question, Eric. So we're really continuing to evolve our AI road maps and ambitions and our understanding of the capacity demands that we might have as we train next generations of foundation models and to support all of the associated product development going forward. So the increase in the top end of the range really reflects that evolving understanding of how much demand we may need. And we're also continuing to keep a close eye on supply availability. Where we land in that range is a function of both the supply and demand factors I mentioned. And this continues to be a pretty dynamic planning process for us. And there are also certainly other factors that drive uncertainty. How quickly can we execute on the new data center architecture? How the supply chain turns out to unfold over the course of the year? But our expectation is, generally, that we will need to invest more to support our AI work in the years ahead, and we're seeing some of that reflected in 2024."

META,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T16:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Mark Shmulik,"Mark, you mentioned at the top of the call this vision, kind of everyone having a Meta AI assistant to kind of get things done. Previously, when we were talking about the metaverse from a time horizon perspective, we were looking at a decade to kind of get there. But given kind of the pace of innovation around AI that you've seen, has that time line changed? And like do you think we'll get there quicker? And then second question for Susan. Just quickly on shop ad. I appreciate the color. Obviously, we've had the Amazon partnership news intra-quarter. We know Meta has made a few attempts that are getting kind of more integrated into shopping over the last few years. Can you hear some of the learnings and, I guess, what's different this time around?"
META,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T16:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Sure. I can take the first one. I do think that AI is going to make all of the products and services that we use and make better. So it's hard to know exactly how that will play out. But for the work in Reality Labs, specifically, there's a bunch of areas. Like if you take smart glasses, before, we thought that we would have to build like full displays and holograms and deliver the sense of presence before that became a mainstream product.  And now it seems quite possible that smart glasses that have AI assistance built in will be the killer app, and that the holograms and sense of presence will come later as a -- maybe on the same time horizon we were talking about before but could end up being just as important as we expected. But there could be a big market here even before that. So I think we'll figure that out over the next few years. But yes, I mean, overall, I think the 2 go together pretty hand-in-hand. I would have predicted that a lot of the parts of Reality Labs -- I guess the sequence in technology is sometimes surprising.  We always kind of expected that as part of building glasses or any of these platforms that having an AI assistant would be a foundational part of it. But the fact that that's -- that there have just been big strides in that over the last year or 2 is just -- is a big opportunity for these products sooner. So I think it's still unknown exactly how that will play out, but I think we'll know more over the next few years. It's very exciting, though."
META,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T16:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Susan Li,"And Mark, I can take the second question. So first of all, online commerce continues to be one of our strongest verticals overall. And a lot of the work that we do to improve ads performance generally really helps do things like grow conversions year-over-year, improves the performance of direct response ads. We've invested a lot in the Advantage+ set of tools, tools like Advantage+ Shopping. So I would say that our offerings for e-commerce advertisers overall are very strong, and we continue to invest in making them better and more performant. On Shops ads, specifically, this is an area where we are really, I would say, focusing on introducing improvements that continue to make it easier for businesses to onboard 2 shops. So for example, eligible Shopify businesses can now onboard to Shops on Facebook and Instagram very seamlessly. And we're making it easier for advertisers to turn their existing ads into Shops ads. And we'll continue to focus on deepening integrations with partners and leveraging AI to make Shops ads even more performant. You mentioned the Amazon ads pilot, and that's a place where we're partnering with Amazon to make Buy with Prime, to create a more seamless shopping experience on Facebook and Instagram so that it's easier for people to purchase directly from an Amazon ad. This is really early, and we're testing this experience with them. But it's another avenue for us to explore how can we make these shopping experience easier for folks on our platform."

META,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T16:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Justin Post,"I was wondering if you could help us think about the messaging run rate for revenues and maybe the long-term opportunity and how you think about that going forward on a multiyear basis. And then secondly, the guidance for Q1 suggests stable growth at the midpoint despite comps getting tougher. So I'm wondering if you could help us at all think about -- the comps get increasingly tougher as we go through the year, how you're thinking about those comps and how you could grow in the second half."
META,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T16:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Justin. I can take both of those. So on your first question about messaging monetization, right now, the 2 primary avenues that we have there are click-to-messaging ads and paid messaging, which we are investing a lot in both to facilitate the full cycle of customer engagement. We saw that revenue growth from click-to-message ads remained strong in Q4. We see broadening advertiser adoption. And there, I would say that our focus in terms of where we're investing is really around enhanced optimization and reporting. So we're really trying to drive down funnel performance, enabling businesses to optimize for purchase.  And we've seen strong growth in purchase optimization revenue on click-to-Messenger ads since we've rolled that out. And we're planning to bring purchase optimization to click-to-WhatsApp campaigns this year. And across the click-to-messaging ads, we're introducing more robust reporting to help advertisers kind of understand how people are engaging with them via click-to-messaging ads and what is the value of that engagement. And then, of course, in the longer term, this is a place where we're excited about the opportunities for increased automation to really help businesses scale their ability to have conversations with their consumers. On the paid messaging side, this is much earlier, of course, but we're seeing good momentum, driven by particularly strong growth from marketing messages. And we've also seen good results from our updated pricing model that we introduced in June. And here, we're really focused on making paid messaging easier to buy. So we're now testing the ability for businesses to send paid messaging directly on Meta Ads Manager. And then, again, similar to click-to-messaging, we are investing in ways to make it easier to get more done within the app. So here, we launched Flows globally in October, which enables businesses to offer richer user experiences within WhatsApp, things like selecting a seat on a flight or booking an appointment. We're seeing good early traction, and we're focused on just introducing more ways to help businesses easily create flows, and we'll plan on introducing more capabilities here. So there's a lot, I would say, going on in the portfolio of messaging monetization work that we're doing. Now your second question was around the 2024 outlook. And we obviously have not shared any guidance beyond Q1. But our revenue for the full year is going to be influenced by a number of factors, including macro conditions that are certainly harder to predict the further out you go. And over the course of 2024, as you said, we'll also be lapping periods of increasingly strong demand. So we don't provide guidance beyond Q1. There's certainly a range of outcomes, and we'll have a better read on how we will compare to future quarters as we progress through the year."

Mark, I believe you'd shifted FAIR out of Reality Labs into the Family of Apps. Can you just talk about some of the benefits there of moving that group as you pursue general intelligence? And then Susan, can you just walk us through your thought process on adding a dividend to your capital returns at this stage beyond the share repurchases?"
META,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T16:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"I can talk to the first one. Yes, the whole reason why we moved FAIR is basically to be closer to the GenAI group. They're both research groups. The GenAI group basically builds our Llama launch vehicles and products, but also conducts a fair amount of research, too, especially things that are going to be coming into the upcoming versions of Llama. FAIR is focused on more foundational work and longer-term work. So it's, I'd say, more things that might be a couple of years out to 10-plus years out. And as we -- I guess, here's one way to think about it.  A lot of last year and the work that we're doing with Llama 3 is basically making sure that we can scale our efforts to really produce state-of-the-art models. But once we get past that, there's a lot more kind of different research that I think we're going to be doing that's going to take our foundation models in potentially different directions than other players in the industry are going to go in because we're focused on specific vision for what we're building. So it's really important as we think about what's going to be in Llama 5 or 6 or 7 and what cognitive abilities we want in there and what modalities we want to build into future multimodal versions of the models. We need to be doing that work in advance and to research those things. And it helps to -- and even though FAIR and GenAI will continue to be 2 kind of separate groups on different time horizons.  I think to have some level of alignment between -- on the vision of what we're building between the 2 of them, so that way, the FAIR team can have in mind, hey, if we research this, then maybe it can intercept Llama 6 or something. Then that, I think, is just going to be more helpful for increasing the ambition and focus of all of the work that we do. It's one of the reasons that I talked about. We did open-ended research on AI for a while. But having a clear product target with these AI agents, I think, is really going to help focus the work and give us a feedback loop that's going to increase the productivity and output that we get dramatically."

And we believe introducing a dividend really just serves as a nice complement to the existing share repurchase program. The dividend doesn't change how much we will be -- or it doesn't change the way we determine the total amount of capital we return. And we expect that share repurchases will continue to be the primary way that we return capital to shareholders. But introducing a dividend just gives us a more balanced capital return program and some added flexibility in how we return capital in the future."

I wanted to ask you about Apple opening up its App Store in Europe and maybe what role that might play for Meta in further building out the App Store app install ads and things along those lines. And Susan, as a follow-up to maybe a prior question, you mentioned the potential around business messaging and the team -- what the team is doing around really testing with WhatsApp and Messenger. Just talk just how you might see this unfold maybe with AI Studio and maybe timing would be helpful."

They've made it so onerous, and I think so at odds with the intent of what the EU regulation was that I think it's just going to be very difficult for anyone, including ourselves, to really seriously entertain what they're doing there. Susan, did you want to add anything?"
META,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T16:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Susan Li,"No. I was going to take the second question, I think, which was around the rollout of some of the GenAI features from a monetization perspective. And we're -- first of all, I would say that we don't expect our GenAI products to be a meaningful 2024 driver of revenue. But we certainly expect that they will have the potential to be meaningful contributors over time. Right now, the most near-term monetization opportunity is with our ad creative tools. We've talked about some of the places that we've been rolling those features out broadly with Text Variations and Image Expansion now globally available. And we're seeing those tools receive adoption and provide real value for advertisers even at this early stage. And we're going to keep investing in making those more useful and performant, which then leads to more advertiser adoption, and that can be sort of a virtuous feedback loop. Over a longer time frame, the GenAI features that we're bringing to business messaging, which I think was where your question originated, we think really represents a compelling opportunity. We're testing AI chats on a very small scale today with a few businesses, but it will take time to continue making those AIs increasingly useful. We're hearing good feedback from the businesses testing them, and we expect to make progress this year as we expand our tests further. I'd say one other thing is just on the consumer side, again, we think GenAI can make it easier for people to produce compelling content across all of our apps, including our messaging apps. And our AI assistant certainly provides also added utilities. So in all of these areas, I would say, we're following our typical playbook of testing and tuning the experiences until they're very good, and then we'll invest in growth and eventually explore monetization."

You talked about rapid iteration of that, given your large audience. So yes, I guess, what's going on, thus far? Which of the apps in the Family of Apps have seen engagement increase from Meta AI? And do you think that there could be increased commercial activity as either your AI agent or some of the other ones out there get more usage within your apps?"
META,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T16:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes. I think having a good assistant is going to be one of the real values that this generation of AI creates as well as giving every creator an opportunity to have an assistant or agent that people can engage with and every business and agent and also allowing people to create a bunch of quirky and fun things as well. But yes, I think Meta AI is going to be very important across the product. It currently is available in some countries in WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram. It's at the phase where we're not really pushing it super proactively. We've sort of made it available, and as people use it, we're learning from how -- what are the basic ways that people want to engage with it. We're currently in the tuning phase on this. I mean, we started rolling this out, I think, it was in November or so, maybe October.  And I would expect that, over the course of this year, we are going to start rolling this out much more prominently across our apps. And that was sort of what I was saying in my opening remarks about the analogy to Stories, where we ran a bunch of experiments, put it out there, got feedback and then eventually did a lot of integrations, even to the point where people were making jokes about us putting Stories in settings, which, for the record, never happened, but I found funny. So I think that we're going to be on that journey this year. We're basically in the learning and tuning phase now. I'm happy with how that's going. We're currently working on and planning the next set of integrations and places where this is going to be available to people across the products, and I'm really looking forward to that. And I think that's going to be one of the big themes for '24 for us."

META,2024-04-24,2024-04-25,,2024-04-24,2024-04-24T12:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-24,prepared,,Mark Zuckerberg,"All right. Thanks, Ken, and everyone, thanks for joining. It's been a good start to the year, both in terms of product momentum and business performance. We estimate that more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of our apps each day, and we're seeing healthy growth in the U.S. And I want to call out WhatsApp specifically, where the number of daily actives and message sends in the U.S. keeps gaining momentum, and I think we're on a good path there. We've also made good progress on our AI and metaverse efforts, and that's where I'm going to focus most of my comments today. So let's start with AI. We're building a number of different AI services, from Meta AI, our AI assistant that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses, to creator AIs that help creators engage their communities and that fans can interact with, to business AIs that we think every business eventually on our platform will use to help customers buy things and get customer support to internal coding and development AIs to hardware like glasses for people to interact with AIs and a lot more. Last week, we had the major release of our new version of Meta AI that is now powered by our latest model, Llama 3. And our goal with Meta AI is to build the world's leading AI service, both in quality and usage. The initial rollout of Meta AI is going well. Tens of millions of people have already tried it. The feedback is very positive. And when I first checked in with our teams, the majority of feedback we were getting was people asking us to release Meta AI for them wherever they are. So we've started launching Meta AI in some English speaking countries, and we'll roll out in more languages and countries over the coming months. You all know our product development playbook by this point. We release an early version of a product to a limited audience to gather feedback and start improving it, and then once we think it's ready, then we make it available to more people. That early release was last fall and with this release, we are now moving to that next growth phase of our playbook. We believe that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use. And now that we have the superior quality product, we are making it easier for lots of people to use it within WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and Facebook. Now in addition to answering more complex queries, a few other notable and unique features from this release. Meta AI now creates animations from still images and now generates high-quality images so fast that it can create and update them as you are typing, which is pretty awesome. I've seen a lot of people commenting about that experience online and how they've never seen or experienced anything like it before. In terms of the core AI model and intelligence that's powering Meta AI, I'm very pleased with how Llama 3 has come together so far. The 8 billion and 70 billion parameter models that we released are best-in-class for their scale. The 400-plus billion parameter model that we're still training seems on track to be industry leading on several benchmarks. And I expect that our models are just going to improve further from open source contributions. Overall, I view the results our teams have achieved here as another key milestone in showing that we have the talent, data and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world's leading AI models and services. And this leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world. As we're scaling CapEx and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently. But realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products. I think it's worth calling that out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook, where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it. We saw this with Reels, Stories as newsfeed transition to mobile and more. And I also expect to see a multiyear investment cycle before we fully scale Meta AI, business AIs and more into the profitable services I expect as well. Historically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us. And the initial signs are quite positive here, too. But building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps, and this is likely going to take several years. On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those, AI is already helping us improve app engagement, which naturally leads to seeing more ads and improving ads directly to deliver more value. So if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time. We're seeing good progress on some of these efforts already. Right now, about 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by our AI recommendation system. That's up 2x over the last couple of years. And for the first time ever, more than 50% of the content that people see on Instagram is now AI recommended. AI has also been a huge part of how we create value for advertisers by showing people more relevant ads. And if you look at our 2 end-to-end AI-powered tools, Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app campaigns, revenue flowing through those has more than doubled since last year. We're also going to continue to be very focused on efficiency as we scale Meta AI and other AI services. Some of this will come from improving how we train and run models. Some improvements will come from the open source community, and we're improving cost efficiency is one of the main areas that I expect that open sourcing will help us improve similar to what we saw with Open Compute. We'll also keep making progress on building more of our own silicon. Our Meta training and inference accelerator chip has successfully enabled us to run some of our recommendations-related workloads on this less expensive stack. And as this program matures over the coming years, we plan to expand this to more of our workloads as well. And of course, as we ramp these investments, we will also continue to carefully manage headcount and other expense growth throughout the company. Now in addition to our work on AI, our other long-term focus is the metaverse. It's been interesting to see how these 2 themes have come together. This is clearest when you look at glasses. I used to think that AR glasses wouldn't really be a mainstream product until we had full holographic displays -- and I still think that, that's going to be awesome and is the long-term mature state for the product. But now it seems pretty clear that there's also a meaningful market for fashionable AI glasses without a display. Glasses are the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you hear. So they have full context on what's going on around you as they help you with whatever you're trying to do. Our launch this week of Meta AI with Vision on the glasses is a good example where you can now ask questions about things that you're looking at. Now one strategy dynamic that I've been reflecting on is that an increasing amount of our Reality Labs work is going towards serving our AI efforts. We currently report on our financials as if Family of Apps and Reality Labs were 2 completely separate businesses, but strategically, I think of them as fundamentally the same business with the vision of Reality Labs to build the next generation of computing platforms in large part so that we can build the best apps and experiences on top of them. Over time, we'll need to find better ways to articulate the value that's generated here across both segments so it doesn't just seem like our hardware costs increase as our glasses ecosystem scales, but all the value flows to a different segment. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses that we built with Essilor Luxottica continue to do well and are sold out in many styles and colors. So we're working to make more and release additional styles as quickly as we can. We just released the new cat-eye Skyler design yesterday, which is more feminine. And in general, I'm optimistic about our approach of starting with the classics and expanding with an increasing diversity of options over time. If we want everyone to be able to use wearable AI, I think eyewear is a bit different from phones or watches in that people are going to want very different designs. So I think our approach of partnering with the leading eyewear brands will help us serve more of the market. I think a similar open ecosystem approach will help us expand the virtual and mixed reality headset market over time as well. We announced that we're opening up Meta Horizon OS, the operating system we've built to power Quest. As the ecosystem grows, I think there will be sufficient diversity in how people use mixed reality, that there will be demand for more designs than we'll be able to build. For example, a work-focused headset may be slightly less designed for motion but may -- you want to be lighter by connecting to your laptop; a fitness-focused headset may be lighter with sweat-wicking materials; an entertainment-focused headset may prioritize the highest resolution displays over everything else; a gaming-focused headset may prioritize peripherals and haptics or a device that comes with Xbox controllers and a game pass subscription out of the box. Now to be clear, I think that our first-party Quest devices will continue to be the most popular headsets as we see today, and we'll continue focusing on advancing the state-of-the-art tech and making it accessible to everyone. But I also think that opening our ecosystem and opening our operating system will help the overall mixed reality ecosystem grow even faster. Now in addition to AI and the metaverse, we're seeing good improvements across our apps. I touched on some of the most important trends already with WhatsApp growth in the U.S. and AI-powered recommendations in our feeds and reels already. But I do want to mention that video continues to be a bright spot. This month, we launched an updated full-screen video player on Facebook that brings together reels, longer videos and live content into a single experience with a unified recommendation system. On Instagram, reels and video continue to drive engagement, with reels alone now making up 50% of the time that's spent within the app. Threads is growing well, too. There are now more than 150 million monthly actives, and it continues to generally be on the trajectory that I hoped to see. And of course, my daughters would want me to mention that Taylor Swift is now on Threads, that one was a big deal in my house. All right. That is what I wanted to cover today. I am proud of the progress we've made so far this year. We've got a lot more execution ahead to fulfill the opportunities ahead of us. A big thank you to all of our teams who are driving all these advances and to all of you for being on this journey with us. And now here is Susan."
META,2024-04-24,2024-04-25,,2024-04-24,2024-04-24T12:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-24,prepared,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $36.5 billion, up 27% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Q1 total expenses were $22.6 billion, up 6% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 9% as higher infrastructure-related costs were partially offset by lapping Reality Labs' inventory-related valuation adjustments. R&D increased 6%, driven mostly by higher headcount-related expenses and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Marketing and sales decreased 16% due mainly to lower restructuring costs, professional services and marketing spend. G&A increased 20% as higher legal-related expenses were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. We ended the first quarter with over 69,300 employees, up 3% from Q4. First quarter operating income was $13.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 13%. Net income was $12.4 billion or $4.71 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $6.7 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $12.5 billion. We repurchased $14.6 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt. Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, with approximately 3.2 billion people using at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March. Q1 total Family of Apps revenue was $36 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $35.6 billion, up 27% or 26% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by gaming and entertainment and media. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and Europe at 40% and 33%, respectively. Asia Pacific grew 25% and North America grew 22%. In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 20%, and the average price per ad increased 6%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia Pacific and Rest of World. Pricing growth was driven by advertiser demand, which was partially offset by strong impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing regions and services. Family of Apps other revenue was $380 million in Q1, up 85%, driven by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp business platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q1, Family of Apps expenses were $18.4 billion, representing approximately 81% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 7% due mainly to higher legal and infrastructure costs that were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Family of Apps operating income was $17.7 billion, representing a 49% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $440 million, up 30%, driven by Quest headset sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year as higher head count-related expenses were more than offset by lapping inventory-related valuation adjustments and restructuring costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $3.8 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are 2 primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, we remain pleased with engagement trends and have strong momentum across our product priorities. Our investments in developing increasingly advanced recommendation systems continue to drive incremental engagement on our platform, demonstrating that people are finding added value by discovering content from accounts they are not connected to. The level of recommended content in our apps has scaled as we've improved these systems, and we see further opportunity to increase the relevance and personalization of recommendations as we advance our models. Video also continues to grow across our platform, and it now represents more than 60% of time on both Facebook and Instagram. Reels remains the primary driver of that growth, and we're progressing on our work to bring together Reel's longer-form video and live video into one experience on Facebook. In April, we rolled out this unified video experience in the U.S. and Canada, which is increasingly powered by our next-generation ranking architecture that we expect will help deliver more relevant video recommendations over time. We're also introducing deeper integrations of generative AI into our apps in the U.S. and more than a dozen other countries. Along with using Meta AI within our chat surfaces, people will now be able to use Meta AI in search within our apps as well as feed and groups on Facebook. We expect these integrations will complement our social discovery strategy as our recommendation systems help people to discover and explore their interests, while Meta AI enables them to dive deeper on topics they're interested in. Threads also continues to see good traction as we continue to ship valuable features and scale the community. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. There are 2 parts to this work. The first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. Here, we continue to advance our understanding of users' preferences for viewing ads to more effectively optimize the right time, place and person to show an ad to. For example, we are getting better at adjusting the placement and number of ads in real time based on our perception of a user's interest and ad content and to minimize disruption from ads as well as innovating on new and creative ad formats. We expect to continue that work going forward, while surfaces with relatively lower levels of monetization, like video and messaging, will serve as additional growth opportunities. The second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance. Similar to our work with organic recommendations, AI is playing an increasing role in these efforts. First, we are making ongoing ads modeling improvements that are delivering better performance for advertisers. One example is our new ads ranking architecture, Meta Lattice, which we began rolling out more broadly last year. This new architecture allows us to run significantly larger models that generalize learnings across objectives and surfaces in place of numerous smaller ad models that have historically been optimized for individual objectives and surfaces. This is not only leading to increased efficiency as we operate fewer models but also improving ad performance. Another way we're leveraging AI is to provide increased automation for advertisers. Through our Advantage+ portfolio, advertisers can automate one step of the campaign setup process, such as selecting which ad creative to show, or automate their campaign completely using our end-to-end automation tools, Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app ads. We're seeing growing use of these solutions, and we expect to drive further adoption over the course of the year while applying what we learned to our broader ads investments. Next, I'd like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. We continue to see compelling investment opportunities to both improve our core business in the near term and capture significant longer-term opportunities in generative AI and Reality Labs. As we develop more advanced and compute-intensive recommendation models and scale capacity for our generative AI training and inference needs, we expect that having sufficient infrastructure capacity will be critical to realizing many of these opportunities. As a result, we expect that we will invest significantly more in infrastructure over the coming years. Our other long-term initiatives that we're continuing to make significant investments in is Reality Labs. We are also starting to see our AI initiatives increasingly overlap with our Reality Labs work. For example, with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, people in the U.S. and Canada can now use our multimodal Meta AI assistant for daily tasks without pulling out their phone. Longer term, we expect generative AI to play an increasing role in our mixed reality products, making it easier to develop immersive experiences. Accelerating our AI efforts will help ensure we can provide the best version of our services as we transition to the next computing platform. We expect to pursue these opportunities while maintaining a focus on operating discipline, and we believe our strong financial position will allow us to support these investments while also returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. We also have a jury trial scheduled for June in a suit brought by the state of Texas regarding our use of facial recognition technology, which could ultimately result in a material loss. Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect second quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5 billion to $39 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96 million to $99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94 million to $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem. Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30 billion to $37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI road map. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect CapEx will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In closing, Q1 was a good start to the year. We're seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer-term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years. With that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions."
META,2024-04-24,2024-04-25,,2024-04-24,2024-04-24T12:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-24,qa,speaker_line_contains_cue,Operator,[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs.
META,2024-04-24,2024-04-25,,2024-04-24,2024-04-24T12:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-24,qa,,Eric Sheridan,"Maybe I'll ask a two-parter. Mark, you used the analogy of other investments cycles you've been through around products like Stories and Reels. I know you're not giving long-term guidance today, but using those analogies, how should investors think about the length and depth of this investment cycle with respect to either AI and/or Reality Labs more broadly and mixed reality? And you both talked about the impact AI is having on the advertising ecosystem. What are you watching for in terms of adoption or utility on the consumer side to know that AI adoption is tracking along with the investment cycle?"
META,2024-04-24,2024-04-25,,2024-04-24,2024-04-24T12:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-24,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes. In terms of the timing, I think it's somewhat difficult to extrapolate from previous cycles. But I guess like the main thing that we see is that we will usually take, I don't know, a couple of years, I mean, it could be a little more, it could be less to focus on building out and scaling the products. And we typically don't focus that much on monetization of the new areas until they reach significant scale because it's so much higher leverage for us just to improve monetization on other things before these new products are at scale. So you enter this period where I think kind of smart investors see that the product is scaling and that there's a clear monetizable opportunity there even before the revenue materializes. And I think we've seen that with Reels and with Stories and with the shift to mobile and all these things, where basically, we build out the inventory first for a period of time and then we monetize it. And during that time, when it's scaling, sometimes it's not just the case that we're not making money from that thing. It can often actually be the case that it displaces other revenue from other things. So like you saw with Reels, I mean, it scaled and there was a period where it was not profitable for us as it was scaling before it became profitable. So I think that's more the analogy that I'm making on this. But I think it's -- what that suggests is that what we should all be focused on for the next period is as the consumer products scale, Meta AI really just launched in a meaningful way so we don't have any kind of hard stats to share on that. But I'd say that's the main thing that I'm focused on for this year and probably a lot of next year is growing that product and the other AI products and the engagement around them. And I think we should all have quite a bit of confidence that if those are on a good track to scale, then they're going to end up being very large businesses. So that's the main point that I was trying to make there."
META,2024-04-24,2024-04-25,,2024-04-24,2024-04-24T12:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-24,qa,,Operator,Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
META,2024-04-24,2024-04-25,,2024-04-24,2024-04-24T12:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-24,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Thanks for taking my questions, I have 2. The first one is on sort of the recommendation engine improvements and even, Susan, when you talked about further opportunities to increase the relevance of the models. Could you just unpack that a little bit for us? Can you give us examples of where you're still running the model in a suboptimal basis or opportunities for improved signal capture use or data you're not using? Where are sort of the areas of improvement you see from here? And then the second one, when you talk about driving incremental adoption of AI tools for advertisers, what are sort of some of the main gating factors you've encountered to get advertisers to test these tools? And how do you think about sort of addressing that throughout '24 and '25?"
META,2024-04-24,2024-04-25,,2024-04-24,2024-04-24T12:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-24,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Brian. So to your first question, where are there more opportunities for us to leverage and improve our recommendations models to drive engagement? One of the things I would say is, historically, each of our recommendation products, including Reels, in-feed recommendations, et cetera, has had their own AI model. And recently, we've been developing a new model architecture with the aim for it to power multiple recommendations products. We started partially validating this model last year by using it to power Facebook Reels. And we saw meaningful performance gains, 8% to 10% increases in watch time as a result of deploying this. This year, we're actually planning to extend the singular model architecture to recommend content across not just Facebook Reels, but also Facebook's video tab as well. So while it's still too early to share specific results, we're optimistic that the new model architecture will unlock increasingly relevant video recommendations over time. And if it's successful, we'll explore using it to power other recommendations. And analog exists, I would say, on the ad side. We've talked a little bit about the new model architecture Meta Lattice that we deployed last year that consolidates smaller and more specialized models into larger models that can better learn what characteristics improve ad performance across multiple services, like feed and Reels and multiple types of ads and objectives at the same time. And that's driven improved ad performance over the course of 2023 as we deployed it across Facebook and Instagram to support multiple objectives. And over the course of 2024, we expect to further enhance model performance and include support for even more objectives like web and app and ROAS. So there's a lot of work that we're investing in, in the underlying model architecture for both organic engagement and ads that we expect is going to continue to deliver increasing ads performance over time. The second question you asked was around getting advertisers to test and adopt gen AI tools. There are 2 flavors of this. The more near-term version is around the gen AI ad creative features that we have put into our ads creation tools. And it's early, but we're seeing adoption of these features across verticals and different advertiser sizes. In particular, we've seen outsized adoption of image expansion with small businesses, and this will remain a big area of focus for us in 2024, and I expect that improvements to our underlying foundation models will enhance the quality of the outputs that are generated and support new features on the road map. But right now, we have features supporting text variations, image expansion and background generation, and we're continuing to work to make those more performant for advertisers to create more personalized ads at scale. The longer-term piece here is around business AIs. We have been testing the ability for businesses to set up AIs for business messaging that represent them in chats with customers, starting by supporting shopping use cases such as responding to people asking for more information on a product or its availability. So this is very, very early. We've been testing this with a handful of businesses on Messenger and WhatsApp, and we're hearing good feedback with businesses saying that the AIs have saved them significant time while customer -- consumers noted more timely response times. And we're also learning a lot from these tests to make these AIs more performant over time as well. So we'll be expanding these tests over the coming months, and we'll continue to take our time here to get it right before we make it more broadly available."
META,2024-04-24,2024-04-25,,2024-04-24,2024-04-24T12:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-24,qa,,Operator,Your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik from Bernstein Research.
META,2024-04-24,2024-04-25,,2024-04-24,2024-04-24T12:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-24,qa,,Mark Shmulik,"I guess back to that product playbook that we talked about a few times, with kind of Reels now such a large share of kind of time spent on Instagram and Facebook, how do we think about the next leg of kind of monetization growth from here? In particular, as we kind of get back to kind of shopping on platform or other ways to monetize, any color there on the road map kind of just beyond ad insertion from here? And then, Susan, just on the ad market, in particular, previously, we heard a lot about kind of Chinese-based advertiser contribution. Any color you could share there on kind of how that spend is trending?"
META,2024-04-24,2024-04-25,,2024-04-24,2024-04-24T12:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-24,qa,,Susan Li,"Sure. Thanks, Mark. So Reels revenue continued to grow across Instagram and Facebook in Q1, and that's driven both by higher engagement and increased monetization efficiency through our ads ranking and delivery improvements. And we -- as we've mentioned before, we don't plan on quantifying the impact from Reels going forward, but it remains a positive contributor to overall revenue. And we expect that there are going to be opportunities for us to continue improving performance and growing supply. So on the performance improvements, we are investing in ongoing ranking improvements. We're continuing to make ads easier and more intuitive to interact with through work like optimizing call to actions and post-click experiences, which are especially important for DR performance. And we're also optimizing ads to feel more native to Reels. In Q1, we rolled out our gen AI image expansion tools across Facebook and Instagram Reels after having introduced it to Instagram feed in Q4, and we're seeing, again, outsized adoption with small businesses. So we're excited about the opportunities to continue making these ads more performant. And even though ads -- the Reels ad loads, sorry, has increased over the last year, it remains lower on a per time basis than both Feed and Stories. So we're going to continue to look for opportunities to thoughtfully grow it in the future and invest in creative ways to address the structural supply constraints of the Reels format being more video-heavy, including higher density experiences and formats and increasingly personalizing ad loads, which we think will make sure that we're really putting ads in front of people when they're most likely to be interested and engaged with them. The second question you asked was around China. Growth in spend from China advertisers remained strong in Q1. This was driven by online commerce and gaming, and it's reflected in our Asia Pacific advertisers segment, which remained the fastest-growing region, at 41% year-over-year in Q1. Now we did see strength across other geographies as well, including a 6-point acceleration in total revenue growth from North America advertisers. So I would say that we aren't quantifying the Q1 contribution from China, and we don't have forward-looking expectations to share on quarterly China-based ad revenue, but I will say that we are lapping periods of increasingly strong demand over the course of 2024 given the recovery of China-based advertisers in 2023 from their prior pandemic-driven headwinds."

And is there anything you're more cautious about in revenue in the ad market? And is the AI opportunity just even bigger, and therefore, requiring more investment than expected? And then, Susan, can you also just comment on how you're thinking about that ability to sustain growth rates over the next few quarters as you face tougher comps off a big base of ad dollars?"
META,2024-04-24,2024-04-25,,2024-04-24,2024-04-24T12:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-24,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes, I can speak to the first one. I think we've gotten more optimistic and ambitious on AI. So previously, I think that our work in this -- I mean when you were looking at last year, when we released Llama 2, we were very excited about the model and thought that, that was going to be the basis to be able to build a number of things that were valuable that integrated into our social products. But now I think we're in a pretty different place. So with the latest models, we're not just building good AI models that are going to be capable of building some new good social and commerce products. I actually think we're in a place where we've shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world. And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just ones that are the most obvious ones for us. So that's -- this is what I was trying to refer to in my opening remarks where I just view the success that we've seen with the way that Llama 3 and Meta AI have come together as a real validation technically that we have the talent, the data and the ability to scale infrastructure to do leading work here. And with Meta AI, I think that we are on our path to having Meta AI be the most used and best AI assistant in the world, which I think is going to be enormously valuable. So all of that basically encourages me to make sure that we're investing to stay at the leading edge of this. And we're doing that at the time when we're also scaling the product before it is making money. So that's the analogy that I was making before, which is we've gone through some of those cycles before. But fundamentally, I think if you look at the facts of what our team is able to produce, I think it just -- our optimism and ambition have just grown quite a bit, and I think that this is just going to end up being quite an important set of products for us. So it was already going to be. Now I think it has the potential to be even more important."

And obviously, our revenue for the full year will be influenced by many factors, including macro conditions and things that are harder to predict the further out you go. And of course, over the course of 2024, we will also be lapping periods of increasingly strong demand. With that said, we expect to see good opportunities to continue growing engagement across our products, driven by the investments we made in AI-based content recommendations, our ongoing video work. And we also expect that we will continue to drive ads performance gains and continue to make our ads sort of more effective and deliver increasing value to advertisers. One thing I'd share, for example, is that we actually grew conversions at a faster rate than we grew impressions over the course of this quarter. So we are -- we're expecting to -- which basically suggests that our conversion grade is growing and is one of the ways in which our ads are becoming more performant. So I feel like there's a lot of opportunity for us, both with our organic engagement growth and with continuing to make the ads better and to continue driving more results for advertisers."

Is there any way you could kind of use some of the metaverse spend over into AI? Are they converging and kind of use some of the money from the other areas to kind of fund the AI? And then second, longer-term investors are very focused on returns on capital. Obviously, great returns on CapEx in the past with your margins today. How do we think about the returns on the capital you're spending? How are you thinking about it, I guess, going forward 2, 3 years out?"
META,2024-04-24,2024-04-25,,2024-04-24,2024-04-24T12:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-24,qa,,Susan Li,"So on the -- I would say -- well, I can start with the second part, and then I'll defer to Mark on the first one. In terms of measuring the ROI on our CapEx investments, we've broadly categorized our AI investments into 2 buckets. I think of them as sort of core AI work and then strategic bets, which would include gen AI and the advanced research efforts to support that. And those are just really at different stages as it relates to being able to measure the return and drive revenue for our business. So with our core AI work, we continue to have a very ROI-driven approach to investment, and we're still seeing strong returns as improvements to both engagement and ad performance have translated into revenue gains. Now the second area, strategic bets, is where we are much earlier. Mark has talked about the potential that we believe we have to create significant value for our business in a number of areas, including opportunities to build businesses that don't exist on us today. But we'll need to invest ahead of that opportunity to develop more advanced models and to grow the usage of our products before they drive meaningful revenue. So while there is tremendous long-term potential, we're just much earlier on the return curve than with our core AI work. What I'll say though is we're also building our systems in a way that gives us fungibility in how we use our capacity so we can flex it across different use cases as we identify what are the best opportunities to put that infrastructure toward."

I would say, broadly, we actually are doing that in a lot of places in terms of shifting resources from other areas, whether it's compute resources or different things in order to advance the AI efforts. For Reality Labs specifically, I'm still really optimistic about building these new computing platforms long term. I mentioned in my remarks upfront that one of the bigger areas that we're investing in Reality Labs is glasses. We think that that's going to be a really important platform for the future. Our outlook for that, I think, has improved quite a bit because previously, we thought that, that would need to wait until we have these full holographic displays to be a large market. And now we're a lot more focused on the glasses that we're delivering in partnership with Ray-Ban, which I think are going really well. And -- so that, I think, has the ability to be a pretty meaningful and growing platform sooner than I would have expected. So it is true that more of the Reality Labs work, like I said, is sort of focused on the AI goals as well. But I still think that we should focus on building these long-term platforms, too."

And then, in particular, what do you say to people who believe that this is potentially a slippery slope in terms of the government picking up -- picking winners and losers? And Susan, how big is Advantage+ in terms of the spend on the platform and just in terms of its impact on overall CPM stabilizing?"

We've obviously been following the events related to TikTok closely, but at this stage, it is just too early, I think, to assess its impact or what it would mean for our business. To your second question on Advantage+, we're continuing to see good traction across our Advantage+ portfolio, including both with solutions, I mentioned this, that automate individual steps of a campaign creation setup as well as ones that automate the full end-to-end process. So on the single-step automation, Advantage+ audience, for example, has seen significant growth in adoption since we made it the default audience creation experience for most advertisers in Q4. And that enables advertisers to increase campaign performance by just using audience inputs as a suggestion rather than a hard constraint. And based on tests that we ran, campaigns using Advantage+ audience targeting saw, on average, a 28% decrease in cost per click or per objective compared to using our regular targeting. On the end-to-end automation products like Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app campaigns, we're also seeing very strong growth. Mark mentioned the combined revenue flowing through those 2 has more than doubled since last year. And we think there's still significant runway to broaden adoption, so we're trying to enable more conversion types for Advantage+ shopping. In Q1, we began expanding the list of conversions that businesses could optimize for. So previously, it only supported purchase events, and now we've added 10 additional conversion types. And we're continuing to see strong adoption now across verticals. So generally, I would say we are building a lot more functionality into the Advantage+ tools over time. also where a lot of our gen AI ads creative features have been introduced and where advertisers have the opportunity to experiment with those. And we'll keep looking to apply what we learn from these products more broadly to our ads investments over the course of the year."

On the second part of your question first, so on the G&A side, that was really driven by legal expenses. We recognized some accruals in Q1 related to ongoing legal matters, and you'll see more detail on that in the 10-Q. On the first part of your question, which is really about sort of the kind of long-term margin profile of Family of Apps, we aren't giving guidance on that per se. But one of the things that we really have been very disciplined about over the course of 2023 and continuing is really operating the business in a very efficiency oriented way. So we're being very disciplined with allocation of new resources. This is a muscle that we really built over 2023 that we believe is important for us to keep carrying forward. And I think you'll see us continue to emphasize that, especially with the Family of Apps business being at the scale that it is."

So I guess stepping back, do you think that Meta AI longer term could bring in search advertising dollars at some point? Or do you view this as what others are doing, where you kind of attach a premium subscription tier once people kind of get going on it? And then the second question is, you mentioned that you guys are working on building AI tools for businesses and creators. So just, I guess, how do you see the business model evolving when we all get to the stage of interacting with something like Taylor Swift's custom AI for merchandise or tickets or something like that. How is that going to play out?"
META,2024-04-24,2024-04-25,,2024-04-24,2024-04-24T12:00:00-04:00,0,2024-04-24,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"All right. So yes, on the Google and Microsoft partnerships, yes, I mean we work with them to have real-time information in Meta AI. It's useful. I think it's pretty different from search. We're not working on search ads or anything like that. I think this will end up being a pretty different business. I do think that there will be an ability to have ads and paid content in Meta AI interactions over time as well as people being able to pay for whether it's bigger models or more compute or some of the premium features and things like that. But that's all very early in fleshing out. The thing that I actually think is probably -- the biggest clear opportunity is all the work around business messaging. That's in addition to the stuff that we're already doing, just generate to increase engagement and ads quality in the apps. But business messaging thing, I mean, whether it's a creator or one of the 100-plus million businesses on our platform, we basically want to make it very easy for all of these folks to set up an AI to engage with their community. For a business, that's going to be able to do sales and commerce and customer support. And I think it will be similar for creators, although there will be more of a kind of just fun and engaging part there, but a lot of creators are on the platform because they see this as a business too, whether they're trying to sell concert tickets or products or whatever it is that their business goal is. And a lot of these folks either aren't advertising as much as they could or, in business, the business messaging parts, I think, are still relatively undermonetized compared to where they will be. And I think a lot of that is because the cost of engaging with people in messaging is still very high. But AI should bring that down just dramatically for businesses and creators. And I think that, that has the potential. That's probably the -- beyond just increasing engagement and increasing the quality of the ads, I think that, that's probably one of the nearer-term opportunities, even though that will -- it's not like next quarter or the quarter after that scaling thing, but it's -- but that's not like a 5-year opportunity either. So I think -- that is one that I think is going to be pretty exciting to look at. But yes, I mean, as Meta AI scales too, I think that, that will have its own opportunities to monetize, and we'll build that out over time. But like I tried to emphasize, we're in the phase of this where the main goal is getting many hundreds of millions or billions of people to use Meta AI as a core part of what they do. That's the kind of next goal, building something that is super valuable. We think this has the potential to be at a very large scale. And that's sort of the next step on the journey."

And we're seeing that in the experience for a few days of Meta AI. So can you just talk to us maybe how the $400 billion parameter model just might evolve the experience on Meta or how you think things might change over the next, call it, months, years, et cetera, as maybe messaging becomes a greater focus and things along those lines? So just a vision longer term."

I mean I think that the next phase for a lot of these things are handling more complex tasks and becoming more like agents rather than just chat bots, right? So when I say chatbot, what I mean is you send it a message and it replies to your message, right? So it's almost like almost a 1:1 correspondence. Whereas what an agent is going to do is you give it an intent or a goal, then it goes off and probably actually performs many queries on its own in the background in order to help accomplish your goal, whether that goal is researching something online or eventually finding the right thing that you're looking to buy. There's a lot of complexity and sort of different things. I think people don't even realize that they will be able to ask computers to do for them. And I think basically, the larger models and then the more advanced future versions that will be smaller as well are just going to enable much more interesting interactions like that. So I mean if you think about this, I mean, even some of the business use cases that we talked about, you don't really just want like sales or customer support chatbot that can just respond to what you say. And if you're a business, you have a goal, right? You're trying to support your customers well and you're trying to position your products in a certain way and encourage people to buy certain things that map to their interests and would they be interested in? And that's more of like a multiturn interaction, right? So the type of business agent that you're going to be able to enable with just a chatbot is going to be very naive compared to what we're going to have in a year even, but beyond that, too, is just the reasoning and planning abilities if these things grow to be able to just help guide people through the business process of engaging with whatever your goals are as a creator of a business. So I think that that's going to be extremely powerful. And I think the opportunity is really big. So -- and on top of that, I think what we've shown now is that we have the ability to build leading models in our company. So I think it makes sense to go for it, and we're going to. And I think it's going to be a really good long-term investment. But I did just want to spell out on this call today, the extent to which we're focusing on this and investing in this for the long term because that's what we do."

This was a strong quarter for our community and business. We estimate that there are now more than 3.2 billion people using at least one of our apps each day. The growth we're seeing here in the US has especially been a bright spot. WhatsApp now serves more than 100 million monthly actives in the US, and we're seeing good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads as well, both in the US, and globally. I'm particularly pleased with the progress that we're making with young adults on Facebook. The numbers we are seeing, especially in the US, really go against the public narrative around who's using the app. A couple of years ago, we started focusing our apps more on 18 to 29 year olds and it's good to see that those efforts are driving good results. Another bright spot is Threads which is about to hit 200 million monthly actives. We're making steady progress towards building what looks like it's going to be another major social app. And we are seeing deeper engagement, and I'm quite pleased with the trajectory here. The big theme right now is, of course, AI. And I'll focus my comments today on three areas. What AI means for our family of apps and core business. What new AI experiences and opportunities we see, and how AI is shaping our metaverse work. So let's start. Across Facebook and Instagram, advances in AI continue to improve the quality of recommendations and drive engagement. And we keep finding that as we develop more general recommendation models, content recommendations get better. In this quarter, we rolled out our full screen video player and unified video recommendation service across Facebook, bringing Reels, longer videos, and live into a single experience. And this has allowed us to extend our unified AI systems, which had already increased engagement on Facebook Reels more than our initial move from CPUs to GPUs did. Over time I'd like to see us move towards a single unified recommendation system that powers all of the content including things like people you may know, across all of our surfaces. We're not there yet. They're still upside, and we're making good progress here. AI is also going to significantly evolve our services for advertisers in some exciting ways. It used to be that advertisers came to us with a specific audience they wanted to reach, like a certain age group, geography, or interests. Eventually, we got to the point where our ad systems could better predict who would be interested than the advertisers could themselves. But today, advertisers still need to develop creative themselves. And in the coming years, AI will be able to generate creative for advertisers as well. And we'll also be able to personalize it as people see it. Over the long term, advertisers will basically just be able to tell us a business objective and a budget, and we're going to go do the rest for them. We're going to get there incrementally over time, but I think this is going to be a very big deal. Moving on to some of the brand new experiences that AI enables, last quarter we started broadly rolling out our assistant Meta AI, and it is on track to achieve our goal of becoming the most used AI assistant by the end of the year. We have an exciting roadmap ahead of things that we want to add, but the bottom-line here is that Meta AI feels like it is on track to be an important service and it's improving quickly both in intelligence and features. Some of the use cases are utilitarian like searching for information or role-playing difficult conversations before you have them with another person and other uses are more creative like the new imagine yourself feature that lets you create images of yourself doing whatever you want in whatever style you want and part of the beauty of AI is that it's general. So we're still uncovering the wide range of use cases that it's valuable for. An important part of our vision is that we're not just creating a single AI, but enabling lots of people to create their own AIs. And this week we launched AI Studio, which lets anyone create AIs to interact with across our apps. I think the creators are especially going to find this quite valuable. There are millions of creators across our apps, and these are people who want to engage more with their communities, and their communities want to engage more with them, but there are only so many hours in the day. So now they are going to be able to use AI Studio to create AI agents that can channel them to chat with their community, answer people's questions, create content and more. So I'm quite excited about this. But this goes beyond creators too. Anyone is going to be able to build their own AIs based on their interests or different topics that they are going to be able to engage with or share with their friends. Business AIs are the other big piece here. We're still in Alpha testing with more and more businesses. The feedback we're getting is positive so far. Over time, I think that just like every business has a website, a social media presence, and an email address, in the future I think that every business is also going to have an AI agent that their customers can interact with. And our goal is to make it easy for every small business, eventually every business, to pull all of their content and catalog into an AI agent that drives sales and saves them money. When this is working at scale, I think that this is going to dramatically accelerate our business messaging revenue. There are a lot of other new opportunities here that I'm excited about too, but I'll save those for another day when we're ready to roll them out. The engine that powers all these new experiences is the Llama family of foundation models. In this quarter we released Llama 3.1 which includes the first frontier level open source model as well as new and industry leading small and medium sized models. The $405 billion model has better cost performance relative to the leading closed models, and because it's open, it is immediately the best choice for fine-tuning and distilling your own custom models of whatever size you need. I think we are going to look back at Llama 3.1 as an inflection point in the industry where open source AI started to become the industry standard, just like Linux is. I often get asked why I'm so bullish on Open Source. I wrote a letter along with the Llama 3.1 release, explaining why I believe that Open Source is better for developers, for Meta app, and for the world more broadly. My view is that Open Source will be safer, will enable innovation that improves all of our lives faster, and we'll also create more shared prosperity. For Meta's own interests, we're in the business of building the best consumer and advertiser experiences. And to do that, we need to have access to the leading technology infrastructure and not get constrained by what competitors will let us do. But these models are ecosystems. They're not just isolated pieces of software that we can develop by ourselves. So if we want the most robust ecosystem of tools, efficiency improvements, silicon optimizations, and other integrations to develop around our models, then we need them to be widely used by developers across the industry. And once we know that we're going to have access to the leading models, then I'm confident that we are going to be able to build the best social and advertising experiences. Part of why I'm so optimistic about this is that we have a long track record of success with open source. We've saved billions of dollars with open compute project by having supply chains standardized on our infrared designs. Open sourcing tools like PyTorch and React has led to real benefits for us from all the industry's contributions. This approach has consistently worked for us and I expect it will work here too. Another major area of focus is figuring out the right level of infra capacity to support training more and more advanced models. Llama 3 is already competitive with the most advanced models, and we're already starting to work on Llama 4, which we're aiming to be the most advanced in the industry next year. We are planning for the compute clusters and data we'll need for the next several years. The amount of compute needed to train Llama 4 will likely be almost 10 times more than what we used to train Llama 3, and future models will continue to grow beyond that. It's hard to predict how this trend -- how this will trend multiple generations out into the future. But at this point, I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new inference projects. And as we scale these investments, we're of course, going to remain committed to operational efficiency across the company. The last area that I want to discuss is how AI is shaping our metaverse work, which continues to be our other long-term focus. Last quarter, I discussed how advances in AI have pulled in the timelines for some of our products. A few years ago, I would have predicted that holographic AR would be possible before Smart AI, but now it looks like those technologies will actually be ready in the opposite order. We're well positioned for that because of the Reality Labs investments that we've already made. Ray-Ban Meta Glasses continue to be a bigger hit sooner than we expected, thanks in part to AI. Demand is still outpacing our ability to build them, but I'm hopeful that we'll be able to meet that demand soon. EssilorLuxottica has been a great partner to work with on this, and we are excited to team up with them to build future generations of AI glasses, as we continue to build our long-term partnership. Quest 3 sales are also outpacing our expectations. And I think that's because it is not just the best MR headset for the price, but it's the best headset on the market, period. In addition to gaming, people are increasingly taking advantage of Quest's capabilities as a general computing platform, spending time watching videos, browsing websites, extending their PC via virtual desktop, and more. Horizon also continues to grow across VR, mobile, and desktop, and I expect that it will become an increasingly important part of that ecosystem as well. We're hosting our Annual Connect Conference on September 25th, and we will have lots of exciting updates around all of our AI and Metaverse work, so I encourage you to tune into that. At the end of the day, we are in the fortunate position where the strong results that we're seeing in our core products and business give us the opportunity to make deep investments for the future. And I plan to fully seize that opportunity to build some amazing things that will pay off for our community and our investors for decades to come. The progress we're making on both the foundational technology and product experiences suggests that we're on the right track. I'm proud of what our team has accomplished so far, and I'm optimistic about our ability to execute on the opportunities ahead. As always, thank you to our teams who are pushing all this important work forward, and thanks to all of you for being on this journey with us. And now here is Susan."
META,2024-07-31,2024-08-01,,2024-07-31,2024-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-07-31,prepared,,Susan Li,"Thanks Mark and good afternoon everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $39.1 billion up 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis. Q2 total expenses were $24.2 billion, up 7% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 23% driven primarily by higher infrastructure and reality labs inventory costs. R&D increased 13%, primarily driven by higher headcount-related expenses and infrastructure costs which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Marketing and sales decreased 14%, due mainly to lower restructuring and headcount-related costs. G&A decreased 12%, mostly due to lower legal-related expenses. We ended the first quarter with almost 70,800 employees, up 2% from Q1. Second quarter operating income was $14.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 11%. Net income was $13.5 billion, or $5.16 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $8.5 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $10.9 billion. We repurchased $6.3 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt. Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, with approximately 3.27 billion people using at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in June. Q2 total Family of Apps revenue was $38.7 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Q2 Family of Apps ads revenue was $38.3 billion, up 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by gaming and entertainment and media. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in rest of world and Europe at 33% and 26% respectively. Asia Pacific grew 20% and North America grew 17%. On an advertiser geography basis, total revenue growth continued to be strongest in Asia Pacific at 28%. The growth was below the first quarter rate of 41%, as we lapped a period of stronger demand from China-based advertisers. In Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services and the average price per ad both increased 10%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia Pacific and rest of world. Pricing growth was driven by increased advertiser demand in part due to improved ad performance. This was partially offset by impression growth particularly from lower monetizing regions and surfaces. Family of Apps other revenue was $389 million, up 73%, driven primarily by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp business platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q2, Family of Apps expenses were $19.4 billion, representing approximately 80% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 4%, mostly due to higher infrastructure and headcount related expenses, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Family of Apps operating income was $19.3 billion, representing a 50% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q2 was $353 million, up 28% driven primarily by Quest headset sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.8 billion, up 21% year-over-year, driven mainly by higher headcount-related expenses and Reality Labs inventory costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $4.5 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance, our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. To deliver engaging experiences, we remain focused on executing our priorities, including video and in-feed recommendations. On Instagram, Reels engagement continues to grow as we make ongoing enhancements to our recommendation systems. Part of this work has been focused on increasing the share of original posts within recommendations so people can discover the best of Instagram, including content from emerging creators. Now, more than half of recommendations in the US come from original posts. On Facebook, we're seeing encouraging early results from the global rollout of our unified video player and ranking systems in June. This initiative allows us to bring all video types on Facebook into one viewing experience, which we expect will unlock additional growth opportunities for short-form video, as we increasingly mix shorter videos into the overall base of Facebook video engagement. We expect the relevance of video recommendations will continue to increase as we benefit from unifying video ranking across Facebook and integrating our next-generation recommendation systems. These have already shown promising gains since we began using the new systems to support Facebook Reels recommendations last year. We expect to expand these new systems to support more services beyond Facebook video over the course of this year and next year. We are also seeing good momentum with our longer-term engagement priorities, including Generative AI and Threads. People have used Meta AI for billions of queries since we first introduced it. We're seeing particularly promising signs on WhatsApp in terms of retention and engagement, which has coincided with India becoming our largest market for Meta AI usage. You can now use Meta AI in over 20 countries and eight languages, and in the US we are rolling out new features like Imagine Edit, which allows people to edit images they generate with Meta AI. Beyond Generative AI, the Threads community also continues to grow and deepen their engagement, as we ship new features and enhance our content recommendation systems. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. There are two parts to this work. The first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to see opportunities to grow ad supply on lower monetizing surfaces like video, including within Facebook as the mix of overall video engagement shifts more to shorter videos over time, which creates more ad insertion opportunities. More broadly, we are continuing to get better at determining the best ads to show and when to show them during a person session across both Facebook and Instagram. This is enabling us to drive revenue growth and conversions without increasing the number of ads or in some cases even reducing ad load. The second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance. We continue to be pleased with our progress here, with AI playing an increasingly central role. We're improving ad delivery by adopting more sophisticated modeling techniques made possible by AI advancements, including our Meta Lattice ad ranking architecture, which continued to provide ad performance and efficiency gains in the second quarter. We're also making it easier for advertisers to maximize ad performance and automate more of their campaign setup with our Advantage+ suite of solutions. We're seeing these tools continue to unlock performance gains, with a study conducted this year demonstrating 22% higher return on ad spend for US advertisers after they adopted Advantage+ Shopping campaigns. Advertiser adoption of these tools continues to expand and we are adding new capabilities to make them even more useful. For example, this quarter we introduced flexible format to Advantage+ Shopping, which allows advertisers to upload multiple images and videos in a single ad that we can select from and automatically determine which format to serve in order to yield the best performance. We have also now expanded the list of conversions that businesses can optimize for using Advantage+ shopping to include an additional 10 conversion types, including objectives like add to cart. Looking forward, we believe Generative AI will play a growing role in how businesses market and engage with customers at scale. We expect this technology will continue to make it easier for businesses to develop customized and diverse ad creatives. We've seen promising early results since introducing our first Generative AI ad features, image expansion, background generation, and text generation with more than 1 million advertisers using at least one of these solutions in the past month. In May, we began rolling out full image generation capabilities into Advantage+ Creative, and we're already seeing improved performance from advertisers using the tool. Finally, we expect AI will help businesses communicate with customers more efficiently through messaging. We're starting by testing the ability for businesses to use AI in their chats with customers to help sell their goods and services and to generate leads. While we are in the early stages, we continue to expand the number of advertisers we are testing with and have seen good advances in the quality of responses since we began using Llama 3. Next, I’d like to discuss our approach to capital allocation which remains unchanged. We continue to invest both in enhancing our core experiences in the near-term and developing technologies that we believe will transform how people engage with our services in the years ahead. We expect that having sufficient compute capacity will be central to many of these opportunities. So we’re investing meaningfully in infrastructure to support our core AI work in content ranking and ads, as well as our generative AI and advanced research efforts. Our ongoing investment in core AI capacity is informed by the strong returns we've seen and expect to deliver in the future, as we advance the relevance of recommended content and ads on our platform. While we expect the returns from Generative AI to come in over a longer period of time, we’re mapping these investments against the significant monetization opportunities that we expect to be unlocked across customized ad creative, business messaging, a leading AI assistant and organic content generation. As we scale generative AI training capacity to advance our foundation models, we’ll continue to build our infrastructure in a way that provides us with flexibility in how we use it over time. This will allow us to direct training capacity to gen AI inference or to our core ranking and recommendation work, when we expect that doing so would be more valuable. We will also continue our focus on improving the cost efficiency of our workloads over time. Reality Labs remains our other long-term initiative that we continue to invest meaningfully in. Quest 3 is selling well and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are showing very promising traction with the early signals that we’re seeing across demand, usage and retention increasing our confidence in the long-run potential of AR glasses. Finally, as we pursue these investments across near and long-term priorities, we will remain focused on operating the business efficiently. Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect third quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $38.5 billion to $41 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96 billion to $99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to scale our -- to further scale our ecosystem. While we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year. As we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint. Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion, updated from our prior range of $35 billion to $40 billion. While we continue to refine our plans for next year, we currently expect significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In addition we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. In closing, Q2 was another good quarter. We continue to execute well across our business priorities and have exciting opportunities in front of us to deliver more value to the people and businesses using our products around the world. With that, Krista let's open up the call for questions."

META,2024-07-31,2024-08-01,,2024-07-31,2024-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-07-31,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Mark, one for Susan. Mark I wanted to sort of go back to some of the new generative AI-enabled use cases for users and advertisers. You talked about Meta AI, Studio, chatbots, [foundation] (ph) models. If you could just sort of hone in on one or two of those that you are most excited about, we are seeing good signal that could be a real driver for the business in '25, '26 just so we sort of know where are you most focused on all those opportunities it would be helpful. And the second one, Susan, you have a lot of CapEx priorities from building new infrastructure for next-generation models, compute capacity. Just walk us through again on the CapEx philosophy and any guardrails you have around ensuring you generate a healthy return on invested capital for investors from all the CapEx. Thanks."
META,2024-07-31,2024-08-01,,2024-07-31,2024-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-07-31,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"I can take the first one. So I think the things that will drive the most results in 2025 and 2026 are actually the first category of things that I talked about in my comments which are the ways that AI is shaping the existing products. So the ways that it is improving recommendations and helping people find better content, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective. I think there is a lot of upside there. Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we are doing is going to improve that. It will improve the experience and the business results. The other areas that we are working on, I mean I think you all know this from following our business for a while, but we have a relatively long business cycle of starting a new product, scaling it to something that reaches 1 billion people or more and only then really focusing on monetizing at scale. So realistically, for things like Meta AI or AI Studio, I mean these are things that I think will increase engagement in our products and have other benefits that will improve the business and engagement in the near term. But before we are really talking about monetization of any of those things by themselves, I mean I don't think that anyone should be surprised that I would expect that -- that will be years, right? It's just -- I think that that's like what we've seen with Reels, it's what we saw with all these things. But I think for those who have followed our business for a long time, you can also get a pretty good sense of when things are going to work years in advance. And I think that the people who bet on those early indicators tend to do pretty well, which is why I wanted to share in my comments the early indicator that we had on Meta AI, which is I mean look, it is early. Last quarter, we -- I think it just started rolling it out a week or two before our earnings call. This time we are a few months later. And what we can say is I think we are on track to achieve our goal of being the most used AI assistant by the end of this year. And I think that is a pretty big deal. Is that the only thing we want to do? No. I mean we obviously want to kind of grow that and grow the engagement on that to be a lot deeper, and then we will focus on monetizing it over time. But the early signals on this are good and I think that -- that's kind of all that we could reasonably have insight into at this point. But I do think that part of what's so fundamental about AI is, it is going to end up affecting almost every product that we have in some way. It will improve the existing ones and will make a whole lot of new ones possible. So it is why there are all the jokes about how all the tech CEOs get on these earnings calls and just talk about AI the whole time. It is because it is actually super exciting, and it is going to change all these different things over multiple time horizons."
META,2024-07-31,2024-08-01,,2024-07-31,2024-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-07-31,qa,,Susan Li,"And Brian, I can take the second question. On the ROI part of your question, I’d broadly characterize our AI investments into two buckets; core AI and Gen AI. And the two are really at different stages, as it relates to driving revenue for our businesses and our ability to measure returns. On our core AI work, we continue to take a very ROI based approach to our investment here. We are still seeing strong returns as improvements to both engagement and ad performance have translated into revenue gains and it makes sense for us to continue investing here. Gen AI is where we are much earlier, as Mark just mentioned in his comments. We don't expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in 2024. But we do expect that they are going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off -- of our investment while we are also open sourcing subsequent generations of Llama. And we've talked about the four primary areas that we are focused here on the Gen AI opportunities to enhance the core ads business, to help us grow in business messaging, the opportunities around Meta AI, and the opportunities to grow core engagement over time. The other thing I’d say is, we are continuing to build our AI infrastructure with fungibility in mind, so that we can flex capacity where we think it will be put to best use. The infrastructure that we build for gen AI training can also be used for Gen AI inference. We can also use it for ranking and recommendations by making certain modifications like adding general compute and storage. And we are also employing a strategy of staging our data center sites, at various phases of development, which allows us to flex up to meet more demand and less lead time if needed while limiting how much spend we are committing to in the outer years. So while we do expect that we are going to grow CapEx significantly in 2025, we feel like we have a good framework in place in terms of thinking about where the opportunities are and making sure that we have the flexibility to deploy it, as makes the most sense."

Just as we look at the revenue guidance and the outlook, Susan, any color you can share on just kind of the state of the overall digital ad market? And you've highlighted some areas where you are seeing strength versus kind of some of the idiosyncratic efforts you've made to kind of improve the efficacy of the ad product. Thank you."

We are continuing to see healthy global advertising demand, and we are also delivering ongoing ad performance improvements just related to all of the investments that we've continued to make over time. And improving the sort of ads, targeting ranking, delivery, all of the fundamental infrastructure there. And we expect that all of that will continue to benefit ad spend in Q3. We do expect year-over-year growth to slow in Q3, as we are lapping strong growth from China-based advertisers, as well as strong Reels impression growth from a year ago. And we also expect modestly larger FX headwinds in Q3 based on current rates."

You called out building community size and what's happened in the United States, as well as Threads. How are you thinking about those newer faster-growing elements of either Messaging or Threads as a platform and the mix between the potential for engagement growth and overall monetization longer term of either the messaging layer or Threads and what you are most excited about there to build to sort of capitalize on scale but bring it back towards monetization? Thank you."
META,2024-07-31,2024-08-01,,2024-07-31,2024-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-07-31,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"I can start and Susan can jump in, if she has anything else that she wants to add. So the WhatsApp stat I think, is really important as a business trend just because the United States punches above its weight in terms of, it is such a large percent of our revenue. So before, WhatsApp was sort of the leading messaging app in many countries around the world but not in the US. And I think now that we're starting to make inroads into leading in the US as more and more people use the product and realize that, hey, it was a really good experience, the best experience for cross-platform communication and groups and on all these different things. I think that -- that's going to just mean that all of the work that we are doing to grow the business opportunity there over time is just going to have a big tailwind if the US ends up being a big market. So that's one reason why it's really relevant. It is obviously also personally somewhat gratifying to see all the people around us starting to use WhatsApp, so I think that is pretty fun but maybe somewhat less relevant from a business perspective. Threads, I think it is another example of something that it got off to about as good of a start of any app that I can think of. I think, it was the fastest growing app to 100 million people. And it is a good reminder that even when you have that start, the path from there to 1 billion people using an app is still multiple years. And that's our product cycle. And I think that -- that's something that is a little bit different about Meta in the way we build consumer products and the business around them than a lot of other companies that ship something and start selling it and making revenue from it immediately. So I think that's something that our investors and folks thinking about analyzing the business, if needed to always grapple with, is all these new products, we ship them and then there is a multiyear time horizon between scaling them and then scaling them into not just consumer experiences but very large businesses. But the thing that I think is just super exciting about Threads is that we've been building this company for 20 years, and there are just not that many opportunities that come around to grow 1 billion person app. I mean, there are -- I don't know, maybe a dozen of them in the world or something, right? I mean, there are certainly more of them outside the company than inside the company, but we do pretty well and being able to add another one to the portfolio if we execute really well on this is just really exciting to have that potential. Now obviously, there is a ton of work between now and there. I mean, we are almost at 200 million. So it is a really good milestone, I'm excited about that. A lot of work between this and it being a large part of the business. But I do think that these kind of opportunities are pretty rare and that's something that we are just really excited about. I think the team is doing great work on it."

On Instagram, we expect Reels to continue to drive growth, while on Facebook, we expect to grow overall video time, while increasing the mix of short-form video, which creates more impression growth opportunities. And generally we expect continued community growth foracross our apps."

Mark just in terms of infrastructure and CapEx, you've talked about currently building out not just for Llama 3 and 4 but really out to 7 perhaps and then Llama 4, 10x the compute required versus Llama 3. Just given how much you are building ahead, how does that influence the shape of the CapEx curve over a multiyear period? And then Susan, if you could talk a little bit more about the 3Q outlook. I know you are talking about tougher comps, but at the same time, it really suggests only 1 point of FX neutral [decel] (ph) at the high end. So just curious if there's anything else you can point to more specifically that's driving the expected strength here. Thanks."
META,2024-07-31,2024-08-01,,2024-07-31,2024-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-07-31,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Doug. I can go ahead and talk about both of those. So your first question was sort of about the longer-term CapEx outlook. We haven't really shared an outlook sort of on the longer-term CapEx trajectory. In part infrastructure is an extraordinarily dynamic planning area for us right now. We are continuing to work through what the scope of the Gen AI road maps will look like over that time. Our expectation obviously again, is that we are going to significantly increase our investments in AI infrastructure next year, and we'll give further guidance as appropriate. But we are building all of that CapEx, again with the factors in mind that I talked about previously thinking about both how to build it flexibly, so we can deploy to core AI and Gen AI use cases as needed. And making sure that we both feel good about the returns that we're seeing on the core AI investments, which we are able to measure more immediately. And then we feel good about the opportunities in the gen AI efforts. Your second question was about the Q3 revenue outlook. Again I mentioned this earlier. We have seen healthy global advertising demand on our platform. We are delivering ongoing ad performance improvements, which again we feel like is a result of many, many quarters of effort that have accrued and will continue to accrue value to our platform. And we saw basically in Q2 where revenue grew 22% that there was broad-based strength across regions and verticals including particular strength among smaller advertisers, and we expect that generally to continue into Q3."

I just want to get back to the comment on US young adult user growth, especially maybe on Facebook and Instagram. I know you made a big change with Reels a couple of years ago. But what are those users doing on Facebook and Instagram? And can you give us any quantification of the usage growth? Thank you."

So building products with young adults in mind has been a core priority area for the Facebook team in recent years, and we've been very encouraged to see these efforts translate into engagement growth with this cohort. We have seen healthy growth in young adult app usage in the US and Canada for the past several quarters. And we have seen that products like Groups and Marketplace have seen particular traction with young adults. Posting to groups in the US and Canada has been growing. That's been boosted mainly by young adults. And we also see that they are active users of Marketplace, which has benefited from product improvements and strong demand for second-hand products in the US."

It is a great, somewhat under-monetized or arguably very under-monetized asset. I know you indirectly monetize it and it's a very large marketplace. It may even be bigger than eBay. Your thoughts on what you may want to do in the future in terms of monetizing it, in part maybe even improve the quality of the Marketplace. And then secondly, I just want to ask you about headcount. It is down about 1% year-over-year. You are pretty much back at par with where the employee headcount was prior to significant reduction. How should we think about headcount growth going forward? Did you talk about a significant growth in CapEx? Should we expect a moderate growth in headcount significant? Any thoughts on that would be helpful. Thank you."
META,2024-07-31,2024-08-01,,2024-07-31,2024-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-07-31,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks Mark. On your first question about Marketplace, again we are obviously excited that it's been one of the drivers of strength in young adults. I would probably just say that more generally, Marketplace is one prong in a broader commerce strategy that we have which continues to be focused on basically creating the best shopping experience on our platform. Marketplace is obviously consumer oriented. The broader part of the commerce strategy is about making it easier for businesses to advertise their products, for buyers to find and purchase relevant items on our platform. And to that end, I’d say that we feel quite happy with also the investments we've been making in Shops ads. Shops ads revenue is growing at a strong year-over-year pace. We are seeing Shops ads drive incremental performance for advertisers, and it's also working well in combination with some of our other products like Advantage+ shopping. Your second question was about headcount. We continue to be disciplined about where we are allocating new headcount to ensure that it's really focused on our core company priorities, but we are also working down a prior hiring underrun. And as we further close that hiring underrun over the course of this year, I do expect that we will end 2024 with in-seat reported headcount that is meaningfully higher than where we ended 2023. We aren't providing sort of 2025 headcount growth expectations yet as we haven't started our budgeting process yet. But again, I expect that we’ll primarily target our hiring to focus on priority areas, and we will be running a very disciplined headcount process."

So the AI system using Llama 3.1 has been incorporated in different variations and looks really impressive and seems to be getting closer to becoming a full search engine for virtually everything except for commercial queries so far. So are there any plans to open it up to the broader web? Kind of like what may be OpenAI is off to testing, maybe link it to third-party marketplaces for commercial search, et cetera. And then on Ray-Ban, can you maybe talk a little bit more about the opportunity to deepen your relationship with EssilorLuxottica? What would that look like? What kind of areas are the most exciting to you, Mark in that relationship? Thank you."

I think the team there is doing really great work going from the first version of Llama, the Llama 2 last year that was a generation behind the frontier and now Llama 3.1, which is basically competitive and in some ways, leading the other top-closed models. Meta AI uses a version of Llama 3.1 as well as a bunch of other services that we've built to kind of build a cohesive product. And when I was talking before about we have the initial usage trends around Meta AI but there is a lot more that we want to add. Things like commerce and you can just go vertical by vertical and build out specific functionality to make it useful in all these different areas are eventually, I think what we're going to need to do to make this just as -- to fulfill the potential around just being the ideal AI assistant for people. So it is a long road map. I don't think, that this stuff is going to get finished in the next couple of quarters or anything like that. But this is part of what's going to happen over the next few years as we build something that will I think, just be a very widely used service. So I'm quite excited about that. And we are going to continue working on Llama 2. So I mean, you mentioned Llama, and I think the question was a little more about Meta AI but they are both -- I mean, they're related Llama is sort of like the engine that powers the product and it's open source, and I'm just excited about the progress that we are making on both of those. On the smart glasses, EssilorLuxottica is a great partner. We are now in the second generation of the Ray-Ban Meta glasses. They are doing well, better than I think we had expected, and we expected them to grow meaningfully from the first generation so that's been a very positive surprise. And I think part of that is that it is just well-positioned to dovetail well with the AI revolution that we are seeing and offering all kinds of new functionality there. So that was great. But EssilorLuxottica is a great company that has a lot of different products that we hope to be able to partner with to just continue building new generations of the glasses and deepen the AI product and make it better and better. I think there is a lot more to go from here. And compared to what we thought at this point, it's doing quite well compared to, I think what it needs to be, to be like a really leading piece of consumer electronics, I think we are still early but all the signs are good."

I want to get back, Mark, to the commentary on open source and Llama 3. Totally understand that Meta is not offering a public cloud, and so what I wanted to hear from you is maybe a little bit more on the product vision of products that come out of Llama 3. And meaning potentially offering some of these products to other companies, call it for customer service or call center offerings or other verticals. And so any insights on just how you envision maybe the open source and Llama 3.1, can sort of offer greater enterprise services for others to benefit from? Thank you."
META,2024-07-31,2024-08-01,,2024-07-31,2024-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-07-31,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"So Llama is the foundation model that people can shape into all kind of different products. So whether it's Meta AI for ourselves or the AI Studio or the business agents or like the assistant that's in the Ray-Ban glasses, like all these different things are basically products that have been built with Llama. And similarly, any developer out there is going to be able to take it and build a whole greater diversity of different things as well. Like I talked about, I think -- the reason why open sourcing this is so valuable for us is that we want to make sure that we have the leading infrastructure to power the consumer and business experiences that we are building. But the infrastructure, it's not just a piece of software that we can build in isolation. It really is an ecosystem with a lot of different capabilities that other developers and people are adding to the mix, whether that's new tools to distill the models into the size that you want for a custom model, or ways to fine-tune things better or make inference more efficient or all different other kinds of methods that we haven't even thought of yet, the silicon optimizations that the silicon companies are doing, all the stuff. It is an ecosystem. So we can't do all that ourselves. And if we built Llama and just kind of kept it within our walls, then it wouldn't actually be as valuable for us to build all the products that we are building as it is going to end up being. So that's the business strategy around that. And that's why we don't feel like we need to necessarily build a cloud and sell it directly in order for it to be a really positive business strategy for us. And part of what we are doing is working closely with AWS, I think, especially did great work for this release. Other companies like Databricks, Nvidia, of course, other big players like Microsoft with Azure, and Google Cloud, they are all supporting this. And we want developers to be able to get it anywhere. I think that's one of the advantages of an open source model like Llama is – it is not like you're locked into one cloud that offers that model, whether it's Microsoft with OpenAI or Google with Gemini or whatever it is, you can take this and use it everywhere and we want to encourage that. So I'm quite excited about that. The enterprise and business applications that we are going to be most focused on, though, in addition to just optimizing the advertiser experience like I talked about in my comments earlier, it is the business agent piece. I just think that there is a huge potential like I said earlier. I think pretty much every business today, it has an e-mail address. They have a website. They have social media accounts. I think in the future, they are going to have at least one, if not multiple business agents that can do the whole range of things from interacting to help people buy things to helping support the sales that they've done, if they have issues with the product, if they need to get in touch with you for something. And we already see people interacting with businesses over messaging working quite well in countries that have low cost of labor. But the thing is that in order to have someone answering everyone's questions is quite expensive in a lot of countries. And I think that this is like a thing that AI, I think is just going to be very well suited towards doing. And when we can make that easy for the hundreds of millions of businesses that use our platforms to pull in all their information and their catalogs, and the history and all the content that they've shared and really just quickly stand up an agent, I think that's going to be awesome. So we can combine Llama with a lot of custom work that we're doing in our business teams and couple that with all the other investment that the rest of the ecosystem is doing to make Llama good. And I think that's going to be huge, but that's just one area. I mean, this really goes across all of the different products that we are building, both consumer and business. So it is a lot of exciting stuff."

Mark, so on Monday in your interview with Jensen, you said something along the lines of if scaling ended up stopping one day, you'd have five years of product work to do and ahead of you. So outside of agents or AI assistants, what other areas in AI are you thinking about or looking at in that five-year road map? And then the second question is maybe one more stab at the capacity question. You guys said that Llama 3.1 was trained on 16,000 H100s. You've also said that you're going to have 600,000 available by year-end. So even if we kind of go up to 160,000 GPUs for Llama 4, we have plenty of extra capacity for inference and future products. I guess how are you guys modeling out this entire kind of CapEx road map between training, inference, and future things? That's all. Thanks a lot."
META,2024-07-31,2024-08-01,,2024-07-31,2024-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-07-31,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"I can start with the first one, and then I'll let Susan answer the second one. It is an interesting question. It is a little hypothetical because I mean, I do think it's true that if, let's say, there were no future foundation models. I think there would just be a huge amount of product innovation that the industry would bring to bear, and that just takes time. But then at the same time there are going to be future foundation models, and they are going to be awesome and unlock new capabilities and we are planning our products around those. So I'm not really planning our product road map assuming that there isn't future innovation. On the contrary, we are planning what's going to be in Llama 4 and Llama 5 and beyond based on what capabilities we think are going to be most important for the road map that I just laid out for having the breadth of utility that you're going to need in something like Meta AI, making it set businesses and creators and individuals can stand up any kind of AI agents that they want, that you are going to have these kind of real-time, multimodal glasses with you all the time that will just be increasingly useful for all the things that you're doing. And that -- I guess this kind of dovetails what I'd expect Susan to talk about next. And we do have this huge set of use cases already about people wanting to discover content and interact with their friends and businesses reaching people, and all that stuff is getting better with this, too. So there is -- I guess my point there was its just – there is some lag between the technology becoming available and the products becoming kind of fully explored in the space. And I just think that -- that was kind of my way of saying that I think that this is just a very exciting area where there's just going to be a lot of innovation for a long time to come. I'll let Susan take a stab at the numbers around the GPUs and all that."

We are clearly in the process of building out a lot of capacity, and Mark has alluded to that in his comments about what we have needed to train prior generations and the next generation of Llama. And we are -- and that's driving sort of what we've talked about in terms of the significant growth in CapEx in 2025. And we aren't really in the position now to share a longer-term outlook. When we think about sort of any given new data center project that we are constructing, we think about how we will use it over the life of the data center. We think about the amount of capacity we would use in terms of training whatever the subsequent generations of Llama are and it is architected around that. But then we also look at how we might use it several years into its lifetime towards other use cases across our core business, across what we think might be future needs for inference, for generative AI-based products. So there is sort of a whole host of use cases for the life of any individual data center ranging from gen AI training at its outset to potentially supporting gen AI inference to being used for core ads and content ranking and recommendation and also thinking through the implications, too, of what kinds of servers we might use to support those different types of use cases. So we are really mapping across a wide range of potential use cases when we undertake any given project. And we are really doing that with both a long time horizon in mind, again, because of the long lead times in spinning up data centers, but also recognizing that there are multiple decision points in the lifetime of each data center in terms of thinking through when to order servers and what servers to order and what you will put them towards. And that gives us flexibility to make the sort of the best decisions based on the information we have in the future."

This was a good quarter with strong product and business momentum and with parts of our long-term vision around AI and the future of computing coming into sharper focus. We estimate that there are now more than 3.2 billion people using at least one of our apps each day and we're seeing rapid adoption of Meta AI and Llama, which is quickly becoming a standard across the industry. So let's start with some highlights from the apps. For WhatsApp, the US remains one of our fastest-growing countries and we just passed a milestone of 2 billion calls made globally every day. On Facebook, we continue to see positive trends with young adults, especially in the US. On Instagram, global growth remains strong. We also lunched teen accounts this quarter which add built-in protections that limit who teens are messaging and what content they can see. On Threads, the community now has almost 275 million monthly actives. It's been growing more than a million signups per day. Engagement is growing too, so we continue to be on track towards this becoming our next major social app. We are making a lot of progress with our AI efforts too, and we're seeing AI have a positive impact on nearly all aspects of our work, from our core business engagement and monetization to our long-term roadmaps for new services and computing platforms. I think that this partially comes from having a vision and roadmap that is aligned with the direction that technology is heading, but even more importantly from our teams doing some really excellent work on execution on so many fronts. Meta AI now has more than 500 million monthly active improvements to our AI driven feed and video recommendations have led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year alone. More than a million advertisers used our Gen AI tools to create more than 15 million ads in the last month and we estimate that businesses using image generation are seeing a 7% increase in conversions and we believe that there's a lot more upside here. We are also seeing great momentum with Llama. Llama token usage has grown exponentially this year and the more widely that Llama gets adopted and becomes the industry standard the more that the improvements to its quality and efficiency will flow back to all of our products. This quarter we released Llama 3.2 including the leading small models that run on device and open source multimodal models. We are working with enterprises to make it easier to use and now we're also working with the public sector to adopt Llama across the US government. The Llama 3 models have been something of an inflection point in the industry but I'm even more excited about Llama 4 which is now well into its development. We're training the Llama 4 models on a cluster that is bigger than 100,000 H100s or bigger than anything that I've seen reported for what others are doing. I expect that the smaller Llama 4 models will be ready first and they'll be ready we expect sometime early next year and I think that they're going to be a big deal on several fronts, new modalities capabilities, stronger reasoning and much faster. It seems pretty clear to me that open source will be the most cost effective, customizable, trustworthy, performant and easiest to use option that is available to developers and I am proud that Llama is leading the way on this. Right now it's the time of the year at Meta when we plan our budget for the next year, and that's still in progress, but I wanted to share a few things that have stood out to me as we've gone through this process so far. First, it's clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years, so I think we should invest more there. And second, our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there too. We haven't decided on a final budget yet, but those are some of the directional trends that I'm seeing. Now, moving on, this quarter, we also had several milestones around Reality Labs and the integration of AI and wearables. Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses are the prime example here. They're great-looking glasses that let you take photos and videos, listen to music, and take calls, but what makes them really special is the Meta AI integration. With our new updates, it'll be able to not only answer your questions throughout the day, but also help you remember things, give you suggestions as you're doing things using real-time multimodal AI, and even translate other languages right in your ear for you. I continue to think that glasses are the ideal form factor for AI because you can let your AI see what you see, hear what you hear, and talk to you. Demand for the glasses continues to be very strong. The new clear edition that we released at Connect sold out almost immediately and has been trading online for over $1,000. We've deepened our partnership with EssilorLuxottica to build future generations of smart eyewear that deliver both cutting-edge technology and style. At Connect, we also showed Orion, our first full holographic AR glasses. We've been working on this one for about a decade, and it gives you a sense of where this is all going. We're not too far off from being able to deliver great looking glasses that let you seamlessly blend the physical and digital worlds so you can feel present with anyone no matter where they are. And we're starting to see the next computing platform come together and it's pretty exciting. All right, we also released our newest mixed reality headset Quest 3S. It brings the best capabilities of Quest 3, high quality color pass-through, a new chipset, and more at the much more accessible price point of $300. Reviews are great so far and I'm looking forward to seeing how well it does this holiday season as more people get their hands on it. So overall, this has been a good quarter. I'm pretty amped about all the work that we're doing right now. This may be the most dynamic moment that I've seen in our industry and I am focused on making sure that we build some awesome things and make the most of the opportunities ahead. And if we do this well then, the potential for Meta and everyone building with us will be massive. As always, I'm grateful for everyone who is on this journey with us, our teams, our partners, and our investors. And now here's Susan."
META,2024-10-30,2024-10-31,,2024-10-30,2024-10-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-30,prepared,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Mark. And good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q3 total revenue was $40.6 billion, up 19% or 20% on a constant currency basis. Q3 total expenses were $23.2 billion, up 14% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 19% driven primarily by higher infrastructure costs. R&D increased 21%, mostly driven by higher headcount related expenses and infrastructure costs. Marketing and sales decreased 2% driven primarily by lower restructuring costs. G&A decreased 10% driven primarily by lower legal related expenses. We ended the third quarter with over 72,400 employees, up 9% year-over-year with growth primarily driven by hiring in our priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, generative AI, as well as regulation and compliance. Third quarter operating income was $17.4 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 12%. Net income was $15.7 billion or $6.03 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.2 billion driven by investments in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure. Our capital expenditures were impacted in part by the timing of third quarter server deliveries, which will be paid for in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow was $15.5 billion. In Q3, we completed a debt offering of $10.5 billion, re-purchased $8.9 billion of our Class A common stock, and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $70.9 billion in cash and marketable securities, and $28.8 billion in debt. Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, with more than 3.2 billion people using at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in September. Q3 Total Family of Apps revenue was $40.3 billion, up 19% year -over -year. Q3 Family of Apps ad revenue was $39.9 billion, up 19% or 20% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year -over -year growth, followed by healthcare and entertainment and media. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in rest of world in Europe, at 23% and 21%, respectively. Asia Pacific grew 18%, and North America grew 16%. On an advertiser geography basis, total revenue growth was strongest in North America and Europe at 21%. Rest of world was up 17%, while Asia Pacific was the slowest growing region at 15%, decelerating from our second quarter growth rate of 28% due mainly to lapping a period of stronger demand from China-based advertisers. In Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 7%, and the average price per ad increased 11%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia Pacific and rest of world. Pricing growth was driven by increased advertiser demand, in part due to improved ad performance. This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing regions and surfaces. Family of Apps Other revenue was $434 million, up 48%, driven primarily by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp business platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments for the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q3, Family of Apps expenses were $18.5 billion, representing approximately 80% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 13%, primarily due to higher infrastructure and headcount related expenses, partially offset by lower legal related expenses. Family of Apps operating income was $21.8 billion, representing a 54% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q3 revenue was $270 million, up 29% driven by hardware sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.7 billion, up 19% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount related expenses and infrastructure costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $4.4 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance. Our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, we are focused on both improving people's experiences within our apps today and investing in longer term initiatives that have the potential to contribute to engagement in the years ahead. We expect our content recommendations roadmap will span both of these timeframes as we have newer term work streams focused on improving recommendations as well as multi-year initiatives to develop innovative new approaches. I'll focus first on the near term. In the third quarter, we continue to see daily usage grow year-over-year across Facebook and Instagram, both globally and in the US. On Facebook, we're seeing strong results from the global rollout of our unified video player in June. Since introducing the new experience and prediction systems that power it, we've seen a 10% increase in time spent within the Facebook video player. This month, we've entered the next phase of Facebook's video product evolution. Starting in the US and Canada, we are updating the standalone video tab to a full screen viewing experience, which will allow people to seamlessly watch videos in a more immersive experience. We expect to complete this global rollout in early 2025. On Instagram, Reels continues to see good traction, and we're making ongoing progress with our focus on promoting original content, with more than 60% of recommendations now coming from original posts in the U.S. This is helping people find unique and differentiated content on Instagram, while also helping earlier stage creators get discovered. Next, let me talk more about our multi-year roadmap for recommendations. Previously, we operated separate ranking and recommendation systems for each of our products because we found that performance did not scale if we expanded the model size and compute power beyond a certain point. However, inspired by the scaling laws we were observing with our large language models, last year we developed new ranking model architectures capable of learning more effectively from significantly larger datasets. To start, we have been deploying these new architectures to our Facebook video ranking models, which has enabled us to deliver more relevant recommendations and unlock meaningful gains in watch time. Now, we're exploring whether these new models can unlock similar improvements to recommendations on other services. After that, we will look to introduce cross-surface data to these models so our systems can learn from what is interesting to someone on one surface of our apps and use it to improve their recommendations on another. This will take time to execute, and there are other explorations that we will pursue in parallel. However, over time we are optimistic that this will unlock more relevant recommendations while also leading to higher engineering efficiency as we operate a smaller number of recommendations. Beyond recommendations, we're making progress with our other longer term engagement priorities, including generative AI and Threads. Meta AI usage continues to scale as we make it available in more countries and languages. We're seeing lifts in usage as we improve our models and have introduced a number of enhancements in recent months to make Meta AI more helpful and engaging. Last month, we began introducing voice so you can speak with Meta AI more naturally and it's now fully available in English to people in the US, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. In the US, people can now also upload photos to Meta AI to learn more about them, write captions for posts, and add, remove, or change things about their images with a simple text prompt. These are all built with our first multimodal foundation model, Llama 3.2. Threads remains another area where we see exciting potential. We are bringing on an increasing number of new users each quarter while depth of engagement also continues to grow. Looking ahead, we plan to introduce more features to make it even easier for people to stay up to date on topics they care about. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. There are two parts to this work. The first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to see opportunities to grow ad supply on lower monetizing surfaces like video. Within Facebook, video engagement continues to shift to short form following the unification of our video player, and we expect this to continue with the transition of the video tab to a full screen format. This is resulting in organic video impressions growing more quickly than overall video time on Facebook, which provides more opportunities to serve ads. Across both Facebook and Instagram, we're also continuing our broader work to optimize when and where we should show ads within a person's session. This is enabling us to drive revenue and conversion growth without increasing the number of ads. The second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance. Similar to organic content ranking, we are finding opportunities to achieve meaningful ads performance gains by adopting new approaches to modeling. For example, we recently deployed new learning and modeling techniques that enable our ad systems to consider the sequence of actions a person takes before and after seeing an ad. Previously, our ad system could only aggregate those actions together without mapping the sequence. This new approach allows our systems to better anticipate how audiences will respond to specific ads. Since we adopted the new models in the first half of this year, we've already seen a 2% to 4% increase in conversions based on testing within selected segments. We're also evolving our ads platform to ensure that the results we drive are customized to each business' objectives and to the way they measure value. In Q3, we introduce changes to our ads ranking and optimization models to take more of the cross-publisher journey into account, which we expect to increase the Meta-attributed conversions that advertisers see in their third-party analytics tools. We're also testing new features and settings for advertisers that will allow them to optimize their campaigns for what they value most, such as driving incremental conversions rather than absolute conversions. Finally, there is continued momentum with our Advantage + solutions, including our ad creative tools. We're seeing strong retention with advertisers using our generative AI-powered image expansion, background generation, and text generation tools, and they're already driving improved performance for advertisers even at this early stage. Earlier this month, we began testing our first video generation features, video expansion and image animation. We expect to make them more broadly available by early next year. Next, I'd like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. We continue to take a long-term view in running the business, which involves investing in a portfolio of opportunities that we expect will generate returns over different time periods. We are very optimistic about the set of opportunities in front of us and believe that investing now in both infrastructure and talent will not only accelerate our progress, but increase the likelihood of maximizing returns within each area. This includes investing in both near-term initiatives to deliver continued healthy revenue growth within our core business, as well as longer-term opportunities that have the scale to deliver compelling returns over time. Given the lead time of our longer-term investments, we also continue to maximize our flexibility so that we can react to market developments. Within Reality Labs, this has benefited us as we've evolved our roadmap to respond to the earlier-than-expected success of smart glasses. Within generative AI, we expect significantly scaling up our infrastructure capacity now while also prioritizing its fungibility will similarly position as well to respond to how the technology and market develop in the years ahead. Moving now to our financial outlook. We expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45 billion to $48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96 billion to $98 billion updated from our prior range of $96 billion to $99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningful year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem. Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38 billion to $40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37 billion to $40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditure growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 CapEx, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet. On to tax, absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low teens. In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. In closing, this was another good quarter for our business. Our global community continues to grow. We're seeing ongoing momentum across our core priorities, and we have exciting opportunities ahead of us to drive further growth in our core business in 2025 and capitalize on the longer-term opportunities ahead. With that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions."

Mark, I wanted to sort of ask you about Meta AI a little bit. Can you help us understand some of the more recurring types of interactions or query types you're seeing with this product and whether they have commercial intent? And then just over time, how do you think about building your own in-house search offering as opposed to partnering and having another player partner those queries? And then, Susan, I wanted to ask you about sort of headcount because you talked a lot about sort of infrastructure investment into ‘25. How do we sort of think about relative headcount investments into ‘25 to sort of support all that infrastructure versus what you've been doing in 2024? Thanks."
META,2024-10-30,2024-10-31,,2024-10-30,2024-10-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-30,qa,,Susan Li,"Brian, thanks for the question. This is Susan. So your first question was around what kinds of recurring interactions that we see between people and their usage of Meta AI. And we're seeing first of all, I think, as Mark mentioned, just we're excited about the progress of Meta AI. It's obviously very early in its journey, but it continues to be on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by end of year, and it has over 500 million monthly actives. And people are using it for many things. A number of the frequent use cases we're seeing include information gathering help with how-to tasks, which is the largest use case. But we also see people using it to go deeper on interest, to look for content on our services, for image generation. That's also been another pretty popular use case so far. And I would say that in the near term, our focus is really on making Meta AI increasingly valuable for people. And if we're successful, we think there will be a broadening set of queries that people use it for, including more monetizable queries over time. The second part of your question Meta AI draws from content across the web to address timely questions from users and it provides sources for those results from our search engine partners. We've integrated with Bing and Google, both of whom offer great search experiences. Like other companies, we also train our Gen AI models on content that is publicly available online and we crawl the web for a variety of purposes. Your second question was really, I think, around maybe how we're thinking about headcount in 2025. And we are still working through our budgeting processes for ‘25. That's in part why we changed our forward-looking guidance approach to give guidance in the next call. But as we're working through this, we are looking at where there are opportunities for us to invest in our strategic priorities, and that includes monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, Gen AI, our ongoing investments in regulation and compliance, and we're really evaluating each of those opportunities with an eye towards what either the measurable ROI looks like or what the strategic opportunity looks like, depending on what the area is. And we're supporting that by continuing to really focus on streamlining our operations elsewhere. So we don't have specifics to share about headcount growth in 2025, but that gives you a little bit of the flavor of where we are in the budgeting process."

Maybe just one building on that question from Brian and going back to Mark's comments about the learnings as you do go through the business planning process. Mark, I wanted to understand better what you continue to learn about what the biggest opportunity sets are to apply AI to when you think about your platform, your product portfolio, and your internal processes because you sound quite optimistic about key learnings and how they continue to ramp and maybe even accelerate in terms of the potential for return profile. I just want to go a little bit deeper into what your key learnings are as you go through that process. Thank you."
META,2024-10-30,2024-10-31,,2024-10-30,2024-10-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-30,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"I think the main point here is just that it seems broadly applicable to a very wide variety of products. There are areas that are more part of our core business from making feed more relevant and reels more relevant to making ads more relevant, to helping advertisers generate better ads, to helping people create the content that they want, helping our integrity operations and compliance and the work that we do there. That's important. It's very valuable across all these aspects of the core business, but then it also is going to enable completely new types of services. We didn't have something like Meta AI before. We didn't have something like the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses before, and AI is going to be a really important ingredient of all of these things. There are also other new products like that, things around AI Studio. This year, we really focused on rolling out Meta AI as kind of our Single Assistant that people can ask any question to, but there's a lot of opportunities that I think will see ramp more over the next year in terms of both consumer and business use cases for people interacting with a wide variety of different AI agents, consumer ones with AI Studio around whether it's different creators or different kind of agents that people create for entertainment. Or on the business side, we do want to continue making progress on this vision of making it so that any small business or any business over time can, with a few clicks, stand up an AI agent that can help do customer service and sell things to all of their customers around the world. I think that that's a huge opportunity. So it's very broad, and I think part of what we're seeing is that there are a lot of opportunities. Some of the longer-term ones around Meta AI or AI Studio, those aren't necessarily a next few years massive profit opportunity, but there are a lot of things in the core business around engagement and monetization, which I think will be over the next few years. So I think we're trying to make sure that we get the right people working on this and that we have the right amount of investment that's just going towards what we view as a very, very large opportunity."

Maybe just to follow up first on Meta AI, Mark, helpful context for me to understand how people are using the platform today, maybe you can just talk more about some of that functionality over time as agents are introduced, just how you really expect to use cases to expand beyond just longer and more complex queries. And then, Susan, on CapEx, just trying to understand your comment on 4Q a little bit more, it sounds like some of the payments pushed into 4Q with the guidance suggesting $15 billion to $17 billion in CapEx in the quarter. And is that something we should think about as run rate into 2025? Thank you."
META,2024-10-30,2024-10-31,,2024-10-30,2024-10-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-30,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes, I mean, I can take the Meta AI question, although I'm sort of intentionally now not saying too much about the new capabilities and modalities that we're launching with Llama 4 e that are coming to Meta AI. I mean, I noted in the comments upfront that with each major generational update, I expect that there will be large new capacities that get added, but I think that that's just going to be, that's partially what I'm excited about, and we'll talk more about that next year when we're ready to. One of the trends that I do think we're going to see though is having the models, not just power Meta AI or our Single Assistant, but across AI Studio and business agents have that grow. I mean, this year, if you look back to where we were about a year ago, we were starting to roll out Meta AI. This year, we have really so far succeeded in having that grow and having a lot of people use that. There's obviously a lot more depth of engagement and new use cases that we want to add over time, but I'd say that we're today with AI Studio and business AIs about where we were with Meta AI about a year ago. So I think in the next year, our goal around that is going to be to try to make those pretty widespread use cases, even though there's going to be a multi-year path to getting kind of the depth of usage and the business results around that that we want. So there's a lot to do here though, and I'm excited to talk about that starting earlier next year."

The expected step up in Q4 CapEx from Q3 is that part of that comes from increases in server spend and to a lesser extent data center CapEx, but with servers, there are these timing dynamics at play that you referred to because we had these server deliveries that landed late in Q3, and so the cash doesn't go out the door basically till Q4, and that's when you'll see the CapEx show up. And given the nature of capital expenditures generally, there is some actually quite a bit of lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. So it's a little bit hard to sort of extrapolate from any particular quarter. Overall, I'd say we're growing our infrastructure investments significantly this year, and we expect significant growth again in 2025."

Just thinking about use of AI and employee productivity, how are you able to utilize AI internally, and are you seeing big productivity gains in your R&D group? And second, I know I'll go after the headcount one more time, but Susan, how flexible is your headcount as you think about cost growth in other areas? Thanks."
META,2024-10-30,2024-10-31,,2024-10-30,2024-10-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-30,qa,,Susan Li,"Justin, so I'll take a crack at both of those. On the use of AI and employee productivity, it's certainly something that we're very excited about. I don't know that we have anything particularly quantitative that we're sharing right now. I think there are different efficiency opportunities with AI that we've been focused on in terms of where we can reduce costs over time and generate savings through increasing internal productivity in areas like coding for example, it's early, but we're seeing a lot of adoption internally of our internal assistant and coding agent. And we continue to make Llama more effective at coding, which should also make this use case increasingly valuable to developers over time. There are also places where we hope over time that we'll be able to deploy these tools against a lot of our content moderation efforts to help make the big body of content moderation work that we undertake to help it make it more efficient and effective for us to do so. And there are lots of other places around the company where I would say we're relatively early in exploring the way that we can use LLM-based tools to make different types of work streams more efficient. So all that is to say it's something we're pretty excited about. We have lots of teams focused on it. There are sort of small opportunities and G&A functions to what we hope will be big opportunities in areas like content moderation and coding productivity over time. On your second question about headcount, we're really, again, we're still mid-budget, so there's, we don't have very much that is definitive to share about this at the time. But as we're evaluating where there are opportunities for us to make good investments, we really think about there is a bucket of very ROI-driven headcount opportunities. We're very rigorous about the way we think about returns there and what the return opportunity is and what we think is the likelihood of those returns and what is the aggregate incrementality of those investments. And those are all things that sort of we're evaluating when we think about where to invest in the core business and where we think we can deliver sort of ROI on a near-term basis. And then at the same time, we're also assessing what the opportunities look like, again, some of the more medium and long-term strategic areas of investment. And that includes our efforts in Gen AI and the infrastructure needed to support it and includes our investments in Reality Labs. And so those are all things that we're kind of assessing in kind of a portfolio of what we think we would do in 2025. With a couple of thoughts, one is, again, where can we sort of build the most flexibility into the way that we're thinking about either infrastructure or headcount plans. And the second is we're really focused across the company on our efficiency efforts broadly and making sure that we feel like we're continuing to push the whole company, including areas in which we expect that we will be making additional headcount investments to think about how they can be more efficient in 2025 than they were in 2024."

You said something along the lines of the more standardized Llama becomes, the more improvements will flow back to the core Meta business. And I guess, could you dig in a little bit more on that? So the series of Llama models are being used by lots of developers building different things in AI. I guess, how are you using that vantage point to incubate new ideas inside Meta? And then second question is, you mentioned on one of the podcasts after the Meta Connect that assuming scaling laws hold up, we may need hundreds of billions of compute CapEx to kind of reach our goals around Gen AI. So I guess how quickly could you conceivably stand up that much infrastructure given some of the constraints around energy or custom ASICs or other factors? Is there any more color on the speed by which we could get that amount of compute online at Meta? Thank you."
META,2024-10-30,2024-10-31,,2024-10-30,2024-10-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-30,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes, I can try to give some more color on this. I mean, the improvements to Llama, I'd say come in a couple of flavors. There's sort of the quality flavor and the efficiency flavor. There are a lot of researchers and independent developers who do work. And because Llama is available, they do the work on Llama and they make improvements and then they publish it and it becomes, it's very easy for us to then incorporate that both back into Llama and into our Meta products like Meta AI or AI Studio or Business AI because the work to be examples that are being shown are people doing it on our stack. Perhaps more importantly is just the efficiency and cost. I mean, this stuff is obviously very expensive. When someone figures out a way to run this better, if they can run it 20% more effectively, then that will save us a huge amount of money. And that was sort of the experience that we had with open compute and part of why we are leaning so much into open source here in the first place is that we found counterintuitively with open compute that by publishing and sharing the architectures and designs that we had for our compute, the industry standardized around it a bit more. We got some suggestions also that helped us save costs, and that just ended up being really valuable for us. Here, one of the big costs is chips. A lot of the infrastructure there, what we're seeing is that as Llama gets adopted more, you're seeing folks like NVIDIA and AMD and optimize their chips more to run Llama specifically well, which clearly benefits us. So it benefits everyone who's using Llama, but it makes our products better rather than if we were just on an island building a model that no one was kind of standardizing around in the industry. So that's some of what we're seeing around Llama and why I think it's good business for us to do this in an open way. In terms of Scaling Infra, when I talk about our teams executing well, some of that goes towards delivering more engaging products and some of it goes towards delivering more revenue. On the Infra side, it goes towards building out the expenses faster, right. So I think part of what we're seeing this year is the Infra team is executing quite well. And I think that's why over the course of the year, we've been able to build out more capacity and going into the year, we had a range for what we thought we could potentially do. And we have been able to do, I think, more than I think we'd kind of hoped and expected at the beginning of the year. And while that reflects as higher expenses, it's actually something that I'm quite happy that the team is executing well on. And I think that will, so that execution makes me somewhat more optimistic that we're going to be able to keep on building this out at a good pace. But that's part of this whole thing is this part of the formula around kind of building out the infrastructures is maybe not what investors want to hear in the near term that we're growing that, but I just think that the opportunities here are really big. We're going to continue investing significantly in this. And I'm proud of the teams that are doing great work to stand up a large amount of capacity. So that way we can deliver world class models and world class products."

We're bringing on an increasing number of users each quarter and depth of engagement also continues to grow and in Q3, we saw especially strong user growth in key markets like the US, Taiwan, and Japan and we've added a number of new features over the course of Q3 including, account insights for businesses and creators to see how their posts perform, the ability to save multiple drafts, continuing to deliver on our commitment to integrate Threads with the Fediverse and basically we're very focused on continuing to build out the sort of functionality of Threads over time and being responsive to what users tell us that they're interested in. Specifically, as it pertains to monetization, we don't expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of 2025 revenue at this time. We've been just pleased with the growth trajectory and, again, are really focused on introducing features that the community finds valuable in working to deepen growth and engagement. Your second question was about the increase in average price per ad, so that grew 11% year-over-year driven by strong advertiser demand and part of that is because of better ad performance over time also and we saw that CPM growth accelerate slightly from 10% in Q2 in part because we experienced lower impression growth in Q3, but more broadly as we think about price and growth and this metric, the year-over-year growth in reported price per ad, there's a lot that goes into that including the auction dynamics resulting from fluctuations and impression growth. And one of the things that we feel like we're very focused on is really the input metrics. What are the conversions that we are delivering to advertisers? Are they getting more value over time? The sort of blended reported price per ad is complicated because all of those things get rolled up into it. There are so many different objectives that advertisers are optimizing for. Those objectives have very different values that make them hard to compare on an apples to apples basis. But we care a lot about conversion growth, which is growing, continues to grow faster than impression growth. And are we seeing healthy cost per action or cost per conversion trends, which we are. And as long as we continue to get better at driving conversions for advertisers, that should have the effect of lifting CPMs over time because we're delivering more conversions for impressions served and that will result in higher value impressions."

I have a bigger picture, kind of like ecosystem question here is, when we think, I'm curious, how far do you think we are from seeing a proliferation of third-party AI applications, specifically on the kind of the consumer side? I know we're seeing more and more on the enterprise side, agents, et cetera. But when do we see, how far out until we see a proliferation of consumer applications in the AI space? And how do you think about, and how does Meta think of itself as one of those key, it was one of those key application applications in the mobile internet and the desktop internet. But now you're also seemingly an infrastructure player as well. So I'd love to hear your thoughts there. Thank you."
META,2024-10-30,2024-10-31,,2024-10-30,2024-10-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-30,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes, I mean, there are a lot of consumer products that we're working on. And with Llama, I would expect that app developers will be able to build a lot of really good things too. I've touched on Meta AI and AI Studio and Business AI as a bunch. And I expect those to be important parts of the consumer experience. Another part that I haven't talked about quite as much yet is the opportunity for AI to help people create content that just makes people's feed experiences better. But if you look at the big trends and feeds over the history of the company, it started off as friends, right. So all the updates that were in there were basically from your friends posting things. And then we went into this era where we added in creator content too. We're now a very large percent of the content on Instagram and Facebook is not from your friends. It may not even be from people that you're following directly. It could just be recommended content from creators that we can algorithmically determine is going to be interesting and engaging and valuable to you. And I think we're going to add a whole new category of content which is AI generated or AI summarized content or kind of existing content pulled together by AI in some way and I think that that's going to be just very exciting for Facebook and Instagram and maybe Threads or other kind of feed experiences over time. It's something that we're starting to test different things around this. I don't know if we know exactly what's going to work really well yet. Some things are promising. I don't know that this isn't going to be a big impact on the business in ‘25 would be my guess. But I think that there is, I have high confidence that over the next several years, this is going to be an important trend and one of the important applications. But you're going to get that, you're going to get Meta AI, AI studio, Business AI has been a whole lot of things that developers would do with Llama 2."

And so with over 10 million advertisers and one of the best URLs offerings out there in your core business, just wondering if there are any plans to start maybe testing ads on commercial queries and move Meta AI closer to becoming a real answer engines for the billions of queries that you guys are already seeing. And then Susan, one of the biggest areas of pushback we get is around the reality of lasting the ongoing losses there. I think 16 billion last year, probably north of 20 billion this year. The question is, are we getting any closer to peak losses there or alternatively, what products do you think have the biggest potential there over the next couple of years? Thanks."
META,2024-10-30,2024-10-31,,2024-10-30,2024-10-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-30,qa,,Susan Li,"I'm happy to take both of these, Youssef, so your first question was on plans to provide ads on commercial queries. I think I alluded to this maybe in a much earlier question. Right now, we're really focused on making Meta AI as engaging and valuable a consumer experience as possible. Over time we think there will be a broadening set of queries that people use it for, and I think that the monetization opportunities will exist when over time as we get there. But right now, I would say we are really focused on the consumer experience above all, and it's just sort of a playbook for us with products that we put out in the world where we really dial in the consumer experience before we focus on what the monetization could look like. The second part of your question is about Reality Labs. We aren't sharing expectations beyond 2024 at this point. And we are certainly as we think about the 2025 budgeting process for Reality Labs, we're certainly thinking about where we want to make sure we're putting our sort of focus and energy. We are very excited again about the progress that we've seen with our smart glasses as well as the sort of strong consumer interest in them. And so we're kind of thinking about where we want to make sure that we are investing appropriately behind the consumer momentum that we see. Overall, I'd say Reality Labs is clearly one of our strategic long-term priorities and we expect it will be an area of significant investment as we build out towards the very ambitious product roadmap that we have there."

META,2024-10-30,2024-10-31,,2024-10-30,2024-10-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-30,qa,,Mark Mahaney,"Let me throw out two questions, please. One, this is a year in which we've had a lot of unusual events that could be driving ad revenue, major elections in not just the U.S. but Europe and in India and major sports events like World Cup and then there's some other things. Is there any, just in thinking about comps for next year and maybe in the future, anything, Susan, you would call out, like, how much of an impact there may have come from these one in every four or five year events. And then secondly, could you just talk a little bit more about WhatsApp monetization and where you are with that now? It sounds like that's the business messaging part; it's really feeding it nicely into other revenue. But help us think about where the monetization levels of WhatsApp are now versus where they can be two or three years down the road, how far away we are from optimization. Thank you."
META,2024-10-30,2024-10-31,,2024-10-30,2024-10-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-30,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Mark. So your first question was about sort of the revenue backdrop in 2024. You mentioned events that occur once every four or five years, so I imagine we're talking about the Olympics. We historically have not seen meaningful incremental contribution from events like the Olympics. We believe that was largely the case this year. So when we think about the Q4 outlook and when we think about going into next year, we generally expect growth to continue to benefit from the healthy global advertising demand that we've seen. We think that our investments in improving our ads performance will continue to accrue benefits to advertisers. But obviously there's a big range of possible macro backdrops and that's something that we try to reflect in the range of revenue guidance that we give. But I don't know that there are a lot of specific events that we would say had a material sort of idiosyncratic to 2024 type of revenue impact. Your second question was around WhatsApp monetization and where we are. And right now what I would say again is click to message is really the big focus area for us here. We're seeing continued traction in this area. And in particular growth and click-to-WhatsApp ads remain particularly strong. And so we're continuing to focus both on scaling click-to-WhatsApp ads in more markets where WhatsApp has strong user adoption like Brazil for example. It's obviously earlier in the US but we're seeing good growth in click-to-WhatsApp ads and are continuing to invest in scaling in consumer adoption of WhatsApp in the US also which will create bigger opportunities down the line. So, and then of course a lot of work that we're doing to make the click to messaging ads more effective and helping to focus for the particular, helping advertisers optimize sorry for the particular conversion events that they care about. The other element of revenue on WhatsApp, I would say, is paid messaging that continues to grow at a strong pace again. This quarter remains, in fact, the primary driver of growth in our Family of Apps, other revenue line, which was up 48% in Q3, and we're seeing generally a strong increase in the volume of paid conversations driven both by growth in the number of businesses adopting paid messaging, as well as in the conversational volume per business."

We ended 2024 on a strong note with now more than 3.3 billion people using at least one of our apps each day. This is going to be a really big year. I know it always feels like every year is a big year, but more than usual it feels like the trajectory for most of our long-term initiatives is going to be a lot clearer by the end of this year. So I keep telling our teams that this is going to be intense, because we have about 48-weeks to get on the trajectory we want to be on. In AI, I expect this is going to be the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches more than 1 billion people, and I expect Meta AI to be that leading AI assistant. Meta AI is already used by more people than any other assistant, and once a service reaches that kind of scale it usually develops a durable long-term advantage. We have a really exciting roadmap for this year with a unique vision focused on personalization. We believe that people don't all want to use the same AI, people want their AI to be personalized to their context, their interests, their personality, their culture, and how they think about the world. I don't think that there's just going to be one big AI that everyone uses that does the same thing. People are going to get to choose how their AI works and what it looks like for them. I continue to think that this is going to be one of the most transformative products that we’ve made. And we have some fun surprises that I think people are going to like this year. I think this very well be the year when Llama and open source become the most advanced and widely used AI models as well. Llama 4 is making great progress in training. Llama 4 mini is done with pre-training and our reasoning models and larger model are looking good too. Our goal with Llama 3 was to make open source competitive with closed models, and our goal for Llama 4 is to lead. Llama 4 will be natively multimodal; it's an omni-model and will have agentic capabilities, so it's going to be novel and it’s going to unlock a lot of new use cases. I'm looking forward to sharing more of our plan for the year on that over the next couple of months. I also expect that 2025 will be the year when it becomes possible to build an AI engineering agent that has coding and problem-solving abilities of around a good mid-level engineer. And this is going to be a profound milestone and potentially one of the most important innovations in history, as well as over time, potentially a very large market. Whichever company builds this first I think is going to have a meaningful advantage in deploying it to advance their AI research and shape the field. So that's another reason why I think that this year is going to set the course for the future. Our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses are a real hit, and this will be the year when we understand the trajectory for AI glasses as a category. Many breakout products in the history of consumer electronics have sold 5 million to 10 million units in their third generation. This will be a defining year that determines if we're on a path towards many hundreds of millions and eventually billions of AI glasses and glasses being the next computing platform like we've been talking about for some time or if this is just going to be a longer grind. But it's great overall to see people recognizing that these glasses are the perfect form factor for AI, as well as just great, stylish glasses. These are all big investments, especially the hundreds of billions of dollars that we will invest in AI infrastructure over the long-term. I announced last week that we expect to bring online almost 1 gigawatt of capacity this year, and we're building a 2 gigawatt and potentially bigger AI datacenter, that is so big that it will cover a significant part of Manhattan if it were placed there. We're planning to fund all this by at the same time investing aggressively in initiatives that use these AI advances to increase revenue growth. And we've put together a plan that will hopefully accelerate the pace of these initiatives over the next few years. That’s what a lot of our new headcount growth is going towards. And how well we execute on this will also determine our financial trajectory over the next few years. There are a number of other important product trends related to our family of apps that I think we’re going to know more about this year as well. We're going to learn what's going to happen with TikTok, and regardless of that I expect Reels on Instagram and Facebook to continue growing. I expect Threads to continue on its trajectory to become the leading discussion platform and eventually reach 1 billion people over the next several years. Threads now has more than 320 million monthly actives and has been adding more than 1 million sign-ups per day. I expect WhatsApp to continue gaining share and making progress towards becoming the leading messaging platform in the U.S. like it is in a lot of the rest of the world. WhatsApp now has more than 100 million monthly actives in the U.S. Facebook is used by more than 3 billion monthly actives and we're focused on growing its cultural influence. And I'm excited this year to get back to some OG Facebook. All right. So this is also going to be a pivotal year for the metaverse. The number of people using Quest and Horizon has been steadily growing, and this is a year when a number of long-term investments that we've been working on that will make the metaverse more visually stunning and inspiring will really start to land. So I think we’re going to know a lot more about Horizon's trajectory by the end of this year. This is also going to be a big year for redefining our relationship with governments. We now have a U.S. administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning, and that will defend our values and interests abroad. And I'm optimistic about the progress and innovation this is can unlock. So this is going to be a big year. I think this is the most exciting and dynamic that I have ever seen our industry. Between AI, glasses, massive infrastructure projects, doing a bunch of work to try to accelerate our business, and building the future of social media, we have a lot to do. And I think we're going to build some awesome things that shape the future of human connection. As always, I'm grateful for everyone who is on this journey with us. Thank you and here’s Susan."
META,2025-01-29,2025-01-30,,2025-01-29,2025-01-29T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-01-29,prepared,,Susan Li,"Thanks Mark and good afternoon everyone. Let’s begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q4 total revenue was $48.4 billion, up 21% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Q4 total expenses were $25 billion, up 5%, compared to last year. Before I cover the specific cost lines, I would note that our fourth quarter expense growth rate reflects a 13 percentage point favorable impact from legal accrual reductions in Q4 and lower year-over-year restructuring costs. In terms of the specific line items. Cost of revenue increased 15%, driven mostly by higher infrastructure costs. R&D increased 16%, primarily driven by higher employee compensation and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Marketing & Sales were approximately flat year-over-year. G&A decreased 67%, driven mostly by lower legal-related expenses due to a $1.55 billion reduction in legal accruals related to certain legal proceedings. We ended the year with over 74,000 employees, up 10% year-over-year, with growth primarily driven by hiring in priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, generative AI, Reality Labs, as well as regulation and compliance. Fourth quarter operating income was $23.4 billion, representing a 48% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 12%. Net income was $20.8 billion or $8.02 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $14.8 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $13.2 billion. We paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the year with $77.8 billion in cash and marketable securities and $28.8 billion in debt. Moving now to our segment results. I’ll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.3 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in December. Q4 Total Family of Apps revenue was $47.3 billion, up 21% year-over-year. And Q4 Family of Apps ad revenue was $46.8 billion, up 21% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World at 27%, followed by Asia-Pacific and Europe at 23% and 22%, respectively. North America grew 18%. In Q4, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 6% and the average price per ad increased 14%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific. Pricing growth benefited from increased advertiser demand, in part driven by improved ad performance. This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing regions and surfaces. Family of Apps other revenue was $519 million, up 55%, driven primarily by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q4, Family of Apps expenses were $19 billion, representing 76% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 5%, primarily due to growth in infrastructure costs and employee compensation, which were partially offset by lower legal-related expenses. Family of Apps operating income was $28.3 billion, representing a 60% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q4 revenue was $1.1 billion, driven by hardware sales and up 1% year-over-year. Reality Labs expenses were $6 billion, up 6% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher infrastructure costs and employee compensation, partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $5 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, daily actives continue to grow across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp year-over-year, both globally and in the United States. In Q4, global video time grew at double-digit percentages year-over-year on Instagram, and we’re seeing particular strength in the U.S. on Facebook, where video time spent was also up double-digit rates year-over-year. We see continued opportunities to drive video growth in 2025 through ongoing optimizations to our ranking systems. We’re also making several product bets that are focused on setting up our platforms for longer-term success. Creators are one of our central focuses. On Instagram, we continue to prioritize original posts in recommendations to help smaller creators get discovered. We also want to ensure creators have a place to experiment with their content, so we introduced a new feature in Q4 that allows creators to first share a Reel with people who don’t follow them. This allows them to test content and see what performs best before deciding to share it with their followers, and also helps introduce them to entirely new audiences. Creative tools is another area we’re investing in. In the coming weeks, we’ll launch a new standalone app called Edits that provides a full suite of creative tools to make it easier for creators to make great Reels on their phone. Another focus is making it easier for people to connect over content. Reels are already reshared over 4.5 billion times a day, and we’ve been introducing more features that bring together the social and entertainment aspects of Instagram. In the U.S., we recently launched a new destination in Reels that consists of content your friends have left a note on or liked. We’re seeing very positive early results and will look to expand this globally in the coming months. On Threads, we made tremendous progress in 2024 and our focus this year is establishing Threads as the place people come to keep up with what they care about. We’re making a number of updates to our recommendation systems to prioritize more recent posts, surface content from top creators, and ensure people see more of the content from accounts they follow. We will also continue improving custom feeds so people can build personalized feeds on topics they’re interested in. Finally, Meta AI usage continues to scale, with more than 700 million monthly actives. We’re now introducing updates that will enable Meta AI to deliver more personalized and relevant responses by remembering certain details from people’s prior queries and considering what they engage with on Facebook and Instagram to develop better intuition for their interests and preferences. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to grow supply on lower monetizing surfaces, like video, while optimizing ad supply on each of our surfaces to deliver ads at the time and place they will be most relevant to people. For example, we are continuing to better personalize when ads show up, including the optimal locations in the depth of someone’s feed, to introduce ad supply when it’s most optimal for the user and revenue. This is enabling efficient supply growth. Longer term, we also see impression growth opportunities on unmonetized surfaces like Threads, which we are beginning to test ads on this quarter. We expect the introduction of ads on Threads will be gradual and don’t anticipate it being a meaningful driver of overall impression or revenue growth in 2025. The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance. The ongoing enhancements to our ads ranking systems are an important driver of this work. In the second-half of 2024, we introduced an innovative new machine learning system in partnership with Nvidia, called Andromeda. This more efficient system enabled a 10,000 times increase in the complexity of models we use for ads retrieval, which is the part of the ranking process where we narrow down a pool of tens of millions of ads to the few thousand we consider showing someone. The increase in model complexity is enabling us to run far more sophisticated prediction models to better personalize, which ads we show someone. This has driven an 8% increase in the quality of ads that people see on objectives we’ve tested. Andromeda’s ability to efficiently process larger volumes of ads also positions us well for the future as advertisers use our generative AI tools to create and test more ads. Another way we’re delivering value for advertisers is through increased automation of their ad campaigns with Advantage+. Adoption of Advantage+ shopping campaigns continues to scale, with revenue surpassing a $20 billion annual run-rate and growing 70% year-over-year in Q4. Given the strong performance and interest we’re seeing in Advantage+ Shopping and our other end-to-end solutions, we’re testing a new streamlined campaign creation flow so advertisers no longer need to choose between running a manual or Advantage+ Sales or App campaign. In this new setup, all campaigns optimizing for sales, app or lead objectives will have Advantage+ turned on from the beginning. This will allow more advertisers to take advantage of the performance Advantage+ offers, while still having the ability to further customize aspects of their campaigns when they need to. We plan to expand to more advertisers in the coming months before fully rolling it out later in the year. Advantage+ creative is another area where we’re seeing momentum. More than 4 million advertisers are now using at least one of our generative AI ad creative tools, up from one million six months ago. There has been significant early adoption of our first video generation tool that we rolled out in October, Image Animation, with hundreds of thousands of advertisers already using it monthly. Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus remains investing capital back into the business, with infrastructure and talent being our top priorities. On the first, we expect compute will be central to many of the opportunities we’re pursuing as we advance the capabilities of Llama, drive increased usage of generative AI products and features across our platform, and fuel core ads and organic engagement initiatives. We’re working to meet the growing capacity needs for these services by both scaling our infrastructure footprint and increasing the efficiency of our workloads. Another way we’re pursuing efficiencies is by extending the useful lives of our servers and associated networking equipment. Our expectation going forward is that we’ll be able to use both our non-AI and AI servers for a longer period of time before replacing them, which we estimate will be approximately 5.5 years. This will deliver savings in annual CapEx and resulting depreciation expense, which is already included in our guidance. Finally, we’re pursuing cost efficiencies by deploying our custom MTIA silicon in areas where we can achieve a lower cost of compute by optimizing the chip to our unique workloads. In 2024 we started deploying MTIA to our ranking and recommendation inference workloads for ads and organic content. We expect to further ramp adoption of MTIA for these use cases throughout 2025 before extending our custom silicon efforts to training workloads for ranking and 0recommendations next year. From a hiring standpoint, our focus continues to be on adding technical talent to support our strategic priorities. In the fourth quarter, nearly 90% of our year-over-year headcount growth was within the R&D function. The remaining growth was primarily in cost of revenue as we added infrastructure headcount to support our data center operations. In 2025, we expect headcount growth will continue to be primarily driven by technical roles across our priority initiatives within infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative AI, as well as regulation and compliance. We anticipate headcount growth in our business functions will remain relatively limited. To achieve our ambitions in these areas, we will need to continue executing at a rapid pace. We’re supporting this by building tools to help our engineering base be more productive. As part of our efficiency focus over the past two years, we’ve made significant improvements in our internal processes and developer tools and introduced new tools like our AI-powered coding assistant, which is helping our engineers write code more quickly. Looking forward, we expect that the continuous advancements in Llama’s coding capabilities will provide even greater leverage to our engineers, and we are focused on expanding its capabilities to not only assist our engineers in writing and reviewing our code, but also to begin generating code changes to automate tool updates and improve the quality of our code base. Finally, we expect our strong financial position will enable us to support these investments while continuing to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Moving to our financial outlook. We expect first quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion. This reflects 8% to 15% year-over-year growth, or 11% to 18% growth on a constant currency basis as our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 3% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. This also reflects the effect of lapping leap day in the first quarter of 2024. While we are not providing a full-year 2025 revenue outlook, we expect the investments we’re making in our core business this year will give us an opportunity to continue delivering strong revenue growth throughout 2025. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full-year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114 billion to $119 billion. We expect the single largest driver of expense growth in 2025 to be infrastructure costs, driven by higher operating expenses and depreciation. We expect employee compensation to be the second-largest factor as we add technical talent in the priority areas that I referenced earlier. Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full-year 2025 capital expenditures will be in the range of $60 billion to $65 billion. We expect CapEx growth in 2025 will be driven by increased investment to support both our generative AI efforts and our core business. The majority of our CapEx in 2025 will continue to be directed toward our core business. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 15%. In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. In closing, this was a good year for our company, with investments across our priority areas delivering strong business performance and innovative new products for our community. We have a compelling set of opportunities to invest in this year, which we expect will help us drive continued strong growth and develop transformative technologies that shape the future of our company and of the industry. With that, Krista, let’s open up the call for questions."

Mark, I appreciate all the excitement about this year and all the innovation to come. I know there's a lot of announcements throughout the course of the year, but I wonder if you could just share a few sort of high-level examples of your vision on new potential use cases and offerings that could drive utility for your users and value for your advertisers. As you sort of think about Llama 4 and Meta AI changing throughout 2025? And then the second one on custom silicon, maybe a question for either of you. Just any learnings on the difference between your custom silicon and third-party chips in your ranking models and results? And how should we think about the main gating factors as to how quickly you'd be able to move a higher percentage of your engagement to your custom silicon? Thanks."
META,2025-01-29,2025-01-30,,2025-01-29,2025-01-29T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-01-29,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"On the first one, I tried to lay this out in my opening comments a bit. I mean we're very focused on Meta AI as a highly intelligent and personalized assistant that you can access across our apps. There's a website, you can access it outside of our apps, too. I think that the quality of this is just -- it's going to keep on improving and improved a lot over the last year. We're also finding more ways that it's useful to integrate it into our services to help more people discover it. I think that, that's undoubtedly why so many hundreds of millions of people are using it today, obviously, because it's kind of easy to discover what we're doing and then keep using it. I don't know. I want to keep some surprises and fun for the stuff that we're going to release this year. I gave a bit of detail on what we're planning to do with Llama 4 that I'm sure technical people will enjoy, because we haven't talked about that before. But I'm going to refrain from adding a whole lot more on what we're launching this year. But it's the different things that I talked about. It's Meta AI. I do expect Llama 4 to be a very exciting set of releases. It's not just one thing. Just like with Llama 3, there were kind of a few different models at different dates, I think we'll see that with Llama 4 too. And then the AI engineer piece, I'm really excited about it. I mean, I don't know that that's going to be an external product anytime soon. But I think for what we're working on, our goal is to advance AI research and advance our own development internally. And I think it's just going to be a very profound thing. So I mean that's something that I think will show up through making our products better over time. But -- and then as that works, there will potentially be a market opportunity down the road. But I mean, for now and this year, we're really -- I think this is -- I don't think you're going to see this year like an AI engineer that is extremely widely deployed, changing all of development. I think this is going to be the year where that really starts to become possible and lays the groundwork for a much more dramatic change in '26 and beyond. I don't know yes, that's kind of it."
META,2025-01-29,2025-01-30,,2025-01-29,2025-01-29T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-01-29,qa,,Susan Li,"Brian, I'm happy to take your second question about custom silicon. So first of all, we expect that we are continuing to purchase third-party silicon from leading providers in the industry. And we are certainly committed to those long-standing partnerships, but we're also very invested in developing our own custom silicon for unique workloads, where off-the-shelf silicon isn't necessarily optimal and specifically, because we're able to optimize the full stack to achieve greater compute efficiency and performance per cost and power because our workloads might require a different mix of memory versus network, bandwidth versus compute and so we can optimize that really to the specific needs of our different types of workloads. Right now, the in-house MTIA program is focused on supporting our core ranking and recommendation inference workloads. We started adopting MTIA in the first half of 2024 for core ranking and recommendations inference. We'll continue ramping adoption for those workloads over the course of 2025 as we use it for both incremental capacity and to replace some GPU-based servers when they reach the end of their useful lives. Next year, we're hoping to expand MTIA to support some of our core AI training workloads and over time, some of our Gen AI use cases."

Can you help us understand how your views continue to evolve with respect to the competitive dynamic around your approach with open source versus others in the industry? And how your approach to open source could possibly bend the cost curve and improve return on capital for AI over the medium to long-term? Thanks so much.
META,2025-01-29,2025-01-30,,2025-01-29,2025-01-29T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-01-29,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes. I mean on open source, I think the best analogy for us is what we did with open compute, where we weren't first to building the system. So then by the time that we got around to building it, it wasn't really a big advantage to have it be proprietary. So we shared it. And then a lot of the industry adopted what we were doing, contributed innovations back to it. By standardizing it on it, that meant that a bunch of supply chain standardized on building it, which made prices more efficient for everyone. I think what we see here is as Llama becomes more used, it's more likely, for example, that silicon providers and others -- other APIs and developer platforms will optimize their work more for that and basically drive down the costs of using it and drive improvements that we can, in some cases, use too. So I think that the strategy will continue to be effective, and yes, I mean, I continue to be optimistic about this. I think it's kind of -- I think it's working. I also just think in light of some of the recent news, the new competitor DeepSeek from China, I think it also just puts -- it's one of the things that we're talking about is there's going to be an open source standard globally. And I think for our kind of national advantage, it's important that it's an American standard. So we take that seriously, and we want to build the AI system that people around the world are using and I think that if anything, some of the recent news has only strengthened our conviction that this is the right thing for us to be focused on."

META,2025-01-29,2025-01-30,,2025-01-29,2025-01-29T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-01-29,qa,,Mark Shmulik,"Yes, thank you for taking my questions. Mark, I appreciate we may get an answer this year. But looking out, as you kind of track the progress of smart glasses, Orion and so forth, do you view that as a better form factor to get the most out of the Meta AI assistance you highlighted in your opening remarks? Or is it more complementary to kind of the in-app experience in the way you've seen people use it today? And then, Susan, the last few quarters, we've kind of seen pricing growth is the dominant driver of ad revenue growth. Given the efforts you've highlighted around driving deeper, more commercial engagement and better advertiser ROI, how do we just think about the contribution of the formula for ad revenue growth going forward? Thank you."
META,2025-01-29,2025-01-30,,2025-01-29,2025-01-29T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-01-29,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes. I mean, I can talk about glasses. I mean it's -- yes, I mean, I've said for a while that I think that glasses are the ideal form factor for an AI device, because you can let an AI assistant on your glasses see what you see and hear what you hear, which gives it the context to be able to understand everything that's going on in your life that you would want to talk to it about and get context on. So -- but look, I mean, I think the glasses are going to be a very important computing platform in the future. When phones became the primary computing platform, it's not like computers went away. I think we'll have phones for some time. But there are a lot of people in the world who have glasses. It's kind of hard for me to imagine that a decade or more from now, all the glasses aren't going to basically be AI glasses, as well as a lot of people who don't wear glasses today, finding that to be a useful thing. So I'm incredibly optimistic about this. And like I shared last year, I think one of the big surprises last year was I previously thought that glasses weren't going to become a major form factor until we got these -- the full kind of holographic displays that we started showing in the prototype for Orion. But now I think it's pretty clear that AI is actually going to drive at least as much of the value as the holographic AR is. So that's a cause to be excited. But look, the Ray-Ban Metas were hit. We still don't know what the long-term trajectory for this is going to be. And I think we're going to learn a lot this year. So I think that this is a really important year for that."
META,2025-01-29,2025-01-30,,2025-01-29,2025-01-29T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-01-29,qa,,Susan Li,"And I can take the second question on pricing growth. So first of all, what I would say is over the long term, we think we have continued opportunity to drive revenue growth across both pricing and impression growth, so both sort of supply and demand dimensions. When we look at pricing, our reported growth can be influenced by different factors such as supply because of the auction dynamics by the mix shift of the different types of surfaces where ads show up. For example, services like video or lower monetization efficiency, relatively speaking. And then, of course, broader macro factors. But we generally expect that we are going to be able to deliver ongoing ad performance improvements through a lot of the ongoing work that we're doing across our monetization road map and that will have the sort of effect of benefiting pricing overall. And part of what I think is kind of important to think about here when we think about price growth is we really -- the average price per ad as we reported, is really blending, it's an output metric. It's blending a lot of things that are happening, including what our advertiser is bidding for, what are their bids for those things? What is the average cost of their actions. So given that there are so many different objectives that advertisers can optimize for that have different values, it's a very complex metric that tries to distill that into one thing. Overall, we are seeing healthy cost per action trends for advertisers for whatever is the action that they are optimizing for. And we believe we'll continue to get better at driving conversions for advertisers. And when we do, that will have the effect of continuing to lift CPMs over time, because we're delivering more conversions per impression served, resulting in higher value impressions."

Mark, you mentioned political changes in the U.S. and better positioning maybe for U.S. companies abroad. But how do you think about it in the U.S. as far as usage and advertiser adoption, you got rid of fact checking. So do you think the content could change? Could it appeal to more users? Will that impact advertising at all? And then Susan, on Meta AI, I know people are pretty excited about the use case, but also thinking about the revenue case. How do you think about monetizing that? Could it be CPC ads? Or how are you thinking about that? Thank you."
META,2025-01-29,2025-01-30,,2025-01-29,2025-01-29T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-01-29,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"The question was about fact checking and our content policies. I mean, look, I think we're trying to build the service that we think is the best for people. I believe in free expression for quite a while. People don't want to see misinformation, but you need to build an effective system that gives people more context. And I think what we found over time is that the community note system, I think, is just going to be more effective than the system that we had before. And I'm not afraid to admit when someone does something that's better than us. I think it's sort of our job to go and just do best work and implement the best systems. So I think that there's been a lot of people who have read this announcement is if we somehow don't care about adding context to things that are on our platform that are misinformation, that's not right. I actually think that the community note system, like what X has had for a while is actually just more effective than what we were doing before. And I think our product is going to get better because of it."

So we're continuing to see strong advertiser demand. Again, particularly for AI-powered tools that are helping businesses maximize the value of their ad spend. So our commitment to brand safety is unchanged, and we expect that we will invest in our suite of tools to meet the needs of advertisers. On your second question in terms of monetizing Meta AI, our initial focus for Meta AI is really about building a great consumer experience, and that's frankly, where all of our energies are kind of directed to right now. There will, I think, be pretty clear monetization opportunities over time, including paid recommendations and including a premium offering, but really not where we are focused in terms of the development of Meta AI today."

Mark, just following up on open source as DeepSeek and other models potentially leverage Llama or others to train faster and cheaper. How does this impact in your view? And what could have been for the trajectory of investment required over a multiyear period? And then, Susan, just as we think about the $60 billion to $65 billion CapEx this year, does the composition change much from last year when you talked about servers as the largest part followed by data centers and networking equipment. And how should we think about that mix between like training and inference just following up on Jan's post this week? Thanks."
META,2025-01-29,2025-01-30,,2025-01-29,2025-01-29T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-01-29,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"I can start on the DeepSeek question. I think there's a number of novel things that they did that I think we're still digesting. And there are a number of things that they have advances that we will hope to implement in our systems. And that's part of the nature of how this works, whether it's a Chinese competitor or not. I kind of expect that every new company that has an advance -- that has a launch is going to have some new advances that the rest of the field learns from. And that's sort of how the technology industry goes. I don't know -- it's probably too early to really have a strong opinion on what this means for the trajectory around infrastructure and CapEx and things like that. There are a bunch of trends that are happening here all at once. There's already sort of a debate around how much of the compute infrastructure that we're using is going to go towards pretraining versus as you get more of these reasoning time models or reasoning models where you get more of the intelligence by putting more of the compute into inference, whether just will mix shift how we use our compute infrastructure towards that. That was already something that I think a lot of the other labs and ourselves were starting to think more about and already seemed pretty likely even before this, that -- like of all the compute that we're using, that the largest pieces aren't necessarily going to go towards pre-training. But that doesn't mean that you need less compute, because one of the new properties that's emerged is the ability to apply more compute at inference time in order to generate a higher level of intelligence and a higher quality of service, which means that as a company that has a strong business model to support this, I think that's generally an advantage that we're now going to be able to provide a higher quality of service than others, who don't necessarily have the business model to support it on a sustainable basis. The other thing is just that when we're building things like Meta AI, but also how we're implementing AI into all the feeds and ad products and things like that, we're just serving billions of people, which is different from, okay, you start to pretrain a model, and that model is sort of agnostic to how many people are using it, like at some level, it's going to be expensive for us to serve all of these people, because we are serving a lot of people. And so I'm not sure what the kind of net effect of all of this is. The field continues to move quickly. There's a lot to learn from releases from basically everyone who does something interesting, not just the ones over the last month. We'll continue to kind of incorporate that into what we do as well as making novel contributions to the field ourselves And I continue to think that investing very heavily in CapEx and infra is going to be a strategic advantage over time. It's possible that we'll learn otherwise at some point, but I just think it's way too early to call that. And at this point, I would bet that the ability to build out that kind of infrastructure is going to be a major advantage for both the quality of the service and being able to serve the scale that we want to."

So we certainly expect that 2025 CapEx is going to grow across all three of those components you described. Servers will be the biggest growth driver that remains the largest portion of our overall CapEx budget. We expect both growth in AI capacity as we support our gen AI efforts and continue to invest meaningfully in core AI, but we are also expecting growth in non-AI capacity as we invest in the core business, including to support a higher base of engagement and to refresh our existing servers. On the data center side, we're anticipating higher data center spend in 2025 to be driven by build-outs of our large training clusters and our higher power density data centers that are entering the core construction phase. We're expecting to use that capacity primarily for core AI and non-AI use cases. On the networking side, we expect networking spend to grow in ‘25 as we build higher-capacity networks to accommodate the growth in non-AI and core AI-related traffic along with our large Gen AI training clusters. We're also investing in fiber to handle future cross-region training traffic. And then in terms of the breakdown for core versus Gen AI use cases, we're expecting total infrastructure spend within each of Gen AI, non-AI and core AI to increase in '25 with the majority of our CapEx directed to our core business with some caveat that, that is -- that's not easy to measure perfectly as the data centers we're building can support AI or non-AI workloads and the GPU-based servers, we procure for gen AI can be repurposed for core AI use cases and so on and so forth. But overall, I would reiterate what Mark said. We are committed to building leading foundation models and applications. We expect that we're going to make big investments to support our training and inference objectives, and we don't know exactly where we are in the cycle of that yet."

So for Facebook, a lot of people use Facebook every day, and it's an important part of their lives. And I think that there are a lot of opportunities to make it way more culturally influential than it is today. And I think that, that's sort of a fun and interesting goal that will take our product development in some interesting directions that we maybe have a focus on it as much over the last several years. So I don't know that I have anything much more specific on this other than that this is going to be one of my focus areas for this year. I mean, I think it's an investment area and something I'm going to spend some time on it. It might mean that in the near-term, we make some trade-offs to kind of focus on some product areas of what we're doing ahead of just kind of maximizing business results in the near term on it. But overall, I'm really excited about doing some exciting stuff here. And I'm not going to get into many specifics now, but we'll get -- we'll follow up on this over the next, I don't know, call it, a year as we start rolling it out and I think some of this will kind of get back to how Facebook was originally used back in the day.

We are in a phase where we are really learning a lot from the way that people engage with Meta AI. So from an app perspective, WhatsApp continues to see the strongest Meta AI usage across our family of apps. People there are using it most frequently for information seeking and educational queries along with emotional support use cases. Most of the WhatsApp engagement is in one-on-one threads, though we see some usage in group messaging. And on Facebook, which is the second largest driver of Meta AI engagement, we're seeing strong engagement from our feed deep dives integration that lets people ask Meta AI questions about the content that is recommended to that. So across, I would say, all query types, we continue to see signs that Meta AI is helping people leverage our apps for new use cases. We talked about information gathering, social interaction and communication. Lots of people use it for humor and casual conversation. They use it for writing and editing research recommendations. And as we look forward to 2025 in our Meta AI road map, we are really focused on doing more to make it feel more personalized. So I would say some of the most exciting features we're working on, including improving sort of the memory dimension of the Meta AI experience. We'll be able to remember certain details that people share in one-on-one chats, for example, and use those details to personalize its responses and then really increasing its ability to deliver great content recommendations and enhance really what makes Facebook and Instagram, so valuable for people today."

Could you talk a little bit about the constraints you're seeing or where you're seeing constraints, either internally resources planning or externally and any one -- any parts of the ecosystem? And then on the second one, I'm curious, as you think about your needs for hiring and we just think about -- we know you gave the OpEx guide for this year. But as we think about future needs for hiring, could you just give us a sense of how we should think about that? You announced the performance-related reductions earlier this -- for early this year. Could you just talk about how we should be thinking about that '26, '27 and beyond? Thank you."
META,2025-01-29,2025-01-30,,2025-01-29,2025-01-29T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-01-29,qa,,Susan Li,"Sure. I'm happy to take both of those. So on your first question on just where do we see constraints in our ability to execute against our CapEx plans. Obviously, we are staying on top of supply availability. That is certainly one of the factors that will influence our CapEx spend in 2025, but we don't really have any updates to share on supply availability right now. We are planning to significantly ramp up deployment of GPUs in 2025, and we'll continue to engage with our vendors and invest in our own silicon to meet those needs. When you asked how to think about capital intensity, we're not really -- as both Mark and I alluded to in our prior comments, I think it is really too early to determine what long-run capital intensity is going to look like. There are so many different factors. The pace of advancement in underlying models, how efficient can they be? What is the adoption and use case of our Gen AI products, what performance gains come from next-generation hardware innovations, both our own and third-party and then ultimately, what monetization or other efficiency gains our AI investments unlock. So again, I think we are sort of early in the journey here, and we don't have -- I would say we don't have kind of anything to share about long-run capital intensity yet. Your second question was about thinking about hiring needs. So it's a good segue after infrastructure, employee compensation is the next largest driver of expense growth in 2025. And here, growth in employee comp and headcount more broadly is primarily driven by those areas that I mentioned, infrastructure monetization, generative AI, Reality Labs and regulation and compliance. And those generally are more technical organizations. That means that it is a higher cost base relative to business functions where we are also expecting to keep headcount growth constrained. And I would say we are -- we're focused on running the company efficiently. But at the same time, it is -- we feel like we're in a critical period in terms of making sure that we are investing to win, and we want to make sure that we staff those priority areas in a way that really positions us to best do that."

META,2025-01-29,2025-01-30,,2025-01-29,2025-01-29T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-01-29,qa,,Operator,And that question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.
META,2025-01-29,2025-01-30,,2025-01-29,2025-01-29T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-01-29,qa,,Ross Sandler,"Yes. One for Mark, on agents. So we all saw OpenAI's operator demo last week. So Mark, as the industry moves from chat to agentic behavior and more commercial intent moves into these AI products? I guess how are you thinking about monetization potential for Meta AI? And then how might Llama 4 reasoning help drive some of these new agentic experiences for Meta AI? Thank you."
META,2025-01-29,2025-01-30,,2025-01-29,2025-01-29T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-01-29,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes. So I guess a couple of things that I'd say on this. One is when you're thinking about agents and reasoning, a lot of this is about being able to perform multistep tasks. So right now, the way that a lot of these systems work as you kind of say something and then it responds and it's almost chat like. But I think that the direction that it's going is you're going to be able to give it an intent or a task and it's going to be able to go off and use sort of an arbitrary amount of compute as much as you want to use on it to be able to do a task. Some of the tasks might be pretty simple for people go buy a specific thing. Some of them might be really hard, like go write an app or optimize this code and like really make it as good as possible. And that type of thing, I think, is just going to start becoming more and more prevalent over the next a year or two. So I think it's very exciting. It's sort of we'll feel in some ways like the current products are just getting smarter and others, it will feel like sort of a new form factor, because it won't be as much like chat. But it's sort of another generation of these products. So I think it's just in general, there's a lot to build and be excited about. I guess my note of caution or just my kind of periodic reminder on our product development process, if you will, is we build these product. We try to scale them to reach usually 1 billion people or more. And it's at that point once they're at scale that we really start focusing on monetization. So sometimes we'll experiment with monetization before, we're running some experiments with Threads now, for example. But we typically don't really ramp these things up or see them as meaningfully contributing to the business until we reach quite a big scale. So the thing that I think is going to be meaningful this year is the kind of getting of the AI product to scale. Last year was sort of the introduction and starting to get to be used. This year my kind of expectation and hope is that we will be at a sufficient scale and have sufficient kind of flywheel of people using it and improvement from that, that this will have a durable advantage. But that doesn't mean that it's going to be a major contributor to the business. This year the improvements of the business are going to be taking the AI methods and applying them to advertising and recommendations and feeds and things like that. So the actual business opportunity for Meta AI and AI studio and business agents and people interacting with these AIs remains outside of '25 for the most part. And I think that's an important thing for us to communicate and for people to internalize as you're thinking about our prospects here. But nonetheless, we've run a process like this many times. We built a product. We make it good. We scale it to be large. We build out the business around it. That's what we do. I'm very optimistic, but it's going to take some time."

META,2025-04-30,2025-05-01,,2025-04-30,2025-04-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-04-30,prepared,,Mark Zuckerberg,"All right. Thanks, Ken. Thanks, everyone, for joining today. We've had a strong start to the year. Our community keeps growing with more than 3.4 billion people now using at least one of our apps each day. Our business is also performing very well, and I think we're well-positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty. The major theme right now, of course, is how AI is transforming everything we do and, as we continue to increase our investments and focus more for our resources on AI, probably useful today to lay out the five major opportunities that we are focused on. Those are improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business engaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI and AI devices. And these are each long-term investments that are downstream from us building general intelligence and leading AI models and infrastructure. Even with our significant investments, we don't need to succeed in all of these areas to have a good ROI. But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making. The first opportunity is improved advertising. Our goal is to make it so that any business can basically tell us what objective they're trying to achieve like selling something or getting a new customer and how much they're willing to pay for each result, and then we just do the rest. Businesses used to have to generate their own ad creative and define what audiences they wanted to reach, but AI has already made us better at targeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in their products than many businesses are themselves, and that keeps improving. And now AI is generating better creative options for many businesses as well. I think that this is really redefining what advertising is into an AI agent that delivers measurable business results at scale. And if we deliver on this vision, then over the coming years, I think that the increased productivity from AI will make advertising a meaningfully larger share of global GDP than it is today. In just the last quarter, we are testing a new ads recommendation model for reels, which has already increased conversion rates by 5%, and we're seeing 30% more advertisers are using AI creative tools in the last quarter as well. The second opportunity is more engaging experiences. This will come in two forms, better recommendations for existing content types and better new types of content. In the last six months, improvements to our recommendation systems have led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and 35% on Threads. Threads now also has more than 350 million monthly actives and continues to be on track to become our next major social app. In addition to better recommendations for existing content types, AI is also enabling the creation of better content as well. Some of this will be helping people produce better content to share themselves. Some of this will be AI generating content directly for people that is personalized for them. Some of this will be in existing formats like photos and videos, and some of it will be increasingly interactive. I've often talked about this long-term trend of content becoming richer over time. Our feeds started mostly with text and then became mostly photos, we all got mobile phones with cameras, and then became mostly video when mobile networks became fast enough to handle that well. We are now in the video era, but I don't think that this is the end of the line. In the near future, I think that we're going to have content in our feeds that you can interact within that, it will interact back with you rather than you just watching it. Over the long-term, as AI unlocks more productivity in the economy, I also expect that people will spend more of their time on engaging experiences across all of these apps. The third opportunity is business messaging. Right now the vast majority of our business is advertising and feeds on Facebook and Instagram. But WhatsApp now has more than 3 billion monthly actives with more than 100 million people in the U.S. and growing quickly there. Messenger is also used by more than a billion people each month, and there are now as many messages sent each day on Instagram as there are on Messenger. So business messaging should be the next pillar of our business. In countries like Thailand and Vietnam, where there is a low cost of labor, we see many businesses conduct commerce through our messaging apps. There's actually so much business through messaging that those countries are both in our Top 10 or 11 by revenue, even though they're ranked in the 30s in global GDP. This phenomenon hasn't yet spread to developed countries, because the cost of labor is too high, to make this a profitable model before AI, but AI should solve this. So in the next few years, I expect that, just like every business today has an email address, social media account and website, they'll also have an AI business agent that can do customer support and sales, and they should be able to set that up very easily given all the context that they've already put into our business platforms. And we're going to have more to share on upcoming calls about our progress in this area. The fourth opportunity is Meta AI. Across our apps, there are now almost a billion monthly actives using Meta AI. Our focus for this year is deepening the experience and making AI the leading personal AI with an emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment. I think that we're all going to have an AI that we talk to throughout the day, while we're browsing content on our phones, and eventually, as we're going through our days with glasses. And I think that this is going to be one of the most important and valuable services that has ever been created. In addition to building Meta AI into our apps, we just released our first Meta AI standalone app. It is personalized, so you can talk to it about interests that you've shown while browsing reels or different content across our apps. And we built a social feed into it so you can discover entertaining ways that others are using Meta AI, and initial feedback on the app has been good so far. Over time, I expect that the business opportunity for Meta AI to follow our normal product development playbook. First, we build and scale the product, and then once it is at scale, then we focus on revenue. In this case, I think that there will be a large opportunity to show product recommendations or ads, as well as a premium service for people who want to unlock more compute for additional functionality or intelligence. But I expect that we're going to be largely focused on scaling and deepening engagement for at least the next year, before we'll really be ready to start building out the business here. The fifth opportunity is AI devices, which is increasingly how we are thinking about our work on the next-generation of computing platforms. Glasses are the ideal form factor for both AI and the Metaverse. They enable you to let an AI see what you see, hear what you hear, and talk to you throughout the day, and they let you blend the physical and digital worlds together with holograms. More than a billion people worldwide wear glasses today. And it seems highly likely that these will become AI glasses over the next five to 10-years. Building the devices that people use to experience our services, lets us deliver the highest quality AI and social experiences, and this will serve as an amplifier on all of the opportunities I've mentioned so far, as well as unlocking some new opportunities as well. Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses have tripled in sales in the last year, and the people who have them are using them a lot. We've got some exciting new launches with our partner, EssilorLuxottica, later this year, as well that should expand that category and add some new technological capabilities to the glasses. On Quest, we are also seeing deeper engagement as Quest 3S makes VR accessible to more people, and more people are creating experiences in horizon with AI tools. Now, everything that I've talked about today is built on top of our AI models and our infrastructure. We released the first Llama 4 models earlier this month. They are some of the most intelligent, best multimodal, lowest latency, and most efficient models that anyone has built. We have more models on the way, including the massive Llama 4 behemoth model. Overall, we are focused on building full general intelligence. All of the opportunities that I've discussed today are downstream of delivering general intelligence and doing so efficiently. The pace of progress across the industry and the opportunities ahead for us are staggering. I want to make sure that we're working aggressively and efficiently, and I also want to make sure that we are building out the leading infrastructure and teams that we need to achieve our goals. So to that end, we are accelerating some of our efforts to bring capacity online more quickly this year, as well as some longer-term projects that will give us the flexibility to add capacity in the coming years as well. And that has increased our planned investment for this year. More broadly, this has been a good start to what I expect will continue to be an intense year. We've got a lot more exciting work in the pipeline that I'm looking forward to sharing soon. I continue to think that this year is going to be a pivotal moment for our industry, and I'm grateful for everyone who is working so hard at the Company to deliver all this amazing technology and new experiences. As always, thank you all for being on this journey with us, `and now, Susan."
META,2025-04-30,2025-05-01,,2025-04-30,2025-04-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-04-30,prepared,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $42.3 billion, up 16% or 19% on a constant currency basis. Q1 total expenses were $24.8 billion, up 9% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 14%, driven primarily by higher infrastructure costs and payments to partners, partially offset by a benefit from the previously announced extension of server useful lives. R&D increased 22%, mostly due to higher employee compensation and infrastructure costs. Marketing and sales increased 8%, driven mainly by an increase in professional services related to our ongoing platform integrity efforts. G&A decreased 34%, driven primarily by lower legal-related costs. We ended Q1 with over 76,800 employees, up 4% quarter-over-quarter. First quarter operating income was $17.6 billion, representing a 41% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 9%, as we recognized excess tax benefits from share-based compensation due to the increase in our share price versus prior periods. Net expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $13.7 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $10.3 billion. We repurchased $13.4 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $70.2 billion in cash and marketable securities, and $28.8 billion in debt. Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.4 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March. Q1 total Family of Apps revenue was $41.9 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Q1 Family of Apps' ad revenue was $41.4 billion, up 16% or 20% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and North America at 19% and 18%, respectively. Europe and Asia-Pacific grew 14% and 12%. In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 5%, and the average price per ad increased 10%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific. Pricing growth benefited from increased advertiser demand, in part driven by improved ad performance. This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing regions and surfaces. Family of Apps' other revenue was $510 million, up 34%, driven mostly by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business platform, as well as Meta Verified subscriptions. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q1, Family of Apps' expenses were $20.1 billion, representing 81% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps' expenses were up 10%, mainly due to growth in employee compensation and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower legal-related expenses. Family of Apps' operating income was $21.8 billion, representing a 52% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $412 million, down 6% year-over-year due to lower Meta Quest sales, which were partially offset by increased sales of RayBan Meta AI glasses. Reality Labs' expenses were $4.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher employee compensation. Reality Labs' operating loss was $4.2 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, we're focused both on enhancing our core Family of Apps today and building the next generation of devices and experiences through Reality Labs. I'll start with our Family of Apps. In the first quarter, we saw strong growth in video consumption across both Facebook and Instagram, particularly in the U.S., where video time spent grew double-digits year-over-year. This growth continues to be driven primarily by ongoing enhancements to our recommendation systems, and we see opportunities to deliver further gains this year. We're also progressing on longer-term efforts to develop innovative new approaches to recommendations. A big focus of this work will be on developing increasingly efficient recommendation systems, so that we can continue scaling up the complexity and compute used to train our models, while avoiding diminishing returns. There are promising techniques we're working on that will incorporate the innovations from LLM model architectures to achieve this. Another area that is showing early promise is integrating LLM technology into our content recommendation systems. For example, we're finding that LLM's ability to understand a piece of content more deeply than traditional recommendation systems can help better identify, what is interesting to someone about a piece of content leading to better recommendations. We began testing using Llama and Threads recommendation systems at the end of last year, given the app's text-based content, and have already seen a 4% lift in time spent from the first launch. It remains early here, but a big focus this year will be on exploring how we can deploy this for other content types, including photos and videos. We also expect this to be complementary to Meta AI, as it can provide more relevant responses to people's queries by better understanding their interests and preferences through their interactions across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. Earlier this year, we began testing the ability for Meta AI to better personalize its responses by remembering certain details from people's prior queries and considering what that person engages with on our apps. We are already seeing this lead to deeper engagement with people we've rolled it out to, and it is now built into Meta AI across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and our new standalone Meta AI app in the U.S. and Canada. We're also continuing to focus on helping people connect over content. In Q1, we launched a new experience on Instagram in the U.S., that consists of a feed of content your friends have left a note on or liked, and we're seeing good results. We also just launched Blend, which is an opt-in experience in direct messages that enables you to blend your reels algorithm with your friends to spark conversations over each other's interests. These features all lean into Instagram's position at the intersection of entertainment and social connection. WhatsApp remains at its core a private messaging app, but it has evolved to also become a place people come to get updates from accounts they are connected to or follow. Today, there are tens of billions of views of status posts on WhatsApp each day, and we continue to invest in the Updates tab, as a place people can go to do more. Creators remain another big focus for us, and we're investing in tools to help them produce the best original content on our platforms. Last week, we launched our standalone Edits app, which supports the full creative process for video creators from inspiration and creation to performance insights. Edits has an ultra-high resolution short-form video camera and includes generative AI tools that enable people to remove the background of any video or animate still images, with more features coming soon. Moving to Reality Labs, we're seeing very strong traction with RayBan Meta AI glasses with over 4 times as many monthly actives as a year ago, and the number of people using voice commands is growing even faster as people use it to answer questions and control their glasses. This month, we fully rolled out live translations on RayBan Meta AI glasses to all markets for English, French, Italian, and Spanish. Now, when you are speaking to someone in one of these languages, you'll hear what they say in your preferred language through the glasses in real time. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to optimize ad supply across each service to better deliver ads at the time and place they are most relevant to people. We are also starting to introduce ads on unmonetized surfaces like Threads, which we opened up to all eligible advertisers this month to reach people in over 30 different markets to start, including the U.S. As we do for any newly monetized surface, we expect to gradually ramp ad supply as we optimize the ad formats and ensure they feel native to the app. We don't expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of overall impression or revenue growth in 2025. The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance. We're continuing to improve our ad systems by developing new modeling technologies to more efficiently predict the right ad to show. In Q1, we introduced our new Generative Ads Recommendation Model, or GEM for ads ranking. This model uses a new architecture we developed that is twice as efficient at improving ad performance for a given amount of data and compute. This efficiency gain enabled us to significantly scale up the amount of compute we use for model training with GEM trained on thousands of GPUs, our largest cluster for ads training to date. We began testing the new model for ads recommendations on Facebook Reels earlier this year and have seen up to a 5% increase in ad conversions. We're now rolling it out to additional services across our apps. On the ads product side, we're seeing continued momentum with our Advantage+ suite of AI-powered solutions. We've been encouraged by the initial tests of our streamlined campaign creation flow for sales, app, and lead campaigns, which starts with Advantage+ turned on from the beginning for advertisers. In April, we rolled this out to more advertisers and expect to complete the global rollout later this year. We're also seeing strong adoption of Advantage+ creative. This week, we are broadening access of video expansion to Facebook Reels for all eligible advertisers, enabling them to automatically adjust the aspect ratio of their existing videos by generating new pixels in each frame to optimize their ads for full-screen surfaces. We also rolled out Image Generation to all eligible advertisers, and this quarter, we plan to continue testing a new virtual try-on feature that uses Gen AI to place clothing on virtual models, helping customers visualize how an item may look and fit. Last, we continue to evolve our ads platform to drive results that are optimized for each business's objectives and the way they measure value. One example of this is our incremental attribution feature, which enables advertisers to optimize for driving incremental conversions or conversions we believe would not have occurred without an ad being shown. We're seeing strong results in testing so far with advertisers using incremental attribution in tests, seeing an average 46% lift in incremental conversions compared to their business-as-usual approach. We expect to make this available to all advertisers in the coming weeks. Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus remains investing capital back into the business, with infrastructure and talent being our top priorities. Starting with headcount, our hiring continues to be targeted at technical roles within our company priorities. In the first quarter, the significant majority of the roughly 2,800 employees we added were to support our priorities of monetization, infrastructure, generative AI, regulation and compliance, and Reality Labs. On infrastructure, we have two primary focuses to meet the growing compute needs of our services and AI initiatives. The first way is by significantly scaling up our infrastructure footprint. Our CapEx growth this year is going toward both generative AI and core business needs, with the majority of overall CapEx supporting the core. We expect the significant infrastructure footprint we are building will not only help us meet the demands of our business in the near term, but also provide us an advantage in the quality and scale of AI services we can deliver. We continue to build this capacity in a way that grants us maximum flexibility in how and when we deploy it to ensure we have the agility to react to how the technology and industry develop in the coming years. The second way we're meeting our compute needs is by increasing the efficiency of our workloads. In fact, many of the innovations coming out of our ranking work are focused on increasing the efficiency of our systems. This emphasis on efficiency is helping us deliver consistently strong returns from our core AI initiatives. For example, we shared on the Q3 2024 call that improvements to our AI-driven feed and video recommendations drove a roughly 8% lift in time spent on Facebook and a 6% lift on Instagram over the first nine months of last year. Since then, we've been able to deliver similar gains in just six months’ time with improvements to our AI recommendations delivering 7% and 6% time spent gains on Facebook and Instagram, respectively. Before moving to our financial guidance, I want to acknowledge the dynamic macro environment and note that our range reflects the potential for a wider set of outcomes. We continue to feel good about the fundamental drivers of revenue growth and believe the past work we've done to streamline our operations and cost profile puts us in a strong position to navigate a variety of outcomes. Moving to our financial outlook. We expect second quarter of 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $42.5 billion to $45.5 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $113 billion to $118 billion, lowered from our prior outlook of $114 billion to $119 billion. Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, will be in the range of $64 billion to $72 billion, increased from our prior outlook of $60 billion to $65 billion. This updated outlook reflects additional data center investments to support our AI efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware. The majority of our CapEx in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 15%. In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US, that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. The European Commission recently announced its decision that our subscription for no ads model is not compliant with the DMA. Based on feedback from the European Commission in connection with the DMA, we expect we will need to make some modifications to our model, which could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to our European business and revenue as early as the third quarter of 2025. We will appeal the Commission's DMA decision, but any modifications to our model may be imposed before or during the appeal process. In closing, this was another solid quarter for our business. We believe the investments we're making across our company priorities will position us well in the coming years to continue delivering engaging services for our community, compelling results for advertisers, and strong business performance. With that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions."

META,2025-04-30,2025-05-01,,2025-04-30,2025-04-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-04-30,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on Llama. Mark, can you -- the LLM landscape continues to sort of evolve and be somewhat competitive. Can you sort of talk us through some of the key areas of advancement you are most focused on and excited about as we sort of think about behemoth and next versions of Llama to come? And then the second one on Meta AI, almost a billion users globally. Any help on sort of how you're seeing US traction there and the types of recurring user behaviors that you're seeing in the early Meta AI use cases? Thanks."
META,2025-04-30,2025-05-01,,2025-04-30,2025-04-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-04-30,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Sure. I can talk about the LLMs. On the Meta AI usage, I'm not sure if we have more stats to share on that now. Yes, it's -- I mean, I'll defer to Susan on if there's anything that we're ready on that. On the LLM, yes, there's a lot of progress being made in a lot of different dimensions. And the reason why we want to build this out is, one is that we think it's important that for kind of how critical this is for our business that we sort of have control of our own destiny and are not depending on another company for something so critical. But two, we want to make sure that we can shape the development to be optimized for our infrastructure and the use cases that we want. So to that end, Llama 4, the shape of the model with 17 billion parameters per expert, was designed specifically for the infrastructure that we have in order to provide low latency experience to be voice optimized. One of the key things if you're having a voice conversation with AI is it needs to be low latency. So that way, when you're having a conversation with it, there is no large gap between when you stop speaking and it starts. So everything from the shape of the model to the research that we're doing to the techniques that go into it are kind of fit into that. Similarly, another thing that we focused on was context window length. And in some of our models, we have really -- we're industry-leading on context window length, and part of the reason why we think that that's important is because we're very focused on providing a personalized experience. And there are different ways that you can put personalized -- personalization context into an LLM, but one of the ways to do it is to include some of that context in the context window and having a long context window that can incorporate a lot of the background that the person has shared across our apps is one way to do that. So that's like -- it kind of is giving you a flavor of the products that we're trying to build and then some specific technical architecture decisions and research prioritization that we basically have made in order to deliver the specific experience that we're going for. I could go on and add a lot more. The reason -- I think it's also very important to deliver big models like Behemoth, not because we're going to end up serving them in production, but because of the technique of distilling from larger models, right? The Llama 4 models that we've published so far and the ones that we're using internally and some of the ones that we'll build in the future are basically distilled from the Behemoth model in order to get the 90%, 95% of the intelligence of the large model in a form factor that is much lower latency and much more efficient. So these things are all very important. Obviously, we wouldn't be able to do that kind of distillation from other closed models. So that kind of gives you a flavor for how we're thinking about the development of this. And then, of course, the models and the infrastructure that we're building out power all of the opportunities that I mentioned before."

The top use case right now for Meta AI from a query perspective is really around information gathering as people are using it to search for and understand and analyze information, followed by social interactions from -- ranging from casual chatting to more in-depth discussion or debate. We also see people use it for writing assistance, interacting with visual content, seeking help. And we see Meta -- people engage with Meta AI from several different entry points. WhatsApp continues to see the strongest Meta AI usage across our family of apps. Most of that WhatsApp engagement is in one-on-one Threads, followed by Facebook, which is the second largest driver of Meta AI engagement, where we're seeing strong engagement from our Feed deep-dives integration that lets people ask Meta AI questions about the content that's recommended to them. And we're obviously excited about the launch of the Meta AI standalone app."
META,2025-04-30,2025-05-01,,2025-04-30,2025-04-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-04-30,qa,,Operator,Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Maybe following up on Brian's question and coming at it from a different angle, and appreciate the color on the use cases you're seeing today for Meta AI. How would you suspect those use cases evolve with a standalone app? Can you bring us into a little bit the decision process to do a standalone app, what that might change in terms of utility, frequency, or scale relative to what you see inside Family of Apps today? And how do you think about positioning Meta AI as a standalone app against the competitive landscape today of other standalone sorts of consumer AI apps? Thank you."

We're going to focus on both integrating it into our Family of Apps in more ways and building a standalone experience. I think some people want faster access to it or a more built-out feature set than you can build into an app like WhatsApp, so the standalone app will be valuable for that. I also think that the standalone app is going to be particularly important in the United States because WhatsApp, as Susan said, is the largest surface that people use Meta AI in, which makes sense if you want to text an AI, having that be closely integrated and a good experience in the messaging app that you use makes a lot of sense. But we're -- while we have more than 100 million people use WhatsApp in the United States, it -- we're clearly not the primary messaging app in the United States at this point, iMessage. We hope to become the leader over time, but we're in a different position there than we are in most of the rest of the world on WhatsApp. So I think that the Meta AI app as a standalone is going to be particularly important in the United States to establishing leadership in -- as the main personal AI that people use. But we're going to keep on advancing the experiences across the board in all of these different areas."

Just on the guide in the second quarter, there are reports of potential supply issues in e-commerce. How you thought about that in the guide, and maybe how you're thinking about it for the back half? And then on a bigger picture question, your CapEx spend is now on close to some hyperscalers with very big client bases? Just help us conceptualize the kind of ecosystem you're building with your CapEx. I know you gave a lot of help on the intro, but maybe the ROI works without direct enterprise spend to drive revenues. How you're thinking about that? Thank you."
META,2025-04-30,2025-05-01,,2025-04-30,2025-04-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-04-30,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Justin. On the Q2 guide, there is uncertainty, obviously, and how the macro environment will evolve over time and how that could impact different segments of our business. Our Q2 revenue outlook aims to factor that in and partly -- that's partly why the $3 billion range reflects the potential for a wider range of outcomes. Specifically, we have seen some reduced spend in the US from Asia-based e-commerce exporters, which we believe is in anticipation of the de minimis exemption going away on May 2nd. A portion of that spend has been redirected to other markets, but overall spend for those advertisers is below the levels prior to April. But our Q2 outlook reflects the trends we're seeing so far in April, which have generally been healthy. So it's very early and hard to know how things will play out over the quarter, and certainly harder to know that for the rest of the year. Your second question is about why we're investing more in CapEx. And we really believe that our ability to build world-class infrastructure gives us a meaningful advantage in both developing the leading AI technology and services over the coming years, and there are a lot of opportunities also for us to improve our core business by putting more compute against our ads and recommendation work. So even with the capacity that we're bringing online in 2025, we are having a hard time meeting the demand that teams have for compute resources across the company. So we are going to continually invest meaningfully here across our infrastructure footprint, but we are also really looking to build this capacity in a way that gives us the maximum flexibility in how and when we deploy it over the coming years. So we can respond to how the market and technology develop."

Just on the higher range for CapEx, can you just help us understand how much of that is tied to the additional data center investments versus the increased hardware costs, and really what's driving those higher hardware costs? And then separately, there have been some articles suggesting that you've been looking to partner to share some of the costs of the AI infrastructure build-out. Can you just help us understand your thought process there and some of the pros and cons of going alone versus partnering? Thanks."
META,2025-04-30,2025-05-01,,2025-04-30,2025-04-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-04-30,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Doug. So our increased CapEx outlook reflects both of those updates, the increased data center spend this year as we have made some adjustments to flex our build strategy that will enable us to really stand up capacity more quickly, both in '25 and '26. We haven't broken down sort of the exact drivers. The higher cost we expect to incur for infrastructure hardware this year really comes from suppliers who source from countries around the world, and there's just a lot of uncertainty around this given the ongoing trade discussions. And so that is both reflected in the wider range that we are giving, and we're also working on our end on mitigations by optimizing our supply chain and our outlook is really trying to reflect our best understanding of the potential impact this year across all of that uncertainty. On the second part of your question, we are -- we are pleased to have partners investing alongside us and bringing Llama to market like AWS and Azure, who are helping us host Llama. We're always looking for opportunities to continue deepening or expanding those partnerships, but we are funding the infrastructure that is being used to train Llama, and we don't have any expectation that will change at this point."

Mark, in your conversation last night with Satya, I think you both discussed a bit around kind of the portion of code being written internally by AI. Kind of back to some of your previous comments around this being a year where we might see AI kind of the place of a mid-level engineer. With the world evolving so quickly, can you share some places where you've seen strong traction there? And are we progressing kind of faster, slower as you expected towards this milestone? And then, Susan, with the expense guidance coming down just a touch, how should we think about just the overall cadence of expected spending, really as it relates to kind of core business performance and just the realities of the day-to-day world we're living in? Thank you."

I don't think that there's been any real change in our prediction for the timing of this. So I'd say, it's basically still on track for something around a mid-level engineer, kind of starting to become possible sometime this year, scaling into next year. So I'd expect that by the middle to end of next year, AI coding agents are going to be doing a substantial part of AI research and development. So, we're focused on that. Internally, we're also very focused on building AI agents or systems that can help, run different experiments to increase recommendations across our other AI products, like the ones that do recommendations across our feeds and things like that. So I think that if it works should just accelerate our progress in those areas. That's the basic bet that we're making."

And that's partially offset by higher expected infrastructure costs related to our increased CapEx outlook as well as higher expected Reality Labs cost of goods sold. And we've maintained our $5 billion range just given the more dynamic operating environment that we're in. And what I would say is our investment posture today reflects the significant opportunities that we see across each of the Company and priorities that we're investing in this year. We will obviously continue evaluating depending on how macro conditions more broadly evolve. But we really feel like these are big strategic priorities for us and are critical for us to continue investing in. And in fact, I think one of the aims of our efficiency work over the last two years was to put us in a stronger financial position, so that we can continue investing in key priorities through tougher financial cycles."

Mark, yesterday in one of your many kind of podcast or keynote presentations, you had mentioned that like a bunch of projects that your teams want to or aspire to do are kind of bottlenecked by the AI capacity, which Susan just talked about earlier, and that even some of the testing that the ad ranking team wants to run is just getting kind of delayed. So I guess looking out either this year, next year, or whatever, when do you kind of see some of this constraint being eased back? And more broadly, we're kind of three years past the IDFA impact to your business. So, where do you -- where do you think we are in terms of just the overall improvements to the ad ranking system, the ROI that you guys are able to deliver, and like what inning are we in on that in your opinion? Thank you very much."

On the first question, the cap -- the capacity landscape we are in is pretty dynamic, both in terms of the many moving parts in terms of us bringing capacity online, but also in terms of the demand from different product groups in our company, whether they are in the Gen AI teams or whether they're doing more of the core AI work around ranking and recommendation. So both the supply and demand are quite fluid and so we don't have a sort of fixed answer in terms of when we expect that we will sort of have enough supply to meet all demand, but that's something that we are working very hard to alleviate and it's part of why we accelerated bringing more data center space online this year and also we're very focused on increasing the efficiency of our workloads over the course of the year. On your second question about ads performance ads ranking. We have invested for many years and continue to invest in driving ad performance improvements. Year-over-year conversion growth remains strong, and in fact, we continue to see conversions grow at a faster rate than ad impressions in Q1. So, reflecting increased conversion rates. And ads ranking and modeling improvements are a big driver of overall performance gains. We have a lot of innovations in model architecture in both the ads retrieval and ranking stages of the ads delivery process to serve more relevant ads to people. We talked about the introduction of the new GEM ads recommendation model in Q1, and we have talked about some of the prior model architecture improvements like Lattice and Andromeda in past quarters. For us, we really believe first and foremost that advertising is a relative performance game, and that's especially important for us, because the vast majority of our business is direct response advertising. So we feel good about how the prior investments are paying off, and we continue to invest in a lot of different work to constantly improve our ads ranking and recommendations performance."

How should we think about the timing of AI capabilities necessary to drive WhatsApp for business adoption in higher cost -- higher labor cost labor markets? What is Meta doing to accelerate that adoption? And do you see this as mostly incremental to SME ad spend that you're already capturing? And then first, Susan, one, please. What does the revised CapEx outlook for this year for '25 mean about future years? Does it mean anything, or you talked about this being an acceleration in your revised outlook statement. Should we think about this as a new starting point for -- to think about '26 and beyond? Or should we just start fresh in '26 and think about the needs and capacity at that point? Thank you."

So Mark talked a little bit about our general vision that every business will soon have an AI that is an expert on their business for their customers to talk to in the same way that today they've got email and websites, social media presences, et cetera. We are currently testing business AIs with a limited set of businesses in the U.S. and a few additional countries on WhatsApp, Messenger, and on -- ads on Facebook and Instagram. We've been starting with small businesses and focusing first on helping them sell their goods and services with business AIs. But ultimately, we are working on tools to support businesses at every stage of the customer funnel, from lead generation to order management and customer service, and a core area that we're addressing right now is really the ability for businesses to customize and control the agent to achieve the outcome that they want. So we've launched a new agent management experience and dashboard that makes it easier for businesses to train their AI based on existing information on their website or WhatsApp profile, or their Instagram and Facebook pages, and we're starting with the ability for businesses to activate AI in their chats with customers. We are also testing business AIs on Facebook and Instagram ads that you can ask about product and return policies, or assist you in making a purchase within our in-app browser. So again, the ultimate vision is to build an experience that serves customers across all of these different services and apps. No matter where you engage with the business AI, it should be one agent that recalls your history and your preferences and we're hearing encouraging feedback is particularly that adopting these AIs are saving the businesses that we're testing with a lot of time and helping to determine which conversations make sense for them to spend more time on. And then your second question right was about 2026 CapEx. You know, infrastructure, as I alluded to earlier, just is a very dynamic planning area given the continued advances in AI, and also for us, the fact that we continue to find a lot of good use cases to put capacity toward in our core AI ranking and recommendations work. So I would say it's too early to discuss plans beyond 2025."

So Mark, in a world where we now have maybe five to 10 chatbots, including Meta AI, on our smartphones doing virtually the same thing. Do you think this is a market much like Search, where the winner takes most, or is it likely to be much more fragmented? But in either case, what would you say are the top two or three competitive advantages of Meta AI? And then, Susan, on the EU decision connection with the DMA, what kind of modifications will you need to make to the apps? And can you maybe just help us gauge the potential financial fallout, understanding that it may still obviously be too early? Thank you."

On Meta AI, I mean, I think that there are going to be a number of different agents that people use, just like people use different apps for different things. I'm not sure that people are going to use multiple agents for the same exact things, but I'd imagine that something that is more focused on kind of enterprise productivity might be different from something that is somewhat more optimized for personal productivity and that might be somewhat different from something that is optimized for entertainment and social connectivity. So I know there will be -- there will be different experiences. One of the trends that I think we're starting to see now is personalization across the -- across these. Right now, if the experience is unpersonalized, then you can kind of just go to different apps and get reasonably similar answers to different questions, but once an AI starts getting to know you and what you care about in context and can build up memory from the conversations that you've had with it over time, I think that will start to become somewhat more of a differentiator. That's one thing that we think will matter. And then, of course, there's all the different modalities, being able to not just answer questions about in text, but being able to do voice and multimodal and be able to produce images and videos and understand all those things and have good conversations about that I think is going to be important overall. So yes, I mean I think Meta AI is well-positioned, but we have a lot of work to do in order to make it the leading personal AI."

I think maybe the most useful sort of metric I could give you is just that our advertising revenue in the European economic area in Switzerland, which would be the geographies impacted here, was 16% of our worldwide total revenue in 2024. Again, we are continuing to engage actively with the European Commission further on this. So we hope to have more clarity by next quarter's call."

We generally saw healthy growth in most verticals in Q1. We did see some weakness in gaming and politics. So, year-over-year growth in gaming was negative in Q1, as we lapped a period of strong spend from China-based advertisers that were promoting a larger volume of game titles in Q1 of 2024. And then year-over-year growth in the government and politics vertical dropped sharply as expected with the conclusion of U.S. elections and but that continues to just be a very small vertical overall. And then your second question on Reality Labs. Yes."

I mean, some of the -- if you look at the -- some of the leading consumer electronics products of other categories, by the time they get to their third generation, they're often selling 10 million units and scaling from there and I'm not sure if we're going to do exactly that, but I think that that's like the ballpark of the opportunity that we have and that's something that I think we're kind of focused on scaling to that and then scaling beyond that for the generations after that. So, I think some of the effort that we're doing is going to -- we're going to get more efficient in some parts of the work that we do, but then as a bunch of the products start to hit and start to grow even bigger than the number that I just said is just sort of like the sort of a near-term milestone, then I think we'll continue scaling in terms of distribution and then at some point, just like the other products that we build-out, we will feel like we're at a sufficient scale that we're going to primarily focus on making sure that, we're monetizing and building an efficient business around it. But that's kind of where we're at on it. We're definitely focused on doing the work more efficiently, but also very optimistic about what we're seeing in the results, especially on the AI glasses side."

We had another strong quarter with more than 3.4 billion people using at least one of our apps each day and strong engagement across the board. Our business continues to perform very well, which enables us to invest heavily in our AI efforts. Over the last few months, we've begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves. And the improvement is slow for now, but undeniable and developing superintelligence, which we define as AI that surpasses human intelligence in every way, we think, is now in sight. Meta's vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone, so that people can direct it towards what they value in their own lives. And we believe that this has the potential to begin an exciting new era of individual empowerment. A lot has been written about all the economic and scientific advances that superintelligence can bring, and I'm extremely optimistic about this. But I think that if history is a guide, then an even more important role will be how superintelligence empowers people to be more creative, develop culture and communities, connect with each other and lead more fulfilling lives. To build this future, we've established Meta Superintelligence Labs, which includes our foundations, product and FAIR teams as well as a new lab that is focused on developing the next generation of our models. We're making good progress towards Llama 4.1 and 4.2, and in parallel, we are also working on our next generation of models that will push the frontier in the next year or so. We are building an elite, talent-dense team Alexandr Wang is leading the overall team, Nat Friedman is leading our AI Products and Applied Research, and Shengjia Zhao is Chief Scientist for the new effort. They are all incredibly talented leaders, and I'm excited to work closely with them and the world-class group of AI researchers and infrastructure and data engineers that we're assembling. I've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter. And the reason that so many people are excited to join is because Meta has all of the ingredients that are required to build leading models and deliver them to billions of people. The people who are joining us are going to have access to unparalleled compute as we build out several multi-gigawatt clusters. Our Prometheus cluster is coming online next year, and we think it's going to be the world's first gigawatt-plus cluster. We're also building out Hyperion, which will be able to scale up to 5 gigawatts over several years, and we have multiple more titan clusters in development as well. We are making all these investments because we have conviction that superintelligence is going to improve every aspect of what we do. From a business perspective, I mentioned last quarter that there are five basic opportunities that we are pursuing, improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI and AI devices. So I can go into a bit of detail on each. On advertising, the strong performance this quarter is largely thanks to AI unlocking greater efficiency and gains across our ad system. This quarter, we expanded our new AI-powered recommendation model for ads to new surfaces and improved its performance by using more signals and longer context. It's driven roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook. We're also seeing good progress with AI for ad creative with a meaningful percent of our ad revenue now coming from campaigns using one of our generative AI features. This is going to be especially valuable for smaller advertisers with limited budgets. While agencies will continue the important work to help larger brands apply these tools strategically. The second opportunity is more engaging experiences. AI is significantly improving our ability to show people content that they're going to find interesting and useful. Advancements in our recommendation systems have improved quality so much that it has led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram, just this quarter. There is a lot of potential for content itself to get better too, we're seeing early progress with the launch of our AI video editing tools across Meta AI and our new Edits app. And there's a lot more to do here. The third opportunity is business messaging. I've talked before about how I believe every business will soon have a business AI, just like they have an e-mail address, social media account and website. We are starting to see some product market fit in a number of countries where we're testing these agents, and we're integrating these business AIs into ads on Facebook and Instagram as well as directly into e-commerce websites. The fourth opportunity is Meta AI. Its reach is already quite impressive with more than 1 billion monthly actives. Our focus is now deepening the experience and making Meta AI the leading personal AI. As we continue improving our models, we see engagement grow. So our next generation of models is going to continue to really help here. And the fifth opportunity is AI devices. We continue to see strong momentum with our Ray-Ban Meta glasses with sales accelerating. We are also launching new performance AI glasses with the Oakley Meta HSTN, they have longer battery life, higher resolution camera and are designed for sports. The percent of people using Meta AI is growing, and we are seeing new users AI retention increase too, which is a good sign for that continued use. I think that AI glasses are going to be the main way that we integrate superintelligence into our day-to-day lives. So it's important to have all of these different styles and products that appeal to different people in different settings. Finally, we're seeing people continue to spend more time with our Quest ecosystem and the community continues to grow steadily. We launched the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition last month, and we're seeing record interest in cloud gaming. And beyond gaming, we continue to see a broader set of use cases with media and web browsing contributing a significant portion of engagement. We're going to have more to share on all of this, especially the Reality Labs work at Connect on September 17. So I encourage you all to tune into that. Overall, this has been a busy quarter. Strong business performance and real momentum in assembling both the talent and the compute that we need to build personal superintelligence for everyone. I am very grateful to our teams who are working hard to deliver all of this, and thanks to all of you for being on this journey with us. And now here is Susan."
META,2025-07-30,2025-07-31,,2025-07-30,2025-07-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-30,prepared,,Susan J. S. Li,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $47.5 billion, up 22% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Q2 total expenses were $27.1 billion, up 12% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 16%, driven mostly by higher infrastructure costs and payments to partners, partially offset by a benefit from the previously announced extension of sever useful lives. R&D increased 23%, mostly due to higher employee compensation and infrastructure costs. Marketing and sales increased 9% primarily due to an increase in professional services related to our ongoing platform integrity efforts as well as marketing costs, partially offset by lower employee compensation. G&A decreased 27%, driven mostly by lower legal-related costs. We ended Q2 with over 75,900 employees, down 1% quarter-over-quarter, as the vast majority of the employees impacted by performance-related reductions earlier this year were no longer captured in our head count. This was partially offset by continued hiring in priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, AI as well as regulation and compliance. Second quarter operating income was $20.4 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 11%, which reflects excess tax benefits from share-based compensation due to the increase in our share price versus prior periods. Net income was $18.3 billion or $7.14 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases were $17 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $8.5 billion. We repurchased $9.8 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders. We also made $15.1 billion in nonmarketable equity investments in the second quarter which includes our minority investment in Scale AI, along with other investment activities. We ended the quarter with $47.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $28.8 billion in debt. Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.4 billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in June. Q2 total Family of Apps revenue was $47.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Q2 Family of Apps ad revenue was $46.6 billion, up 21% or 22% on a constant currency basis. Within that revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Europe and Rest of World at 24% and 23%, respectively. North America and Asia Pacific grew 21% and 18%. In Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 11%, with growth mainly driven by Asia Pacific. Impression growth accelerated across all regions due primarily to engagement tailwinds on both Facebook and Instagram and to a lesser extent, ad load optimizations on Facebook. The average price per ad increased 9%, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Pricing growth slowed modestly from the first quarter due to the accelerated impression growth in Q2. Family of Apps other revenue was $583 million, up 50%, driven by WhatsApp paid messaging revenue growth as well as Meta Verified subscriptions. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q2, Family of Apps expenses were $22.2 billion, representing 82% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 14% and mainly due to growth in employee compensation and infrastructure costs, partially offset by lower legal-related costs. Family of Apps operating income was $25 billion, representing a 53% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q2 revenue was $370 million up 5% year-over-year due to increased sales of AI glasses, partially offset by lower Quest sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.9 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by higher non-head count-related technology development costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $4.5 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance, our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, daily actives continue to grow across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp as we make additional improvements to our recommendation systems and product experiences. We continue to see momentum with video engagement, in particular. In Q2, Instagram video time was up more than 20% year-over-year globally. We're seeing strong traction on Facebook as well, particularly in the U.S., where video time spent similarly expanded more than 20% year-over-year. These gains have been enabled by ongoing optimizations to our ranking systems to better identify the most relevant content to show. We expect to deliver additional improvements throughout the year as we further scale up our models and make recommendations more adaptive to a person's interests within their session. Another emphasis of our recommendations work is promoting original content. On Instagram, over 2/3 of recommended content in the U.S. now comes from original posts. In the second half, we'll be focused on further increasing the freshness of original posts, so the right audiences can discover original content from creators soon after it is posted. We are also making good progress on our longer-term ranking innovations that we expect will provide the next leg of improvements over the coming years. Our research efforts to develop cross-surface foundation recommendation models continue to progress. We are also seeing promising results from using LLM in Threads recommendation systems. The incorporation of LLMs are now driving a meaningful share of the ranking related time spent gains on Threads. We're now exploring how to extend the use of LLMs and recommendation systems to our other apps. We're leveraging Llama and several other back-end processes as well, including actioning bug reports so we can identify and resolve recurring issues more quickly and efficiently. This has resulted in top line bug reports in the U.S. and Canada in Facebook Feed and notifications dropping by roughly 30% over the past 10 months. The primary way we're using Llama in our apps today is to power Meta AI which is now available in over 200 countries and territories. WhatsApp continues to be the largest driver of queries as people message Meta AI directly for tasks such as information gathering, homework assistance and generating images. Outside of WhatsApp, we're seeing Meta AI become an increasingly valuable complement to our content discovery engines. Meta AI usage on Facebook is expanding as people use it to ask about posts they see in Feed and find content across our platform in Search. Another way we expect Meta AI will help with content discovery is through the automatic translation and dubbing of foreign language content into the audience's local language. We'll have more to share on our efforts there later this year. Moving to Reality Labs. The growth of Ray-Ban Meta sales accelerated in Q2, with demand still outstripping supply for the most popular SKUs despite increases to our production earlier this year. We're working to ramp supply to better meet consumer demand later this year. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to optimize ad supply across each surface to better deliver ads at the time and place they are most relevant to people. In Q2, we also began introducing ads within Feed on Threads and the Updates tab of WhatsApp, which is a separate space away from people's chats. As of May, advertisers globally can now run video and image ads to Threads users in most countries, including the United States. While ad supply remains low and Threads is not expected to be a meaningful contributor to overall impression growth in the near term, we are optimistic about the longer-term opportunity with Threads as the community and engagement grow and monetization scales. On WhatsApp, we are rolling out ads in status and channels, along with channel subscriptions in the Updates tab to help businesses reach the more than 1.5 billion daily actives who visit that part of the app. We expect the introduction of ads and status will be gradual over the course of this year and next, with low levels of expected ad supply initially. We also expect WhatsApp ads and status to earn a lower average price than Facebook or Instagram ads for the foreseeable future, due in part towards WhatsApp skew toward lower monetizing markets, and more limited information that can be used for targeting. Given this, we do not expect ads and status to be a meaningful contributor to total impressions or revenue growth for the next few years. The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance. There are three areas of this work that I'll focus on today, improving our ad systems, advancing our ads products, including by building tools that assist in ads creation and evolving our ads platform to drive results that are optimized for each business' objectives. First is our ad systems where we're innovating in both the ads retrieval and ranking stages to serve more relevant ads to people. A lot of this work involves us continuing to advance the modeling innovations we've introduced previously while expanding their adoption across our platform. The Andromeda model architecture we began introducing in the second half of 2024 powers the ads retrieval stage of our ad system, where we select the few thousand most relevant ads from tens of millions of potential candidates. In Q2, we made enhancements to Andromeda that enabled it to select more relevant and more personalized ads candidates while also expanding coverage to Facebook Reels. These improvements have driven nearly 4% higher conversions on Facebook Mobile Feed and Reels. Our new Generative Ads Recommendation system, or GEM, powers the ranking stage of our ad system, which is the part of the process after ads retrieval where we determine which ads to show someone from candidates suggested by our retrieval engine. In Q2, we improved the performance of GEM by further scaling our training capacity and adding organic and ads engagement data on Instagram. We also incorporated new advanced sequence modeling techniques that helped us double the length of event sequences we use, enabling our systems to consider a longer history of the content or ads that a person has engaged with in order to provide better ad selections. The combination of these improvements increased ad conversions by approximately 5% on Instagram and 3% on Facebook Feed and Reels in Q2. Finally, we expanded coverage of our Lattice model architecture in Q2. We first began deploying Lattice in 2023 with our later-stage ads ranking efforts, allowing us to run significantly larger models that generalize learnings across objectives and surfaces in place of numerous smaller ads models that have historically been optimized for individual objectives and surfaces. In April, we began deploying Lattice to earlier-stage ads ranking models as well. This is leading not only to greater capacity and engineering efficiency but also improved performance with the recent Lattice deployments driving a nearly 4% increase in ad conversions across Facebook Feed and Reels in Q2. Next, ad products. Here, we're seeing strong momentum with our Advantage+ suite of AI-powered solutions. In Q2, we completed the rollout of our streamlined campaign creation flow for Advantage+ sales and app campaigns, which makes it easier for advertisers to realize the performance benefits from Advantage+ by having it turned on at the beginning. We've seen lifts in advertiser adoption of sales and app campaigns since we've expanded availability and are working to complete the rollout for leads campaigns in the coming months. Within our Advantage+ Creative suite, adoption of genAI ad creative tools continues to broaden. Nearly 2 million advertisers are now using our video generation features, image animation and video expansion, and we're seeing strong results with our text generation tools as we continue to add new features. In Q2, we started testing AI-powered translation so that advertisers can automatically translate the caption of their ads to 10 different languages. While it's early, we have seen promising performance lifts in our prelaunch tests. We're also continuing to see strong adoption of image expansion among small- and medium-sized advertisers, which speaks to how these tools help businesses who have fewer resources to develop creative. With larger advertisers, we expect agencies will continue to be valuable partners in helping apply these new tools to drive performance. Outside of Advantage+, we're seeing good momentum in business messaging, particularly in the U.S., where click to message revenue grew more than 40% year-over-year in Q2. The strong U.S. growth is benefiting from a ramp in adoption of our website to message ads, which drive people to a business's website for more information before choosing to launch a chat with the business in one of our messaging apps. Finally, we continue to evolve our ads platform to drive results that are optimized for each business' objectives and the way they measure results. In Q2, we completed the global rollout of our incremental attribution feature, which is the only product on the market that optimizes for and reports on incremental conversions, which are conversions that would not have happened without a person seeing the ad. We also launched omnichannel ads globally in Q2 and which enable advertisers to optimize for incremental sales, both in-store and online with just one campaign. In tests, advertisers using omnichannel ads have seen a median 15% reduction in total cost per purchase compared to website-only optimization. Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus remains investing capital back into the business with infrastructure and talent being our top priorities. I'll start with hiring. Our approach to adding head count continues to be targeted at the company's highest priority areas. We expect talent additions across all of our priority areas will continue to drive overall head count growth through this year and 2026. While head count growth in our other functions remains constrained, within AI, we've had a particular emphasis on recruiting leading talent within the industry, as we build out Meta Superintelligence Labs to accelerate our AI model development and product initiatives. Next, infrastructure. We expect having sufficient compute capacity will be central to realizing many of the largest opportunities in front of us over the coming years. We continue to see very compelling returns from our AI capacity investments in our core ads and organic engagement initiatives and expect to continue investing significantly there in 2026. We also expect that developing leading AI infrastructure will be a core advantage in developing the best AI models and product experiences. So we expect to ramp our investments significantly in 2026 to support that work. Moving to our financial outlook. We expect third quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $47.5 billion to $50.5 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. While we are not providing an outlook for fourth quarter revenue, we would expect our year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2025 to be slower than the third quarter as we lap a period of stronger growth in the fourth quarter of 2024. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114 billion to $118 billion, narrowed from our prior outlook of $113 billion to $118 billion and reflecting a growth rate of 20% to 24% year-over-year. While we're still very early in planning for next year, there are a few factors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total expense growth rate. The largest single driver of growth will be infrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our infrastructure fleet. Aside from infrastructure, we expect the second largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as we add technical talent in priority areas and recognize a full year of compensation expenses for employees hired throughout 2025. We expect these factors will result in a 2026 year-over- year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth rate. Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $66 billion to $72 billion, narrowed from our prior outlook of $64 billion to $72 billion and up approximately $30 billion year-over-year at the midpoint. While the infrastructure planning process remains highly dynamic, we currently expect another year of similarly significant CapEx dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our AI efforts and business operations. On to tax. With the enactment of the new U.S. tax law, we anticipate a reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax for the remainder of the current year and future years. There are several alternative ways of implementing the provisions of the act, which we are currently evaluating. While we estimate that the 2025 tax rate will be higher than our Q2 tax rate, we cannot quantify the magnitude at this time. In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. For example, we continue to engage with the European Commission on our Less Personalized Ads offering or LPA, which we introduced in November 2024 and based on feedback from the European Commission in connection with the DMA. As the commission provides further feedback on LPA, we cannot rule out that it may seek to impose further modifications to it that would result in a materially worse user and advertiser experience. This could have a significant negative impact on our European revenue as early as later this quarter. We have appealed the European Commission's DMA decision, but any modifications to our model may be imposed during the appeal process. In closing, this was another strong quarter for our business as our investments in infrastructure and technical talent continue to improve core ads performance and engagement on our platforms. We expect the significant investments we're making now will allow us to continue leveraging advances in AI to extend those gains and unlock a new set of opportunities in the years to come. With that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions."

And Susan, building on Mark's comments on scaling talent and compute, I want to know if you go a little bit deeper on how we should be thinking about those two components driving some of the commentary you've given around OpEx and CapEx over the next 12 to 18 months."
META,2025-07-30,2025-07-31,,2025-07-30,2025-07-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-30,qa,,Mark Elliot Zuckerberg,"Yes, sure. I can start. At a high level, I think that there are all these questions that people have about what are going to be the time lines to get to really strong AI or superintelligence or whatever you want to call it. And I guess that each step along the way so far, we've observed the more kind of aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen. And I think that, that just continued to happen over the course of this year, too. And so I've given a number of those anecdotes on these earnings calls in the past. And I think, certainly, some of the work that we're seeing with teams internally being able to adapt Llama 4 to build autonomous AI agents that can help improve the Facebook algorithm to increase quality and engagement are like -- I mean, that's like a fairly profound thing if you think about it. I mean it's happening in low volume right now. So I'm not sure that, that result by itself was a major contributor to this quarter's earnings or anything like that. But I think the trajectory on this stuff is very optimistic. And I think it's one of the interesting challenges in running a business like this now is there's just a very high chance it seems like the world is going to look pretty different in a few years from now. And on the one hand, there are all these things that we can do, there are improvements to our core products that exist. And then I think we have this principle that we believe in across the company, which we tell people take superintelligence seriously. And the basic principle is this idea that we think that this is going to really shape all of our systems sooner rather than later, not necessarily on the trajectory of a quarter or 2, but on the trajectory of a few years. And I think that that's just going to change a lot of the assumptions around how different things work across the company. So anyway, I think it's basically just what we're continually observing how this works and what the trajectory or the pace of AI progress has been. I think it continues to be on the faster end. And that I think informs a lot of the decisions from everything from the importance and value of having the absolute best and most elite talent-dense team at the company to making sure that we have a leading compute fleet so that the people here can do -- obviously, the researchers here have more compute per person to be able to lead their research and then roll it out to billions of people across our products, making sure that we build and drive these products through all of the different things that we do, which I think is one of the things that our company is the best in the world at is basically when we take a technology, we're good at driving that through all of our apps and our ad systems and all that stuff, it's not just going to kind of sit on the vine. I think that there's no other company, I think that is as good as us at kind of taking something and kind of getting it in front of billions of people. So yes, I mean, we're just going to push very aggressively on all of that. But at some level, yes, this is -- there's sort of a bet in the trajectory that we're seeing and those are the signals that we're seeing. But we're just trying to read it."
META,2025-07-30,2025-07-31,,2025-07-30,2025-07-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-30,qa,,Susan J. S. Li,"Eric, for the second part of your question, we haven't, in fact, kicked off our budgeting process for 2026. So thinking about next year, there are clearly many, many moving pieces in a very dynamic operating environment. But there are certain aspects that we have some visibility into today, including the rough shape of our 2026 infrastructure plans. And that flows through into our expense expectations next year. And we also have some visibility into the compensation expense growth that we'll recognize from the AI talent that we're hiring this year. And so those two things are part of why we gave a little bit of an early preview into the expectations for growth for 2026 total expenses as well as for 2026 CapEx. So on the total expenses side, as I mentioned, we expect infrastructure will be the single largest contributor to 2026 expense growth. That's driven primarily by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth in 2026, largely driven by recognizing incremental depreciation from assets that we purchased and place in service in '26 as well as from infrastructure deployed through 2025 that will recognize a full year of depreciation next year. We also expect a greater mix of our CapEx to be in shorter-lived assets in 2025 and '26 than it has been in prior years. And then the other component of infra cost growth next year would come from higher operating expenses, including energy costs, leases, maintenance and operational expenses that are associated with maintaining that fleet. And we also expect some increased spend on cloud services in '26 to meet our capacity needs as well as growth in network-related costs. So a lot going on, on the infrastructure side as it contributes to the 2026 total expense number. After that, employee compensation is the next largest driver of expense growth in '26. Again, driven primarily in the investments that we're making in technical talent, including recognizing a full year of compensation expense for the AI talent we hire this year. I realize this answer is getting a little long, so I'll try to wrap up quickly. On the CapEx side, the big driver of our increased CapEx in '26 will be scaling genAI capacity as we build out training capacity that's going to drive higher spend across servers, networking, data centers next year. We also expect that we're going to continue investing significantly in core AI in 2026. And again, this is a pretty -- a very dynamic area of planning, but we wanted to share kind of our early thoughts as things are shaping up."

The first one, Mark, just to kind of go back to the intelligence labs and sort of the vision for superintelligence. As you sort of sit here now versus 12 months ago, can you just sort of walk us through any changes of technological constraints or technological gating factors that you are most focused on overcoming in the next 24 months that may have been different than they were in the past, just to make sure you can really lead in the idea of superintelligence over the next 10 years? And then the second one to Susan or Mark, one on the core. You've made so many improvements to the core to drive higher engagement, recommendations, et cetera. Can you just walk us through a couple of the factors you're still most excited about to come in the next 18 months that you think could drive a further lift to engagement on the core platform?"

I mean in terms of the research agenda and a bunch of the areas that we're very focused on, I do think focusing on self- improvement is a very important area of research. And there's obviously different scaling paradigms, and I don't want to get too much into the detail of research that we're doing on this. But I think that for developing superintelligence, at some level, you're not just going to be learning from people because you're trying to build something that is fundamentally smarter than people. So it's going to need to learn how to -- or you're going to need to develop a way for it to be able to improve itself. So that, I think, is a very fundamental thing. That is going to have a very broad implications for how we build products, how we run the company, new things that we can invent, new discoveries that can be made, society more broadly. I think that that's just a very fundamental part of this. In terms of the shape of the effort overall, I guess I've just gotten a little bit more convinced around the ability for small talent-dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research. And it's a bit of a different setup than we have on our other world- class machine learning system. So if you look at like what we do in Instagram or Facebook or our ad system, we can very productively have many hundreds or thousands of people basically working on improving those systems, and we have very well-developed systems for kind of individuals to run tests and be able to test a bunch of different things. You don't need every researcher there to have the whole system in their head. But I think for this -- for the leading research on superintelligence, you really want the smallest group that can hold the whole thing in their head, which drives, I think, some of the physics around the team size and how -- and the dynamics around how that works. But I'll hand it over to Susan to talk about more of the practical stuff."

There are a handful of shorter-term things that we're focused on in the near term. One is we're focused on making recommendations even more adaptive to what a person is engaging with during their session so that the recommendations we surface are the most relevant to what they're interested in at that moment. And we're making optimizations to help the best content from smaller creators break-out by matching it to the right audiences sooner after it gets posted. And we're also working on improving the ability for our systems to discover more diversified and niche interest for each person through interest exploration and learning explicit user preferences. We're also planning to scale up our models further and incorporate more advanced techniques that should improve the overall quality of recommendations. But we also have a lot of long-term bets in the hopper around areas like developing foundational models that will support recommendations across multiple services. Incorporating LLMs more deeply into our recommendation systems. And a big focus of this work is going to be on optimizing the systems to make them more efficient. So that we can continue to scale up the capacity that we use for our recommendation systems without eroding the ROI that we deliver."

Mark, Meta has been a huge proponent of open source AI, has your thinking changed here at all, just as you pursue superintelligence and push for even greater returns on your significant infrastructure investments? And then, Susan, your comments on '26 CapEx suggest more than $100 billion of spend next year potentially. Do you continue to expect to finance all this yourself? Or could there be opportunities to partner here?"
META,2025-07-30,2025-07-31,,2025-07-30,2025-07-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-30,qa,,Mark Elliot Zuckerberg,"Yes. I mean on open source, I don't think that our thinking has particularly changed on this. We've always open sourced some of our models and not open sourced everything that we've done. So I would expect that we will continue to produce and share leading open source models. I also think that there are a couple of trends that are playing out. One is that we're getting models that are so big that they're just not practical for a lot of other people to use. So it's -- we would kind of wrestle with whether it's productive or helpful to share that or if that's really just primarily helping competitors or something like that. So I think that there's that concern. And then obviously, as you approach real superintelligence, I think there is a whole different set of safety concerns that I think we need to take very seriously, that I wrote about in my note this morning. But I think the bottom line is, I would expect that we will continue open sourcing work. I expect us to continue to be a leader there. And I also expect us to continue to not open source everything that we do, which is a continuation of kind of what we've been kind of working on. And yes, I mean, I think Susan will talk a little bit more about the infrastructure, but it really is a massive investment. We think it will be good over time. But we do take very seriously that this is a just massive amount of capital to convert into many gigawatts of compute which we think is going to help us produce leading research and quality products and in running the business, I do look for opportunities to basically convert capital into quality of products that we can deliver for people. But this is certainly a massive bet that we're kind of -- we're focused on, and we want to make sure that what we build accrues to building the best products that we can deliver to the billions of people who use our services."

We certainly expect that we will finance some large share of that ourselves, but we're also exploring ways to work with financial partners to co-develop data centers. We don't have any finalized transactions to announce, but we generally believe that there will be models here that will attract significant external financing to support large-scale data center projects that are developed using our ability to build world-class infrastructure while providing us with flexibility should our infrastructure requirements change over time. So we are exploring many different paths."

Mark, your spend is now approaching some of the biggest hyperscalers out there. Do you think of all this capacity mostly for internal uses? Or do you think there's a way to share or even come up with a business model where leveraging that capacity for external uses? And then Susan, when you think about the ROI on this CapEx, I'm sure you have internal models, I'm sure you can't share all that, but how are you thinking about the ROI? And are you optimistic about the long-term returns?"
META,2025-07-30,2025-07-31,,2025-07-30,2025-07-30T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-30,qa,,Susan J. S. Li,"Justin, I can go ahead and take a crack at both of those. And obviously, Mark, you should feel free to weigh in. Right now, we are focused on ensuring that we have enough capacity for our internal use cases, which includes both all of the core AI work that we do to support the recommendation engine work on the organic content side to support all the ads ranking and recommendation work. And then, of course, to make sure that we are building the training capacity that we think we need in order to build frontier AI models. And to make sure that we're preparing ourselves for the types of inference use cases that we think might -- that we might have ahead of us as we eventually focus not only on developing frontier models, but also how we can expand into the kinds of consumer use cases that we think will be hopefully widely useful and engaging for our users. So at present, we're not really thinking about external use cases on the infrastructure, but it's a good question. On your second question, which is really around the sort of ROI on CapEx, there are a couple of things. So again, on the core AI side, we continue to see strong ROI. Our ability to measure that is quite good, and we feel sort of very good about the rigorous measurement and returns that we see there. On the genAI side, we are clearly much, much earlier on the return curve and we don't expect that the genAI work is going to be a meaningful driver of revenue this year or next year. But we remain generally very optimistic about the monetization opportunities that will open up, and Mark spoke to them in his script, the sort of five pillars, so I won't repeat them here. And we think that over the medium- to long-term time frame, those are opportunities that are very adjacent and intuitive for where -- in terms of where our business is today, why they would be big opportunities for us and that there will be sort of big markets attached to each of them. So we, again, are also, I would say -- the last thing I would add here is we are building the infrastructure with fungibility in mind. Obviously, there are a lot of things that you have to build up front in terms of the data center shells, the networking infrastructure, et cetera. But we will be ordering servers, which ultimately will be the biggest bulk of CapEx spend as we need them and when we need them and making sort of the best decisions at those times in terms of figuring out where the capacity will go to use."

Is it really against kind of those five pillars you outlined above? Or should we be thinking more broadly? And Susan, obviously AI delivering great ROI today, all those investments and also building towards kind of longer-term goals, just curious, has there just been any change or adjustment to how you think about the relationship between revenues or core business performance and the cadence of investment?"

Then I think you just get into our standard product and business playbook, which is translating that technology into new products, which will first scale to billions of people and then over time, we will monetize. But I think that there's going to be some lag in that, right? And that, I think, is kind of always the way that we work is, whether we're building some new social product or this, something like Meta AI or a new product around this, we're going to work on getting to leading scale, building the highest quality product, focused on that for a few years. And then once we're really confident in that position, then we'll focus on ramping up the business around it. So it's -- I mean, going back to the last question a little bit, it's sort of when you compare this business to some of the cloud businesses, it's like we do have this delay where we focus on building research and then doing research and then ramping consumer products, and it often does take some period of time before we really are ramping up the business around it. I think that's kind of a known property of our business and the cycle around it. But I guess, on the flip side, we believe that if you are building superintelligence, you should use all of your GPUs to make it so that you're serving your customers really well with that. And we think that there's going to be a much higher return than we can do by generating that directly rather than just kind of renting or leasing out the infrastructure at other companies."

And it won't be linear. In some years, we'll deliver above-average profit growth. And in years where we're making big investments, I think we will see that impact the amount of operating profit growth that we can deliver. And at the moment, we see a lot of attractive investment opportunities that we believe are going to set us up to deliver compelling profit growth in the coming years for all of our investors. And so we're focused on constraining investments elsewhere as we pursue those investments. But we really believe that this is a time for us to really make investments in the future of AI as I think it will open up both new opportunities for us in addition to strengthen our core business."

So it's -- yes, you focus on specific areas, but in general, it just sort of gets better at a lot of different things that people want to ask it or want to do with it. And I think with each version, both like what we're doing on a week-to-week basis in terms of continuing to train it, and when we drop kind of new generations or big dot releases of each generation, that will improve engagement, too. So we're focused on that. I'm not going to go into the specific research areas or capabilities that we're planning on dropping in the future. But obviously, I'm pretty excited about it."

Where are we on the development of glasses? And has that new computational platform that you've talked about in the past, is it moving faster or slower than you thought? And as you leverage Meta AI, do you believe glasses ultimately replace smartphones? Or do you need the new form factor that's AI first? And then, Susan, just quickly, how do you guys see SBC progressing over the next couple of years? Is it fair to assume it will grow materially faster than the revenue and OpEx? And how do you minimize shareholder dilution?"

Yes, I mean, I'm very excited about the progress that we're making. I think both the Ray-Ban Metas and I'm very excited about the Oakley Meta, the HSTNs too. And other things that we have planned. Yes, I mean, this product category is clearly doing quite well. And I think it's good for a lot of things. It is stylish eyewear, so people like wearing them just as glasses. It has a bunch of interesting functionality. And then the use of Meta AI in them just continues to grow, and the percent of people who are using it for that on a daily basis is increasing, and that's all good to see. I mean, I continue to think that glasses are basically going to be the ideal form factor for AI because you can let an AI see what you see throughout the day, hear what you hear, talk to you. Once you get a display in there, whether it's the kind of wide holographic field of view like we showed with Orion or just a smaller display that might be good for displaying some information, and that's also going to unlock a lot of value where you can just interact with an AI system throughout the day in this multimodal way. It can see the content around you, it can generate a UI for you, show you information and be helpful. I mean, I personally think that just like if -- I wear contact lenses, I feel like if I didn't have my vision corrected, I'd be sort of at a cognitive disadvantage going through the world. And I think in the future, if you don't have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, I think you're kind of similarly, probably be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people and who you're working with, or competing against. So I think that this is a pretty fundamental form factor. There are a lot of different versions of it. Right now, we're building ones that I think are stylish, but aren't focused on the display. I think there's a whole set of different things to explore with displays. This is kind of what we've been maxing out with Reality Labs over the last 5 to 10 years is basically doing the research on all of these different things. And it's a -- I don't know, 10 years ago, I would have -- like the other thing that's awesome about glasses is, they are going to be the ideal way to blend the physical and digital worlds together. So the whole metaverse vision, I think, is going to end up being extremely important, too, and AI is going to accelerate that, too. It -- just that if you'd asked me 5 years ago, whether we'd have kind of holograms that created immersive experiences or superintelligence first, I think most people would have thought that you'd get the holograms first. And it's this interesting kind of quirk of the tech industry that I think we're going to end up having really strong AI first. But because we've been investing in this, I think we're just several years ahead on building out glasses. And I think that that's something that we're excited to keep on investing in heavily because I think it's going to be a really important part of the future."

We had another strong quarter with 3.5 billion people using at least one of our apps every day. Instagram had a major milestone with 3 billion monthly actives, and we're seeing good momentum across our other apps as well, including Threads which recently passed 150 million daily actives and remains on track to become the leader in its category. I am very focused on establishing Meta as the leading frontier AI lab. Building personal superintelligence for everyone and delivering the app experiences and computing devices that will improve the lives of billions of people around the world. Our approach of advancing open source AI means that when Meta innovates, everyone benefits. Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a strong start. I think that we've already built the lab with the highest talent density in the industry. We're heads down developing our next generation of models and products and I'm looking forward to sharing more on that front over the coming months. We're also building what we expect to be an industry-leading amount of compute. Now there's a range of time lines for when people think that we're going to get superintelligence. Some people think that we'll get there in a few years. Others think it will be 5, 7 years or longer. I think that it's the right strategy to aggressively frontload building capacity so that way we're prepared for the most optimistic cases. That way, if superintelligence arrives sooner, we will be ideally positioned for a generational paradigm shift in many large opportunities. If it takes longer, then we'll use the extra compute to accelerate our core business which continues to be able to profitably use much more compute than we've been able to throw at it. And we're seeing very high demand for additional compute, both internally and externally. And in the worst case, we were just slow building new infrastructure for some period while we grow into what we build. The upside is extremely high for both our existing apps and new products and businesses that are becoming possible to build. Across Facebook, Instagram and Threads, our AI recommendation systems are delivering higher quality and more relevant content, which led to 5% more time spent on Facebook in Q3 and 10% on Threads. Video is a particular bright spot with video time spent on Instagram up more than 30% since last year. And as video continues to grow across our apps, Reels now has an annual run rate of over $50 billion. Improvements in our recommendation systems will also become even more leveraged as the volume of AI-created content grows. Social media has gone through 2 eras so far. First was when all content was from friends, family and accounts that you followed directly. The second was when we added all of the creator content. Now as AI makes it easier to create and remix content, we're going to add yet another huge corpus of content on top of those. Recommendation systems that understand all this content more deeply and can show you the right content to help you achieve your goals are going to be increasingly valuable. Our ads business continues to perform very well, largely due to improvements in our AI ranking systems as well. This quarter, we saw meaningful advances from unifying different models into simpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency. And now the annual run rate going through our completely end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. And one way that I think about our company overall is that there are 3 giant transformers that run Facebook, Instagram and ads recommendations. We have a very strong pipeline of lots of ways to improve these models by incorporating new AI advances and capabilities. And at the same time, we are also working on combining these 3 major AI systems into a single unified AI system that will effectively run our family of apps and business using increasing intelligence to improve the trillions of recommendations that we'll make for people every day. I'm also very excited about the new products that we're going to be able to build. More than 1 billion monthly actives already use Meta AI and we see usage increase as we improve our underlying models. I'm very excited to get a frontier model into Meta AI and I think that the opportunity there is very large. The same goes for our business AI. Every day, people have more than 1 billion active threads with business accounts across our messaging platforms, ranging from product questions to customer support. Our business AIs will enable tens of millions of businesses to scale these conversations and improve their sales at low cost and the better our models get, the better this is going to work for all businesses. This quarter, we also launched Vibes which is the next generation of our AI creation tools and content experiences. Retention is looking good so far. And its usage keeps growing quickly week over week. I'm looking forward to ramping up the growth of Vibes over the coming months. More broadly, I think that Vibes is an example of a new content type enabled by AI, and I think that there are more opportunities to build many more novel types of content ahead as well. As our new models become ready, I'm looking forward to starting to show everyone some of the new kinds of products that we're working on. At Connect, we announced our 2025 line of AI glasses, and the response so far has been great. The new Ray-Ban Meta glasses and Oakley Meta Vanguards are both selling well. As people love the improved battery life, camera resolution, new AI capabilities and the great design. And there's our new Meta Ray-Ban display glasses, our first glasses with a high-resolution display and the metaneural band to interact with them. They sold out in almost every store within 48 hours with demo slots fully booked through the end of next month. So we're going to have to invest in increasing manufacturing and selling more of those. This is an area where we are clearly leading and have a huge opportunity ahead. Taking a step back, if we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead for our existing apps and the new experiences that are possible, then I think that the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history. We've got a lot to do. But we're making real progress, delivering strong business results, building the talent density and infrastructure needed for the next era and leading the way on AI devices that will define the next computing platform. I am proud of how our teams are rising to the challenge, and I'm grateful for their dedication, hard work and creativity. As always, thank you all for being a part of this journey with us. And now here is Susan."
META,2025-10-29,2025-10-30,,2025-10-29,2025-10-29T16:30:00-04:00,0,2025-10-29,prepared,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our segment results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Our community across the family of apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.5 billion people used at least 1 of our family of apps on a daily basis in September. Q3 total family of apps revenue was $50.8 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Q3 family of apps ad revenue was $50.1 billion, up 26% or 25% on a constant currency basis. In Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 14%. Impression growth was healthy across all regions driven by engagement and user growth, particularly on video services. The average price per ad increased 10% year-over-year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing regions and services. Family of Apps other revenue was $690 million, up 59%, driven by WhatsApp paid messaging revenue growth as well as meta verified subscriptions. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q3 revenue was $470 million, up 74% year-over-year. The significant year-over-year growth in Q3 was partly due to retail partners stocking up on Quest headsets ahead of the holiday season. We did not have a similar benefit in the third quarter of last year since our Quest 3S headset launched in the fourth quarter of 2024. Aside from this, strong AI glasses revenue also contributed to revenue growth in Q3. Moving now to our consolidated results. Q3 total revenue was $51.2 billion, up 26% or 25% on a constant currency basis. Q3 total expenses were $30.7 billion, up 32% compared to last year. Year-over-year expense growth accelerated 20 percentage points from Q2 due primarily to 3 factors: First, legal-related expense growth was higher than in Q2 due to charges we recorded in the third quarter as well as us lapping a period of accrual reversals in the third quarter a year ago. Second, employee compensation growth accelerated, driven by technical hires, particularly AI talent. Finally, growth in infrastructure costs accelerated due to increased infrastructure operating costs associated with our expanded data center fleet, depreciation on our incremental CapEx spend and third-party cloud spend. We ended Q3 with over 78,400 employees, up 8% year-over-year, driven by hiring in priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, Meta Superintelligence Labs as well as regulation and compliance. Third quarter operating income was $20.5 billion, representing a 40% operating margin. Q3 interest and other income was $1.1 billion driven primarily by unrealized gains on our marketable equity securities. Our tax rate for the quarter was 87%, which was unfavorably impacted by a onetime noncash reduction in deferred tax assets that we no longer anticipate using under new U.S. tax law. Our tax rate would have been 14%, excluding this charge. Although the transition to the new U.S. tax law resulted in an accounting charge in the third quarter, we continue to expect we will recognize significant cash tax savings for the remainder of the current year and future years under the new law, and this quarter's charge reflects the total expected impact from the transition to the new U.S. tax law. Net income was $2.7 billion or $1.05 per share. Excluding the onetime tax charge, our net income and EPS would have been $18.6 billion and $7.25 per share, respectively. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases were $19.4 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $10.6 billion. We repurchased $3.2 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders. We ended the quarter with $44.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and $28.8 billion in debt. Turning now to the business outlook. There are 2 primary factors that drive our revenue performance. Our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, daily actives continue to grow year-over-year across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. We're continuing to see improvements to our products and recommendations drive incremental engagement with year-over-year growth in global time spent accelerating on both Facebook and Instagram in Q3. In the U.S., overall time spent on Facebook and Instagram grew double digits year-over-year, driven by continued video strength as well as healthy growth in non-video time on Facebook. The engagement gains continue to be driven by product work and ongoing improvements to our recommendation systems as we optimize our model architectures, implement advanced modeling techniques and integrate more signals about people's interests. We also continue to focus on increasing the freshness of recommended content. On Facebook, our systems are now surfacing twice as many Reels published that day than at the start of the year. Looking to 2026, we expect to advance our recommendation systems across several dimensions. On Instagram, one focus is evolving our systems to surface content across a broader set of topics that cater to the diverse interest of each person. This follows a similar approach we've implemented on Facebook that has driven good results. We also expect to make significant progress on our longer-term ranking innovations in 2026. We're seeing promising new results from our research efforts to create foundational ranking models and expect the new model innovations we're developing as part of this will enable us to significantly scale up the amount of data and compute we use to train our recommendation models in 2026, yielding more relevant recommendations. Another large focus next year is leveraging LLMs to improve content understanding. We expect this is going to enable our systems to more precisely label the keywords and topics within videos and posts, which will allow our systems to both develop deeper intuition about a person's interest and retrieve the content that matches them. Finally, we're making good progress with Meta AI and Threads. The number of people using Meta AI across our family of apps continues to grow, and we're increasingly leveraging first-party content into Meta AI results with the majority of Meta AI's responses to Facebook Deep Dive queries in the U.S. now showing related Reels. We're also seeing a lot of traction with media generation. People have created over 20 billion images using our products. And since launching Vibes within Meta AI in September, we have seen media generation in the app increased more than tenfold. On Threads, we see strong growth in both daily actives and the depth of engagement as we continue to improve recommendations. The ranking optimizations we made in Q3 alone drove a 10% increase in time spent on Threads. We also continue to ship new features, including launching direct messaging in Q3, so anyone on Threads can now message one another within the app. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance. increasing monetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to refine ad supply across each of our major surfaces within Facebook and Instagram to better deliver ads at the time and place they are most relevant to people. Longer term, we have exciting ad supply opportunities on both Threads and WhatsApp status. Ads are now running globally and feed on Threads and we're following our typical monetization playbook of optimizing the ads formats and performance before we ramp supply. Within WhatsApp status, we're continuing to gradually introduce ads and expect to complete the rollout next year. The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance. Advancing our ad systems remains a critical aspect of this work and we are driving performance gains through ongoing improvements in our larger scale ads ranking models. For example, we continue to broaden the adoption of Lattice, our unified model architecture. In Q3, we rolled out Lattice to app ads, which drove a nearly 3% gain in conversions for that objective. Since introducing Lattice back in 2023, along with other back-end improvements, we have now cut the number of ads ranking and recommendation models by approximately 100 as we consolidated smaller and more specialized models into larger ones that use the Lattice architecture to generalize learnings across surfaces and objectives. We continue to observe performance improvements as we combine models and expect to drive additional gains as we consolidate another 200 models over the coming years into a smaller number of highly capable models. In addition to advancing our foundational ads models, we're innovating on our run time models we use downstream of them for ads inference. For example, we began piloting a new run time ads ranking model in Q3 that leverages more compute and data than our prior models to select more relevant ads. In testing, we've seen this new model drive a more than 2% lift in conversions on Instagram. We also significantly improved performance of Andromeda in Q3 by combining models across retrieval and early-stage ranking into a single model, driving a 14% increase in ads quality on Facebook surfaces. Within our ads products, we're seeing continued momentum with Advantage+. In Q3, we completed the rollout of our streamlined campaign creation flow for Advantage+ lead campaigns. So now advertisers running sales app or lead campaigns have end-to-end automation turned on from the beginning, allowing our systems to look across our platform to optimize performance by automatically choosing criteria like who to show the ads to and where to show them. The annual run rate of revenue running through our end-to-end automated solutions has now reached $60 billion following the implementation of the new streamlined creation flow, as we continue to see more advertisers leverage the performance benefits of our solutions. Within our Advantage+ creative suite, the number of advertisers using at least 1 of our video generation features was up 20% versus the prior quarter as adoption of image animation and video expansion continues to scale. We've also added more generative AI features to make it easier for advertisers to optimize their ad creatives and drive increased performance. In Q3, we introduced AI generated music. So advertisers can have music generated for their ad that aligns with the tone and message of the creative. Finally, business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us. We're seeing strong growth across our portfolio of solutions, including with click-to-WhatsApp ads, which grew revenue 60% year-over-year in Q3. We're also making good progress on our business AI efforts, where we've been focused on building a turnkey AI that helps businesses generate leads and drive sales. We've been opening access in recent months to more businesses within our initial test markets, the Philippines and Mexico. And I've seen strong usage with millions of conversations between people and business AIs taking place since July. This month, we expanded availability within WhatsApp and Messenger to all eligible businesses in Mexico and the Philippines, respectively. In the U.S., we're also starting to roll out the ability for merchants to add their business AIs to their website so we can support the full sale funnel from ad to purchase. Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus is deploying capital to support the company's highest order priorities including developing leading AI products models and business solutions. As we make significant investments in infrastructure to support this work, we are focused on preserving maximum long-term flexibility to ensure we can meet our future capacity needs while also being able to respond to how the market develops in the years ahead. We're doing so in several ways, including staging data center sites so we can spring up capacity quickly in future years as we need it as well as establishing strategic partnerships that give us option value for future compute needs. The strong financial position and cash generation of our business enable us to make these investments while also accessing additional pools of cost-efficient capital. Moving to our financial outlook. We expect fourth quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $56 billion to $59 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Our outlook reflects an expectation for continued strong ad revenue growth partially offset by lower year-over-year Reality Labs revenue in Q4. The anticipated reduction in Reality Labs revenue is due to us lapping the introduction of Quest 3S in Q4 of last year. As well as retail partners procuring Quest headsets during Q3 of this year to prepare for the holiday season, which were recorded as revenue in the third quarter. Turning to the expense and CapEx outlooks. I'll first start with 2025 before providing some commentary on our planning for 2026. We expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $116 billion to $118 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $114 billion to $118 billion and reflecting a growth rate of 22% to 24% year-over-year. We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases to be in the range of $70 billion to $72 billion, increased from our prior outlook of $66 billion to $72 billion. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape we expect our fourth quarter 2025 tax rate to be 12% to 15%. Turning now to 2026. We are at an exciting point for our company. where we have continued runway to improve our core services today as well as the opportunity to build new AI-powered experiences and services that will transform how people engage with our products in the future. We expect the set of investments we're making within our ads and organic engagement initiatives next year will enable us to continue to deliver strong revenue growth in 2026. While our progress on AI models and products will position us to capitalize on new revenue opportunities in the years to come. A central requirement to realizing these opportunities is infrastructure capacity. As we have begun to plan for next year, it's become clear that our compute needs have continued to expand meaningfully, including versus our own expectations last quarter. We are still working through our capacity plans for next year, but we expect to invest aggressively to meet these needs, both by building our own infrastructure and contracting with third-party cloud providers. We anticipate this will provide further upward pressure on our CapEx and expense plans next year. As a result, our current expectation is that CapEx dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025. We also anticipate total expenses will grow at a significantly faster percentage rate a than 2025, with growth primarily driven by infrastructure costs, including incremental cloud expenses and depreciation. Employee compensation costs will be the second largest contributor to growth. As we recognize a full year of compensation for employees hired throughout 2025, particularly AI talent and add technical talent in priority areas. Finally, we continue to monitor active legal and regulatory matters, including the increasing headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and financial results. For example, in the EU, we continue to engage constructively with the European Commission on our less personalized ads offering. However, we cannot rule out the commission imposing further changes to that offering that could have a significant negative impact on our European revenue as early as this quarter. In the U.S., a number of youth-related trials are scheduled for 2026 and may ultimately result in a material loss. In closing, this was another good quarter for our business. We have an exciting set of opportunities to continue improving our core business while delivering innovative new experiences and services for the people and businesses using our products in the years to come. With that, Christa, let's open up the call for questions."
META,2025-10-29,2025-10-30,,2025-10-29,2025-10-29T16:30:00-04:00,0,2025-10-29,qa,speaker_line_contains_cue,Operator,[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
META,2025-10-29,2025-10-30,,2025-10-29,2025-10-29T16:30:00-04:00,0,2025-10-29,qa,,Brian Nowak,"I have 2 for Susan. The first one, Susan. So the pipeline for core improvements to come in '26 with models and ad ranking models and more [ FPS ] of compute seems very exciting and the infrastructure build team sizable behind that. So can you help us a little to understand some of the early quantifiable signals you're seeing on AB tests from some of these improvements to come that sort of make you most excited and give you confidence you're going to get ROIC from all this CapEx? That's the first one. Second one is a little faster. How large is the Reality Labs revenue headwind in the 4Q guidance?"
META,2025-10-29,2025-10-30,,2025-10-29,2025-10-29T16:30:00-04:00,0,2025-10-29,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Brian, for the question. I think your first question had a couple of parts to it. So I'm going to try to disaggregate those parts, and let me know if this addresses what you're getting to. I will say that the growth in 2026 CapEx relative to 2025 comes from growth in each of the core areas, MSL, core AI as well as non-AI spend. So all of those areas are growing, but the MSL AI needs are growing the most. In terms of the core AI pipeline, I think, we talked about last year when we were going into the 2025 budget process, we had a road map of resource investments across both head count and compute that we thought would pay off in 2026. And it's really a very broad range of sort of different ads ranking and performance efforts. And we're continuing to see that those have paid off through the course of the year. There is a long list of specific efforts, but 1 of the measures that we look at to monitor this is how are we driving ad performance, how are conversions growing? Conversions is a complex metric for us because advertisers optimize for so many different conversions on different values. But when we control for that and look at value-weighted conversion rates, we're seeing very strong year-over-year growth and conversion -- weighted conversions continue to grow faster than impressions. We also talked about some of the new model architecture over the course of the year and the degree to which the new model architecture is enabling us also to take advantage of having more data and more compute to drive ads performance. So we expect that, that's going to be a continued story in 2026. We are, in fact, at the beginning of our 2026 budgeting process now, and we see a similar list of revenue investments that we're excited to be able to invest in. And so we think that, that's going to be a big part of our ability to continue to drive strong revenue performance throughout the year. On your second question, which is the Reality Labs revenue headwind. I don't think we have quantified the exact size of that. We expect that Q4 Reality Labs revenue will be lower than last year for a couple of reasons that I alluded to, the biggest factor is we're lapping the introduction of Quest 3S in Q4 of last year, and we don't have a new headset in the market this year. We also recorded all of our holiday-related Quest 3S sales in Q4 '24, since the headset was launched in October '24. This year, we're recognizing some of those Quest 3S sales in Q3 as retail partners have procured Quest headsets in advance of the holiday season. We're still expecting significant year-over-year growth in AI Glasses revenue in Q4 as we benefit from strong demand for the recent products that we've introduced, but that is more than offset by the headwinds to the Quest headsets."
META,2025-10-29,2025-10-30,,2025-10-29,2025-10-29T16:30:00-04:00,0,2025-10-29,qa,,Operator,Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
META,2025-10-29,2025-10-30,,2025-10-29,2025-10-29T16:30:00-04:00,0,2025-10-29,qa,,Douglas Anmuth,I appreciate the strategy to front-load capacity for superintelligence. Can you just talk about your thought process and kind of triangulating the CapEx dollar growth and the significantly faster expense growth next year with core growth in the business and then the impact on earnings and free cash flow? And do you have targets that we should be thinking about for cash on hand or net cash overall?
META,2025-10-29,2025-10-30,,2025-10-29,2025-10-29T16:30:00-04:00,0,2025-10-29,qa,,Susan Li,"Thanks, Doug. We're, right now, I would say, in the process of -- relatively early, actually still in the process of putting together our budget for 2026. And it is on the capacity side, a particularly dynamic process. We're certainly seeing that we wish we had more capacity today than we do. We would be able to put it towards good use certain not only with the MSL team appreciate having more capacity, but we'd be able to put it towards good and ROI-positive use in the core business as well. So we're really trying to plan ahead not only to ensure that we have the capacity we need in 2026, but also to give ourselves the sort of flexibility and option value to have the capacity that we think we could need in '27 and '28. So that said, there are lots of moving pieces in the budget. It's not baked yet. It's still sort of in the process of coming together. We don't have specific targets to share -- but we do feel like our strategic priority is really making sure that we have the compute that we need to be well positioned to succeed at AI, and that's sort of the foremost priority as we're putting together the budget."
META,2025-10-29,2025-10-30,,2025-10-29,2025-10-29T16:30:00-04:00,0,2025-10-29,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes. I mean, I'll add a few thoughts on this, too, although I mean, as Susan said, we're still working through the actual budget, and I think we'll typically have more to share on that early next year. But to date, we keep on seeing this pattern where we build some amount of infrastructure to what we think is an aggressive assumption. And then we keep on having more demand to be able to use more compute, especially in the core business in ways that we think would be quite profitable, then we end up having compute for. So I think that suggests that being able to make a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be a profitable thing over some period because if the primary use of it is going to be to accelerate the AI research and the new AI work that we're doing and how that relates to both the core business and new products. But any compute that we don't need for that we feel pretty good that we're going to be able to absorb a very large amount of that to just convert into more intelligence and better recommendations in our family of apps and ads in a profitable way. Now I mean, it's, of course, possible to overshoot that, right? And if we do, I mean, this is what I mentioned in my comments, then we see that there's just a lot of demand for other new things that we build internally, externally, like almost every week, people come to us from outside the company asking us to stand up an API service or asking if we have different compute that they could get from us and we haven't done that yet. But obviously, if you got to a point where you ever built, you could have that as an option. And then the kind of the very worst case would be that we effectively have just prebuilt for a couple of years, in which case, of course, there would be some loss and depreciation, but we'd grow into that and use it over time. So my view on this is that rather than continuing to be constrained on CapEx and feeling in the core business like we have significant investments that we could make that we're not able to make that would be profitable. But the right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need, both for the AI research and new things that we're doing and to try to get to a different state on our compute stance on the core business. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about that overall. Of course, there's a lot of operational constraints too on what one can build, right? So we're basically trying to work through this all, and I think we'll have more to share in the coming months and over the course of next year. But I can think there's just a huge, huge amount of opportunities ahead here."

And how you think about scaling and exiting models from the superintelligence effort might change the utility and behavior around Meta AI in the years ahead."
META,2025-10-29,2025-10-30,,2025-10-29,2025-10-29T16:30:00-04:00,0,2025-10-29,qa,,Mark Zuckerberg,"Yes. I mean a lot of people use Meta AI today. I mean, as I said in my comments upfront, there's more than 1 billion people who use it on a monthly basis. And what we see is that as we improve the quality of the model, primarily for post-training Llama 4 at this point. We are -- we continue to see improvements in usage. So our view is that when we get the new models that we're building in MSL in there and get like truly frontier models with novel capabilities that you don't have in other places, then I think that this is just a massive latent opportunity, right? We know -- I mean I would guess that Meta I think has the best track record of any company out there of taking a new product that people love and getting it to billions of people in terms of usage. So I think that the ability to plug in leading models is going to -- I would predict lead to a very large amount of use of these things over the coming years. So I'm very excited about that in terms of new products. It's not just Meta AI is an assistant. I think that there are going to be all kinds of new products around different content formats, and we're starting to see that with video and content creation, but I think there's going to be a lot more like that, that I'm quite excited about. And then there are the business versions of all these 2, like business AI. And then that's, of course, one part of the story is the new things that will be possible to build. And then the other part is how more intelligent models are just going to improve the core business. And improve the recommendations that we make across the family of apps and improve the recommendations and advertising. And I think there's just a -- as we've shown, there's sort of this very large amount of headroom and the opportunity there keeps growing as we as we are improving and optimizing the AI there. And I think that, that really shows no sign of being near the end. I think that there's quite a bit more to do there. And like I said in response to the last question, we are sort of perennially operating the family of apps and ads business in a compute starved state at this point, which is, on the one hand, sort of an odd thing to say, given the compute that we built up. But we really are taking a lot of the resources and using them to advance future things that we're doing, and we think that there's a lot more compute that we could put towards these that would just unlock a huge amount of opportunity in the core business as well."

And then, Mark, as you think about kind of the timing of some of these newer efforts coming out of Superintelligence Labs, is that anchoring to kind of an updated frontier model launch sometime next year like the right way for us to think about it? Or should we be looking at kind of progress from new products you're excited to see shift like Vibes?"

So on the sort of adds improvement side, some of the innovations that we have been launching actually involve sort of improving our larger scale models. So we don't use our larger model architectures like GEM for inference because their size and complexity would make it too cost prohibitive. The way that we drive performance from those models is by using them to transfer knowledge to smaller lightweight models that are used at run time. And then in addition to the foundation model work, we are working on advancing our inference models by developing new techniques in architectures that then allow us to scale up compute and complexity in an ROI-positive way. So in general, we obviously, have a very large base of advertisers. There's a lot of demand liquidity in the system and even small-scale improvements that we are able to make in terms of driving basis point improvements in the performance of ads or single-digit increases in conversions relative to impressions in a given quarter off of a large base mean that we're really able to continue to grow the absolute dollars of revenue growth in a pretty meaningful way."

As we get into the AI cycle, obviously, some concerns on the investment. But can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about tools that could be coming out for users? I know there's some new competition. And then secondly, how do you think about margins in this content cycle? Any reason to think they would be different versus prior cycles."

I mean, I think certainly, every -- each product has somewhat different characteristics. And I think we'll kind of understand how that goes over time. I mean, my general goal is to build a business that maximizes value for the people who use our products and maximizes profitability, not margin. So I think we'll kind of just try to build the best things that we can and try to deliver the most value that we can for most people."

And Mark, some of the goals for competing AI labs are around achieving AGI or these other milestones that are kind of like out there and a little esoteric. How are you setting up your new team in terms of achieving those types of goals versus products that can generate revenue for Meta kind of right out of the gate. And is the goal that you had articulated to us previously around giving billions of people kind of a personal AI to use. Is that still the direction of travel that you see? Or is there other things like kind of the Vibes or [ Sora ] angle that you think are potentially important. How should we think about like the overall direction."

So the way that I think about this is that the research is going to enable new technological capabilities to exist. And then those capabilities can get built into all kinds of different products. So the ability to reason more intelligently is, for example, very important across a large number of things. It would be useful for an assistant. It will also be useful in business AI. It will also be useful in the AI agent that we're building to help advertisers figure out what their campaigns are going to be. It will also have implications for eventually how we do ranking and recommendations of people's feeds and make different decisions there. That's just one example. I mean certainly, the capability to be able to produce very high-quality good video is going to be useful for giving people new creative tools. It will help increase the amount of content inventory that can be shown in Instagram and Facebook and therefore, should enable an increase in engagement there. It should help advertisers be able to create creative that will help us monetize better. So you can just go kind of down the list of capabilities that you'd expect. And I think each one will enable a bunch of different things. And I think the art of product development here is looking at the list of technology capabilities and figuring out what new products are going to be useful and prioritizing those. But fundamentally, I would sort of expect this exponential curve in new technology capabilities that are going to become available. And the other thing that I expect is that I think being the best in a given area will drive great returns rather than -- this is not like a check-the-box exercise of like, okay, we can generate some kind of content and someone else can. I think that like the company that is the best at each of these capabilities, I think, will get a large amount of the potential value for doing that. So there are lots of different capabilities to build. I'm not sure that any one company is going to be the best at all of them. I doubt that's going to be the case. But a lot of what we're trying to do is not like not kind of do some things that others have done. We're really trying to build novel capabilities. And I'm keeping this high level because I'm not -- I don't want to necessarily from a competitive or strategic perspective, get into what we're prioritizing. But that hopefully gives you a sense of how we're thinking about what we're doing. We want to be able to kind of build novel things, build them into a lot of our products and then have the compute to scale them to billions of people. And we think that that's going to both show up in terms of new products being possible in new businesses and very significant improvements to the current business, too."

So when you look at it, what you've seen that's most encouraging to you in terms of the adoption and the use of Meta AI? And then when you think about -- I know you generally like to roll out and then deepen engagement and then later think about monetization. Like where do you think you are on that path now? Is it clear to you what the monetization options are for Meta AI."

And then secondly, that as we -- there is a clear correlation as we improve the models in ways that we think make them better, that people use them more. So that shows that we have a runway to basically be able to improve engagement and turn this into a product that's leading over time. In terms of where we are on this, and we basically just did this huge effort to boot up Meta Superintelligence Labs and build what I am very proud of is, I think, the highest talent density lab in the industry at this point. There are a lot of really great researchers and infrastructure folks and data folks who are now a part of this effort who are focused on training the next generation of work and doing some really novel work. And when that is ready, I think that we will be able to plug that into a number of the products that we're building, and I think that, that will be very exciting. But I think that's really the next thing that we're looking at. And then from there, I think that these models will also improve monetization in all of the different ways that we've talked about so far in terms of improving engagement, improving advertising, helping advertisers engage. I mean there's one opportunity that we just usually talk about on these calls, but hasn't come up as much here is just the ability to make it so that advertisers are increasingly just going to be able to give us a business objective and give us a credit card or bank account and like have the AI system basically figure out everything else that's necessary. Including generating video or different types of creative that might resonate with different people that are personalized in different ways, finding who the right customers are. All of these -- all of the capabilities that we're building, I think, go towards improving all of these different things. So I'm quite optimistic about that."

And we heard a lot about end-to-end automation here, I think, reaching a $60 billion ARR. I wanted to hear about -- if you can talk to us more just about adoption rates amongst the advertisers? And then maybe bigger picture, as you incorporate ranking recommendation changes like Andromeda, GEMS or Lattice, just talk to us how this automation is driving, call it, a higher ROI for advertisers overall, as we bring it all together."

So we've been sort of laying the continued brick-by-brick build of Advantage+ and extending the set of objectives that it applies to over time. And so in Q3 we completed the global rollout of the streamlined campaign creation flow for Advantage+ lead campaigns. So now advertisers who are running sales apps or lead campaigns have end-to-end automation turned on from the beginning. And like the kind of application of the streamlined campaign creation flow for other objectives, this generally allows advertisers to optimize and automate several aspects of the campaign setup process at once. That includes things like audience selection where to show the ad, how the budget gets paced and distributed across ad sets to drive the most efficient outcomes. And we see that Advantage+ continues to drive performance gains, advertisers who run lead campaigns using Advantage+ are seeing a 14% lower cost per lead on average than those who are not. And I would say that we think there is still a lot of opportunity generally to grow adoption of Advantage+. A lot of advertisers only use our end-to-end automated solutions for a portion of their campaigns so we can grow share there. And to capture that opportunity, we're focused on driving continued performance improvements and addressing some of the key use cases that we still need in order to grow adoption. We're also working to broaden adoption among advertisers who use 1 of our single step automated solutions. For example, advertisers who might only use a piece of it like Advantage+ audiences by helping them understand the benefits of using more than one automated solution at the same time. So I would say Advantage+ is sort of an ongoing platform by which we both continue to expand the feature set that is available in Advantage+ and then expand the extensibility or the coverage of that feature set to sort of the broader set of advertisers. I think Mark mentioned that the annual revenue run rate now for advertisers who are using these automated options is $60 billion. And again, we see that there is room to continue growing that."

Mark, on wearables, in particular, do you think you'll be able to sell enough hardware to recoup your investment? Or is that dependent on maybe creating new avenues for revenue from things like advertising services and commerce through that new computing platform? And if so, what are kind of the gating factors there? And then Susan, how do you see the on-balance sheet versus off-balance sheet financing of your AI initiatives? You've recently struck a deal with Blue Owl for the Louisiana data center. Is that part of the CapEx guide for '26? And if it's not, how significant will that way of funding for Meta going forward?

So I know there are a few pieces here. One is that the work on Ray-Ban Meta and the Oakley Meta product is going very well. I think, yes, I mean, at some point, if these continue going as well as it has been, then I think it will be a very profitable investment. I think that there's some revenue that we get from basically selling the devices and then some that will come from additional services from the AI on top of it. So I think that there's a big opportunity. Certainly, the investment here is not just to kind of build just the device. It's also to build these services on top. Right now, a lot of people get the devices for a range of things that don't even include the AI even though they like the AI. But I think over time, the AI is going to become the main thing that people are using them for and I think that that's going to end up having a big business opportunity by itself. But as products like the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Metas are growing, we're also going to keep on investing in things like the more full field of view, product form of the Orion prototype that we showed at Connect last year. So those things are obviously earlier in their curve towards getting to being a sustaining business. And our general view is that we want to build these out to reach many hundreds of millions or billions of people and that's the point at which we think that this is going to be just an extremely profitable business."

In terms of how that is recognized as CapEx, our prior CapEx reflected a portion of the data center build cost prior to the joint venture being established. Going forward, the construction cost of the data center will not be recorded in CapEx as the data center is constructed, we will contribute 20% of the remaining construction costs required, which is in line with our ownership stake, and those will be recorded as other investing cash flows."

Mark, as you think about with the -- hopefully, a leading frontier model next year in hand, could you talk about where you think the value will accrue in this evolving ecosystem?

But I mean I think that -- I mean, I think there's just a lot of value to create with AI overall. So I mean, clearly, you're seeing the people who are making the hardware. NVIDIA is doing an amazing job, right, I think, extremely well-deserved success. The cloud partners and companies are making -- are doing very well. I think that will likely continue. I think there's a huge opportunity there. And -- but if you look at it today, the companies that are building apps, I mean, a lot of the apps are still relatively small. And I think that's obviously going to be a huge opportunity. And I think what we've seen overall is basically people take like individual technology advances and build them into products that then build either communities or other kinds of network effects and then end up being very sustaining businesses. And I think what we haven't really seen as much in the history of the technology industry is the rate of new capabilities being introduced because around each of these capabilities, you can build many new products that I think each will turn into interesting businesses. So yes. I don't know. I mean I'm generally pretty optimistic about there being a very large opportunity. But in terms of new things to build, I think being able to build them and then scale them to billions of people is a huge muscle that Meta has developed, and I think we do very well. And I certainly think that, that's going to deliver a huge amount of value, both in the core business for all the ways that we talked about, how it's going to improve recommendations and the quality of the services as well as unifying the models together. And so that way, when these systems are deciding what to show they can just pull from a wider pool. And that we've -- these are things that we've just seen over the 20-plus years of running the company that they just deliver consistent wins. That we're going to keep on being able to make the systems more general and smarter and make better recommendations for people and have a larger pool of inventory. And that is all going to be great. And then there's going to be a lot of new things that I think we're going to be able to take and scale to billions of people over time and build new businesses, whether that's advertising or commerce supported or people paying for it or different kinds of things. So yes, it's -- I think it's pretty early, but I think we're seeing the returns in the core business. That's giving us a lot of confidence that we should be investing a lot more, and we want to make sure that we're not under-investing."
