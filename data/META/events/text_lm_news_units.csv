Formerly known as Facebook, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) is now a household name because of the foundational success it experienced in social media. But it has been over a decade since its IPO on May 18, 2012, As the only company in the ‘Magnificent Seven’ that has yet to undergo a stock split, an investor who purchased $1000.00 worth of META stock on the day it went public at $38.00 per share would now be sitting on an investment worth $15318.16, good for a gain of 1431.82%. But since its IPO date, a lot has changed. For starters, on Feb. 1, 2024, the company announced — alongside authorizing a $50 billion stock buyback — that shares of META would begin paying a dividend. And while its current yield of 0.34% may not seem like much, at its current price, that equates to $0.50 per share quarterly, or $2.00 per share annualized. META is the dominant player in the social media landscape but it is now branching out more broadly into tech, and specifically, the artificial intelligence (AI) space. It is the latter that the company is most heavily investing in now, and for that reason, it is also the primary driver of 24/7 Wall Street price predictions and forecasts for 2025-2030. Key Points in This Article: “Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,” according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. 24/7 Wall Street projects a 70.94% upside potential for the stock through the end of the decade.

Recent Meta Stock Updates and News 11/12/2024 Despite an overall negative trading day, Meta saw a slight uptick of 0.28% today, ending a two-day losing streak. 11/11/2024 Meta has announced a partnership with 13 universities in the U.S. and U.K. to bring virtual reality (VR) into classrooms. This new initiative, called “Meta for Education beta”, aims to test new VR and XR products, make learning more immersive and engaging, and make the company’s VR more mainstream. 11/8/2024 A federal judge has ruled that Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, is not personally responsible for lawsuits accusing the company of harming children through addictive social media platforms. The judge dismissed claims that Zuckerberg knowingly concealed the mental health risks associated with using Facebook and Instagram. While the judge’s decision exonerates Zuckerberg from personal liability, it doesn’t affect the lawsuits made against Meta itself. 11/7/2024 Meta experienced a 2.7% increase in its share price today, trading as high as $587.77. Trading volume was significantly lower than average, with only 3.7 million shares changing hands. 11/6/2024 Meta has adjusted its policy regarding the use of its AI model, Llama. The company has now granted access to U.S. national security agencies and defense contractors. 11/5/2024 Meta is now facing a $15.6 million fine from the South Korean Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) for sharing user data with advertisers. The PIPC is accusing Meta of sharing the sensitive personal information of 980,000 South Korean Facebook users with 4,000 advertisers, violating the country’s privacy laws. 11/4/2024 Meta’s recent attempt to secure additional nuclear power has been rejected. This could hinder efforts by Meta and other tech giants to secure additional energy from nuclear sources to fuel their growing AI operations. 10/31/2024 Meta reported strong third-quarter earnings, with a 19% increase in revenue to $40.6 billion and a 35% rise in net income to $15.7 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations. 10/29/2024 Meta stock saw a significant rise today, up over 2% to $590.19. This positive momentum has contributed to its impressive 66% year-to-date performance, placing it among the top 20 performers in the S&amp;P 500. Tomorrow, the company is scheduled to release its third-quarter results. 10/28/2024 Meta is developing a new AI-powered search engine aimed to lessen its reliance on Google and Microsoft’s Bing for search results. Meta Platforms’ 10-Year Market Smashing Results Here’s a table summarizing the performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) of META stock from 2014 to 2024: Share Price Revenues Net Income 2014 $80.78 $12.466 $2.940 2015 $104.66 $17.928 $3.688 2016 $115.05 $27.638 $10.217 2017 $176.46 $40.653 $15.934 2018 $133.20 $55.838 $22.112 2019 $208.10 $70.697 $18.485 2020 $273.16 $85.965 $29.146 2021 $336.35 $117.929 $39.370 2022 $120.34 $116.609 $23.200 2023 $353.96 $134.902 $39.098 TTM $517.77 $161.579 $55.042 Revenue and net income in %billions Over the past decade, Meta Platforms’ revenue has grown 1,196.16% from $12.466 billion to over $161 billion over its trailing 12 months (TTM), while its net income went from $2.940 billion to over $55 billion TTM during the same period, good for an increase of 1,772.18%. The primary driver of that growth over the past 10 years has been ad space for the company’s social media platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Reel, and WhatsApp, among others. While Meta Platforms has branched out into augmented reality and virtual reality — a business segment it refers to as Reality Labs — 99% of its revenue generation comes from its Family of Apps business segment, as of year-end 2023. But as the company looks to the second half of the decade, Zuckerberg and the company will focus on a few key focus areas that will have a large impact on Meta Platforms’ stock performance. Key Drivers of Meta Platforms’ Stock Performance AI Investment: Founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta Platforms “released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we’re driving good growth across our apps.” While the market for Meta’s social media advertising remains healthy and continues to drive the majority of the company’s revenue, it is focusing heavily on AI investments to expand through the end of the decade. Price-per-ad revenue saw a 10% year-over-year gain, and that success will fund its AI spending aimed at future growth. The company said shareholders should expect between $37 billion and $40 billion in capital expenditures this year that will fund a data center capable of powering its AI initiatives. That is likely to continue into next year, with CFO Susan Li stating that the META expects “significant capital expenditure growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence research and product development efforts.” Continued Renewable Energy Development: According to the company’s net zero plan, which it is aiming to achieve by 2030, “Since 2020, Meta’s global operations have been supported by 100% renewable energy. As of 2023, we have 10,000MW of contracted renewable energy across 6 countries.” As part of its net zero plan, Meta Platforms’ reliance on renewable energy will ultimately decrease the cost of its utility expenses, and ultimately, its carbon footprint through contracted and self-employed green technologies. Renewables already cost less than fossil fuel energy sources, and according to Canary Media, “By 2030, technology improvements could slash today’s prices by a quarter for wind and by half for solar.” The company has announced that its goal for its forthcoming data center is that it is 100% sustainable and net zero. Focusing on Growing Free Cash Flow: Zuckerberg coined the 2023 Meta Platforms “year of efficiency,” and their results were staggering. By year-end, the company recorded a record free cash flow of $43 billion. That is up from $21 billion in 2019, marking a nearly 105% increase in its cash position in four years. Meta’s free cash flow TTM stands at $49.74, showing that its focus on its bottom line is driving decisions from the top down and has increasingly strong results. Meta Platforms (META) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus one-year price target for Meta Platforms is $597.50, which represents a 2.59% upside potential from today’s share price of $582.43. Of all the analysts covering META stock, it receives a consensus “Buy” rating with a score of 1.5, with 1 being the strongest “Buy” rating and 5 being the strongest “Sell” rating. 24/7 Wall Street’s forecast projects Meta Platforms’ stock price to be $603 by the end of 2025, based on the company’s ability to sustain its strong ad revenue while increasing efficiency, which in turn will drive its bottom line despite capital expenditures increasing toward its AI objectives. Meta Platforms Price Estimates 2025-2030 Year Revenue Net Income EPS 2024 $161.579 $54.960 $21.18 2025 $183.459 $62.250 $24.12 2026 $205.257 $70.680 $27.71 2027 $226.332 $78.258 $30.42 2028 $245.319 $85.912 $32.38 2029 $268.306 $97.044 $36.54 2030 $274.947 $91.227 $39.70 Revenue and net income in $billions How META’s Next 5 Years Could Play Out We estimate the price per share of Meta Platforms to be $692 with revenue jumping over $200 billion for the first time in 2026. EPS expectations are for $27.71 annualized. That stock forecast represents a gain of 18.66% over today’s share price. In 2027 we expect META’s stock price to reach $760 with net income increasing to $78 billion on the back of free cash flow exceeding $60 billion for the first time. That stock price represents a 30.32% increase over today’s share price. 24/7 Wall Street forecasts that META’s share price will reach $809 by the end of 2028, as free cash flow surpasses $70 billion. That price per share represents a 38.72% increase from where the stock is trading today.= Then in 2029, we estimate that Meta Platforms will reach $79.262 billion in free cash flow, $97.044 billion in net income and over $268 in revenue resulting in a price per share of $914, or 56.73% upside potential from today’s share price. META’s Price Target for 2030 By the end of the start of the next decade, we forecast that META’s stock price will reach $995.00, or 70.62% higher than it is trading for today, despite estimates that net income will pull back slightly from over $97 billion to over $91 billion. Revenue growth will continue, with an estimated 2.48% year-over-year increase from 2029. Year Price Target % Change From Current Price 2024 $530 -9.12% 2025 $603 3.40% 2026 $692 18.66% 2027 $760 30.32% 2028 $809 38.72% 2029 $914 56.73% 2030 $995 70.62% Revenue and net income in $billions “The Next NVIDIA” Could Change Your Life If you missed out on NVIDIA’s historic run, your chance to see life-changing profits from AI isn’t over.

Nvidia Corporation NVDA shares fell notably in overnight Robinhood trading on Sunday as China's DeepSeek unveiled an AI model that reportedly offers cutting-edge performance at a fraction of the cost. This development has sparked doubts about the need for massive GPU investments. What Happened: DeepSeek, backed by Chinese quant firm High-Flyer, launched its R1 language model (LLM) as open source last week. It also published a technical report asserting that advanced AI systems can be developed on substantially smaller budgets. 🚀 DeepSeek-R1 is here!⚡ Performance on par with OpenAI-o1📖 Fully open-source model & technical report🏆 MIT licensed: Distill & commercialize freely!🌐 Website & API are live now!

Vice President JD Vance, who was backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, has voiced his concerns about the influence of big tech companies, asserting that these companies wield “too much power.” What Happened: Speaking on “Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan” on Saturday, Vance was asked about the prominent presence of tech leaders at Donald Trump’s inauguration. This included names like Meta Platforms, Inc.’s META Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com, Inc.’s AMZN Jeff Bezos, Tesla Inc.’s TSLA Elon Musk, Apple Inc.’s AAPL Tim Cook, and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG GOOGL Sundar Pichai. To illustrate his point, the Vice President noted that the tech leaders did not receive preferential seating over his mother or other supporters. “We believe fundamentally that big tech does have too much power.” See Also: Nvidia Stock Slides Overnight On Robinhood As China’s DeepSeek Sparks Doubts Over GPU Spending Frenzy — Chamath Palihapitiya Highlights Report Indicating AI Holy Grail Cracked He stressed the importance of tech companies respecting constitutional rights and halting censorship and cautioned that Trump’s administration would not look kindly on non-compliance. Why It Matters: The tech sector played a crucial role in Trump’s 2024 election victory, with Musk investing significantly in support of Trump and other Republicans. Trump appointed Musk to lead a new agency focused on reducing federal spending. Other tech leaders also engaged with Trump, visiting Mar-a-Lago before the inauguration. Vance has been vocal about his desire to break up large tech companies, particularly Google's parent company Alphabet. Interestingly, the Vice President had a powerful Silicon Valley backer in the share of Thiel who has also funded his 2022 Ohio campaign with $15 million.

After spiraling by over 600 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished in the green, while the S&amp;P 500 similarly eked out a modest gain. The Nasdaq Composite finished slightly lower, but far from its worst levels of the day. While recession fears have been stoked now that the economy is officially slowing down, the markets shook it off, perhaps in anticipation of Meta (Nasdaq: META) and Microsoft&#8217;s (Nasdaq: MSFT) earnings this afternoon. Stocks Trim Losses 12:19 pm by Gerelyn Terzo President Trump has attributed the unexpected GDP contraction to the Biden Administration, surmising that economic growth will &#8220;take a while.&#8221; In the meantime, he urges Americans to stay patient as the next economic boom awaits. Stocks have trimmed their losses. NVDA a Sell 12:07 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street firm has turned cautious on the AI boom. Seaport Research has reportedly downgraded shares of AI darling Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) to a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating, owing to worries about AI spending from businesses. Analyst Jay Goldberg believes that while Nvidia was a clear winner in the AI mania, the prospects are already built into the stock. Nvidia stock has shaved off 20% of its value year-to-date. The stock market has come off its lows of the day, with the Nasdaq Composite trimming its declines from approximately 3% to 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are down fractionally. Today&#8217;s sell-off was sparked by an economic contraction in Q1, thrusting the possibility of a recession further into the spotlight. Markets Off Worst Levels 10:53 am by Gerelyn Terzo In what is shaping up to be an historic market sell-off, stocks have come off their worst levels of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses from over 600 points to about 400 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are down by barely 2% each. In addition to the GDP shocker, the markets received more economic data to process from the labor market. Private payrolls rose by 62,000 in April, falling short of Dow Jones expectations for nearly double that growth. March saw a gain of 147,000 private payrolls, making the sting even worse. Companies are placing hiring on hold as they await the full impact of the Trump administration&#8217;s tariffs. Stock Market Drawdown 10:08 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Goldman Sachs, if the economy were to slip into a recession, the stock market selling would intensify. Goldman Sachs Micro Strategist Vicky Chang warned that unlike past market cycles, this time around, headline risk signals the market bottom, not the economic trough, saying, &#8220;We still think there is significant vulnerability in a recession scenario, even if the worst of the underlying ‘shock’ has passed.&#8221; The economic slowdown is real. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% during Q1 2025 after corporate America rushed to receive imports before the tariffs kicked in. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. GDP declined at an annual rate of 0.3%, adjusted for inflation, the worst drop the economy has suffered in in three years. By way of comparison, economists were predicting an economic expansion of 0.4% in the first quarter, a far cry from the results as the tariff wars took hold. Stocks went into freefall mode in response, including a 600-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite spiraled by 2.7% and the S&amp;P 5oo lost 2.0%. Every single sector of the economy is trading lower as fears of an economic recession grip the markets. Each of the Magnificent Seven stocks are under pressure, including a steep 6% drop in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and declines of close to 4% for Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). What a day for Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) to be reporting quarterly earnings after the closing bell today. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 646.83 (-1.6%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 454.57 (-2.6%) S&amp;P 500: Down 111.05 (-1.9%) Market Movers Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) is losing 8% on the day and has been downgraded by Goldman Sachs to a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating from &#8220;&#8216;buy&#8221; with a $85 price target attached, down from a previous target of over $100 per share. Starbucks reported Q1 results and missed Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Social media platform Snap (NYSE: SNAP) is falling by over 15% this morning in the market sell-off after choosing to forego earnings guidance due to uncertainty from tariffs. First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR) is losing 10% on the day after missing Q1 estimates and revealing the toll that tariffs will take on its revenue in 2025.

The stock market had a 20% reset in April, which lasted only a few days, if even that. Recently, it has traded down only 7% for the year. It has only been a quarter of a century since the last market wipeout. The Nasdaq dropped 75% from March 2000 to October 2002. Most of the reason was the .com companies had raised too much money as their losses mounted, and the value of their business models was viewed as unsustainable. Key Points The Market Could Drop 50% Trillions Of Dollars Would Disappear Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The most notable part of the market crash was that it destroyed company stocks with strong business models that are today&#8217;s market titans, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). When the market imploded, Microsoft’s market cap dropped 65%. If the market dropped 75% today, the Nasdaq would collapse from 17,100 to 4,475, and its market value would collapse by $23 trillion, hammering the wealth of many Americans. It is worth noting that the 2000 to 2022 Nasdaq market collapse was not accompanied by a significant recession. GDP fell only .3% in that period, and unemployment rose to 5.5%. That is hardly a recession at all. One of the first signs of a new, sharp market drop is that stocks in the AI craze have started to crater. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), considered the No. 2 AI chip maker, traded at $227 in March last year. A few weeks ago, it dropped to $88 and has since recovered to $102. Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) reached $125 in February last year. It dropped to $74 early last month, a 40% drop. It recently moved up to $117. What is critical about Palantir and AMD is that they are remarkably healthy companies with growing revenue and what appear to be successful models, unlike the .com companies of 2000 and 2002. Nevertheless, their shares collapsed. If there is a massive market sell-off, it would happen for one of two reasons. The first is that the huge bet on AI falters. It could. Companies could get “out over their skis.” Meta (NASDAQ: META) says it will invest $50 billion to $75 billion in AI this year. Microsoft has pegged its investment at $80 billion for the same period. AI is supposed to change the world. Many public companies with prospects driven by AI investments are supposed to have tremendous revenue growth unless they don’t. The other threat to the market is hyperinflation. Inflation rose to 14% in 1979. If there is a similar problem this year, it will be because of tariffs, which could be as high as 100% on Chinese goods. The inflationary problem would ripple across the US economy in months. Sixty percent of US adults own stocks. That statistic says everything.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended The Magnificent 7 Could See Even More Upside 11:38 am While today’s 1,000-point Dow rally has been impressive, similar days may be ahead. When the U.S. and China meet again in the next few weeks, they’ll work out a bigger agreement on trade. While nothing has been set in stone with that just yet, markets are still celebrating today’s trade breakthrough. Here’s where that currently stands. Under the 90-day pause, both countries lowered tariffs by 115 percentage points to 10%. The 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remains in place, so most Chinese goods face a 30% rate in total, down from 145% previously, as noted by CNBC. The Magnificent 7 Are Just Starting to Rally Back 10:50 am As of May, the Magnificent 7 lost about $6 trillion in value since their peak in late 2024. Also, at its trough, the Roundhill BIG Tech ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS) – which tracks the Magnificent 7 plummeted from about $56 to a low of $39. However, thanks to the latest U.S.-China news, the ETF is quickly rebounding higher. Making the Mag 7 even more attractive, analysts believe they can easily beat the S&amp;P 500 in earnings this year. Plus, with valuations off their 2024 peaks, investors are coming back to the table to feast. The U.S. and China have finally agreed to a temporary – but significant easing of tariffs. In fact, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. tariffs on China will drop 115 percentage points to 30%. China’s levies on U.S. imports will drop to 10%. More information on specifics can be found in the Joint Statement on U.S. China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva at WhiteHouse.gov. As a result of the agreement, the Dow Jones is up about 1,050 points. The NASDAQ is up 663, as the S&amp;P 500 adds 156 points. Even better, it’s boosting the Magnificent 7 stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is up 5.6%, or $11.25. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up 1%, or by $4.80. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) is up about 3%, or by $4.71. com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is up 7.4% or by $14.55.

Key Points ETFs have generated higher returns than mutual funds. GLD, VYM, and QQQ have the potential to outpace S&amp;P 500. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) 2025 hasn’t been a smooth ride. The economy has seen volatility, the market has seen several ups and downs, and investors are scrambling to look for low-risk options to invest their money. There are concerns about the impact of tariffs, and consumer spending is low. Amidst the uncertainty, the only way to invest is to look for low-volatility investment options that can generate steady income. Exchange-traded funds have emerged as one of the top investment options this year. They allow investors to own a collection of stocks with just one investment and at a low cost. I was a die-hard fan of mutual funds, but the returns weren’t satisfactory, which is why I decided to make a switch to ETFs. With thousands of ETFs to choose from, it can become overwhelming, and the industry is getting more crowded. Here are the top 3 I invested in. SPDR Gold Shares Gold has always been considered a hedge against inflation, and the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) ETF is a top choice amid uncertain markets. Launched by State Street Global Advisors, the ETF is traded on exchanges in Hong Kong, Mexico, Japan, and Singapore. It is a trust that purchases, stores, and sells gold bullion, allowing investors to capitalize on rising gold prices. It has a low expense ratio of 0.40% and is the largest gold ETF in the market. Its NAV has soared over 40% in a year and about 12% in five years. The fund launched in 2004 and has kept pace with the S&amp;P 500 over the years. Gold prices will fluctuate in the short term, but the past year has seen a steady upside. Geopolitical tensions and the expanding money supply have lifted the commodity’s value. GLD is a defensive investment, and it brings stability to my portfolio. It is easier for me to pay the annual management fee as compared to buying and storing gold bullion. This ETF has become a centrepiece of my portfolio. Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF A reliable dividend ETF by Vanguard, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSE: VYM) has a strong history of delivering steady income and capital appreciation. It has an expense ratio of 0.06% and it tracks the performance of FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. VYM has a yield of 2.57% and holds 582 stocks. The sector distribution includes: Financials: 21.50% Industrials: 13.40% Technology: 12.30% Healthcare: 12.10% It holds some of the biggest dividend paying companies in the top 10, including Walmart, AbbVie, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Exxon Mobil. The ETF pays quarterly dividends, and the strong portfolio allows it to remain consistent at it. VYM has generated double-digit annualized market returns with a return of 10.4% in 5 years and 12.4% in the past year. The fund is filled with large-cap stocks that have a stable balance sheet and a record of strong financial performance. Despite market volatility, the fund has remained resilient and outperformed the S&amp;P 500. It offers a safety net and steady dividend income. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) I believe in the future of tech and wanted to make the most of the sector. Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) allows me to do that. It holds the Magnificent Seven and has a yield of 0.58%. The fund is known for its impressive capital appreciation. QQQ tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100 index and has the 100 largest companies listed on the stock exchange. It aims for high growth while providing exposure to the best U.S. non-financial companies. It is a tech-focused ETF with over 50% allocation to tech stocks, followed by 19.66% in consumer staples and 5.80% in healthcare. It is top heavy with the 10 holdings making up 51% of the portfolio and these include the Magnificent Seven like Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Apple. Slightly on the expensive side, QQQ has an NAV of 530.82 and is up 16% in 12 months. The NAV has soared over 100% in the past five years, generating impressive gains for investors. As long as the tech sector continues to expand, QQQ is set to benefit.

From here, depending on the strength of Magnificent 7 stock earnings, trade deals, and the Federal Reserve, we could see the index closer to 22,000 later this week. Helping, JPMorgan says the market will continue to run until Nvidia reports earnings in late August. “We continue to find evidence for our bullish hypothesis: (i) resilient macro data; (ii) positive earnings growth; (iii) thawing trade war rhetoric,” JPMorgan said, as quoted by CNBC. “This week we are focused on [July nonfarm payrolls] and MegaCap Tech earnings.” We’re also waiting on earnings from Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple this week. Nasdaq could easily see higher highs 9:13 am With excitement over a trade deal with the US-EU, and hopefully with China, the Nasdaq could see higher highs. Helping, we&#8217;ll soon see major earnings from some of the top Magnificent 7 stocks, and hopeful hints of a potential interest rate cut by September&#8217;s Fed meeting. Stay tuned for more. Nasdaq futures are up about 108 points to 23,599 at the moment. If it can open at that level, that’ll put the tech-heavy index at new all-time highs. According to CNBC, “The moves come after the broad market index and the Nasdaq hit new all-time and closing highs during Monday’s trading session, just barely seeing gains. It was the 15th record close for the broad market index in 2025.” Fueling momentum, tech giants like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) soared by about $7.19 a share yesterday. Shares are up another $2.80 in premarket trading today. Helping, analysts at Bank of America just raised their price target on AMD to $200.

Now, markets are waiting to see if a deal can be made with China. That&#8217;s ahead of President Trump’s August 1 deadline. Plus, all eyes will be on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to leave interest rates as is. However, they’ll be listening to hints about a potential rate cut by September’s meeting. Friday will also be an important day, with the release of non-farm payroll numbers. Goldman Sachs Reiterated a Buy Rating on Microsoft Goldman Sachs says it’s bullish on Microsoft heading into earnings. “Microsoft is well-positioned to capitalize on this shift with a more capital-efficient and higher-margin recurring revenue model, just as it did during the on-prem to cloud transition,” as noted by CNBC. Analysts at Oppenheimer just reiterated a Perform rating on Apple ahead of earnings, noting, “We take a neutral view into AAPL’s F3Q25 earnings. We expect investors to focus on the revenue outlook for F4Q25 after normalizing the potential FX tailwind, Services revenue growth, and the sales trend in Greater China.” Citi analysts reiterated a buy rating on Coinbase, with a price target of $505 from $270. The firm noted the company has seen several catalysts recently. That includes the GENIUS Act, the House passage of the CLARITY Act, and its addition to the S&amp;P 500 index.

Key Points Tax Code Changes: The Big Beautiful Bill allows companies to expense R&amp;D costs within the year instead of over five years, providing significant tax advantages for tech firms. Domestic Manufacturing Incentives: The bill extends domestic credits for building fabrication facilities in the U.S., encouraging companies like Taiwan Semiconductor and NVIDIA to invest in local supply chains. Investment Opportunities: Companies specializing in high-tech build-outs and reshoring U.S. manufacturing are seeing substantial stock price increases, indicating a dynamic investment landscape in the tech sector.

In a recent episode of the AI Investor Podcast (embedded above), host Austin Smith and technology analyst Eric Bleeker discussed the implications of the Big Beautiful Bill on the tech industry, particularly regarding artificial intelligence and domestic manufacturing. The conversation highlighted a significant change in the tax code that allows companies to fully expense their research and development costs within a single year, rather than amortizing them over five years. This shift is expected to provide a substantial financial boost to major tech companies, potentially influencing their hiring and investment strategies. Bleeker elaborated on how this new tax structure could serve as a powerful incentive for companies to relocate their operations back to the United States. He pointed to the aggressive expansion plans of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) in Arizona and NVIDIA&#8216;s (Nasdaq: NVDA) strategic moves to enhance its supercomputer supply chain domestically. In addition, companies like Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) that are hiring aggressively for AI research are now incentivized to move that research back to the United States, as they can use research amortization to significantly reduce their tax bill. The discussion also touched on investment opportunities in companies that are poised to benefit from these changes, with some stocks already experiencing significant gains. One stock that Bleeker thinks has a lot to gain is Emcor Group (NYSE: EME), which benefits from domestic advanced manufacturing and the growth of new energy to power AI data centers. Bleeker emphasized that the evolving landscape of U.S. high-tech manufacturing presents dynamic investment prospects that could unfold over the next few years.

Close Shares of Marvell Technology (MRVL) soared on Wednesday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the chipmaker’s stock, citing the “exceptional” strength of AI demand. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore on Wednesday raised his Marvell price target by about 10% to $80 while maintaining an “equal weight” rating. “Marvell is firmly in the AI winners camp, and sentiment has swung aggressively negative compared to a few months ago,” Moore wrote. “We are more excited for their opportunity in optical, which brings higher margin and durability vs. their ASIC opportunity, which has disappointed.” (ASIC refers to application-specific integrated circuit, a class of customizable chip that combines several circuits to perform tasks that would otherwise require multiple interconnected chips.) Marvell shares were up more than 9% in recent trading, making it the best-performing stock in the Nasdaq 100. Despite Wednesday's gain, Marvell shares are down about 23% since the start of the year. Marvell is just one of several semiconductor stocks Moore expects to benefit from strong AI demand over the next year. He also raised his 12-month price targets on Nvidia (NVDA) by 17%, Broadcom (AVGO) by 25%, Astera Labs (ALAB) by 26%, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) by more than 50%. All of those stocks were also trading in the green on Wednesday. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) “While stock prices have moved higher, our conviction on AI spend durability in 2026 continues to grow,” Moore wrote. Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) last week raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast, citing the need to accelerate data center buildouts to meet seemingly insatiable demand for AI and cloud computing. Investors will get more updates on the strength of AI investment after markets close on Wednesday when tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) report earnings.

Free Cash Flow Turns Positive Again: Roku reported $26.5 million in free cash flow, swinging back into the black after a few quarters of cash burn. Operating leverage from better gross margins and tight expense control helped drive the shift. Active Accounts &amp; Engagement Trends 4:35 pm Active Accounts: 84.8 million (up 1.7M QoQ, up 12% YoY) Streaming Hours: 31.7 billion (flat QoQ, up 20% YoY) Roku added more accounts than expected, but total streaming hours plateaued sequentially — a key area to watch as engagement fuels ad inventory monetization. Guidance Update 4:23 pm Roku provided the following Q3 2025 outlook: Revenue: ~$940 million Adj. EBITDA: $(20) million Gross Profit: ~$430 million This represents a ~7.6% sequential growth in topline revenue, while narrowing EBITDA losses significantly. Gross margin guidance implies modest operating leverage ahead. CEO Anthony Wood emphasized that advertising spend is stabilizing, and Roku continues to gain share of traditional TV budgets. The tone was cautiously optimistic, especially on the AI-powered ad tools improving campaign efficiency and targeting. “We are seeing healthy engagement and strong monetization as marketers adapt to converged TV,” said Wood. CFO Dan Jedda added that “Disciplined expense management” remains a top priority amid evolving macro conditions.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Conference Call Is Over 6:10 pm Apple&#8217;s conference call has ended and shares are up 3%. Overall, the company did a lot tonight to push the narrative they&#8217;ll be aggressive to catch up in AI and that device sales are rebounding. It&#8217;s a good quarter for Apple that might start turning around what&#8217;s been a disappointing 2025. Tim Cook on AI 5:58 pm TD Cowen Analst: Tim, I was curious about your thoughts on AI for edge devices. There&#8217;s like some people who think that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you think &#8212; do you see a scenario where the LLM become a third part of your iOS or is the SLM the way to go and how to think about evolution of edge devices in a futuristic AI world and is smartphone going to be the choice of device. Just curious your thoughts on it, broadly speaking. Timothy Cook Chief Executive Officer The way that we look at AI is that it&#8217;s 1 of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. And I think it will affect all devices in a significant way what pieces of the chain are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn&#8217;t want to to really talk about today. because that gives away some things on our strategy. But I think it&#8217;s a good question. . Tim Cook on Apple Momentum 5:48 pm Here&#8217;s what Tim Cook had to say about Apple&#8217;s surprising momentum in China last quarter: &#8220;Yes. We did grow in Greater China by 4% during the quarter versus the previous quarter, it was driven by an acceleration by iPhone, although we also had substantial growth on the MAC year-over-year. From a &#8212; as you know, the government has placed certain subsidies that affects some of our products, not all of them, but there are some of them. And I think that had some effect. It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out. that cut in during a portion of the previous quarter. The other things I would say are that the installed base hit a record high in Greater China &#8212; and we set an all-time record for the iPhone installed base. The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter. And according to Boral Panel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top 3 models in Urban China, which is extraordinary. Also, if you look at the other products, Mac, iPad and watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China Mainland were new to the product. So lots of good things there. And the other thing I would point out, which is an interesting point, The MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model in all of China, and the Mac Mini was the top-selling desktop model in all of China. So overall, a positive &#8212; very positive quarter.&#8221; Apple&#039;s CFO Says AI Investments Will Rise 5:47 pm &#8220;I would say, a pretty significant driver as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. So that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we&#8217;ve been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers. The other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where in cases we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. So you are going to see an increase in CapEx. We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities in tooling, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you&#8217;re seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments.&#8221; &#8211; Kevan Parekh, Apple CFO Tariff Implications 5:22 pm On Apple&#8217;s conference call they just said they incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs last quarter.

As a result, several Wall Street analysts downgraded the stock this morning, and shares were down 38.1% as of 10:08 a.m. ET. The second-quarter results weren't bad. Revenue rose 19% to $694 million, which topped the consensus at $686 million. The company touted progress in several channels, including connected TV, retail media, and supply chain optimization, and its Kokai AI platform is being adopted by its customers. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose 12% to $271 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased from $0.39 to $0.41, which matched estimates. The Trade Desk's results make it clear that its growth rate is slowing, which is a problem for a stock that has historically traded at a high multiple. Several analysts downgraded the stock on the update. Bank of America double-downgraded the stock to underperform, saying concerns about competitive pressures were justified. At least three other analysts also cut their ratings as it appears that the ""walled gardens"" that The Trade Desk competes with like Netflix, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet are becoming stronger. Looking ahead to the third quarter, the company called for revenue of at least $717 million and EBITDA of about $277 million, indicating margins are expected to fall slightly on a sequential basis. The revenue forecast, which compares to the average estimate at $722 million, implies growth of at least 14%, a clear sign that growth is decelerating. Given that, the sell-off looks justified as The Trade Desk now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 31 based on adjusted earnings, which seems like a fair price now that its growth prospects are in doubt.",326.0,180.0,3.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.06111111111111111,0.016666666666666666,0.0,0.0,-0.044444444444444446

I see a market overreaction. Despite 26% YoY revenue growth to $51.24B, rising ad KPIs, and strong OCF, META sold off, leaving it the cheapest hyperscaler at ~25.6x forward P/E.
