Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (“KSF”), announces that KSF continues its investigation into AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV). Throughout the first half of 2021, the Company promoted its drug product, Rinvoq, a Janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”). During this time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced warnings resulting from studies of another JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz, which the Company downplayed as unrelated to Rinvoq. In September 2021, the FDA ordered “new and updated warnings” for Xeljanz, as well as other JAK inhibitors including Rinvoq, “since they share mechanisms of action with Xeljanz.” On December 3, 2021, the Company announced the updated warning for Rinvoq to include “additional information about the risks of malignancy and thrombosis, and the addition of mortality and MACE (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke) risks within the Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions sections.” The Company was subsequently sued in a securities class action lawsuit for failing to disclose material information, violating federal securities laws, which remains ongoing. KSF’s investigation is focusing on whether AbbVie’s officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company’s shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws. If you have information that would assist KSF in its investigation, or have been a long-term holder of AbbVie shares and would like to discuss your legal rights, you may, without obligation or cost to you, call toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or email KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn (lewis.kahn@ksfcounsel.com), or visit https://www.ksfcounsel.com/cases/nyse-abbv/ to learn more.

Genmab recently announced that the company will submit a biologics license application (BLA) for epcoritamab with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), also in the second half of 2022. The MAA submission is supported by results from the large b-cell lymphoma (LBCL) cohort of the pivotal EPCORE™ NHL-1 open-label, multi-center trial evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of epcoritamab in patients with relapsed, progressive or refractory CD20+ mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), including DLBCL. In April 2022, Genmab and AbbVie announced the topline results from the Phase II expansion part of the EPCORE™ NHL-1 trial. In June 2022, primary results were presented in a late-breaking oral presentation as part of the Presidential Symposium at the 27th Annual Meeting of the European Hematology Association (EHA2022) in Vienna, Austria. “The MAA submission will mark the next step towards potentially obtaining marketing approval in Europe and being able to deliver a new therapeutic option to patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab. “While there are existing treatments for DLBCL patients across Europe, we recognize the significant medical need for alternative therapeutic options for patients unable to tolerate current treatments or whose treatments have failed.” Epcoritamab is being co-developed by Genmab and AbbVie as part of the companies' oncology collaboration. The companies will share commercial responsibilities in the U.S. and Japan, with AbbVie responsible for further global commercialization. The companies are committed to evaluating epcoritamab as a monotherapy, and in combination, across lines of therapy in a range of hematologic malignancies, including an ongoing phase 3, open-label, randomized trial evaluating epcoritamab as a monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL (NCT: 04628494). About Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) DLBCL is a fast-growing type of NHL that affects B-cell lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. DLBCL, the most common type of NHL worldwide, accounts for about 25 percent of diagnosed cases of B-cell NHL worldwide. DLBCL can arise in lymph nodes as well as in organs outside of the lymphatic system. The disease occurs more commonly in the elderly and is slightly more prevalent in men.i,ii About the EPCORE™ NHL-1 Trial EPCORE™ NHL-1 is an open-label, multi-center safety and preliminary efficacy trial of epcoritamab including a phase 1 first-in-human, dose escalation part; a phase 2 expansion part; and an optimization part. The trial was designed to evaluate subcutaneous epcoritamab in patients with relapsed, progressive or refractory CD20+ mature B-NHL, including LBCL and DLBCL. Data from the dose escalation part of the study, which determined the recommended phase 2 dose, were published in The Lancet in 2021. In the phase 2 expansion part, additional patients are treated with epcoritamab to further explore the safety and efficacy of epcoritamab in patients with different types of relapsed/refractory B-NHLs who had limited therapeutic options. The primary endpoint of the phase 2 expansion part was overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by an IRC. Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of response, complete response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, time to response, time to next therapy, and rate of minimal residual disease negativity. About Epcoritamab Epcoritamab is an investigational IgG1-bispecific antibody created using Genmab's proprietary DuoBody technology. Genmab's DuoBody-CD3 technology is designed to direct cytotoxic T cells selectively to elicit an immune response towards target cell types. Epcoritamab is designed to simultaneously bind to CD3 on T cells and CD20 on B-cells and induces T cell mediated killing of CD20+ cells.iii CD20 is expressed on B-cells and a clinically validated therapeutic target in many B-cell malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.iv,v About Genmab Genmab is an international biotechnology company with a core purpose to improve the lives of people with cancer.

Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (“KSF”), announces that KSF continues its investigation into AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV). Throughout the first half of 2021, the Company promoted its drug product, Rinvoq, a Janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”). During this time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced warnings resulting from studies of another JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz, which the Company downplayed as unrelated to Rinvoq. In September 2021, the FDA ordered “new and updated warnings” for Xeljanz, as well as other JAK inhibitors including Rinvoq, “since they share mechanisms of action with Xeljanz.” On December 3, 2021, the Company announced the updated warning for Rinvoq to include “additional information about the risks of malignancy and thrombosis, and the addition of mortality and MACE (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke) risks within the Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions sections.” The Company was subsequently sued in a securities class action lawsuit for failing to disclose material information, violating federal securities laws, which remains ongoing. KSF’s investigation is focusing on whether AbbVie’s officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company’s shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws.
