ABBV,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,2021-02-03,2021-02-03T09:00:00-05:00,0,2021-02-03,prepared,,Richard Gonzalez,"Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 performance as well as our expectations for 2021. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our pipeline, and Rob will discuss the quarter and our 2021 guidance in more detail. Following our remarks, we'll take your questions. We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.92, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08. Fourth quarter total net revenues were up nearly 7% on a comparable operational basis. This performance was driven by robust double-digit sales growth from our immunology, hem/onc and neuroscience franchises, as well as 9% comparable operational sales growth of Botox Cosmetic, which is demonstrating a rapid recovery. Our fourth quarter performance topped off another excellent and truly transformational year for AbbVie, which included the successful acquisition and integration of Allergan, creating a stronger and much more diverse AbbVie with leadership across numerous attractive high-growth markets. Significant contributions from our two new best in category immunology medicines, RINVOQ and SKYRIZI , which combined for more than $2.3 billion in 2020 sales, their first full year on the market. We expect the combined contribution from RINVOQ and SKYRIZI to nearly double in 2021 to approximately $4.6 billion based on their continued strong uptake in RA and psoriasis as well as RINVOQ’s anticipated approvals in PSA, ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis later this year. We delivered continued robust growth from our leading hem/onc portfolio, with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA contributing more than $6.6 billion in combined 2020 sales. We expect our hem/onc franchise to grow double digits again in 2021. We also added two compelling oncology pipeline assets, Epcoritamab, a potential best-in-class CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody in development for B-cell malignancies and lemzoparlimab, an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody being studied in multiple cancers. These two assets will further support the growth of our hem/onc franchise across our long-range plan. The acquisition of Allergan brought us a substantial neuroscience portfolio with compelling therapies for migraine and psychiatric conditions augmenting our already existing neuro franchise. The newly combined neuroscience franchise delivered nearly $4.9 billion in comparable 2020 revenue and is expected to grow double digits in 2021. We also added the leading global Aesthetics franchise, a largely cash pay portfolio with roughly $3.5 billion in comparable 2020 revenues. As I previously noted, this portfolio has demonstrated a rapid V-shape recovery and we view Aesthetics as an extremely attractive long-term growth opportunity. And importantly, we made excellent progress in 2020 with our pipeline. We expect our R&D pipeline advancements to lead to the approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next two years, including a total of six additional indications for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, which will cover all of Humira's major indications plus new significant disease areas, including atopic dermatitis, expanded indications for VENCLEXTA and Vraylar and several new product approvals, including Atogepant for episodic migraine, Navitoclax for myelofibrosis and ABBV-951, a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. These new opportunities will collectively add meaningful revenue growth in advance of the U.S. Humira LOE. We've entered 2021 in a strong position, which is reflected in our revenue and earnings per share guidance. Based on the recent outperformance of our business, we expect full-year 2021 comparable operational sales growth of approximately 9.4% with total AbbVie sales expected to be approximately $1.7 billion above current consensus, and we anticipate 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $12.32 to $12.52, representing growth of 17.6% at the midpoint. This level of guidance represents impressive performance with nearly all aspects of our business expected to perform at or above current consensus for 2021. The Allergan integration continues to go very well. The transition has been seamless despite the size of the transaction and the timing of the COVID pandemic. While we're making excellent progress against our expense synergies, which Rob will cover in more detail here momentarily, it remains increasingly clear to us that there are significant opportunities for long-term revenue contributions across numerous Allergan growth platforms. As we recently disclosed, we believe UBRELVY , the first-to-market in leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. Atogepant, a potential once-daily oral treatment for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine also represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. We expect Vraylar's peak sales to approach $4 billion within its currently approved indications of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression with major depressive disorder or MDD, representing a potentially significant incremental growth opportunity. Aesthetics, which is poised to regain its growth trajectory this year is expected to generate high single-digit revenue growth over the next decade. We continue to closely monitor the COVID dynamics, which will have an impact on our business again in 2021, predominantly in the first half of the year, but significantly moderated from the 2020 impact. And despite the recent COVID resurgence within select geographies, we feel the global healthcare system is much better equipped with COVID treatment protocols in PPE to safely see and treat patients throughout the current year. That said, some therapeutic areas continue to be more impacted than others, like CLL, HCV, certain hospital-based procedures, among others, which we have contemplated in our 2021 guidance. Overall, we've been pleased with the rate of recovery across our business, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and our commercial execution. So in summary, we've assembled an impressive set of growth assets and the outlook for AbbVie's business remains strong. With RINVOQ and SKYRIZI expected to contribute more than $15 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2025 and our expectations for continued robust growth across hem/onc, neuroscience, and aesthetics, we have a high degree of confidence that we will be able to successfully absorb the Humira LOE impact in 2023, support an immediate return to total sales growth in 2024 and produce compelling high single-digit compounded annual total sales growth in 2025 through the remainder of the decade with the diversified portfolio and pipeline that we have today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?",1028.0,577.0,37.0,4.0,12.0,0.0,3.0,10.0,4.0,2.0,0.06412478336221837,0.006932409012131715,0.02079722703639515,0.0,0.005199306759098787,0.05719237435008666
ABBV,2021-02-03,2021-02-03,,2021-02-03,2021-02-03T09:00:00-05:00,0,2021-02-03,prepared,,Michael Severino,"Thank you, Rick. We've clearly made significant progress with our pipeline over the past few years, particularly our late-stage programs in hematologic oncology with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, and in immunology with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. Since inception, our R&D organization has delivered an impressive set of new products, which collectively contributed approximately $11 billion in revenue in 2020. We also continue to see significant evolution of our early and mid-stage clinical programs with many assets expected to transition to late-stage registrational studies over the next several years. We will continue to replenish our late-stage pipeline with innovative assets that have the potential to drive additional growth for AbbVie in the second half of the decade. At our recent immunology investor event in December, we provided a detailed overview of our immunology programs, highlighting the robust data generated to-date for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI across approved and pipeline indications. Included in this event, we presented positive topline data from two new Phase 3 studies for RINVOQ . Results from the first induction study in ulcerative colitis and results from the head-to-head study versus dupilumab in atopic dermatitis. We expect to see results from the second Phase 3 UC induction study later this quarter, and from the UC maintenance study in the middle of this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2021. Our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis are currently under review and we expect an approval decision in the US in the second quarter based on priority review and in Europe in the second half of the year. We recently received European Commission approval for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and expect approval decisions for those indications in the US in the first half of this year. I want to take a moment to address the topic of safety, specifically MACE and malignancies following the results from tofacitinib's post-marketing safety study. At present, there are no data to suggest the safety outcomes from their study applied to a specific JAK1 inhibitor such as RINVOQ. We are not aware of any signal for an elevated risk of MACE or malignancies with the RINVOQ or any JAK inhibitor other than Xeljanz. We conducted a pooled database analysis across our clinical trials for DVT, MACE and malignancies at the time of RINVOQ’s regulatory submission and have updated it periodically including up to the present. Rates with RINVOQ have not been elevated relative to competitors or to expected baseline rates. Importantly, there has been no increase or meaningful change in those rates over time. Additionally, we adjudicate events for MACE and DVT, which is considered the highest standard of evidence. If we look across our long-term database in RA, a population that is at increased risk for MACE events, our rates remain low. At the approved dose in RA, we have followed more than 3,700 treated patients totaling more than 9,000 patient-years' experience. Our rate of MACE events is 0.4 per 100 patient-years, which compares favorably to the expected rate of 1.0 to 1.7 events for 100 patient-years. In addition, there is no evidence of a dose-response between the 15 and 30-milligram doses. Similarly, the rate of malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer with similar follow-up is 0.8 events per100 patient-years. This rate is also consistent with the expected range of rates of 0.86 to 0.94 per 100 patient-years. And again, we see no evidence of a dose-response between 15 and 30-milligrams. Moving now to SKYRIZI; we also recently reported top-line results from the Phase 3 programs for SKYRIZI in Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. In the two Crohn's induction studies, SKYRIZI demonstrated significant improvements in clinical remission and endoscopic endpoints compared to placebo with symptom improvement seen as early as week four. Based on the data generated to date, we believe SKYRIZI has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. We expect to see results from the maintenance study in Crohn's disease later this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2021. We're also very pleased with SKYRIZI’s results in the Phase 3 studies in psoriatic arthritis, where we saw significant improvements in disease activity across both skin and joint endpoints compared to placebo. We believe that the activity we have seen on joint disease and the impressive skin clearance that is a hallmark of the SKYRIZI program make it a compelling offering for patients with mixed joint and skin involvement. We plan to submit our regulatory applications for SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis in the first half of this year. We're making good progress with our early and mid-stage immunology programs as well where we expect several data readouts and phase transitions in 2021. We expect to begin three new studies for ABBV-154, our TNF steroid conjugate including a Phase 2b dose-ranging study in RA as well as Phase 2 studies in Crohn's disease and polymyalgia rheumatica. And we'll see proof-of-concept data in the second quarter for ravagalimab, our CD40 antagonist in Phase 2 for ulcerative colitis, and for ABBV-157, our oral ROR-gamma T inhibitor in Phase 1 for psoriasis. Both of these programs experienced slight COVID-related delays with results now expected for both in the second quarter of this year. In oncology, we continue to make significant progress advancing our pipeline with numerous data readouts and regulatory milestones last year. As well as the addition of several new assets brought in through our in-licensing efforts, including Genmab's CD3xCD20 epcoritamab and I-Mab's anti-CD47 lemzoparlimab. We showcased new data from several programs at the recent ASH meeting where we presented nearly 40 abstracts from eight different assets. Notable presentations included data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE trial evaluating IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA in frontline CLL, which showed patients who achieved undetectable MRD following this combination maintain their deep remission at the one-year mark after stopping therapy with a 95% rate of disease free survival. We also presented new five-year data from VENCLEXTA’s Murano trial demonstrating the benefits of fixed duration VENCLEXTA combinations and helping patients achieve sustained progression-free survival. The latest results from Murano in the relapsed refractory CLL setting showed a median progression-free survival of 54 months in the VENCLEXTA and rituximab group, compared to 17 months in the bendamustine-rituximab group, three or more years after stopping treatment. Updated dose-escalation data from a Phase 1 study evaluating epcoritamab in B-cell malignancies were also presented at ASH. Epcoritamab is a subcutaneously delivered bispecific CD3xCD20 antibody being developed in collaboration with Genmab. In the Phase 1 study, epcoritamab demonstrated encouraging single agent anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with a consistent and favorable safety profile showing no Grade 3 or higher CRS events as well as limited neurotoxicity. We believe epcoritamab has the potential to become a best-in-class therapy across a number of B-cell malignancies including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. The Phase 3 trial in relapsed-refractory DLBCL recently began and we will provide updates on epcoritamab as its development program progresses. Initial results were also presented from a Phase 1 study evaluating TNB-383B in relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma. TNB-383B is a novel bispecific T-cell engaging immunotherapy targeting BCMA and CD3 being developed in collaboration with TeneoBio. These Phase 1 results demonstrated that the BCMA/CD3 bispecific provided overall response rates of 80% with a large number of patients achieving a very good partial response or better despite having received multiple prior lines of therapy. TNB-383B was well tolerated at all doses tested with a few off-target toxicities and no Grade 3 or higher CRS observed. With its safety profile efficacy and the convenience of once every three-week dosing, this agent has the potential to become a promising treatment option for myeloma patients. And our partner I-Mab published an abstract with initial results from a Phase 1 study evaluating lemzoparlimab in AML and MDS. These results demonstrated encouraging activity in relapsed-refractory AML patients and lemzoparlimab was well tolerated with no serious hematological adverse events reported today. Based on these promising initial results, we plan to begin new studies this year for lemzoparlimab in AML, MDS and in multiple myeloma. We also recently saw data from an interim analysis of a Phase 2 study evaluating Teliso-V in heavily pretreated non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer patients. The encouraging results from Stage 1 of this study met the criteria for advancing the program. With Teliso-V demonstrating a 54% objective response rate in patients with wild-type EGFR with highly expressed c-MET. In EGFR wild-type patients with over-expressed c-MET, which includes both high and intermediate expression, the objective response rate was 35%. Based on these results, we believe that there is an important role for Teliso-V in this target population, which represents roughly 25% of the non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer population. We will be opening the second stage of the study and are planning discussions with regulators regarding the potential of this study to support an accelerated filing. We expect 2021 to be another important year for our oncology pipeline with several regulatory submissions as well as data readouts across all stages of development. This year, we expect to see data for IMBRUVICA in the Phase 3 SHINE study in frontline MCL with regulatory submissions expected in the second half of the year. Data for IMBRUVICA in combination with VENCLEXTA in second line or greater MCL and frontline CLL with regulatory submission for frontline CLL expected in the second half of the year. We also expect to see data from registration enabling studies for VENCLEXTA in high-risk MDS and navitoclax in relapsed-refractory myelofibrosis. And we expect to see data from numerous programs in our early-stage oncology pipeline. In addition, the programs under collaboration with Calico are also progressing well. Our partnered effort is comprised of a strong pipeline of novel targets, which includes more than 20 active programs in discovery or preclinical development. Importantly, we currently have programs, which have advanced into clinical development in two areas immuno-oncology and neurodegeneration. The lead Calico program in oncology is focused on PTPN2 inhibitors, which act at multiple steps in the cancer immunity cycle and have potential applicability in a broad variety of tumor types. The discovery of novel orally bio-available PTPN2 inhibitors represents a significant breakthrough and a target class that has historically been considered un-druggable. We currently have two assets in Phase 1 development ABBV-CLS-579 and 484. We've seen evidence of immune activation in the clinic with this pathway and we expect to see proof-of-concept data from this program in 2022. The lead Calico program in neuroscience is an eIF2B activator, which targets a key regulator of the highly conserved integrated stress response pathway. Inhibition of this pathway has the potential to prevent pathology and restore function in a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and Parkinson's disease as well as in traumatic brain injury. Our lead eIF2B activator ABBV-CLS-7262 is currently progressing through Phase 1 and we plan to begin a study later this year in patients with ALS. In other neuroscience updates, last year, we completed our registrational program for atogepant in episodic migraine prevention and we recently submitted our regulatory application to the FDA. We expect an approval decision by the end of the third quarter. The data generated in our Phase 3 programs support a strong benefit-risk profile and we believe that atogepant has the potential to offer meaningful benefits to patients as a safe, effective, oral treatment option for the prevention of episodic migraine. In 2021, we expect to see data from several late-stage neuroscience assets, including results from two Phase 3 studies for Vraylar in major depressive disorder and results from the pivotal program for ABBV-951 in advanced Parkinson's disease with regulatory submissions for 951 expected in the second half of the year. We also expect to see proof-of-concept data for Elezanumab in a Phase 2 study in multiple sclerosis and ABBV-8E12, our lead anti-tau antibody in a Phase 2 study in Alzheimer's disease. In addition to 8E12, we have a number of promising approaches in Alzheimer's, including our neuroinflammation programs aimed at TREM2 and CD33, currently in clinical development, as well as other tau approaches in preclinical development. These include tau antibodies with different epitope specificity as well as approaches to clear intracellular tau. In Aesthetics, we continue to make excellent progress with our portfolio of facial toxins and dermal fillers with several regulatory submissions, data readouts and pivotal study starts expected this year. Our programs include new indications for Botox as well as innovative toxins such as new liquid formulations and both the long and short-acting toxins. We also have programs to develop new indications for the Juvederm Collection as well as novel dermal fillers such as HArmonyCa, which will be entering registration enabling studies in the U.S. And in eye care, based on the positive results from the Phase 3 studies evaluating our topical eye drop AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. We plan to submit our regulatory application later this month and expect an approval decision in the fourth quarter of this year. So in summary, our R&D productivity remained high last year despite multiple COVID-related challenges and we were able to maintain steady continuity and minimize delays. We're entering 2021 well-positioned for continued success and we expect significant program advancement across all stages of our pipeline, again this year. This includes five new asset or major indication approvals, half a dozen regulatory submissions, more than 10 pivotal study readouts, and more than 15 data readouts from early and mid-stage programs. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2021 guidance.

Starting with fourth quarter results, we once again delivered strong top and bottom-line performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.92 above our guidance midpoint by $0.08. Total net revenues were approximately $13.9 billion, up 6.8% on a comparable operational basis and ahead of our expectations. Immunology global sales were approximately $6 billion, up 14.8% on an operational basis. Within immunology, Humira sales were approximately $5.2 billion, up 4.4% on an operational basis with continued high single-digit growth in the US offset by biosimilar competition across international markets. SKYRIZI sales were $525 million and RINVOQ sales were $281 million with both products demonstrating strong sequential growth above expectations. Hematologic Oncology delivered another strong quarter with revenue of approximately $1.8 billion, up 15.5% on an operational basis with solid growth from IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. Aesthetic sales were more than $1.1 billion with Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm both experiencing a rapid recovery from the COVID pandemic. Neuroscience revenues were nearly $1.4 billion, up 14.9% on a comparable operational basis, led by Vraylar and our migraine portfolio. We also saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had sales of more than $900 million. Turning now to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 81.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 12.6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.3% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.9% of sales, an improvement of 230 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $618 million and the adjusted tax rate was 11.6%. As we look ahead to 2021, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $12.32 and $12.52, reflecting growth of 17.6% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $5.63 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We expect adjusted net revenue of approximately $55.7 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This forecast comprehends the following assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect immunology global sales of approximately $25 billion, including US Humira growth of approximately 8%, internationally Humira revenue of approximately $3 billion at current exchange rates, SKYRIZI global sales of approximately $2.9 billion, and RINVOQ global sales of approximately $1.7 billion. We expect hematologic oncology to grow double-digits with IMBRUVICA global revenue of approximately $5.7 billion and VENCLEXTA global sales of approximately $1.8 billion. For Aesthetics, we expect global sales of approximately $4.5 billion, including approximately $1.8 billion from Botox Cosmetic and approximately $1.3 billion from Juvederm. For neuroscience, we expect global revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, including Botox Therapeutic sales of approximately $2.3 billion, Vraylar sales of approximately $1.8 billion, and UBRELVY sales of approximately $400 million. For eye care, we expect global sales of approximately $2.9 billion, including approximately $550 million from RESTASIS, which assumes no generic competition in the first half of 2021. For women's health, we expect global revenue of approximately $1.1 billion. For remaining larger products, we expect global sales of approximately $2 billion from Mavyret, $1.2 billion from Creon, $1 billion from Linzess, $800 million from Synthroid, and $750 million from Lupron. Looking at the P&L for 2021, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 83% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.6 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $11.8 billion. This guidance includes approximately $1.7 billion in expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 50% of sales, which represents an improvement of roughly 200 basis points versus 2020. We expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2.4 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12.5% and our share count to be roughly flat to Q4 2020. As we look ahead to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $12.7 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 50% of sales. And we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.3%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.79 and $2.83, excluding approximately $1.32 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was $8.4 billion and we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $21 billion in 2021. This fully supports a strong and growing dividend, which we have more than tripled since inception, as well as rapid debt repayment where we expect to pay down $17 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021, including the $8.6 billion that was repaid in 2020. We expect to achieve a net debt to EBITDA ratio just below 2.5 times by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. We anticipate that our net leverage ratio will be approximately 2 times by the end of 2022. Our strong cash flow also allows for continued business development with approximately $2 billion allocated annually to augment our pipeline with the most promising external technologies and innovative mid to late-stage assets. In closing, we are very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in 2020. We've driven top tier growth while also advancing our strategic priorities and we expect to deliver robust performance in 2021 and over the long term.

And as usual, appreciate all the detail in the guidance, and congratulations on the results. A quick question on SKYRIZI and one on RINVOQ. First, one of your competitors had a negative result of a post-marketing study recently. I'm just wondering if you've had any discussions with regulators about conducting any other studies for RINVOQ or updating the label for RINVOQ as a result of that negative signal? And then, secondly on SKYRIZI, a commercial question. Your current price for the 150-milligram dose is about $85,000 and you're using 4x, the dose for ulcerative colitis. Could you just tell us how you can manage that? And is it feasible to have sort of different prices despite the big difference in dosing?

I will take your second question first and then we can cover the SKYRIZI question. With respect to RINVOQ, I assume you're talking about the tofacitinib safety study, which top line results fairly recently in the last several days and showed in that program that they were unable to exclude a risk of MACE or malignancy based on the criteria that were used to analyze that data sets. As I said in my prepared remarks, we've kept a very, very close eye on our data, both at the time of the NDA and in an ongoing manner since that time and we've not seen a signal. Our rates have not been elevated with respect to comparator or baseline rates and the rates overall remain low. With respect to your specific question about whether we've had discussions with regulators, regulators have not asked us to do long-term safety study in the way that Pfizer was asked. So that has not been discussed with regulators and we have not had any contact with regulators around labeling updates up to the present time.",189.0,84.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.023809523809523808,0.047619047619047616,0.0,-0.047619047619047616

We have anticipated the different markets and how we will approach the pricing. Now, it's important that we're just starting to see the SKYRIZI data. We saw the induction data, we'll see the maintenance data. I think it's important that as we look at our strategy that we're honing is for SKYRIZI, you're going to -- for Crohn's, you're going to have an induction dose, which is an IV at a different dose and we know that based on the form and some things we can believe we can price that to market. And also, we are coming with a unique approach for the maintenance as well depending on where that dosing falls out. And we would be using at that point, which is known as on-body injector.

So I want to appreciate the long-term guidance you've given recently on the top line. I'm just wondering how we should maybe think about the margin progression as we think about the Humira LOE in a couple of years?

I think when you consider the greater than $2 billion expense synergies from Allergan by next year and the P&L leverage that will come from the sales growth, we also expect for next year, you should expect that our operating margin will continue to expand through 2022. Upon the entry of U.S. biosimilars in 2023 and given Humira's profitability, it is reasonable to expect operating margin pull back. We've indicated before the 45% range based on our current LRP, I think it'll be a little bit higher than that. But then we've returned to growth immediately – in 2024, we'll return to revenue growth, a very strong revenue growth starting in 2025, you can expect then operating margins once again expand. We've had a long history of expanding operating margin by leveraging the P&L.

It's important to recognize that what we've communicated in long-term guidance on Vraylar is based on the three currently approved indications.

Now having said that, I think we do have -- I'd say, we're cautiously optimistic about the MDD indication and I'll let Mike kind of walk through how we look at it and what gives us that level of confidence.

I think that our optimism and I think that's the right way to express it in a disease like MDD, which is a challenging disease to work and is based on a couple of features. One is based on the basic pharmacology of Vraylar, which has a unique mix of D3, D2 specificity and other features that lead clinically to what's been described as a brightening effect, which seems to be beneficial in a number of settings. It's also driven by the results that we have from the MDD study that is positive that we already have in hand. So with one positive study, we would need only one -- at least one or, of course, both of the next two studies to read out positive, either of those outcomes would support a filing. We've done a deep dive into the study design and the patient population. We think it's a well-designed study. And we think the patient characteristics with respect to baseline factors and other elements are all very appropriate for this sort of study and we can assess that in a blinded aggregate way in a way that's completely consistent with the study rules for the conduct of the study. And so all of those things make us feel optimistic that it's a molecule with a good chance to work, well-designed study, well-conducted study, and we look forward to seeing the results. But as I mentioned, MDD is a challenging area. And for that reason, we didn't build into our deal model and we didn't factor it into our guidance, as Rick said, so we view this as upside.",292.0,123.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04065040650406504,0.016260162601626018,0.008130081300813009,0.008130081300813009,0.0,0.024390243902439025

We're very encouraged with the market that we're about to enter and I'll give you some context there. So when we look at the population, we see that just on the moderate to severe atopic derm patients that the market size or the potential is at least 2 times and probably closer to 3 times the size of the psoriasis market. And so this is very, very encouraging in terms of our ability to enter. It's also significantly under-penetrated. I mean if you look at the psoriasis market, you're talking about far greater than 10% or 12% penetration and in the single-digit, the low-single digits, where we are right now with the one biologic dupilumab. So it's very, very attractive. The other thing that I would say is that we see from our go-to-market approach that we know the HCPs very intimately. So about 85% of the market is driven by the derms, we know the derms very well and there is a 90% -- roughly 90% overlap with the big prescribers of dupilumab and drugs like SKYRIZI and our Humira. So we are very, very encouraged at the ability for this segment to rapidly expand, despite the fact there will be multiple new entrants coming in. To get to your specific question about the access ramp, we have a very strong position, as you know with RINVOQ right now in the existing indication of RA. We had greater than 95% commercial access, that's the dominant channel for atopic derm and our anticipation is we will have very strong access that we'll build to that level over the course of '21. Obviously, it's going to take some time, once we get the approval to go through the final approvals on the big commercial plans and so we see it's starting off slow, but then building into the middle of the year and certainly getting to a significant level at the end of the year. So the combination of the market, the asset itself, which looks very, very strong, as you've seen from the data and the way that we will play in our derm segment as well as the allergy segment give us a lot of confidence for a strong ramp in '21 and beyond.",396.0,156.0,9.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.057692307692307696,0.02564102564102564,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.0,0.03205128205128205

Obviously, if you look at the running rate out of the fourth quarter had [ph] strong running rate coming out of the fourth quarter but that's a $1 billion worth of growth from '20 to '21. The majority of that growth is going to come from continued performance in RA. I think where you will see the most significant impact from atopic dermatitis will be as we flow into '22, much like as you saw what happened in the RA market, it takes time for physicians to start to get adapted. Once they do, their momentum picks up. So, I don't remember the specific number. I'm not sure we gave that guidance anyway, but I would be thinking about it more than its continued penetration and growth in RA which drive in the bulk of that growth.

I think eye care is a very attractive market. The kinds of markets that I think we look for and that we are the very best at is where there are specialized physicians who really drive the use of medications based on the clinical data and being able to restate markets and improve standard-of-care in those markets, and certainly, eye-care, I think it fits that description. And so we would have a strong appetite to look for opportunities and we are looking for opportunities now that we could add to that eye care business to be able to drive growth. Obviously, RESTASIS, as Rob indicated in his formal remarks, we've built in a half a year that's still an unknown of when that product will go generic or if it will go generic.

I'd say as we've studied the Aesthetics market and had an opportunity to be able to operate the business now for some time, I think we're even more enthusiastic about the long-term ability to be able to grow this market. I would say some of the areas that were a bit of a surprise to us is the responsiveness of this market to patient activation, and I would say that the strategy that we've put in place is one where we are funding the business on a very -- on a continuous basis at a high level to achieve the level of activation that we're looking for and we think that will, certainly, you can see, the response I guess an example in Botox already, we are seeing a very aggressive response in being able to grow the market, you saw the Botox grew -- Botox Cosmetic grew in the fourth quarter to 9%. I would expect that we can continue to drive that level of growth. And as part of legacy Allergan, I think it was much more episodic in the way this was funded quarter-to-quarter where we basically built a funding plan that will allow them to continue to drive activation over a longer term [ph]. I'd say the second thing that's it's of interest to us is, I think this is a market where you can drive significant innovation. If you fund that innovation in a way, again on a more continuous basis and advance those programs more aggressively, and have a well thought out strategic roadmap as to where you're trying to drive some of these markets. As Mike mentioned in his comments, our goal is to basically try to advance the level of performance of the toxin market significantly over time. And the same with the filler market. There are certainly things that we can do to expand the areas that you could use fillers, both within the US and globally and that's a significant opportunity. But long term, we think there is an opportunity to take some of the biologic expertise that we have here at AbbVie and create more biologically active fillers, and not only do physical filling but also improve collagen, improve elastin, and other kinds of characteristics that will improve skin quality. And we think that will be -- if we're successful, we think that will be a significant opportunity to drive long-term growth. And then, the last thing I'd say is the geographic footprint that AbbVie has. We obviously have a very broad geographic footprint and the structure that we've set up is this totally integrated global unit that we're operating the Aesthetics business really gives them the freedom to go out and expand or more aggressively fund areas around the globe that they think there is a significant opportunity. A good case in point is I believe it was in the fourth quarter, we funded a significant expansion in China to be able to increase the sales force there to be able to drive it more deeply into a broader set of the cities in China to the next level down and we are already seeing the benefits of that, China is already back to growing much like it did pre-COVID. So I think there's a lot of attractive attributes about that. On IMBRUVICA maybe Jeff and I will tag team on that one. What we're clearly seeing is the COVID is having an impact on patient starts in CLL. We're not only seeing it IMBRUVICA, but we're seeing in VENCLEXTA as well. And then somewhat logical when you think about these oncology practices of trying to reduce density and CLL is a disease where you can, in many patients' cases, you can delay therapy for some period of time. I would say that's the vast majority of it. When we look at -- when I look at the overall share. And the reason why I'm talking about the overall share is VENCLEXTA is now gaining a significant level of momentum in this market as well. When I look at our overall shares in first line, second line or third line, we continue to have the dominant share position. And I'd say probably, partially due to your question, if I look at Calico [ph] I'd say it's performing at the expectation we have. I think the first line share is about 12%, slightly higher in second line maybe 14%, and I don't recall the third line share...",784.0,342.0,21.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,4.0,1.0,0.06140350877192982,0.011695906432748537,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.0,0.049707602339181284

AbbVie delivered one of the first completely clean and compelling quarters in pharma this cycle, and I have to believe, has something in reserve for upside as the year unfolds. I'm sure you monitor the competition, so beyond the AbbVie management team itself, what about your business do you think is allowing you to execute in this way? Would you attribute it to -- mainly to the products themselves, the payer strategies, geographic mix, or is there something else? And the second question is the ongoing Vraylar Phase 3 trials utilize doses up to 3-milligrams while the successful prior trials were up to 4.5-milligrams, so why were the doses lowered in the first place? And what placebo response mitigation methods are included in the ongoing trials?

I would say, first and foremost, we are a very disciplined organization in how we approach execution in the marketplace. We tend to probably, in [ph] some extent, obsessively plan and then go out and try to execute against that plan and I think in times of difficulties that kind of discipline tends to demonstrate itself and that's when you see the biggest differences. So that's not say [ph] other people don't do it like that. I'm not that familiar with how others operate, but I know how we operate and I know how we contingency plan and we look at. Okay, if that doesn't work, what are we going to do and we do that ahead of time, if that doesn't work, what are we going to do. And I think that kind of contingency planning and focus on execution is helpful. I'd say the second thing is, if I look at our business, we put a strategy in place and I feel very good about how the business is performing overall. I mean I would say the business is firing on all cylinders. And you can look at our fourth quarter performance, to your point, and I think it demonstrates that and you can look at our guidance and it demonstrates that almost every single product area is performing at or above, most of them above what consensus was and then I think it's another indicator for you and we have a much more diverse business now. We have four major growth platforms that are helping us drive that level of growth. Our new product launches are doing extremely well. Obviously, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are, but I'd also say UBRELVY and Vraylar are performing extremely well and the pipeline, I would say one of the things gives me the most confidence is when I look at the pipeline behind that. It's designed to be able to drive our long-term growth because one of the things that we focus on is how we're going to make sure that we continue to drive this business to perform at the level its performing over the long term. And so if I look at the SKYRIZI and RINVOQ R&D execution around the follow-on indications, it's been nothing less than spectacular both from a timing standpoint and the kind of data that we have been able to produce. When I look at our hem/onc strategy, we've had a very disciplined strategy there ensuring that we have enough assets to continue to grow. What has become a very large franchise for us. Our franchise is $6.6 billion as we said, we're going to grow in double digits. Over the long term, what's going to allow us to do that? Well obviously IMBRUVICA is going to continue to drive share, VENCLEXTA is going to continue to drive share in CLL but VENCLEXTA has indication expansions in the area of potential, in the areas of T1114 and a broader AML population and several other areas. Then I look at Navitoclax. We should get that product approved and give us an opportunity in myelofibrosis and then you look at Genmab and you look at our CD47, those will all allow us to ensure that we can sustain that growth profile over the long term. In neuroscience, same thing, atogepant will allow us to expand into the broader migraine population. So I feel very good about what we put in place and our ability to execute against that. So I think there is not one silver bullet that I can point to. I think it's all of those things, certainly, our ability in market access has helped a lot in the US. I think we're very good at that, but you have to have the right kinds of assets in order to execute that. You have to have assets that are differentiative like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. So it's the combination of all of that gives you this performance and gives you the long-term sustainable ability to deliver that kind of performance and I feel awfully good about where we are.",722.0,290.0,8.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.027586206896551724,0.013793103448275862,0.013793103448275862,0.0,0.0,0.013793103448275862

I believe you're talking about the ongoing MDD studies and what I would say there is that the dose selection was based on everything we know about dose-response, not only from the prior MDD studies but across the program and we've done a deep dive into that and we're confident that we're at a dose that ought to have optimal effect in these indications -- in this indication. With respect to your question about placebo response rate, managing or controlling the placebo response is extremely important in all studies, but particularly in depression studies and other studies in psychiatry. And I would say that there are many different approaches that are taken that are complementary to each other. The first and most important is appropriate site selection, one has to select sites with an appropriate patient population with experienced investigators who are also experienced evaluators in a clinical trial setting and that's one of the most important things to getting high-quality data to determine whether a drug works. The next element has to do with investigator training, investigator manuals, protocol design and also with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria to make sure that you have a patient population that is representative of the population that you would expect to treat post-registration if the study is successful. And we've taken a look at all of these things, we've taken a look at the blinded aggregate data and we feel good that the measures that we have in place will effectively control the placebo response and give us a quality readout.",279.0,134.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.022388059701492536,0.014925373134328358,0.007462686567164179,0.0,0.0,0.007462686567164179

I mean we have a significant investment from an R&D standpoint. And in disease-modifying approaches for a number of different neurological diseases that Mike has talked about and mentioned in his comments earlier. So I'd say we have a significant R&D investment. We obviously are investing in Vraylar to continue to expand that asset. Again, our goal will be to invest in these areas where you can get maximum capture -- market share capture. I think if you look at Vraylar and you look at the projections that we made over time, if you look at the sequential year-over-year dollar growth of that business, that's how you get to that number. And basically, we're going to be able to sustain that, we expect to continue to sustain it as relatively low market share, but that's not unusual. And in this market, because there's a lot of generic products that psychiatrists, cycle patients through and sometimes in combination with patients. So we're going to invest in the business to be able to drive the maximum level of profitable share as we do in any other segment that we're in.

We think we can get to approaching $4 billion. When you look at the migraine portfolio, peak sales are greater than $1 billion for both the UBRELVY and Atogepant. We have 951 in the pipeline that we think can be a significant contributor, obviously, Botox Therapeutic will continue to grow.

I think first, the asset itself is very, very attractive. And when you look at the response on the migraine free days at the 10 to 60-milligram, it's really impressive data, very impressive data as this very strong oral. And so we think that we can come at this in a couple of different ways. Obviously, you highlighted the leveraging Ubrelvy. We've got a dedicated sales force that calls on the specialty organization, the neurologists as well as the headache specialists will actually carry both UBRELVY and atogepant in their call plan to really leverage the knowledge of a very established sales force and as well as focus on the big primary care writers that see a lot of migraine sufferers. So this is -- this is an important dynamic that will, we'll be able to leverage when we get into the market towards the end of the year. Also, we are looking at the ability to see how you look on the back end of the migraine journey so patients are on Botox Therapeutics, for example, which is very substantial. It's the leading in play share for chronic migraine. But many of those patients don't get full efficacy results. So ultimately the combination of Botox plus atogepant as a way to get really migraine freedom in the toughest patients is another area over the long term that we think can leverage these assets across the board, whether it's you UBRELVY on the front end with acute atogepant in the middle, oral for episodic and chronic or Botox on the back end.

This is Mike, I'll take your first question on ABBV 154 our TNF steroid conjugate has not been delayed because of COVID. There were some delays in other early immunology programs. Our CD 40 and our ROR gamma-T program experienced modest delays but 154 did not. As we said at the time of the COVID peak over the course of last summer, there were a small number of studies that we delayed initiation and delayed enrollment, is the programs that I'm talking about TD 40 and ROR gamma T were impacted modestly in that time period but 154 was not so that remains on-track. We remain confident in it. We have selected 154 as the agent to go forward. Remember that we had two 3373 and 154 and we selected 154 because of advantages it had in linker technology, we're planning to initiate a large Phase 2 B study in the first half of this year and then today, we're now saying that we will also be studying Phase 2 Crohn's disease, as well as polymyalgia rheumatica, and that's an important set of indication that covers a wide range of opportunities, RA and Crohn's disease areas where we are very active, PMR polymyalgia rheumatica is a new area where there is not a lot of therapeutics, unfortunately, it is a well-established area in medicine but there is very little in terms of treatment for these patients, they have considerable pain and suffering from their condition and it's -- and it's particularly steroid responsive.

If you look at the total AbbVie share, it's approximately 45%, so very remarkable when you add Humira plus SKYRIZI in the dermatology space.

We had a few inbound questions on the treatment of the royalty and I know you've answered this question a little bit in the past, but also just noticing the big non-cash GAAP charge you took this quarter, you back out a non-GAAP earnings. So I know you have described accounting for this as a business combination. But can you maybe give a little bit more color on the rationale and the accounting behind that non-cash charge and then is there also some threshold number or other event where you'd add this royalty expense back to non-GAAP. And then, on AbbVie 951; we picked up a decent amount of KOL excitement around this asset in Parkinson's. I know Phase 3 is expected later this year, but I wonder if you could maybe talk about the launch -- your launch expectations on this and maybe contrast it to the Duodopa experience just from our feedback, it seems like this could expand the addressable PD population pretty sizably and Rick maybe frame how this sort of factors into your long range $10 billion neuroscience guidance.

So that means each quarter we do a mark-to-market, the fair value of the future milestone royalty payments and you did see us take a fair value write up this quarter. Based on the higher sales outlook as we communicated during the Immunology Day event in December and you see in the guidance provided today, obviously the outlook for SKYRIZI continue to increase. And so we're recognizing that liability going forward. We also take into a consideration because it's a fair value measure what the market is assuming. So it's not just our own forecast. It's also what street expectations are and those have also increased as we've seen a very nice ramp. We are starting to see obviously the confidence from the street increase that's translated into a higher outlook for SKYRIZI which then translates in a higher future potential royalties. One of the reasons I wanted to stress, also on the free cash flow in my remarks today is because there is some confusion over that's how we account for, but it's important to keep in mind that when I talk about free cash flow of $21 billion this year, that accounts for the royalty payments of - to BI. And so you can look at a few different ways, you can look at it from a – if you can track the consideration accretion that we're recording and the liability on the balance sheet as an indicator of the future outlook, but also as we monitor our cash flow pretty carefully what does that contribute to overall cash flow. So we would not be going back, we made a determination as a business combination. We don't -- should not anticipate that we would reverse that but we'll provide obviously more clarity on what those royalties look like going forward given the size of the asset.",338.0,150.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.02666666666666667,0.0,0.0,-0.02

Well, that was really, it wasn't like a judgment call or something thing to desire to do the accounting, said to be accounted for in that fashion. It's since been changed going forward. But the window in which we that occurred that was the required accounting treatment. So number two, Jeff and I will cover number two, sort of a high level look and then Jeff, maybe can give more specificity around that. If you look at Duodopa I mean this is a -- this is a therapy that has absolutely phenomenal efficacy and you can see these patients who cannot move early and you turn on the pump and you start giving them the drug and within a very short period of time, they will gain their motion. The challenge is a very difficult treatment to the patient to basically deal with and the caregiver to deal with on a long term sustainable basis; you have to do surgery, insert a G-Tube, you got to maintain that G-Tube opened, so that does somewhat limit the population is able to use it. And so we view this as a way to significantly expand the market. Jeff is obviously far more familiar with it. So I'll let him, give you a little more specific, but that's the general concept. I think this could be a significant -- wanting to be a significant treatment for these patients who need this kind of therapy.

Rick, it's we hear the same thing from our KOLs, they're very, very encouraged and with the perspective you look at Duopa or Duodopa, about $0.5 billion product with a really difficult challenge on on-boarding for these patients. Right. You have to do the J-Peg surgery. You have challenges with the size of the pump. Nonetheless, it's still remarkable that we do get that level of sales. So if I give you some perspective on the market. If you look at the advanced Parkinson disease market, 90% of it is really old generic orals where the patients just have to take more and more oral medication before they can have any -- any relief. And then, they are still in big trouble. So, only a minority about 10% ever get to let's say more advanced device-aided therapy, which is Duopa or Duodopa and deep brain stimulation. So, as we studied the market we agree that as we look at the ability to sort of move from a more convenient way a simple way for neurologists to get a more advanced therapy without doing a procedure, whether it's brain surgery or the -- or the GI surgery we think we can start to move upstream into that 90% of really non-workable oral segment.

I'll take the question on the heme-onc portfolio mid stage and newer technologies, but I would say is there is a lot going on in our heme-onc portfolio. Obviously with our late-stage molecules in the mid-stage. I think you'll see a focus on T-cell redirection, which is of course a newer technology. And I think a very attractive approach to harness the immune system to control these cancers and you see good progress with our CD3 by CD20 and our BCMA T cell redirecting therapies. And so, that is clearly an area of focus for us now and I think we'll continue to be in the future. With respect to gene therapy, gene therapy is not a single thing it can be used in different ways. Gene replacement is not an area that we've been focused on. Gene delivery is an enabling technology for other therapeutic approaches like cell-based therapies and we have early programs and cell-based therapies in heme-onc and in other areas. Solid tumor oncology and potentially other areas in the future. And so that's something that we are keeping a close eye on and making sure that we have access to the enabling technologies we need to prosecute those targets. I think that for those sorts of approaches we're probably one generation away from things that are broadly applicable. But we are exploring possibilities that we think can fulfill that next generation need. And so we are keeping up a broad eye and are essentially therapeutically agnostic. What I mean by that is we look for the best tool to do the job. We don't find it tool and then figure out how to use it. And so in each of these cases we're going after strong biology. We're going after things that we think will raise the bar on the standard of care.

I’ll discuss our first quarter performance and outlook, and then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. We’re off to an excellent start this year, delivering strong top and bottom line first quarter performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.14. Total adjusted net revenue of $12.9 billion was up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis, nearly $250 million ahead of our expectations. These results include strong performance across each of our core therapeutic areas, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, neuroscience, and esthetics, as well as high single digit operational growth from hematological oncology. Additionally, we continue to see robust sales from our key and newly launched products. Skyrizi and Rinvoq contributed nearly $900 million in combined revenues this quarter, more than double the sales versus the prior year as both products continue to ramp in their initial indications. Imbruvica and Venclexta delivered combined sales of approximately $1.7 billion, reflecting continued leadership in CLL and other hematological malignancies. Vraylar, which remains one of the fastest growing medicines in psychiatry, delivered more than 20% comparable operational growth. Ubrelvy, the leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, generated revenue growth of approximately 25% on a sequential basis, and within our leading esthetics portfolio, which is performing well above pre-COVID levels, Botox cosmetics and Juvederm are demonstrating robust performance. Both of these brands grew more than 40% on a comparable operational basis. The integration of Allergan also continues to go very well. As illustrated by our balanced results this quarter, we are clearly demonstrating that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with the scale and flexibility to fully invest in the business for long term growth. While the pandemic has categorically impacted our day-to-day lives, we are encouraged by the latest recovery trends. We see market growth and new patient activity increasing overall, especially in March, although certain markets continue to remain below pre-COVID levels, including CLL and HCV in particular. We expect that increasing vaccinations globally will continue to support a fully recovery across our therapeutic areas as we progress through the remainder of this year. Based on our robust performance this quarter and the continued strong outlook for our business, we are raising our full year 2021 EPS guidance and we now expect adjusted earnings per share between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of more than 18% at the midpoint. I’m also extremely pleased with our R&D prospects, including the number and potential of the opportunities especially within our late stage pipeline. We’re on the cusp of the potential commercial approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next two years, including five total expected approvals in 2021. This includes Atogepant, a novel oral CGRP for episodic migraine, adding to our already attractive migraine portfolio; a new eye drop for the treatment of presbyopia, as well as expanded indications for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and atopic dermatitis, and we expect more than half a dozen new product or indication launches in 2022, including Navitoclax for myelofibrosis, ABBV-951 for advanced Parkinson’s disease, Skyrizi for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease, Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis, Vraylar for major depressive disorder, and initial indications for Imbruvica and Venclexta. With these collective new growth opportunities and the continued momentum of our underlying portfolio, our long term outlook remains very strong. In closing, our focus remains on strong commercial and operational execution as well as pipeline advancement. I’m pleased with the financial results for the quarter and the overall pace of the recovery across our portfolio. We’re off to another excellent start in 2021.

We demonstrated strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and commercial execution. Our immunology portfolio delivered global revenues of more than $5.7 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 12% on an operational basis. Humira sales were approximately $4.9 billion, up 2.6% on an operational basis with continued high single digit growth in the U.S. offset by biosimilar competition across our international markets, where the unfavorable impact was more moderate than expected in the quarter. Our new immunology agents, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, are both demonstrating robust prescription growth well above all comparable launches. Skyrizi sales were $574 million, reflecting 34% in-play patient share, which includes new and switching patients. This is more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor. Skyrizi total prescription share in the U.S. psoriasis biologic market is now approximately 15%, second only to Humira. Additionally, we recently received approval for a single dose prefilled pen for Skyrizi which will reduce the number of injections per treatment. Skyrizi is now the only quarterly dose psoriasis treatment available in an auto injector, further improving the patient experience. Rinvoq sales were $303 million with strong in-play patient share of approximately 15% in the U.S. RA market. Physician and patient feedback remains very positive on Rinvoq’s level of efficacy, speed of response, and strong benefit-risk profile. Internationally, both of these new assets delivered strong double-digit sequential growth with ramping access in share. Skyrizi has now also achieved in-play patient share leadership in the EU 5 psoriasis market, exceeding Tremfya and Cosentyx and at parity with Taltz. As Mike will discuss momentarily, we are also making considerable progress to expand the uses of Skyrizi and Rinvoq in several immune-mediated diseases with half a dozen additional indication approvals expected later this year and in 2022. In hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.7 billion, up 7.3% on an operational basis. Imbruvica continues to perform well across multiple indications, including CLL, where it remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. Imbruvica sales increased 2.9% on an operational basis this quarter with performance impacted by lower new patient starts within CLL, where the market remains below pre-COVID levels. Imbruvica growth was also unfavorably impacted by the COVID-relating stocking benefit that we saw in the first quarter of 2020. Venclexta sales were $405 million, up 24.5% on an operational basis with increasing share in frontline CLL and continued strong performance in AML. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 10.9% on a comparable operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of $346 million were up 21.2% on a comparable operational basis, reflecting a nearly 2.5% total prescription share of the U.S. atypical antipsychotic market. Within migraine, the launch of Ubrelvy is exceeding our expectations with $81 million of revenue in the quarter. Feedback from physicians has been very positive, highlighting Ubrelvy’s efficacy, safety, convenient dosing profile, and overall commercial access. Ubrelvy is the number one branded acute treatment for migraine based on both new patient share and prescription growth. The oral CGRP therapies, including our leading Ubrelvy, now represent roughly 16% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market. We believe there is substantial room for long term growth in this rapidly expanding segment based on unmet need and strong patient demand. We also look forward to the expected commercial approval of Atogepant, our oral CGRP for episodic migraine later this year. Botox therapeutic is seeing a very nice recovery in chronic migraine as well as its other indications, with total sales of $532 million, up 7% on a comparable operational basis. Lastly in our other key therapeutic areas, we saw significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $817 million. Mavyret sales were $450 million, down 28.4% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes have remained below pre-COVID levels, and we also saw double-digit comparable growth from Linzess, the leading branded prescription medicine in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with IBSC, or chronic idiopathic constipation. Overall, I’m extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we are making with recent new product launches. We remain on track to deliver very strong revenue growth in 2021. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs.

I’ll start with immunology, where we continue to make good progress with Rinvoq and Skyrizi in new disease areas, as well as in our early and mid-stage immunology programs. We recently reported positive top line results from the second induction study for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis. Similar to results from the first induction study, in this Phase III trial Rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on disease activity as measured by clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement. The 45 milligram induction dose was well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with previous Rinvoq studies. In these induction trials, we saw no DVT, PE, MACE events, or malignancies in the Rinvoq groups, and the rates of serious adverse events were numerically lower than placebo. We believe these induction data compare very favorably to other UC treatments on the market or in development and based on the data generated to date, Rinvoq has the potential to become one of the most highly effective therapies for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We expect to see results from the UC maintenance study this summer with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of the year. The Rinvoq program in Crohn’s disease is also progressing very well, and we expect to see induction data from the first of two Phase III trials in the fourth quarter, followed by induction data from a second Phase III trial and maintenance data in the first half of 2022. We’re also nearing completion of our pivotal program for Skyrizi in Crohn’s disease. Earlier this year, we reported positive results from the two Crohn’s induction studies and we expect to see maintenance data this summer. Our regulatory submissions for Skyrizi and Crohn’s disease remain on track for the second half of 2021. Following completion of our registrational program for Skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis, we recently submitted our regulatory applications in the U.S. and Europe with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2022. We’re very pleased with the level of activity we saw with Skyrizi on both joint disease and skin clearance in our Phase III program and look forward to providing this new treatment to patients suffering from psoriatic arthritis. Our regulatory submissions are currently under review for Rinvoq in three new indications in the U.S.: ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis. As we’ve previously announced, the FDA recently extended the review periods for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis following a request for an updated assessment of the benefit-risk profile for Rinvoq in these indications. In response to the FDA request, we provided updated data from across Rinvoq programs in RA, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis. Based on the review extensions, we now expect approval decisions for psoriatic arthritis in June and for atopic dermatitis in July. The regulatory action date for Rinvoq in ankylosing spondylitis is unchanged and remains on track for June. We remain confident in the benefit-risk profile of Rinvoq across all indications and will work with the FDA to bring Rinvoq to market in these new disease areas. Earlier this year, we received European approval for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and AS. Our European regulatory application for Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis is under review and we remain on track for a CHMP opinion this summer with an approval decision anticipated in the third quarter. We also recently saw results from a four-week Phase Ib study evaluating our novel small molecule RORγT inverse agonist, ABBV-157, in patients with psoriasis. By targeting RORγT with an inverse agonist rather than an antagonist, we believe we can more effectively inhibit IL-17 production, thus resulting in a greater impact on skin inflammation. In our Phase 1b study, 157 showed promising activity as an oral psoriasis agent and we plan to move the asset forward to a larger Phase IIb dose ranging study in the second half of this year. Moving now to our oncology portfolio, we continue to make very good progress with our late stage programs for Imbruvica, Venclexta and Navitoclax, as well as with our early stage oncology assets. We remain on track for several key regulatory submissions, data presentations, and phase transitions this year. At the upcoming ASCO and EHA meetings, we will be presenting more than 40 abstracts, including results from the Imbruvica plus Venclexta CAPTIVATE trial fixed duration cohort in treatment-naïve CLL patients. The Imbruvica-Venclexta combination is an important element of our hema-on strategy to provide a differentiated fixed duration treatment that offers deeper levels of response. Data from our Imbruvica-Venclexta combination studies will support regulatory submissions in frontline CLL later this year. We will also be presenting four-year follow-up data from Venclexta’s CLL14 trial in frontline CLL as well as updated efficacy and safety data from a Phase Ib study evaluating Venclexta plus azacitidine in treatment-naïve, high risk MDS patients. We expect this MDS study to complete in the second half of this year and, if positive, it could support a submission in the first half of 2022 to seek an accelerated approval. In the area of solid tumors, at the recent AACR meeting we presented Phase II results for Teliso-V in non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. In this study, Teliso-V demonstrated promising response rates in heavily pretreated patients, particularly in patients with highly expressed c-Met where we saw a 54% objective response rate. c-Met is an attractive target across multiple tumor types, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer where approximately 30% of patients have over-expressed c-Met. Approaches in this area have historically focused on small molecule kinase inhibitors and anti c-Met antibodies, both of which have shown only limited efficacy in this patient population that has not been sufficient for approval. In contrast our c-Met antibody drug conjugate is a novel approach that we believe will have broader applicability and will provide enhanced efficacy compared to previous approaches. We recently began the second stage of our Phase II study which has the potential to support an accelerated approval in second line plus metastatic non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. We also plan to evaluate Teliso-V in the frontline setting, including in combination with other agents, as well as in other c-Met positive tumor types. We also have a next-generation c-Met ADC program that will be entering the clinic later this year. Our new c-Met ADC, ABBV-400, utilizes a topoisomerase inhibitor payload which we believe will provide greater anti-tumor efficacy against both amplified Met and over-expressed c-Met subtypes, thus providing deeper responses with broader applicability than other anti c-Met targeting agents. In neuroscience, we recently presented data from several key programs at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting. A total of 33 abstracts were presented, including data from the Phase III ADVANCE study in episodic migraine prevention, showing that Atogepant has the potential to be a highly effective, safe and well tolerated oral treatment option with a rapid onset of action. The FDA recently accepted our NDA for Atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine and an approval decision is expected in September of this year. We also presented results from an open label Phase III study evaluating Ubrelvy in perimenstrual migraine which showed that Ubrelvy has potential as a safe and efficacious treatment of migraine attacks that occur during or near menstruation. Menstrual-related migraine attacks can be more difficult to treat because they are often longer in duration, more severe, and often resistant to treatment. We presented data from a Phase I study demonstrating that ABBV-951 subcutaneous infusions maintain an equivalent Levodopa exposure to Duopa in advanced Parkinson’s patients. Results from the pivotal program for ABBV-951 are expected this summer with the regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of this year. We also remain on track for readouts in the fourth quarter from two Phase III studies for Vraylar in adjunctive major depressive disorder and, if successful, we would anticipate regulatory submissions in the first half of 2022. In eye care, we submitted our regulatory application in the U.S. for AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. 584 is a once-daily eye drop being developed to help address symptoms that are often corrected through reading glasses. This new technology represents a complementary product to reading glasses and would be a convenient on-demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia. An approval decision is expected in the fourth quarter of this year. In esthetics, we are investing to accelerate key next generation toxins and filler programs. By combining the esthetic team’s deep expertise with AbbVie’s breadth and scale of resources, we’ll be able to bring novel products to market significantly faster. Looking across our portfolio, we’ve identified a number of programs to accelerate, including our short acting and long acting toxins, as well as our next generation bio-stimulatory tropoelastin and collagen fillers. Acceleration of these programs is expected to drive significant long term growth for the esthetics franchise. In summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance and financial outlook.

Starting with first quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, up 21.9% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were $12.9 billion, up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis excluding a 1.1% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51% of sales, an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $622 million and the adjusted tax rate was 12.3%. As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of 18.8% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $5.10 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of 9.8% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we continue to expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This implies a full year revenue forecast of approximately $55.9 billion. Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect international Humira revenue of approximately $3.1 billion and we now expect Botox cosmetic sales of approximately $1.9 billion. All other full year assumptions remain unchanged. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $13.6 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.6% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.05 and $3.09, excluding approximately $1.78 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, we continue to make great progress on our Allergan transaction commitments. We realized over $360 million in expense synergies in the first quarter and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. We have already paid down $10.4 billion of combined company debt. We continue to expect cumulative debt pay down of $17 billion by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4 times by the end of 2021 and approximately two times by the end of 2022. In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across the portfolio and financial results ahead of our expectations.

As we think about FDA balancing lowest effective dose versus incremental efficacy and safety risks, what would the impact of only having a 15 milligram versus a 15 and 30 milligram approval have on your view on the atopic derm opportunity, which I think you talked about is about a $2 billion sales potential previously? Then my second question was just a little bit more color on the esthetic dynamics. Is there anything we’re seeing with the results we’re seeing--very, very strong here, is there any catch-up type event as the world reopens that we’re seeing with these results, or are these sustainable underlying trends that are kind of coming in above expectations for that business?

I’ll take the first question and then Rick will take the second question that you asked. With respect to Rinvoq, we feel very confident in the benefit-risk profile across indications and across the doses that we study. Having said that, both the 15 and 30 milligram doses have performed very well, both from an efficacy and a safety perspective, and so if you look at the efficacy results that we drove with 15 in atopic dermatitis, we drove high levels of response, very rapid response, and had a very prominent impact on itch, which is one of the most bothersome symptoms, with 15 as well as with 30. With the 15 milligram dose, for example, we saw statistically significant and clinically significant reduction in itch after only two days, which is really quite remarkable in this disease. Again, that’s really one of the most bothersome symptoms to patients. We think we could be successful with either dose, to answer your question specifically, but we also remain confident in the benefit-risk of both doses.",176.0,84.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0

I think if you look at the underlying performance of the esthetics business, in particular the market growth in the U.S. and in China, it’s driving the fundamental growth that we see through the business. Certainly there is some impacts still from COVID, so we’re seeing some impact there, but I think the majority of it is when we took over Allergan, we made a decision to really invest in promotion at a much higher level than they were investing in it prior, and they had an approach that was more of an episodic investment approach where we have basically made a decision that we’ll fund across the entire year at a relatively significant level to drive demand, because the data clearly supports that you can grow this market. I think the best comparison is to start to look at what it looked like versus 2019, because you obviously had the COVID impact in 2020, but you take for example Botox - Botox versus 2019, cosmetic Botox versus 2019, it’s up about 27%. The market’s growing very robustly. Some of that is probably COVID-driven - these are U.S. numbers I’m describing right now. Some of that is probably COVID-driven, but I wouldn’t say a lot of it at this point is COVID-driven in the U.S. China continues to grow very well - in fact, I’d say China is back to the level of growth, and we have expanded the sales force in China once, about four or five months ago. We’re in the process now of going through a second expansion in China and we expect that China will continue to drive significant growth going forward. The one area that still is being impacted in a fairly significant way from COVID is the European market. We still see it--we see it starting to emerge in areas like the U.K., but there are other areas in Europe that are still in lockdown. I would expect that Europe and Brazil as well will hopefully start to see some recovery as we get into the second half of this year and they can start to contribute, which would add additional growth to the overall business. But I would tell you I’m very pleased with the decisions we’ve made around driving more promotion, and I’m pleased with the execution of this team. This team has done extremely well in executing and driving the kind of share position that we want and the growth that we want, so I think it is sustainable going forward.",447.0,194.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.015463917525773196,0.0,0.010309278350515464,0.0,0.0,0.015463917525773196

First Rick, something we don’t talk about a lot, which is the neuroscience portfolio, and you’ve started reporting it combined. I know there’s four products in there, but adding them up, the long term guidance you provided previously was about $8.3 billion, I think, and you’re already annualizing it close to $6 billion. Could you give us a sense of how much upside that portfolio has, given the trends that you’re seeing? Then on a related question, I hate to harp on the JAK question, but obviously there’s a lot coming to us from what this impact might be, so if you were confined to the 15 milligram dose not because of any signal but because of the regulators’ view of the safety of the class, how much impact would that have on the $8 billion long term guidance, and do you have other levers which you could pull to fill whatever shortfall that would cause?

But I think when you look at the two major growth franchises there, being the migraine franchise and the anti-psychotic franchise with Vraylar, both of those, we think, have significant opportunity to continue to grow. You’re obviously seeing Ubrelvy now perform extremely well in the marketplace - I think Jeff can probably give you a little more color on that, and Vraylar is continuing to perform very well as well. I think if we are able to achieve one positive study on MDD, I think that will give us significant growth going forward. This is a franchise that we’re excited about.

It’s hit, I mentioned 16% for the quarter, but now on the weeklies it’s 17% or above on just the penetration of that segment, so we see a lot of runway in that segment over our long range planning. Certainly the availability of another oral CGRP, in this case for episodic migraine, allows us to compete in a much larger segment beyond the acute, and to Rick’s point, remember we have the big anchor asset with Botox therapeutic in migraine on the back end for chronic migraine and we have plans in place to expand that upstream also into episodic migraine. This is actually in some ways non-overlapping because we have a big injector base for Botox and then we can have the neurologist and primary care base for Atogepant, and so when you look basically really across the waterfront - you know, leading acute agent, oral, very, very potent and active oral agent in the middle with episodic, and then on the back end with Botox, it’s a very nice portfolio for us that will drive growth. As Rick mentioned, we are encouraged on the potential for adjunctive MDD, and that segment itself when we do the market analysis is about as large, the adjunctive MDD segment, as bipolar depression, and so this basically has the opportunity for us to really double the potential penetration over our long range plans, so we’re very encouraged over this set of assets.",263.0,117.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.03418803418803419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03418803418803419

There’s not much bipartisan agreement in the U.S. over drug price reform but there seems to be a lot when it come to antitrust in relation to the pharmaceutical industry. Perhaps Rick could comment, following last night’s House Committee on the Judiciary, where there was lots of pointed talk from both sides focusing firstly on patent thickets, second on having a presumption of anticompetitive behavior in terms of assessment of large scale in particular M&A, meaning that it would impact future business development for the industry, so that’s the first question. Then the second question, rather more positive, in terms of the JAK, when I look at consensus, the forecasts for Rinvoq are about $6 billion. When you look at the size of the opportunity in RA alone, let alone psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, UC, and the other indications you have, is it conceivable to you, short of this drug effectively or the class being heavily limited or pulled from the market, that that $6 billion looks like an incredibly conservative estimate for what this drug could do?",188.0,90.0,3.0,5.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.05555555555555555,0.06666666666666667,0.022222222222222223,0.0,-0.022222222222222223

Clearly I’ve accepted the invitation to be able to testify to the Committee on May 18. We certainly feel absolutely comfortable and confident in the way we operate in this market. This is a highly competitive market where Humira competes, and certainly as we look at the patents that were issued for Humira, they went through a rigorous process in order to be issued. They represent true innovation to the product. They were challenged by competitors, just like every competitor has a right to challenge a patent if they don’t believe it’s valid or appropriate, and those patents were challenged and the vast majority of those patents survived that challenge. What I’d say is when we look at our behavior in this market, I think our behavior was absolutely pro competitive. We had patents that went all the way out to 2034 in that portfolio and yet we chose to license every single biosimilar player in 2023, literally 11 years before the last patent would have expired.

I guess it was more general rather than just AbbVie-centric, how it would impact BD and the ability of the industry to operate if pricing can’t get resolved.

When I look at the current consensus, obviously as you quoted, it’s a little bit--just a little bit above $6 billion from the numbers that I’m looking at, and I look at the growth beyond ’25, it’s nowhere near what we’re expecting, so we feel very good about the opportunity there.

Agree - these are spectacular assets with incredibly dynamic market, so we see across the rheumatology markets, the atopic derm market, we see the IBD market which with both assets we think is underappreciated. I mean, even expansion in second and third lines as new assets come in that are really breakthrough assets with higher levels of efficacy, and so we clearly believe that consensus is conservative here. Just a comment on atopic derm - this is an explosive market. I mean, it is significantly underdeveloped in terms of the penetration, so it’s going to grow substantially, and even if you look at conservative assumptions on where we source business - you know, the growth of the second line, that’s not to say that we’re not going to be very competitive in front line. It’s a very, very attractive space. Again, I think the performance that we’ve seen, the clinical performance that we’ve seen right now, primarily on the induction trials for Skyrizi and Rinvoq, Skyrizi in Crohn’s, Rinvoq in UC, is very, very encouraging, so we see that cascading over our long range plans as well.

First on Ubrelvy, you mentioned it looks like the class is doing very well and gaining share. It also looks like over the last few weeks or so, you’ve been gaining a little share within the class relative to Nurtec, so I’m just wondering if you can share your perspective on what you think is driving that. Some of us thought it might be due to pricing and access, but based on our calculations, it looks like your gross to net is actually lower than what it is from the Biohaven side, so any perspective would be helpful. Then on Atogepant, maybe just a little more, if you could talk to your go-to-market strategy, assuming approval in September, especially given Nurtec will likely have an indication for both treatment and prevention. How do you see coming in with two separate drugs - you know, could be two co-pays, could be just a different message relative to a single drug, so just any perspective on how competing with that would be helpful as well.

In terms of the acute market, as I mentioned, the penetration of the overall segment is increasing very, very nicely, as I highlighted. If you look at the mix between Ubrelvy and Nurtec, we have gained a little bit over the last few weeks, but it’s very close. We typically run at 51%, 52%, 53% of the new prescription basis. I think you are quite perceptive over the value creation that’s taking place there, and I clearly don’t have full insight into the Biohaven fall through, but we’ve been quite disciplined. We have over 90% commercial access, so we’re quite comfortable where we are from an overall access perspective, and our team remains quite disciplined in terms of making sure that we both drive the right type of volume with our positioning but also the right type of profitability over time. We’re encouraged with our continued momentum with Ubrelvy. In terms of Atogepant, I think what’s quite impressive about our program there is just the sheer level of efficacy that we have, and I think this is very important in terms of sometimes the narrative over simple or easy versus, look, how do you think about the best drug for episodic prevention, particularly when you choose an oral, so we are at the very, very high end of the migraine freedom or the days of migraine control with this new asset, and we think that frankly you need to take care of the migraine and Atogepant will be very well positioned to do that. We also think that we’ll have nice synergies. Obviously we have a fairly significant sales force that is promoting Ubrelvy to both neurologist and high prescribing general practitioners, and it will fit in very well as we put Atogepant into that sales fleet, so we’re set up well, we think, for our go-to-market.",317.0,136.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.04411764705882353,0.007352941176470588,0.007352941176470588,0.0,0.0,0.03676470588235294

With respect to why Imbruvica is being hit harder than other anti-cancer agents in the pandemic, I think it has to do with the underlying rate of progression CLL. CLL, while it is a very significant limiter of long-term function and survival, in the short term there’s a sense that therapy can be delayed if necessary because the rate of progression is relatively slower than other forms of cancer, for example certainly much slower than AML, another indication that we are very active in, in the hema-on space.

It seems relatively odd that there was such a big jump in the middle of a wave of the epidemic in January-February for a physician-administered product.

It has been a very difficult are to approach in general, and we believe Vraylar has a good profile there and has a good overall impact on the disease, a very strong overall impact on the disease, but it’s also one that’s been very challenging from a labeling perspective in the U.S. It’s been a very difficult claim to get in the U.S. It’s not clear that there is a specific path to negative symptoms in the label, but I do think the overall profile of Vraylar in schizophrenia, both with respect to symptom control and benefit risk, are viewed very positively by treating physicians, and I think the overall benefits are well understood by treating physicians and I think that is reflected in Vraylar’s overall strong performance.",198.0,83.0,5.0,11.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.060240963855421686,0.13253012048192772,0.024096385542168676,0.012048192771084338,0.0,-0.07228915662650602

One, Rick highlighted the sales force dynamics in China. We’ve definitely focused our sales team on the migraine component. The other thing that’s taken place is a little bit, I think, of an investment approach. We’ve had more consistent consumer investment since we had the integration than previously at the legacy Allergan, so I think the combination of the consumer investment, new waves where if patients access an injector at a neurologist, they can get a sample of Botox right at their first appointment rather than wait for many months.

As you said, it’s certainly early in the process and we obviously know what’s being proposed, but we don’t necessarily know where we will end up. I think one of the important things that we need to continue to think through is if we go back to--you know, one of the reasons why back in 2017 tax reform was passed was to make sure that two things happened: one, that U.S.-based companies were competitive with their foreign competitors, and two, it encouraged companies like ours to invest in the United States. I can certainly talk about the AbbVie example. I think it’s pretty compelling when you sit back and look at--you know, we were able to go out and acquire a Irish company, re-domicile it back to the United States. AbbVie today has 24,000 jobs in the United States. We’ve also increased investment significantly in the U.S. since tax reform. Over the last three years, we’ve invested $1.5 billion, we committed that we’d do $2.5 billion over time. We’re going to exceed that commitment. We’ve added about 1,500 jobs over that period of time. Companies like ours clearly took the benefit of tax reform and that has allowed us to be able to be more competitive and certainly in the acquisition of a company like Allergan, I think that was clearly demonstrated, but we also have invested much more aggressively in the U.S. I think going forward, one of the things that important for policymakers to balance is to make sure that we don’t go back to where we were, and that is where U.S. companies aren’t as competitive against their foreign competitors. The current proposal would make the U.S. have the highest rate of all developed countries - I’m not sure that’s the position you’d want to be in, so hopefully as we go forward, there will be a balance that’s looked at in raising taxes but also making companies maintain a competitive position and continue to be incented to invest in the U.S.",362.0,163.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.024539877300613498,0.006134969325153374,0.0,0.0,0.018404907975460124,0.018404907975460124

I think if you look at our overall estimate of high single digit growth on esthetics, it’s not heavily reliant on a large number of new products. There will be new products that come in - they’re probably closer towards the back end of the long range plan so they don’t have a significant impact on that overall growth rate, so I think we fundamentally believe that the market dynamics are such and the brands are competitive, highly competitive in this market, that we have the ability to grow the market and continue to maintain our share position in that market, and that will allow us to be able to drive that level of growth or higher.",134.0,67.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.014925373134328358,0.0,0.04477611940298507,0.0,0.0,0.014925373134328358

Again, as Rick mentioned, we’re not counting on a significant contribution to the pipeline, although we will continue to drive innovation particularly with toxins and fillers, and of course as you’ve heard before, it’s important within body contouring to continue to drive innovation there as well, so we feel very good about that outlook and we’re not counting on a ton from the pipeline there.",139.0,69.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216

Are you hearing anecdotally any physicians that may be switching patients from Xeljanz to Rinvoq in RA, if there is a perceived safety benefit with Rinvoq as a more selective JAK, are you able to take advantage of that at all? Then secondly, if Rinvoq gets approved for atopic derm, how will you look to build out your presence with dermatologists? Will you leverage your current footprint on the esthetics side, or will you have a completely different medical derm team?

We’re actually not hearing physicians, from our intelligence, from our field teams, actively thinking to switch patients from Xeljanz to Rinvoq. I mean, that’s a big decision for a physician. What we have heard is when we do some of our research and our ear to the ground, we clearly see that oral surveillance is perceived as a Xeljanz issue, so typically what will happen is you may see people take their foot off the gas on some new starts, but we don’t see or hear certainly any widespread news of active switching, so that’s basically our intelligence on your first question. In terms of your second question, we will not be using the esthetics sales force. We will basically leverage our existing infrastructure that we have with some expansion we’ve taken place for Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis. I think as you know, in terms of our reputation amongst the medical derms is extremely strong. We have the number one reputation because of the years of Humira in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and HS, and obviously we have a very, very strong impression and launch from Skyrizi, so we’ve basically designed a sales force that through our management, which has been connected to these derms for more than a decade, and existing reps with some new reps in there, we are building--we have built a sales force that will work seamlessly with our Skyrizi teams to give a very nice offering to those dermatologists. An important fact is that basically the overlap of those dermatologists that drive basically the atopic derm market is about 90% between the atopic derm market and the psoriasis market, so we feel we’re well positioned in terms of how we’ve set up our go-to-market approach with the segment.",314.0,132.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.007575757575757576,0.0,0.0,0.0

Are you assuming that a new bar has been set by deucravacitinib in terms of efficacy versus Otezla, and is that something you’re very mindful of as you consider your own programs? Secondly for Rick, I realize AbbVie was born out of a company that had devices and pharma under one roof, but clearly you’ve embraced esthetics, for example, that good franchise building could involve drugs and devices or drugs that need to be delivered by device.

With respect to oral psoriasis agents, we would want to come in from an efficacy perspective with something that clearly exceeded the threshold that existed in the past with Otezla, and I think coming in a range that is Humira-like or better would be our goal. I think if you look at BMS’ Tyk2, they sort of come in at that Humira-like efficacy, and so I think that is generally the range that we’re talking about. I think when one talks about a direct comparison in terms of where a bar is set, we have to look not only at efficacy but at safety and at the totality of the data. Obviously it’s extremely early for our RORγT agent, but we think it is a molecule, because it impacts very well understood biology with a good understanding of where to go from an efficacy perspective and a good understanding of safety, that we can get in a range that’s very competitive there, so I think we’d be looking for that Humira-like efficacy or greater as something that we would like to use to enter the space with in oral, obviously coupled with a strong safety profile.",213.0,88.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.011363636363636364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03409090909090909

I think the way we approach the markets that we operate in is we look for areas where there is significant unmet need and then we ultimately try to come up with solutions for those needs. Sometimes it’s drug only - in fact, I’d say the majority of our historical experience as AbbVie has been drug-only, but as an example, 951 is a good example of where it’s a combination product, right - a device and a drug. Certainly as we look at ophthalmology, we have implantable devices that were part of the Allergan acquisition that are important therapeutic options, that are available for physicians and patients. I’d say we tend to go at it and we’re certainly not opposed to devices being part of it if they can add to the ability to be able to provide for an advancement in the standard of care. In esthetics, as Rob indicated a moment ago, we’re looking at what is that big third leg on the stool, and we believe that is body. I would say in the area of body, devices are going to play a much more critical role, and so that’s an area where I think you’ll see us embrace even device-only kinds of strategies because they provide the right solution for that particular improvement. It’s an area that historically many of us know well because of our experience, as you pointed out, in our previous life, but I’d say also the teams in the organization itself tend to look for broad-based solutions that can meet the unmet need.",278.0,121.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.03305785123966942,0.01652892561983471,0.01652892561983471,0.0,0.0,0.01652892561983471

Just on Vraylar, you have strong long term guidance of $4 billion with just the existing indications, but the script trends at least seem to have slowed down, obviously in part because neuro has been weak as an overall therapeutic area during the pandemic. But just wondering--and just given that the quarter itself was a little bit weaker, I think, versus expectations, can you talk about the broader neuro market? Is that weakness there, because we do see strength with Ubrelvy and with Botox therapeutics, so just wondering if there’s something going on specifically with Vraylar? Has the bipolar depression opportunity been tapped out for some reason, and what can you and need to do to accelerate growth for Vraylar with the existing indication? That’s number one. Number two on Rinvoq, I think understands the rates around DVTP and MACE, but if you could give a little bit more clarity, based on the updated data that you’ve filed with the agency, what the rate of malignancy is across the indications, and whether that’s any different between the strengths and how that compares to the background rate.

The macro prescription market has been down a little bit versus historical trends, but we really think it’s simply a timing issue, and I’ll give you some numbers that support that. Before COVID hit, right in the first quarter of last year, the new to brand, or NBRx for Vraylar was about 3,500 new to brand prescriptions a week, and what we saw is during COVID, that dropped down all the way to about 2,700 - that was the nadir, and then it’s consistently come back up. Towards the end of March, we started to hit or recover that pre-COVID historical rate, so progress is there, and ultimately the way we see these markets function, as you recover your NBRx momentum, the TRx’s will start to come, so we’re encouraged on the latest trends. But your point is right - it has been a little bit soft on the market, and certainly as a brand Vraylar dropped because of COVID, but is now really fully recovered and so we should see continued recovery of the momentum there.

I'll discuss our second quarter performance and outlook. And then Jeff, Mike and Rob will do our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie delivered another excellent quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.11, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04. Total adjusted net revenues of nearly $14 billion were up 19.3% on a comparable operational basis, approximately $375 million ahead of our expectations. These results demonstrate our strong and balanced performance across each of our major growth franchises, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, hem/onc, neuroscience and aesthetics. Looking at the most recent trends, the vast majority of our portfolio is well into the recovery phase from the pandemic. In immunology, we continue to see strong recovery across the room, derm and gastro segments with positive trends across all key indicators, including new patient starts. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ continue to ramp nicely in their initial indications, with both products demonstrating robust double-digit sequential revenue growth. In neuroscience, Vraylar is demonstrating strong new prescription volume in the atypical antipsychotic market and the launch of Ubrelvy, the leading oral CGRP for acute migraine continues to exceed our expectations. Aesthetics continues to perform well above pre-COVID levels exceeding our internal expectations. We're pleased with the rapid market growth in both toxins and fillers, driven by our increased promotional resources globally, brand strength and COVID-related pent-up demand. Rapid global market demand is expected to remain well above historical levels in the near to medium-term and we are raising our full year guidance once again for aesthetics. While the recovery across the AbbVie portfolio is going very well in aggregate, in certain disease areas like CLL and HCV, we continue to see a residual impact from the pandemic. We expect these specialty areas to further recover as the year progresses. One of AbbVie’s greatest strengths is the dedication and engagement of our people. Across AbbVie, the majority of our employees have safely returned to the workplace. And our field teams are now predominantly conducting live engagements with physicians and customers, where protocols and guidelines permit. I'm extremely proud of the teamwork and collaboration our people have demonstrated throughout this pandemic, to bring our medicines to patients and keep our business performing at a strong level. As an organization, we have also made a tremendous amount of progress with the Allergan transaction and integration. We just recently completed our first full year as a combined company, which I'd say has gone exceptionally well. We're tracking well against the operational and financial commitments we outlined at the time of the transaction, with a crucian performing above our original projections. But I'm particularly pleased with the robust revenue performance that we've been able to drive since acquiring Allergan. With 2021 sales tracking to grow significantly faster than legacy Allergan’s historical performance. Our results continue to show that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with numerous products within our newly combined portfolio delivering robust growth. Based on the continued strong momentum of our business in the quarter and our progress year-to-date, we are once again raising our full year 2021 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $12.52 to $12.62, reflecting growth of 19% at the midpoint. Our strong performance allows us to continue to fully invest in the business for long-term growth. As you'll hear from Mike momentarily, we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our research and development programs. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our performance in the quarter and with our continued strong momentum of the business, which has positioned as well for the remainder of 2021 and many years to come.

I'll start with immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.1 billion, reflecting growth of 13.8% on an operational basis. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ continue to have significant impact on AbbVie’s growth and performance, contributing more than $1 billion in combined sales this quarter. SKYRIZI global revenues were up 17.4% on a sequential basis, reflecting increasing market share globally. In the U.S., SKYRIZI continues to perform well and has maintained its leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients at approximately 34%. SKYRIZI’s total prescription share capture is now approaching 20%, second only to Humira. Internationally, SKYRIZI has achieved in-play patient share leadership in 13 markets, including Canada, France and Japan. RINVOQ is also demonstrating robust growth with global sales up nearly 25% on a sequential basis. We continue to see in-play patient share of approximately 15% in the U.S. RA market, where physician and patient feedback remain very positive on RINVOQ’s strong benefit risk profile. Internationally, RINVOQ access and share continue to ramp nicely in RA, with in-play market leadership now in half a dozen key countries. We are also making excellent progress with the regulatory approval and commercial launch of PSA and AS across several OUS countries. And we look forward to the approval and commercialization of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis later this year following the recent CHMP positive opinion for both the 15-milligram and 30-milligram doses. Humira global sales were approximately $5.1 billion, up 3.6% on an operational basis, with continued high single-digit revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 12.6% on an operational basis. In hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.8 billion, up 13.2% on an operational basis. AbbVie maintains a strong leadership position in CLL with a combined portfolio, including both Imbruvica and Venclexta, new patient share of approximately 42% and total patient share of approximately 72% across all lines of therapy. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 7.2%. In the U.S., performance continues to be impacted by lower new patient starts in CLL, which remain below pre-COVID levels as well as increasing competitive dynamics from newer therapies, including Venclexta and other BTK inhibitors. Venclexta sales increased 38.3% on an operational basis with strong demand across all approved indications. We're particularly pleased with the performance in AML with robust share in the U.S. and increasing momentum internationally following recent approvals in the EU and Asia.  In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.4 billion, up 29.6% on a comparable operational basis. We continue to see strong momentum with Vraylar, which recently achieved multiple all-time highs in weekly prescriptions and market share. Vraylar revenues of $432 million were up more than 25% on a comparable operational basis. And Ubrelvy once again delivered robust results. Sales of our leading acute migraine treatment were $126 million, exceeding our expectations. Feedback from physicians remains very positive, highlighting Ubrelvy’s rapid and sustained pain relief, safety, convenient and flexible dosing profile and overall commercial access. Ubrelvy is now capturing roughly 9% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market, with more than 1 million cumulative total prescriptions since the launch. We continue to believe there is substantial room for long term growth in this rapidly expanding acute market based on unmet need and strong patient demand. In migraine prevention, we've also been planning and preparing for the forthcoming regulatory approval and commercial launch of Atogepant, our oral CGRP for episodic migraine. We're very encouraged with the efficacy profile of Atogepant, including reduction in migraine days versus placebo, as well as the overall percentage of response rates in patients. Now the launch of Atogepant will be supported by our existing migraine sales force with commercial access expected to ramp strongly, we remain on track for a U.S. regulatory decision in September. Botox Therapeutics continues to perform well across nearly a dozen medical indications, with a total sales of $603 million, up more than 38% on an operational basis. In chronic migraine, Botox Therapeutic remains a foundational prevention treatment, and the clear branded leader in new patient starts. Lastly, in our other therapeutic areas, we saw significant contribution from eyecare, which had revenues of $919 million, up 24.1% on a comparable operational basis. Mavyret sales were $442 million, up 13.9% on an operational basis, although treated patient volumes remain suppressed versus pre COVID levels. And we also saw double digit comparable operational revenue growth for both Creon and Linzess. So, overall I'm pleased with the momentum of our therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating a strong recovery as well as our progress with new recent product launches.

I'll start with immunology where we had several notable pipeline events in the quarter. In the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we reported positive top line results from the Phase 3 maintenance studies for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis, and SKYRIZI in Crohn's disease. In the RINVOQ UC maintenance study, both the 15 and 30 milligram doses met the primary and all secondary endpoints at week 52. In the induction portion of the program, RINVOQ demonstrated a very strong impact on the disease. And the results from this maintenance study demonstrate that patients continuing treatment with RINVOQ maintain high levels of clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic improvement at the one-year mark. In fact, maintenance treatment with either dose of RINVOQ resulted in some of the highest rates of remission and endoscopic improvements seen in UC clinical studies. With the 30 milligram RINVOQ dose 52% of patients achieved clinical remission, 62% achieved endoscopic improvement, 49% achieved histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement, and 68% achieved steroid free remission. We are very pleased with how RINVOQ performed from a safety perspective as well. In this maintenance study, the exposure adjusted event rates for overall adverse events including serious and severe events were higher in the placebo group than in either RINVOQ dose group. Additionally, the exposure adjusted rates for MACE, VTE and malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer were comparable between RINVOQ groups and placebo. These results provide further evidence that RINVOQ has the potential to become a highly effective therapy for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We're also nearing completion of the Crohn's disease program for RINVOQ and expect to see data from the first Phase 3 induction study later this year. Results from the second induction study and the maintenance study are expected in the first half of next year, with regulatory submissions also anticipated in 2022. We also saw very impressive results from SKYRIZI in the maintenance phase of our Crohn's disease program, particularly with the 360 milligram maintenance dose, which met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response versus the withdrawal arm at week 52. Importantly, when we look at the most stringent endpoints, we see strong separation between SKYRIZI 360 milligrams and control with the response rates of 39% for endoscopic remission, and 29% for deep remission, compared to 13% and 10% for the withdrawal group at week 52. We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in UC and SKYRIZI in Crohn’s in the coming months. In the quarter, we also announced updates regarding our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. In June, RINVOQ received a positive CHMP opinion in Europe recommending both the 15 milligram and 30 milligram doses in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. This CHMP opinion puts us on track for European approval in August. When approved atopic dermatitis will be the fourth indication for RINVOQ in Europe. Regarding our supplemental NDAs in the U.S., we recently announced that we were notified by the FDA that they would not need our PDUFA action dates for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and atopic dermatitis, which were in late June for psoriatic arthritis and AS and mid-July for atopic dermatitis. The agency cited their ongoing review of the tofacitinib ORAL surveillance study indicating that they needed more time to complete their reviews of the data. The FDA has not requested any additional safety analyses for RINVOQ since the PDUFA dates were missed. While there are no new action dates, based on our discussions with the agency, we expect decisions on our regulatory applications in the next few months. Following completion of the agency's review of the tofacitinib ORAL surveillance data. We remain confident in the benefit risk profile for RINVOQ across all indications. And we'll continue to work with the FDA to bring RINVOQ to market in these new disease areas. In our early-stage immunology pipeline, we recently began two new trials for ABBV-154 our TNF-steroid conjugate. We initiated a definitive dose ranging study in patients with RA and also started our Phase 2 study in polymyalgia rheumatica. Later this year, we expect to begin the Phase 2 study for 154 in Crohn's disease. Also in the quarter, we completed the induction stage of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluating ravagalimab in ulcerative colitis patients. While this CD 40 antagonists demonstrated greater efficacy compared to historical control, the efficacy results did not meet our prespecified criteria. As a result, we will not be advancing ravagalimab in ulcerative colitis. In oncology, we continue to make good progress across all stages of our pipeline. At the recent ASCO and EHA meetings, data were presented from the GLOW and CAPTIVATE studies evaluating a Fixed Duration Imbruvica and Venclexta regimen in CLL patients. Results from these two studies demonstrated that the all oral Fixed Duration Imbruvica plus Venclexta regimen has the potential to provide deeper and more durable remission and extends progression free survival as a frontline treatment across the spectrum for the age and fitness status for CLL patients. We plan to submit these data to regulatory agencies and look forward to bringing this new Fixed Duration treatment option to CLL patients once approved. Earlier this month, we received a breakthrough therapy designation for Venclexta in combination with azacitidine for previously untreated higher risk MDS patients, based on the strong data demonstrated thus far in our ongoing Phase 1b study. We expect to see final results from this study in the coming months and plan to discuss the data with regulators regarding the potential to support an accelerated approval for Venclexta in MDS. Also in the quarter, we saw interim results from a Phase 1 study evaluating the BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody TNB-383B in multiple myeloma patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy. 383 performed very well as a monotherapy in these heavily pretreated patients, demonstrating an objective response rate of nearly 80% and a very good partial response or better rate of 63% and a complete response rate of nearly 30% at doses greater than 40 milligrams in the dose escalation cohort. Based on these promising results, we exercise our right to acquire TNB-383B from Teneobio. We expected the transaction to close in the coming months, and we’ll provide more information on our development plan for 383 in multiple myeloma later this year. This is a highly competitive area. But based on the data to-date, we believe this BCMA CD3 bispecific has the potential to be differentiated on efficacy, safety and dosing interval and could be best in class as both a monotherapy and combination therapy across lines of treatment in multiple myeloma. We continue to make good progress with navitoclax program in myelofibrosis, which consists of randomized Phase 3 trials in both the frontline and relapsed refractory setting, as well as a single arm Phase 2 study. Based on feedback from the FDA, we intend to submit our regulatory application with randomized Phase 3 data together with the Phase 2 trial results. We expect the Phase 3 data readout and regulatory submissions in the second half of 2022 with navitoclax approval in myelofibrosis anticipated in 2023. In neuroscience, we recently completed the Phase 2 proof of concept studies for two assets, elezanumab in multiple sclerosis and ABB-8E12 in Alzheimer’s disease. In the respective studies either assay meet the efficacy endpoints of the trial. And we will be discontinuing the development of elezanumab and MS and 8E12 in Alzheimer's disease. Given the enormous unmet need in Alzheimer's disease, we remain committed to finding disease modifying therapies. And we continue to pursue a range of approaches. We have several additional programs that are either in the clinic today or are in preclinical development. These include programs that modulate the neuroinflammatory response in Alzheimer's disease, such as our TREM2 and CD33 programs that are both in clinical development and programs that target pathologic tau through novel mechanisms, such as approaches that target intracellular aggregates for clearance that are in preclinical development. Following the accelerated approval of aducanumab in the U.S., there has been an increased focus on a-Beta directed programs. We have monitored this area closely over the last several years. And based on all of the available data, we believe there is a continued opportunity for an a-Beta directed monoclonal antibody that clears plaque more rapidly than existing agents with a reduced risk of amyloid related imaging abnormalities or area. We have profile the number of a-Beta antibodies preclinically. And we have a candidate with the potential to meet these requirements. We expect to introduce this candidate into the clinic by the end of this year or early next year. Also in neuroscience, we're nearing completion of our registrational program for a ABBV-951 in advanced Parkinson's disease. We recently completed an interim analysis in the first of two Phase 3 studies where our subcutaneous Levodopa Carbidopa delivery system demonstrated safety and efficacy, comparable to DUOPA after six months of treatment. The primary objective of this trial was safety, but efficacy was also evaluated as secondary endpoints. In this analysis, 951 performed very well, demonstrating a 52% reduction in normalized off time, and a 41% increase in normalized on time without troublesome dyskinesia. Patients also benefited from 915s 24 hour continuous Levodopa Carbidopa infusion, with patients experiencing substantial benefits in sleep and reduction in mourning off time. Full data from this six month interim analysis will be presented at a medical meeting later this year. Data from a second Phase 3 study are expected in the fourth quarter with our regulatory submissions anticipated later this year, or early next year. And lastly, in eyecare at the recent meeting for the American Society for cataract and refractive surgery, we presented results from the Phase 3 Gemini 1 study evaluating our topical eye drop AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. In this study, 584 demonstrated improved near vision without impacting distance vision, with a rapid onset of action within 15 minutes, and sustained vision improvements for up to six hours. 584 has the potential to be convenient, on demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia, and we look forward to an approval decision later this year. So, in summary, we've made great progress with our pipeline in the first half of this year. And we look forward to several additional data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance and financial outlook.

Starting with second quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.11 up 32.9% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were nearly $14 billion 19.3% on a comparable operational basis, excluding a 1.6% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.7% of sales, an improvement of 260 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 82.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $606 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.6%. As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.52 and $12.62, reflecting growth of 19% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $6.48 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of 10.7% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange have 0.9% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This implies a full year revenue forecast of approximately $56.3 billion. Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect aesthetics global revenue of approximately $4.9 billion, including approximately $2 billion from Botox Cosmetic, and approximately $1.4 billion from Juvederm. We now expect Restasis sales of approximately $1.1 billion and assume no generic competition in 2021. For Ubrelvy, we now expect sales of approximately $500 million. For women's health, we now expect global revenue of approximately $900 million. And for Mavyret, we now expect global sales of approximately $1.9 billion. Looking at the P&L for 2021, we are now forecasting adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.7 billion and adjusted SGA expense of approximately $11.9 billion. All other full year assumptions remain unchanged. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate net revenue of approximately $14.3 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have 0.5% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.18 and $3.22, excluding approximately $1.64 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, we continue to make great progress on our Allergan transaction commitments. We are exceeding our revenue expectations in several areas, including Botox, Vraylar, Ubrelvy and eyecare. We've also delivered expense synergies of almost $800 million during the first half of this year, and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. And we have already paid down $12 billion of combined company debt. We expect to achieve $17 billion of cumulative debt paid down by the end of this year, with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4 times by the end of 2021. And approximately two times by the end of 2022. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding performance. And we are very pleased with the strong momentum of the business heading into the second half of the year.

So one, Rick, you mentioned some of the Allergan products, maybe doing better than your expectation. Can you maybe, I mean, I know you don’t want to share your secret sauce. But in terms of what is it that you've noticed that has helped to drive those products? Because it seems like it's pretty much across the Board, from an aesthetic to Vraylar, Ubrelvy. So, is it around promotion efforts? Is it around some payor dynamics? Or anything you could share would be helpful there? And then the second one on Imbruvica. I just want to confirm, I think you guys said that the new patient share across all indications now is 42%. So, I just want to see you guys are in line with what you expect at this point. Obviously, there's been questions around some like competitors that have entered the market. And maybe you can just talk about the patients who are not studying on Imbruvica. So, what are you seeing as the reasons why they might be choosing a competitor?

I'll cover certain part of the first question, and maybe I'll ask Jeff to jump in and cover any additional thoughts that he might have. I think as you look at this business, one of the things that I think AbbVie is sort of known for is that, we tend to operate in a very focused and disciplined way, especially across what we consider to be growth franchises. We expect every one of our major businesses to develop plans, to be able to maximize the value of their assets, both from a strategic long-term basis, but also from a short-term tactical basis. And I'll use aesthetics as the example. Early on, we made the decision that we were going to fully integrate the aesthetics business to make sure that it had the focus and attention there it needed because we believe this business had a significant opportunity to be able to grow. We did that globally. So, if you look at Allergan in the past internationally, those people representing those products also had to represent eyecare and other therapeutic products. So, we moved those out into the therapeutic areas of AbbVie internationally and solely dedicated the aesthetics group internationally to just their products. And then in the U.S., we operate with a similar structure and a fully integrated R&D organization is totally committed to just developing aesthetics products and reports directly to Mike and then the Head of the Business for aesthetics reports directly to me. And we had them develop a plan that they are now executing against to be able to deliver against that. So, I think it's really three aspects of it from my perspective. It's one the structure we put in place. And that was a thoughtful, planned out structure. Two, it's the discipline processes that we use to be able to execute across all of our businesses. And then third, I'd say we have consistently invested and we do invest in businesses that we think have the opportunity to be able to drive long-term growth and performance in a way that we can drive that at maximum speed. And certainly, as you look at aesthetics, we've increased the investment in SG&A and we've increased the investment in R&D.

So, as we looked at the - particularly the neuroscience compounds, Vraylar and Ubrelvy, we were able to structure the sales forces a little differently, which was important from commercial execution and also really upgrade and drive some of the investment around patient activation. So, I think that all of these brands are spectacular brands leadership position. And when we got that investment profile right, we've seen the response, so nothing that beyond that. Going back to your question on the hematology share, the 42% that I referred to was the combined AbbVie shares. So that's Imbruvica plus Venclexta across all lines of CLL. So, if you take a look - if I give you a little bit more color on the latest data that we have, for example, in frontline, we have 35% total AbbVie share, which is made up around 24% for Imbruvica and 11% for Venclexta. For second line share, for example, we have a 48% total AbbVie position, which is approximately 33% for Imbruvica and 15% for Venclexta. So, both of these brands are now operating at a very significant share level across CLL. I'll give you some more thoughts as you ask for in terms of color in the market. Beyond that leadership level that we have across the CLL indication, we do see that the CLL market is still suppressed. So, for example, patient starts year-to-date are down in the high single digits. And even within the quarter, they were down in the low single digits. We see that improving. And so that outlook looks to improve over the second part of the year. In terms of overall share dynamics, over the last several quarters, we have lost a few share points to Calquence, within the range of our expectations as they've ramped with their CLL ramp. But also interesting, we've seen that there's been some share increases in monotherapy CD20, which we think is also a COVID type of effect that will ultimately revert back to normality as we go along through the pandemic. So overall, the franchise is performing very, very well. And as you heard from Mike, we're tremendously excited about the future of the hem/onc franchises as we move forward.",391.0,167.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.04790419161676647,0.011976047904191617,0.005988023952095809,0.0,0.0,0.03592814371257485

Just one more thing we should mention is, we've been able to really leverage our international infrastructure. And so, we set up this business. We have the aesthetics franchise, focus fully internationally on that business whereas Allergan had combined with therapeutics. So, we've been able to bring that focus and the level of investment. I think we've also been able to leverage our market access prowess. So, we’re very strong across the globe.

Can you just put some of this data into context as you think about the competitive landscape, and particularly relative to what you had anticipated in your long-term guidance for this indication?

I'll take the aesthetics question and then Mike can maybe cover the second question that you had. So, it's a great question. And it's one that we have been looking at very carefully. I mean, if you just step back and you look at the performance of the business, we've done a number of things to drive the business. We believe this business is significantly underpenetrated when you look at the available patient population here and your ability to drive long-term penetration is tremendous. And so, that's why we've done the things that we've done to try to drive that demand. Globally, the aesthetic sales were up 31%. If we look at the U.S. toxin and filler business, the markets up about 40% versus 2019. So, but it's hard to evaluate, I can tell you the vast majority of it is driven by fundamental demand. And we can see that through the funnel that we see patients coming in and how many of them are activated to go get procedures. But we just conducted a fairly robust market research study to try to understand how much of it was COVID related. And we looked at things like how many of those patients got stimulus checks, how many of them were affected from an employment standpoint, and are now back at work? I'd say that study, if you looked at the data in that study, the conclusion that you withdraw from that is very little of it is COVID related. Now, I think the flaw is this, most patients are not going to say they use stimulus money for these kinds of procedures or other kinds of things. So, I think to the best of our ability, what I would tell you is about two thirds of the performance, I think, is fundamental demand, and maybe one-third of it is pent up demand. We're going to need a couple more quarters, I think to see how that plays out. But I'd say that's our best assessment right now. So, very robust growth either way, and it could sustain a little bit better than that. But I think, you can pretty well count on two thirds of it being fundamental demand at sustainable longer term.

What I would say is the data that we've seen from RINVOQ UC has exceeded our expectations from an episode perspective, and the results they are very strong. UC has been very difficult to treat pharmacologically and getting high rates of permission. And this response has been challenging and both has delivered those now account just across number of studies. And I think from a safety perspective, it's also performed very well. I commented in my remarks, fact that overall rates of these serious AEs are actually lower with RINVOQ [ph]. Now the reason for that is that many of these AEs are driven by self and with the improvement in the ease to use UC then improve as well. And with respect to events of interest, the safety profile has worked very, very well with their segment A, segment B and other events rates have been comparable to controls. And so overall, we feel very confident in the long term guidance that we put out. But one thing that's important to keep in mind is that long term guidance is 2025 guidance.

You've mentioned the efficacy rates. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the skin safety profile as compared to the neogen product or the apomorphine IV from Europe, especially when it comes to the some more severe effects like Abscess and Okta? The second question is staying with a pipeline is a little bit of budget a-Beta. Didn't take long for you guys to walk into that. I was kind of wondering if you can talk a little bit about the science that you're discovering, is the right approach to get to the best effect with minimal side effects to try to remove as much flak as possible in a very targeted manner? Or should the approach be to go after soluble [indiscernible] and approach to removal of plaque indirectly?",152.0,68.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.04411764705882353,0.014705882352941176,0.0,0.0,-0.014705882352941176

With respect to 951 we’ll publish full data from the Phase 3 study that I described at a medical meeting and then ultimately, in peer reviewed journals as well. But what I can say is the skin safety has looked good to our eye and is within our expectations well within our expectations. As one would expect with a cutaneous device, there are some local reactions, but those have generally been mild and resolved with continuing treatment. We've not seen significant issues with more severe types of skin about the safety profile, and we think the patient friendly aspects of subcutaneous delivery that has some parallels to an insulin pump like device will be a real advantage here because it allows patients to get that to open like efficacy that's transformative without the need for placement of a gastric tube that's unthreaded in the small bowel and very, very difficult to manage. And so, we feel very good about the potential for 951. With respect to a-Beta, I think if one looks at all of the data, it's quite clear that if you can remove plaque rapidly, then there will be a benefit, and the key parameter that we would need to see is deep reductions in level of plaque and rapid reductions in the level of plaque, because you won't start to see a cognitive benefit, we believe until you get to that amyloid negativity level bypass, which is 20 centroids, until you reduce patients to that level. So, the goal would be to get them there as rapidly as possible. And to do that, while minimizing the impact of area. And we think that that can be done through epitopes selection. There are slight differences in the amyloid forms that are present in vessel wall compared to plaque. And with appropriate epitopes selection, we believe that our preclinical data would support that you can do that with reduced risk of area. And of course, we now need to see whether the clinical data supports that as well. But those are the basic principles that we're following. We've obviously had these candidates before the aducanumab approval, because as I said, we've been monitoring this area quite closely. But we think this is a good time to advance those candidates and to determine whether the science I described plays out in the clinic. But our approaches with respect to a-Beta are based on plaque, not soluble forms of [Indiscernible].",428.0,189.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.026455026455026454,0.015873015873015872,0.021164021164021163,0.0,0.0,0.010582010582010581

Firstly, on the outlook for rebaiting and oncology, this is somewhat of a novelty, at least historically. I know that yes, excluded Calquence from their formulary, there's obviously increased therapeutic competition in the space. How should we be thinking about the rebaiting outlook and oncology going forward more broadly? Second, on the U.S. paybacks through COVID and now in the recovery stage, could you outline the magnitude of which you've had to increase and then decrease the Medicaid components in the patient assistance programs? Or whether you're seeing that improvements, some sense of scale and direction there?

I mean, largely, as you know the rebaiting has been done through the sort of the GPO channel. And particularly with the physician in office dynamics that are in that sector, we don't see significant rebaiting happening at the PDM level. And if it is, it's quite modest. I think the certainly from the ESI standpoint that you highlighted, that was an ESI decision. That was not certainly something that AbbVie approach that particular payer with any sort of deal. Our philosophy is that these drugs are very important for oncologists to have basically open access for all of these agents. So, I think it is something that we've seen some of these lights that have started to turn on. But they've been quite modest. And I don't think that they're going to be a super accelerant that we should be overly worried about. That's my position on that. I think this the second approach in terms of sorry, that was the question on the magnitude of the Medicaid. Yeah, this has been quite interesting. We've seen, certainly on all of the data, the fact that the enrollment in Medicaid has gone up. When we look across our businesses at let's say, acute channel shifts in terms of the utilization, they're relatively modest. They're there, so we don't see massive movements around our channels shifting that link to the magnitude of what you might see in terms of the enrollments. So it's relatively modest, certainly manageable. And I think, certainly, as we see the jobs positioned come back and that could be quite strong, I think we'll see any modest movement will be corrected over the next several quarters.",302.0,127.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.007874015748031496,0.015748031496062992,0.015748031496062992,0.0,0.0,-0.007874015748031496

Going ahead I'd add to the second question is so we have a very extensive and I would say generous PAP program in place that's really designed to ensure that patients who can't afford our medicines, have the ability to be able to access those medicines free of charge in many cases. As an example, 99% of the applications we get for uninsured patients we approve we actually just increased the program to 600% of the federal poverty level across all of our brands. And so, it's a program that I think is designed to fulfill the mission that I just described. And that is that patients who need our medicines can get them from us if they can't afford to pay for them, or whatever system that they operate in. And but we have not seen and much to our surprise, we have not seen that program increased dramatically, even through COVID. And we advertise directly to patients that if they lost their job during COVID, that we would provide our medicines to them.

Rick, you've given the long term guidance of recall $7 billion in revenue by 2025. I think and by means correct me if I don't recall correctly. But if you only get the 15 milligram dose approved, if that's the outcome of the deliberations of the FDA, but you get the approvals in Europe, can you achieve that revenue guidance? You’re confident enough in the 15 milligram program? And then secondly, for Mike. You'll see us development program seems to have been sort of reactivated. And could you talk a little bit about your conviction, a little bit more detail on a 119? We don't know much about that.

And I would say we're confident that even with a 15 milligram, we will sustain that guidance. If you look at the performance of the 15 milligram is quite remarkable.

When we restructured the collaboration with Galapagos. A few years ago, to take direct operational control of that program, we had a couple of goals. One is we wanted to make sure that we're optimizing the potentiator in C1 components of the regimen. We felt we had a best in class, C1 in Q2. But we believed we needed to make a switch in the potentiator to one that we already had in hand. And we've done that. We also believe that we needed a C2 corrector. That’s in that time period a few years ago did not exist. So, we needed a C2 corrector that had the potential to be best in class. And so, what we did is we put a significant internal chemistry effort to come up with a number of compounds. 119 is the most advanced and a very promising one that we believe fit that bill. And based on all the preclinical profiling, we think 119 can be a best in class C2 corrector. And with the other components of or triple, we think we can deliver best in class efficacy with appropriate pharmacological properties, dosing, low DDIs, et cetera. And so, we are now in a proof-of-concept Phase 2 study in the clinic to determine whether those preclinical data will in fact spare out. What I would say here is the preclinical assays are good. They're much more predictive than they are in other areas because we fundamentally know what the defect is in CF, and we can study it in appropriate tissues in human tissues in vitro. But ultimately, we're going to need to see the clinical data. By right around the end of the year, we'll see internally proof of concept results for that triple. We'd probably be in a position to announce them externally early next year, and those will be data that will include impact on FET1 with a triple. And so that will tell us whether we can be best in class. And I agree if we are best in class, I think it's a very significant opportunity and we will progress it rapidly. Now, it's a proof-of-concept study. So, if it's successful, we'd have some additional dose ranging to do. We're studying the highest dose of 119, to determine whether it can have that effect we'd have to do some additional dose ranging to determine the optimal dose of 119, but that can be done rapidly. And then we would, if successful move into Phase 3 development.",440.0,179.0,13.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,0.07262569832402235,0.01675977653631285,0.027932960893854747,0.0,0.0,0.055865921787709494

So, with respect to JAK safety, we have indicated that we believe that an action is possible in the next few months. That's based on our discussions with the agency and what timing we think is reasonable. It's not a specific action date, like the PDUFA dates that had been set in the past. So, we will continue to monitor it as the process continues to move along. But the rate limiting factor, as we understand it is the agency's review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance data. And I think once that is completed, we will be able to move forward with Goodspeed with arm review. But there are no additional data from a safety perspective or no other substantial analysis that the agency is waiting on for us. We provided our updated benefit risk quite some time ago, as we announced publicly. And the agency has not requested any additional data. So, it's really that review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance is gaining as we understand it. With respect to an advisory panel, the agency always has the authority to call one if they desire to have one. But what I would say is, if they were planning on having an advisory committee. I would expect them to already be preparing for that and already have that process in motion.

As I mentioned, we're very, very pleased with Ubrelvy and really our overall migraine portfolio that we're rapidly developing here. To give you some sense, it's quite remarkable. I mean, if you look at the total acute oral CGRP category, so that's us and the competitor. It's about 18% of all new prescriptions, and it continues to grow very, very quickly. So again, it shows you how hard patients and physicians are. Are looking for the adoption of these particular agents, even though you have to step through a Triptan, some cases two Triptan. So, the market demand is very, very substantial. When we look to the overall performance, we can see that roughly the two agents are sort of splitting the acute indication. Some of the more weeklies are now being a little confounded by the new preventative episodic approval from Neurotech. But nonetheless, I think that's a small piece of the story. When we sort of peel out some of their new preventative scripts, we still have the leadership position for the acute market. But I really think the bigger picture is how fast that segment will expand over time? And we anticipate that will continue to lead that based on Ubrelvy’s overall profile. Our overall access dynamics are quite good. So, we really have roughly a 90% access. Again, some of that access demands a step through a Triptan. But overall, when you look at how fast that category is going, we don't really anticipate that there's major new plans that we need to achieve any sort of incremental access position. And so, basically our commercial strategy continues to be how hard can we drive this acute segment and lead that acute segment. And as I mentioned in my prepared remark, anticipating the arrival in the late third quarter for Atogepant, which has just a spectacular profile for episodic migraine.

It's well known that AbbVie rebates heavily on Humira in the U.S. So, when biosimilars launch, won’t you potentially have room to pull back on those rebates, which could mean, basically the meaningful offset to last Humira volumes. It seems like it could end up being in the billions of dollars that you could pull back in house. And I realized there's RINVOQ and SKYRIZI dynamic to consider. And related to that line of questioning how does the prospect of interchangeability biosimilars impact your thinking on this front? If interchangeable, generics are allowed or not allowed? How does that impact what you might do with those rebate dollars?

I would say let me start with interchangeability. We've outlined now over the last year or two, I think pretty specifically what we view the biosimilar impact in the U.S. to be and we are assuming that there will be two interchangeable biosimilars. And that's in the thought process of the erosion models that we have described many, many times now. So, we are assuming there will be interchangeability. We're certainly not in a position where we're going to talk about what we're going to do from the standpoint of rebates. We've always competed very effectively in these markets. Certainly, the focus for us going forward is the next generation assets, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. And you can see now, those two assets this year will do $4.6 billion. So, call it $5 billion. They're rapidly growing. And they're doing exactly what we had hoped they would do. They have higher levels of efficacy, and they're ramping dramatically. And they will buffer the impact of biosimilar impact in the U.S. And so, what I'd say is the strategy is going exactly the way we had hoped it would go.

But I'm wondering if this could all turn into be a positive. So, to what extent do you believe RINVOQ prescribing might be being held back by competitor product concerns? So, once those concerns are resolved and or RINVOQ emerges unscathed, if it does. RINVOQ could even do better.

And this question we fought a lot about, let me give you some perspective on RINVOQ. So, if you look at our, let's say, our demand performance, and I think I mentioned my prepared remarks, we've been very consistent about 15% in place share in the large RA market, which is just under Humira, which has grown a little bit over the COVID times and since January to about 18%. So, we're very, very stable. And I do believe that there is some overhang on certain segments of prescribers that have, let's say, going back a little bit to the TNF, really our own product, Humira. So, it's not outside of the realm of possibility as this resolves and really largely, as you probably heard, or seen Xeljanz has lost in play share over that period. So, I do believe there's a little overhang in certain, probably significant segments of Rheumatology. So, we are anxiously awaiting the resolution here of oral surveillance, which obviously has delayed our regulatory submissions. But it's not outside of the realm of possibility, given the very significant and differentiated data that we have in our packages, that we can see an acceleration as things resolve. But we're going to anxiously be monitoring. And certainly, be prepared to anticipate any outcome there.",229.0,94.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.031914893617021274,0.0425531914893617,0.07446808510638298,0.010638297872340425,0.0,-0.010638297872340425

Just kind of maybe if you, wonder if you can give a little bit more color on the driver of that have gone forward with that. Did you guys -- does your science sort of tell you that amyloid beta oligomers, for example, are not a driver of the disease or this is more of a decision that's driven by the regulatory precedents of approving targeting the a-Beta plaques.

With respect to the focus on plaque, I think when one looks at all of the data, you can conclude that if you can reduce plaque rapidly, from that point forward, you can see a benefit. So, in other words, getting the majority of patients to a level where they are amyloid negative by PET, so below 20 [ph] centoloids. And doing that rapidly is what's required to see a benefit emerge over time. And part of the importance of speed is that you're not going to see that benefit until you get to that level. So, if you spend the entire period of a trial, getting to that level, you don't then have an opportunity within that trial to see an improvement in cognition. And of course, for patients, if you don't get to that level fast enough, they're not going to drive benefit for a period of sometimes too many years. And they need really faster than that. So, that's our focus on plaque. With respect to different components and the role of oligomers. I think it's hard to tease that apart right now, what we know from the data is what I said that getting patients to amyloid negativity, but reducing plaque is what seems to drive a clinical benefit, whether there are upstream steps that one could try to impact to achieve the same result. I think it's an open question. And we're going where the science tells us to go today. With respect to IV or subcue, I think it's early to answer that question. It's going to relate to ultimately the delivered dose. And then dose forms that can be delivered. So, for example, there are on body injectors and other things that can deliver more than the traditional one or two and those of a solution containing a monoclonal antibody. So, there are approaches that could be IV or subcue, but I think it's a little bit early to make predictions on how that will all play out.",354.0,147.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,0.034013605442176874,0.0,0.006802721088435374,0.0

So you're right, we did give guidance to $1.7 billion early this year, assuming we would have a new indications approved. We said that would be a minor contribution, think of it in that couple of hundred-million-dollar range. But given the strong performance out of the RA indication, we've maintained that guidance, despite the fact that those approvals are delayed. There is some level of savings in terms of SG&A related to approvals being delayed. But at the same time, we're investing the business you'd look at, we're doing the aesthetics.

You've got to do peak sales for both products in the early 2030s. There's been a lot of focus on near term regulatory hurdles, particularly for RINVOQ. But there's also a lot that could happen competitively between now and then. So, with that said, what do you view is the biggest potential longer term competitive threats for both of those drugs, and particularly given the ongoing emergence and maturation of new drug modalities? And second, can you talk a little bit about the assumptions you've built into overall guidance relating to the Delta variant, and whether that's changed at all the way you think about the second half recovery?

And I would say as we look at RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, and the clinical data that has been generated is certainly achieving or exceeding the expectations that we had for those assets. I don't see anything on the horizon, that would make it in a timeframe that would have a material impact on those assets based on the guidance that we provided, or even longer-term guidance out to typically do a 10-year long range planning process. So yes, there are certainly many, many modalities that are available today across many of these therapeutic areas. It's having the right kind of asset, and the right kind of clinical performance. And then everything else that wraps around that market access and all the other things you have to be effective at in order to achieve the level of performance that these assets are achieving. And so, bottom line is, I think we feel very confident in our assumptions here. As it relates to the Delta variant. I think as we look at the guidance that we are providing in the second half, it certainly is reflective of what we assume -- we don't assume dramatic changes in the U.S. or other major markets around the world and where we are today. We're assuming major levels of recovery in certain markets, either that are currently in lockdown, like Australia as an example, or in many of the Asian markets outside of outside of China and Singapore.

With respect to RINVOQ and the regulatory environment in the prescriber perception prescriber environment, between Europe and the U.S., we do see differences. And the European authorities, and the European prescribing base seems to place less emphasis on these signals and view them more specifically to the molecules that generated the data then the EU have. Why that is? I can't give you a single reason other than these are both very large, competent jurisdictions that have come to their own impressions of the data. And those impressions have different somewhat. As you've said, for atopic derm we got the positive opinion from the CHMP for both the 15 and 30 milligram doses. We think the data are very supportive of that decision. And we look forward to launching that indication in Europe.

Now, as you know, waiting for reimbursement takes a little bit more time than the U.S. but as I highlighted, we have in play leadership and this is including the TNF to biosimilars in Germany, France, Canada, for example. So, it's quite strong. I think another point that I'd like to make, and we certainly see it in some of the early launch countries with PSA and AS. There appears to be a synergistic effect which makes some sense from a commercial standpoint. As countries like Germany start to introduce PSA and AS, the entire RINVOQ molecule starts to accelerate and move faster. And so again, given the last question I answered, we're actually anxiously awaiting the approval of those extra room indications there. So it's quite strong.

And what I would say is, we found that the studies were very well designed. We were comfortable with important considerations like patient selection, selection of sites that we believe would give quality data. We looked at the blinded aggregate characteristics of the population roles. You look at the baseline characteristics, and you don't know who's on active or placebo, but you can just see if you're enrolling the right patient population, and we believe we were. All of the measures are designed and seem to be behaving appropriately. And so, we feel good about the design characteristics of that study. And we did not feel that it was necessary to make any changes. But we did do that deep dive to be sure of that as I said, what we found was in fact reassuring. With respect to the market opportunity, I'll just make a couple of comments. And I'll hand it off to Jeff, for some more detail. But what I would say is, depression obviously is a substantial indication. And it's one that is very difficult to treat with existing agents. About 50% of patients don't achieve adequate control with monotherapy with frontline agents like SSRIs, or SNRIs. And so, there is an important opportunity for adjunctive therapy.

And then you have the prescriptions and really the different bipolar segments. And what I would say about not the big depression market, but the adjunctive MDD market that Mike spoke about. It's about the same size in terms of a prescription value to the bipolar segment.

I'll discuss our third quarter performance and outlook and then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie continues to perform very well. We once again delivered an outstanding quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.13. Total adjusted net revenues of more than $14.3 billion was up 10.8% on an operational basis, with balance growth across each of the major growth platforms. We continue to see double-digit revenue growth in immunology, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established very strong launch trajectories. These 2 assets are either approved, under regulatory review, or in late-stage development across all of Humira's major indications. And we remain confident that they will both be significant contributors to AbbVie 's long-term growth. Aesthetics is also demonstrating impressive double-digit operational sales growth. Our dedicated global aesthetics structure and increased investment are driving accelerated category growth across both toxins and fillers, where there is substantial room for additional market penetration. Our strategic investments and targeted field force expansions have improved overall our customer retention rates and significantly increased the number of first-time patients to our leading brands. We are once again raising our full-year guidance for aesthetics this quarter. And we view these portfolio as an extremely attractive growth opportunity over the long term with high single-digit compounded annual growth rates expected through the end of the decade. Our Neuroscience business drove robust double-digit revenue performance again this quarter. And we added a compelling new product to our migraine portfolio with the approval of Qulipta, a once-daily oral medication for the preventative treatment of episodic migraine. Our Hematological Oncology portfolio delivered operational sales growth of approximately 8% this quarter, despite a protracted market recovery in CLL, which remains below pre -COVID levels. Beyond the significant contributions of Imbruvica and Venclexta, we have an exciting oncology pipeline with several promising programs in development for blood cancers and solid tumors, to support sustainable long-term growth. These include Navitoclax for myelofibrosis, Epcoritamab for B-cell malignancies, ABBV383 for multiple myeloma, lemzoparlimab for AML and MDS, as well as Teliso -V for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer.  Lastly, we continue to make excellent progress with the integration of Allergan. Our financial results show that we have created a stronger and much more diverse Company with numerous products across our newly combined portfolio, delivering robust growth. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our momentum and we are once again raising our full-year 2021 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $12.63 to $12.67, reflecting growth of nearly 20% at the midpoint. Additionally, as noted in our news release, today, we are announcing an 8.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, from a $1.30 per share to a $1.41 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2022. Since our inception, we've grown our quarterly dividend by more than 250%. In summary, we're demonstrating strong execution across our portfolio. We've assembled an impressive set of diversified assets with significant growth potential giving us a high degree of confidence in the long-term outlook for our business.

We continue to demonstrate strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with Immunology, where we remain well-positioned for sustained leadership with a portfolio of best-in-class medicines. Total immunology revenues were approximately $6.7 billion, up 14.9% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were more than $5.4 billion up 5.2% on an operational basis, with 10.1% revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 16.7% on an operational basis. SKYRIZI is performing extremely well. Global sales of nearly $800 million were up 18.1% on a sequential basis, reflecting continued market share gains. In the U.S. SKYRIZI's leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients, is now roughly 36% more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor. SKYRIZI total prescription share in the U.S. psoriasis biologic market is now nearly 20%, second only to HUMIRA. Internationally, SKYRIZI continues to ramp nicely, having also achieved in-play patient share leadership in more than a dozen key markets. This compelling share performance will be further supported by 2 important near-term enhancements. The availability of more simple delivery forms for SKYRIZI, as well as the potential indication expansion in psoriatic arthritis. First, we recently launched the new and convenient SKYRIZI single-dose, 150 milligrams, self - injectable pen and syringe in major territories around the world. The market response has been very favorable, and the approval now makes SKYRIZI the only quarterly dosed brand that is available in a single self - injectable pen for patients. Second, we are preparing for the global launch of SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis, as we near approval decisions in both the U.S. and Europe. We received a CHMP positive opinion earlier this month, with anticipated approval in Europe by year-end. And we continue to expect FDA approval early next year. The addition of this indication, once approved, will round out Skyrizi's dermatology label, and give patients with PSA access to a new compelling therapeutic option. We're also making excellent progress with Skyrizi's development in Crohn's disease, which was recently submitted for U.S. regulatory review, with commercialization expected next year. Rinvoq also continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of more than $450 million were up nearly 20% on a sequential basis. Total in-play RA share remains strong and now reflects approximately 17% patient share in the U.S., as well as leadership in a half a dozen key countries around the world. Internationally, RINVOQ share continues to ramp in RA. And we're making excellent progress with the recent commercial launches of PSA, AS and atopic dermatitis, where we have secured strong labels for each of these indications.  As many of you are aware, the FDA issued a safety communication regarding new and updated warnings for JAK inhibitors, including RINVOQ in early September. While we do not yet have an updated label, we are closely monitoring prescription trends and feedback from the field. And we have not observed a significant impact to RINVOQ utilization at this time. That said, should the updated label restrict to use the TNF inadequate responders, we would certainly expect a near-term impact to new patient starts in RA. Based on the robust data we have generated across our development program against multiple biologics and later lines of RA therapy, we do expect that RINVOQ will ultimately attain higher share growth in the second line-plus setting, as most patients ultimately fail TNF therapies over time. Overall, we continue to feel very good about the performance and profile of RINVOQ and remain confident this asset will be a major contributor to AbbVie's long-term growth.  In Hematologic Oncology, global revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 8.1% on an operational basis. Imbruvica and Venclexta have a strong position across multiple heme -indications, including CLL, where AbbVie's combined portfolio remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. Global Imbruvica revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 0.3%. In the U.S., performance continues to be primarily impacted by a slower-than-expected market recovery in CLL, as well as some modest share erosion from newer therapies, including Venclexta and other BTK inhibitors. New patients starts in CLL remain below pre -COVID levels, and it is difficult to predict when this dynamic may fully recover. Venclexta sales were up 38.7% on an operational basis with increasing momentum across all indications, including a strong AML launch trajectory in the international markets.  In neuroscience, revenues were nearly $1.6 billion up 25% on an operational basis. I'm particularly pleased with the results and outlook for our emerging migraine portfolio, where we are now the only Company to have a portfolio of distinctive therapies to address the spectrum of this common complex and debilitating disease, including Botox Therapeutic, a unique foundational treatment for the prevention of chronic migraine, which is performing very well. Total sales of $645 million for all the Therapeutic Botox uses were up 22.5% on an operational basis. Ubrelvy, our leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine is also demonstrating rapid growth. Total sales of a $162 million were up nearly 30% on a sequential basis. Based on Ubrelvy's competitive profile, continued strong new patients starts, and a rapidly expanding market, we remain confident that Ubrelvy represents a $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity. And now we're just launching Qulipta, the only oral CGRP specifically developed for the preventative treatment of migraine, which is already off to an excellent start. Early feedback from our physicians has been very positive given QULIPTA 's strong efficacy, safety, and convenient dosing profile relative to the current standards of care. The QULIPTA launch is being supported by our existing migraine sales force with commercial access expected to ramp strongly through the first half of 2022. QULIPTA also represents a $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity.  Now we believe having 3 distinct and competitively positioned therapies across the spectrum of migraine conditions with Botox Therapeutic, UBRELVY and QULIPTA, which each have been optimized for a specific migraine indication, enables physicians to tailor treatment for the broadest range of patients. Our portfolio of migraine therapy puts us in a very strong position to capture growth in this dynamic market. Turning to psychiatry, we also see robust performance with Vraylar, which remains the fastest-growing atypical anti-psychotic. Total revenues of $461 million were up 29% on an operational basis, with continued strong demand across schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar depression. Lastly, in our other key therapeutic areas, we saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $871 million up 2.9% on an operational basis. Mavyret sales were $426 million up 2.9% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes still remain suppressed compared to pre -COVID levels. And we saw double-digit growth operationally for both Creon and Lupron. So overall, I'm pleased with our continued execution across the Therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs.

ABBV,2021-10-29,2021-10-29,,2021-10-29,2021-10-29T09:00:00-04:00,0,2021-10-29,prepared,,Michael Severino,"Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with immunology, where we had several regulatory updates and data readouts for both Rinvoq and Skyrizi across therapeutic areas. Following successful completion of the registrational programs for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, and Skyrizi in Crohn's disease, we submitted our regulatory applications for each asset in their respected indications. We saw a very strong data for both Rinvoq and Skyrizi as induction and maintenance treatments in UC and Crohn's respectively. And based on these results, we believe both drugs have the potential to become a highly effective, differentiated therapies in these indications. We anticipate approval decisions for both in 2022. Earlier this month, we announced positive top line results from our Phase 3 SELECT-AXIS 2 program for Rinvoq in axial SpA, which included data from 2 standalone studies. One for ankylosing spondylitis patients who had an inadequate response to biologics. And another for patients with non-radiographic axial SpA. In the ankylosing spondylitis biorefractory study, RINVOQ performed very well, demonstrating significantly greater improvements in signs and symptoms, as well as physical function and imaging endpoints compared to placebo.  We saw levels of efficacy in this difficult to treat refractory population similar to those more typically observed in bio-naive patients. These results will be added to our submission package for RINVOQ in AS which is currently under review by the FDA. In a non - radiographic axial spot study, RINVOQ also performed very well, meeting the primary and key secondary endpoints. We plan to submit our regulatory applications in this indication later this quarter as well.  RINVOQ's safety profile in these actual spot trials was consistent with previous studies, and there was no evidence for increased risk of DVT, PE, MACE events, or malignancies in either study. Based on the data generated in the select access program, we believe RINVOQ has the potential to improve care for patients suffering from Axial SpondyloArthritis by providing sustained disease control and rapid and durable pain reduction as well as improving function. As you're likely aware, in September, the FDA communicated that they will require new warnings for JAK inhibitors, including RINVOQ and their use will be limited to certain patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate anti - TNFs. We continue to work with the FDA regarding updated labeling language for the RA indication, while simultaneously engaging with the agency on our files for atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. We remain confident in our submission packages for these 3 new indications and continue to expect approvals following completion of the RA label update.  In the area of oncology, we continue to make good progress advancing all stages of our pipeline. We're nearing completion of several indication expansion programs for VENCLEXTA. In our study in previously untreated higher-risk MDS patients, which recently received a breakthrough therapy designation, we expect to make a data cut early next year to include 6-month follow-up data for duration of response. Based on this data cut, we plan to submit our regulatory applications to the FDA in the first half of 2022, for an accelerated approval. We continue to make good progress with Venclexta in the Canova trial, which is evaluating Venclexta in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation. VENCLEXTA has shown strong anti - myeloma activity in this biomarker-defined population and if successful, has an opportunity to play an important role in the treatment paradigm for multiple myeloma. We expect a data readout from this event-driven trial next year. In our early to mid-stage hem/onc pipeline, we continue to expand the cohorts in the aducanumab Phase 1 2 studies in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.  And we're evaluating aducanumab as both a monotherapy and in combinations. We expect to see data from both the monotherapy and combo studies next year. And we will discuss the monotherapy data with regulators regarding a file for accelerated approval. We also recently began the dose escalation stage of the Phase 1b studies for [Indiscernible] in AML, MDS and multiple myeloma. And ABBV -383, our BCMA-CD3 bispecific antibody, is currently in the expansion stage of its Phase 1 study in multiple myeloma patients. And we expect to begin registrational phase 3 studies next year. Moving to Neuroscience, where we had several notable pipeline events since our last earnings call. In September, we received FDA approval for Qulipta, the only oral CGRP specifically designed as a preventative treatment for migraine. We're very pleased with the label, which reflects Qulipta a strong benefit risk profile, and is supported by a robust clinical development program. In our registrational program, which evaluated Qulipta in nearly 2,000 patients suffering from episodic migraine, treatment with Qulipta resulted in a significant reduction in mean monthly migraine days compared to placebo. And approximately 60% of patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in the migraine days. We think these data compare favorably to other preventative migraine treatments on the market, and believe our new oral treatment option will be competitively positioned in the prevention market. Our migraine portfolio now includes Ubrelvy for acute treatment of migraine, Qulipta for preventative treatment of episodic migraine, and Botox for preventative treatment of chronic migraine. With this distinct portfolio, AbbVie is uniquely positioned to address the full spectrum of this complex and debilitating disease. This morning, we announced top-line results from two Phase 3 studies evaluating Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. In the 301 study, a 1.5 milligram a day Vraylar dose met the primary endpoint demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in total MADRS score compared to placebo at Week 6 with a highly statistically significant p-value of 0.005. In this study, the 3 milligram Vraylar dose did not reach statistical significance, but it did show a clear trend toward improvement with a nominal p-value of approximately 0.073 at Week 6. In the second phase 3 trial, the 302 study, neither Vraylar doses met the primary endpoint of change in total MADRS score at week 6. But both the 1.5 and 3 milligram doses demonstrated clear trends toward a clinically meaningful benefit at weeks 2 and 4, with nominal P values less than 0.05 for a number of comparisons. Additionally, as a reminder, we had 1 prior positive registrational Phase 2B study where Vraylar demonstrated efficacy in MDD when added to ongoing antidepressant treatment. Based on precedent in the field and the totality of the data, we believe we have a viable regulatory pathway for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. We plan to engage with regulatory agencies to discuss these results and expect to spend our regulatory application to the FDA in the first half of next year. We also recently announced positive top-line results from a phase 3 study comparing our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system, ABBV -951 to oral levodopa/carbidopa in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. In this pivotal study, treatment with 951 resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in on time without troublesome dyskinesia, as well as similar improvements in normalized off time compared to oral Levodopa or Carbidopa. We're very pleased with these results, which we believe support our view that 951 has the potential to become a transformative improvement to current treatment options for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We plan to submit our regulatory application next year with approval decisions anticipated in the U.S. and Europe in early 2023. And in Eye Care, we announced the partnership with REGENXBIO to develop and commercialize RGX -314, a potential gene therapy for the treatment of wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and other chronic retinal diseases. RGX-314 is a very attractive addition to our pipeline, and complements our Eye Care portfolio with a potential flagship product in retinal disease. REGENXBIO recently presented initial data from 2 Phase 2 studies evaluating RGX -314 in wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy, using in-office suprachoroidal delivering. While early, these results are encouraging, with RGX -314 demonstrating efficacy at the lowest dose. And the study showing that the drug and delivery method both appear to be well tolerated. Also, in eye care, we continue to expect approval for [Viewty] (ph) shortly, formerly known as AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with Presbyopia. This once-daily eye-drop was developed to help address presbyopia that is often corrected through reading glasses. And once approved via convenient on-demand solution for patients with mild-to-moderate presbyopia who may not want to wear reading glasses. This has been a very productive year thus far for our R&D organization, and we anticipate several additional milestones in the coming months. We expect this momentum to continue into next year, which is looking to be a milestone filled year for AbbVie as well.

As you have heard from Rick, Jeff, and Mike, we once again delivered outstanding performance this quarter, while also advancing our strategic priorities. Our results demonstrate the strong momentum of the business, and support AbbVie's long-term financial outlook. Turning to third quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.33 up 17.7% compared to prior year, and $0.13 above our guidance midpoint. This includes $0.05 from accelerated synergies, and $0.03 from mark-to-market equity gains. Total adjusted net revenues were $14.3 billion, up 10.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.5% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51.1% of sales, an improvement of 230 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.4% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 20.6% of sales. Net interest expense was $585 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.6% as Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.63 and $12.67 reflecting growth of 19.8% at the midpoint.  Excluded from this guidance is $6.34 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance continues to contemplate full-year revenue growth of 10.7% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange at a 0.7% favorable impact on full-year comparable sales growth. This implies a full-year revenue forecast of approximately $56.2 billion. Included in this guidance are the following updated full-year assumptions. We now expect Aesthetics global revenue of approximately $5.1 billion. We now expect international HUMIRA sales of approximately $3.3 billion. For IMBRUVICA, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.5 billion, reflecting slower recovery of the CLL market. For Mavyret, we now expect global sales of approximately $1.7 billion. And we now expect Allergan expense synergies of approximately $1.8 billion. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $15 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.24 and $3.28, excluding approximately $1.14 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated $17 billion of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year, and our cash balance at the end of September was $12 billion Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today we announce an 8.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2022. And we remain on track to achieve $17 billion of cumulative debt paydown by the end of this year, with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.3 times by the end of 2021, and approximately 2 times by the end of 2022. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong.

Rick, I guess I'll jump in with the big one that I think is still the overhang for the stock, which is the RINVOQ outlook. You have $15 billion out there for 2025 in combined SKYRIZI, RINVOQ forecast guidance. And I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of the puts and takes. SKYRIZI doing really well but some overhangs for RINVOQ. Is that $15 billion still achievable, do you think you're trending above that, or do you have to make up a shortfall.

What I'd say is the following: If I look at SKYRIZI, I would say that SKYRIZI performance is very, very impressive. Jeff outlined what the in-play share is and what the total TRxs are and it's very close to the passing HUMIRA now, which in this short period of time is frankly a surprise, how quickly it has ramped. I think that's a very positive case. If I look at RINVOQ, actually the in-place share looks very good. Now, we would expect if the label gets changed and restricts the label to behind TNFs, that that will have some impact on the front line patients -- the naïve patients that we're capturing now. And so we will see that impact. Having said that, I would say that when I look at RINVOQ's performance overall and how durable it's been throughout this situation, we'll obviously shift more towards second line patients and beyond, which was originally in the plan, but the emphasis would have occurred a year or 2 later than this, where we would have driven that. We have very good data to be able to support that.  The other thing I'd say is if you look at the indications that we have coming out for these two assets, we have AD, which is a very significant opportunity for us. We have PSA and is a very significant opportunity. But next year we have the IVD indications that are coming out. And I'd say there, when we gave the $15 billion forecast, the performance that was in our TPP or our target product profile that we had assumed, we have outperformed that in the clinical trials that we've submitted. And so I think that's a very significant opportunity for us, and a significant opportunity for us to outperform. Having said all of that, we don't want to reconfirm the guidance yet. We want to see what the final label looks like from the agency. And then we'll be in a position, I think, to come out and tell the investor community exactly what we think. The only other thing I'd say is, I think if you go back 5, 6 years ago, what we're trying to accomplish with the Company, we were basically trying to accomplish with the Company, build a set of assets that could ultimately significantly replace HUMIRA in the marketplace and be superior to HUMIRA. These 2 assets already are at $5 billion and growing very rapidly. So I think everything I know about these 2 assets, they'll be able to do exactly what we expect of them. Even in the most negative outcome from a label standpoint that we would expect. Second thing is we built a significant heme/onc portfolio, that when I look at the pipeline behind IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA I think there's a significant opportunity to drive significant growth in that portfolio. And then with the Allergan acquisition, I couldn't be more pleased. Aesthetics franchise is performing at an outstanding level, the neuroscience franchise is performing an outstanding level. I think migraine is a very significant opportunity for us to be able to drive, and eye care is another one. And so we now have multiple assets, and multiple portfolios to be able to drive the growth. And our goal is still what we described to the analysts early on, we expect to see the impact of the LOE on Humira in '23, and immediately be able to grow beyond that starting in '24, return to growth, sales growth at that point. And regardless of what happens with RINVOQ'S label, I have a high-level of confidence we can continue to do that.

As you know, we're in litigation with Alvotech. I think it's important to understand the nuances behind that litigation. In this first set of litigation, this first wave of litigation, we are basically applying 10 patents in HUMIRA. And as you know, we have a very robust patent portfolio around HUMIRA, but these 10 patents are both formulation patents and indication patents. Many of these patents were challenged through the IPR process and upheld by the patent office. I'll give you some idea of the strength of these patents. The first thing I'd say to you is, we have a high level of confidence that we will prevail in this litigation. There will be a second wave of litigation that occurs after that, which will bring into the portfolio the rest of the patents that we think Alvotech infringes. So there could be another phase of litigation that occurs after this one, but I can tell you we're highly confident that we will prevail in this first set of litigation based on the strength of those patents. To specifically answer your question, if they were to prevail, which I don't believe they will, then it would accelerate the other patent settlements.

I guess do you see a scenario where you are unable to get the drug approved in these pending indications particularly AD over the next few months, or is your review based on all the interactions, etc. that this is largely, I guess, a label and maybe a line of therapy discussion and decision with the agency? And my second question was on Botox aesthetics, a very healthy growth we're seeing here, we're now coming up against even some more normalized comps and you're still seeing the growth rate very, very healthy. Just -- are we still seeing catch-up usage in this, or is this just really underlying demand at this point. And just a little bit more color about just how you're thinking about the near-term growth trajectory.

So psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. We remain very confident in those files, and we remain very confident in approval decisions. The gating factor here is really getting to the specifics of the language around RA, which is a process that is well underway. And we would expect to be in a position to gain approvals after that is completed. And again, we hope that's completed in the near future, certainly this year. The psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis filings, we would expect to follow fairly closely on the heels of that RA decision for ankylosing spondylitis.

On Botox, I think one of the things when we first went through the integration process that was compelling to us was the amount of penetration in these markets and Allergan's ability to be able to reach out and touch consumers and activate those consumers. And that's part of what drove our decision globally to go with this fully integrated, totally dedicated Aesthetics organization.  Because in many other markets around the world, although the data is not quite as good as it is here in the U.S., but in China as an example you see is very similar kinds of dynamics. And so focusing that team purely on Aesthetics was part of the effort here to be able to drive accelerated growth. The second was, when we looked at the ability to be able to use various methods to be able to activate consumers. We believe that the business was being underfunded in a way, both in the way it was being funded and the total amount that was being funded. And so we did some early work to determine whether or not that funding could drive incremental market growth, and it showed a positive result. And then when we saw that, we applied significantly greater funding to it. And what you're actually seeing now, I think, is we are driving the market. We're bringing more patients into the category, and obviously because we have the leadership position from a market share standpoint, we get the vast majority of those patients. Is there still some pent-up demand? I would tell you it's hard to believe at this point that there can be a lot of it, but there has to be some of it. Remember those practices reopened in the U.S. in the summer of 2020. That's a long time to have pent-up demand, but it's impossible to tell one way or another. I would say the majority of it is certainly being driven by us activating patients and retaining more patients. One of the other things we saw was the retention rate was relatively low once you activated a patient. And so we spent some time working with the team to figure out how could you retain those patients at a higher rate, meaning they repeat their procedures. They don't just do it once and then disappear, but they come back for a second procedure or plus going to fillers as an example. So the data is very clear. If you look at the U.S. as an example, toxins and fillers are growing high 30% of the market. We're growing at about the same rate, maybe a little bit lower on fillers but about that rate on toxins. When we look at globally, the overall brands are growing at about that rate. And so, I think this is a business that is sustainable over the long term. When we say across the decade high single-digits, obviously, if we keep this growth rates. The business is getting bigger and bigger. So therefore, the percentage will come down a bit. But I'd tell you, I'm very optimistic about this market, and our ability to be able to bring new assets into this market. They can change the standard of care going forward and us being able to drive market growth at the same time.

I wanted to ask a question on HUMIRA in 2023, I'm just really trying to nail down what's in that erosion guidance of 45% plus or minus 10. That's sales erosion, not volume, correct? I'm trying to think through what happens to the U.S. rebate stream in 2023, which is likely in the billions of dollars. Do you think you'll retain favorable formulae positioning even with biosimilars, in which case you keep paying that rebate, but you also would have less volume loss, or do you think it becomes disadvantage on formulary, in which case you pull back those billions of dollars in rebates, and that flows through the bottom-line.

I think the guidance we laid out of 45% or 48%, whichever is the latest number plus or -10%, is still guidance that we feel pretty comfortable with. To your point about, is the bulk of it priced? It is. Even if you look at the international market it's about 1/3, 2/3, or maybe slightly higher than that. I mean, 2/3 of its price, 1/3 of it is volume. And I would expect that we will maintain a significant part of the volume. Obviously, we don't talk publicly about what our manage care strategy is, but what I would tell you is we're close enough now to that 23 time-frame that you would expect us to be starting the work to ensure formulary access on all of our products, and certainly HUMIRA is one of those for 2023.

Will that matter to the FDA, maybe you could remind us what those who sit in the previous Phase 3. And now that you have the full dataset, how do you think Vraylar will stack up competitively at the NDD space?

I'll take the first part of your question, and then Jeff will take the second part of your of your question. With respect to Vraylar MDD, in the study that you described the 1.5 milligram dose medicine point and met it with a highly statistically significant P-value of 0.005, so 0005. And that's important in terms of strength of evidence overall and weight of evidence overall. And then as you point out, in the 3 milligram arm in that same study, we didn't hit significance, but we had a P-value that was very small.  The nominal P-value is 0.073, if we around. When you look at that overall study to RA clearly shows an effect in NDD. Now, the second Phase 3 study that we just read out did not reach statistical significance for either dose group, but there were favorable trends and across a number of comparisons, there were nominal p-values that were quite small and many of them were out lower than 0.05. And I'll just remind the listeners that it's very common in depression studies, even with classes of medicines that have firmly established efficacy to have some study that read out positive and some studies that are negative. And so we think that overall package that we announced today is very strong. And it's also important to keep in mind that we did have a prior study that was conducted several years ago that was also positive that demonstrated a statistically significant effect. And that study -- look at different dosing, there were dose ranges that were studied in that trial with titration.  It was the upper 2 of the dose ranges that was significant, but it did show both a clinically meaningful and significant benefit. So we have 2 positive studies and that's important because the way these studies are typically looked at is an overall weight of evidence, do you have a convincingly positive phase 3 study? And is there other evidence within the overall data package that is supportive and we feel comfortable that that is the case here.  And lastly, what I'd say is, if you look at the precedent, and you look at other approvals, findings like the ones that we described on not a long time, and, in fact, that's the very common amongst approved agents in this space, including some of the more recent approvals in adjunctive NDD like resulting. So overall we think it is a strong package that has a viable regulatory pathway. And we will stack up very nicely to competitors. So we're going to begin those regulatory discussions shortly. So without I'll turn it over to Jeff.",450.0,190.0,8.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.042105263157894736,0.015789473684210527,0.0,0.010526315789473684,0.0,0.02631578947368421

When we look at the market sizes, about 60 million total prescriptions for the adjunctive MDD market. And that's very similar to the bipolar market that we operate in now, so it's a very meaningful opportunity for us. If you think about the -- what Mike was saying in terms of the competitive profile, I think we have to remember that while it's got a fairly low share, the -- Vraylar is very attractive, which is why it's the fasting growing agent. So the efficacy is viewed very, very nicely overall, and I think that if approved, this also has competitive efficacy of very gentle metabolic profile, minimal weight gain, very tolerable, and also very simple dosing for the psychiatrists and the primary care doctors that look at this. So when you start to see the potential for an agent like Vraylar that's got the full spectrum across bipolar disease in terms of mania, mixed episodes and depression. And then the adjunctive depression indication, if approved, it will be very attractive.

And QULIPTA, its very early, we just introduced the product with our full commercial promotion. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have now as of this quarter, a dedicated migraine sales force which shows you how important we think that this franchise is and what we can do with this franchise. So we have an entire sales team out there that is launching QULIPTA and now also focused on UBRELVY. And the early feedback has been very strong. What we hear qualitatively from our field and certainly from our research in the first few weeks of launch is, first, the simplicity and strength of QULIPTA for prevention.  We see very, very nice response to our efficacy data, which is -- Mike has said before, and I've said before is on the very high end of preventative performance. So 60% of patients in our trials achieved greater than 50% reduction in migraine days, which is viewed as very significant. And almost 30% have a complete control. A 100% decrease in their migraine days. That's very compelling in terms of this Qulipta power. Also, physicians like the simple, everyday dosing, once a day.  And so things are quite strong in terms of our early qualitative feedback. So we do obviously anticipate that the majority of our prescriptions will be bridged prescriptions until are -- we get the full ramp of our market access, which as I mentioned, we're quite confident by the first half of the year, we should ramp similar to Ubrelvy, where ultimately, as you remember, we achieved about a 90% access in the U.S. So quite good early feedback on the launch, and again we think that the 3 assets together are unique competitive positioning for AbbVie.",295.0,124.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.06451612903225806,0.016129032258064516,0.016129032258064516,0.0,0.008064516129032258,0.04838709677419355

If I could just follow up on CGRP, I'm curious, obviously, you have a different strategy than your competitor when it comes to the prophylactic market. I'm just wondering how you think where your source of the patients are going to come from. Are you expecting more transitions from injectables or do you think they're going to be more de novo patients, and if you could just talk about that a little bit. And then secondly, on REGENXBIO, could you just talk about your confidence in the data there. Obviously there was some inflammation there though it did seem self-limiting. I'm just curious how you think about that impacting the profile, because obviously in other gene therapy products in the eye inflammation has sometimes proven to be pretty significant as a long-term sequelae.

So in terms of the source of business, we think that QULIPTA is going to source business from 2 primary areas. First is, the big headache specialists, the big neurologists. We think absolutely from our research and feedback that you'll start to see an early trade-off of the injectable MABS in favor of the orals and certainly in favor of QULIPTA. I think that this is viewed as very attractive. In many cases, some people have spontaneously highlighted wow it looks like a very strong MAB in a single oral pill. So that's a source of business in terms of market share trade-off. I think the other insight that we have from the market is that we are going to a -- calling on a substantial amount of high prescribing primary care physicians who don't write a lot of MABS, but they certainly write a lot of generic topiramate and some other older agents. And so we also see that we have a unique opportunity in a wider audience to source from physicians that really don't lean towards the MABS because of the injectable nature of those, etc. So we think we're going to have a good balance between those two sources of business and that's quite attractive for us right now.",226.0,102.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049019607843137254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049019607843137254

If we take a step back and look at the program overall, they have very strong efficacy data already demonstrated with sub-retinal delivery and that's in a lot of procedure. But it gives us clear proof-of-concept for the approach, and shows that we can get durable control. And that component of the program is already in Phase 3. And then the more recent data that were presented just about a month ago, several weeks ago, looked at suprachoroidal delivery. So that is a delivery method that can be done in-office. It's a specialized form of injection, but it is a form of injection. And that is also showing very good promise. We're already seeing signs of efficacy in the first cohort, which is the lowest dose cohort, which quite frankly is sooner than we expected to see them before that study had started to deliver results. And the tolerability is very good. If one looks at the inflammation that has reported in the [Indiscernible] trials, it's very different in its nature and its [Indiscernible] than that, that has been seen with other agents. It's principally anterior, chamber is exclusively anterior chamber, there's no vasculitis, no more significant inflammation.  It is readily treated with topical steroids, and generally resolves without any difficulty, and in fact, quite rapidly. And it's also important to remember that there's no prophylactic steroids being used here. Other approaches have required that. So these are patients who have no prophylaxis upfront in responding to what's often a brief course of topical steroids. And the reason why there's no prophylactic steroids, given as they're just not felt to be needed given the very mild nature of the inflammation that's being observed. So we're very confident with it. And again, we feel it's qualitatively very different than what has been seen in other agents. And we've obviously talked to retinal specialists as well who are quite familiar with the program, and the views we've heard from them are supportive of what I just described.",372.0,160.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0375,0.0125,0.0,0.0,0.00625,0.025

With respect to the tone of conversations with the FDA for RINVOQ, I would describe them as productive. With respect to your question specifically about the RA label, those discussions are productive as well. I would assume the base case is what they announced conceptually back in early September, but we are working through the specifics of how that translates into labeling language. And I would characterize the discussions around the other indications as being very productive and very positive as well. And so as I mentioned earlier in this call, we remain very confident in the files for those new indications for all three of them. With respect to Vraylar, head-to-head superiority studies are not typically done in this space. They are very challenging. It is challenging to show an impact even with established classes period in major depressive disorder and particularly in this space, because this is the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. So these are patients who aren't responding to the current therapies, and require an add-on and atypical antipsychotics with pharmacology similar to Vraylar, our one of the most commonly used agents in this space. So we think the very strong data that we have from the study that we described, and the fact that we have prior supportive evidence as well from the earlier study, will position it very well to be competitive in that marketplace.",252.0,109.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.027522935779816515,0.03669724770642202,0.009174311926605505,0.0,0.009174311926605505,-0.009174311926605505

Just to build on Mike's point, if you think about the size of Vraylar now approaching $1.8 billion it has a 2.5 share in terms of the anti-psychotic market. It's a low share, high-value in growth area. When you think about most of our business is already stepped through in some cases one or two of the generics. The problem is that these patients are so fragile, they just don't respond well.

And indications where we have data, but have not yet submitted like the IBD indications. And so we feel that it's going to be an important part of our portfolio, and the treatment armamentarium going forward. So having said that, immunology is always an area where we are scouring the landscape to look for the best opportunities.

I've got a clarification and then a couple of questions. First, Rick, you mentioned regarding Alphatec about the acceleration clauses. And I just want to clarify if this is on District Court decision or appeal, given the timing it actually makes quite a bit of difference. Then the two questions I have first are interchangeability for HUMIRA. Do you think this will matter in the marketplace? We are hearing different things from the large payers. What is your take here and what is going to be AbbVie's position about this? And the second question is, the last draft we've seen from this year regarding the infrastructure bill does not include a reduction of out-of-pocket costs in Medicare. We're still hearing from context, this still might be the case if it's still included. If you can comment on this issue, do you expect it to be included, and the impact it might have on AbbVie's business.",172.0,74.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.05405405405405406,0.04054054054054054,0.02702702702702703,0.0,-0.04054054054054054

On Alvotech, obviously these agreements that we have with the other biosimilar players are confidential, I'm not going to delve into some of the specifics around those. What I can tell you is what I said before. I mean, we are highly confident in our position with this IP. This IP has been challenged multiple times and we have a high degree of confidence that we will prevail.  So I think it's obviously a hypothetical scenario, but I don't -- I wouldn't give it a lot of merit. Second on interchangeable HUMIRA s as we've discussed previously, when we built the erosion model that we described a couple of years ago, or certainly a year-and-a-half or so ago, we did assume at that point that they were going to be 2 interchangeable biosimilars. It does matter from a pricing standpoint to some extent. So I think it will have an impact but it's consistent with what we had assumed. And so we've essentially taken that into consideration in the forecast that we provided you, and the estimates that we provided you. On drug pricing in the U.S., I would say it's a very fluid situation. It's a little difficult to truly understand exactly where we are. You are correct, if you look at this framework that came out yesterday [Indiscernible] talked about repeal of the rebate rule being eliminated. And it didn't talk about much else. Look, the things that we're focused on and things that we think would make a difference on our out-of-pocket costs for patients, and making them lower for Medicare patients, making them something that they can spread over a period of time -- a 12-month period of time to make the cash flow easier to deal with. And as we've said before, we think industry will play a role in that as one of the participants. And we would hope that we will get back to that, because I think -- we think that is the most fundamental issue is reducing the out-of-pocket costs for these patients.",363.0,143.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.013986013986013986,0.02097902097902098,0.013986013986013986,0.0,0.0,-0.006993006993006993

What I would say about RINVOQ is our assumptions around the labeling at a base case are based on what the agency announced in their safety communication in September. That principally updates to the black box warnings that all of these agents have in fact all agents in immunology have some degree of this. They treat similar conditions to RINVOQ, for example, the TNS have some of the same but not all of the same warnings. Updating that section label is part of our base case and then the restriction that the agency described for certain patients around TNF inadequate response forms our base case. And those are the two factors that we're considering. We would not anticipate any limit into ration of therapy, for example. And the question those principally applies to the atopic dermatitis file, because we have just a single dose in the other files, in the files that are in the rheumatology space. And we feel confident about both doses in terms of the benefit risk that we've demonstrated in that atopic dermatitis program. It's really those two dimensions and how those translate into specific language in RA. And then of course, how they translate to the other indications, because TNFs are not the standard of care in all indications, they are not used in atopic dermatitis. So then it's how do those concepts get translated into the label in other indications. Those are the principal dimensions that we're looking at when we think about those programs. And again, we feel very confident in the files that we've put forward, and feel very good about how discussions have gone to date. With respect to CF and what we're looking for, we're looking for something that has demonstrated benefit compared to what's already out there, what will be out there at the time our agents come to market. Obviously the principal competitor, the only group with a marketed product right now in this space is Vertex so that's what we would be benchmark ourselves against.  I would say at an absolute minimum, you'd have to have efficacy that was just as good with other meaningful advantages. But what we're striving for is something that has an efficacy advantage of a small number of absolute FEV1 points. A small number of absolute FEV1 points might not sound like much, but it can translate into real benefit for patients in this disease.",429.0,175.0,6.0,6.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.03428571428571429,0.03428571428571429,0.022857142857142857,0.0,0.011428571428571429,0.0

And then there's still a bit more work to be done for the new indications. And then looking on to the UC filing.

So with respect to the ongoing reviews, what I would say is the discussions around the RA label update, and the new indications that are under our review are going on simultaneously. And there is some level of interdependence. In other words, we need to understand where the RA label will land, because some of those elements, like the warnings and precautions, will translate over to the other indications because in the U.S. you get 1 label for the molecule that applies across all of the indications. So there's some interdependency, that's why getting the RA label update resolved is a gating factor. Whether it could happen on the same day or in close succession, I think it's too early to call with that fine level of detail, but we would expect the psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis filings to follow in a very reasonable time-frame after that label update. As I mentioned, we're adding new data to the ankylosing spondylitis submission, which is the smallest of the three indications. And so that one might be on a slightly different time-frame as the agency reviews those new data. With respect to the SEC filings, the RA label update is not on critical path to file acceptance. What the agency looks at when they look at file acceptance is, have you provided sufficient data for them to evaluate the file, is it in an appropriate format that they can review, are there any significant deficiencies. And of course, we're very confident in the file that we've submitted, so we would not in any way anticipate any challenges there.

With respect to the data for 951, we're very pleased with the data. There is very strong efficacy, and the safety is within our expectations, it matches our expectations across essentially all important areas. What's important to keep in mind is this agent delivers transformative benefit to patients who have extremely difficult to control Parkinson's disease through other measures, and to have a very, very difficult time controlling their disease. For example, with orals or with other approaches. And so the overall picture has to be looked at in that context. With respect to treatment discontinuations, what I would say is the treatment discontinuations, The rate of that overall is very similar to what you see with similar devices with insulin pump like devices used across a range of conditions. Most of these were driven by either local tolerability issues like injection site reactions, which were principally erythema or technical usability issues because these are older patient populations with limited mobility and dexterity in many cases, and there's always a subset of patients who find that they have difficulty using any device under those circumstances. Again, those rates of discontinuation are very similar to what you see with similar insulin pump-like devices. And keep in mind this is a very, very large population. This advanced Parkinson's population, only a very small proportion of which currently get advanced treatments because it's so limited in how that can be delivered. We think there's a big opportunity here and that treatment discontinuation rate doesn't change that and is in line with our expectations. With respect to hallucinations. We know that that is on mechanism. Or Levodopa and Carbidopa and it's essentially evidenced that we are delivering Levodopa and Carbidopa in a way that's more effective than can be done through other methods. And it's something that can be titrated and something that can be managed. And what I would point to is in the other direction. The oral group, the control group that got oral Levodopa and Carbidopa had more falls. And that to our eye shows a lower degree of control, which matches the clinical efficacy data, because we know falls are common in Parkinson's disease patients. So we need to keep that in mind. And with the efficacy that we've delivered, we think these are all very attractive profiles and ones that will translate into significant real-world use. When we look at how this will impact overall use, again and keep in mind that the very broad population, only a very small segment which can access the therapies that they need to control their disease. Therapies like DUOPA, which is transformative, that takes us surgical gastric tube actually threaded into the small bow to get deep brain stimulation and other types of measures. This is a much less invasive approach that delivers very strong efficacy and we think that will translate very, very effectively into the real world.",510.0,225.0,5.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.035555555555555556,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.013333333333333334

So typically, when -- we start to negotiate with the payers in the spring of the year for the following year. And typically those contracts can be multiyear contracts, maybe 2-year contract.

In terms of QULIPTA, look, we are off to a very good start.  I can tell you that UBRELVY continues to run a pace, that total oral CGRP market is upwards of maybe 18% of new prescriptions. And it's still early and that would be us and neurotech in the acute segment. And at a theoretical peak level, you could see maybe 30% or 40% based on cardiovascular issues with Triptan's or some other issues. But we still have clear -- clearly some runway to go. It's probably a little early to sort of determine how that preventative segment will really grow because you've only seen really the MABS so far.  They certainly tripled the market size. How will both of these orals and particularly in oral like QULIPTA in terms of the market development run a pace?

I’ll provide perspective on our overall performance and outlook, and then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our quarterly business highlights, pipeline progress, financial results and guidance for 2022 in more detail.  Our performances this quarter tops off another excellent year for AbbVie with results well above our initial expectations. We delivered full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $12.70, representing growth of more than 20% versus the prior year. Full-year adjusted net revenues were more than $56 billion, up 10.5% on a comparable operational basis. These results demonstrate balanced performance across each of our major growth franchises, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, aesthetics, and neuroscience. I’m extremely pleased with our momentum, and we’ve entered this year in a strong position, which is reflected in our guidance. We anticipate 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $14 to $14.20, representing growth of 11% at the midpoint. Longer-term, we remain well positioned with an impressive set of diversified growth assets. In immunology, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are already contributing meaningful revenue, including $4.6 billion in combined sales last year with substantial growth anticipated in 2022 and beyond. Over the next few months, we expect to add several new indications to the list of approved uses for these two assets, at which point, Skyrizi and Rinvoq will be commercialized across all of Humira’s major indications, plus atopic dermatitis. With the strong performance that we’re seeing in their initial indications and the robust data we’ve demonstrated across our broad development programs, we expect combined peak sales for Skyrizi and Rinvoq to exceed the peak revenues achieved by Humira.  In hematological oncology, we’ve established a leading position with Imbruvica and Venclexta, which were both expected to remain important revenue contributors through the decade. To support our next wave of growth, we also have an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies to address critical unmet needs in both blood cancers and solid tumors. Notable opportunities from our mid to late stage oncology pipeline include Navitoclax for myelofibrosis, which has the potential to provide disease modification in a market where current treatments only address symptoms. At Epcoritamab, a potentially best-in-class CD3XCD20 for B-cell malignancies, including DLBCL and follicular lymphoma; ABBV-383, our BCMA CD3 bispecific, which has the potential to become a best-in-class treatment in multiple myeloma; and Teliso-V, our promising c-Met ADC being studied for nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, which was recently granted breakthrough therapy designation. In neuroscience, we have a portfolio of compelling and differentiated therapies to support robust long-term growth in migraine, Parkinson’s disease and psychiatric conditions. Ubrelvy and Qulipta are both demonstrating strong launch trajectories in migraine, with each treatment expected to contribute more than $1 billion in peak sales. Vraylar continues to have a significant opportunity with currently approved indications with peak sales expected to approach $4 billion. An approval in major depressive disorder represents upside to our current projections. And 951, a potentially transformative improvement to our current treatment options for patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease with peak sales also anticipated to be more than $1 billion. Our leading aesthetics portfolio represents another extremely attractive growth opportunity. This business is performing well above expectations, delivering full year 2021 sales of more than $5.2 billion, $700 million higher than our initial guidance. AbbVie’s increased promotional investments are driving accelerated category growth, especially in toxins and fillers, where there is substantial room for additional market penetration globally. Dedicated resources are also of focused on delivering new product innovation within aesthetics, with several exciting R&D programs internally, including both short-acting and long-acting toxins, as well as novel fillers with biostimulatory or regenerative features. And we remain active with business development to pursue promising external technologies and complementary opportunities, including the recently closed Soliton acquisition, which further expands our body contouring portfolio. Given this focus and investment, we expect our aesthetics franchise to deliver high single digit revenue growth, through the end of the decade, including sales of more than $9 billion in 2029. Lastly, we’ve developed a robust pipeline, including numerous attractive late-stage programs, novel early stage therapies in a growing range of potential platform technologies, which we expect will collectively contribute to our growth through the decade. With the actions that we’ve taken to diversify our sources of growth, we remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our business. Following the U.S. Humira LOE event in 2023, we expect to quickly return to growth in 2024 and deliver high-single-digit growth from 2025 to the end of the decade. This is a testament to the strength of AbbVie’s broad and balanced portfolio. In summary, this is an exciting time for our Company. We’re demonstrating excellent execution across our portfolio, and our long-term growth prospects remain very strong. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff.

Looking at our quarterly results, we continue to demonstrate excellent commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I’ll start with immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.7 billion, reflecting growth of 13.3% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were $5.3 billion, up 3.5%, with 6% revenue growth in the U.S. offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 8.8% on an operational basis. Skyrizi is performing extremely well. Global sales of nearly $900 million were up 12.4% on a sequential basis, reflecting continued market share gains. Skyrizi has now surpassed Humira as the leader for total prescriptions in the U.S. psoriasis biological market, with share of approximately 20%. We are also now leading the market in several international geographies, including Japan. Total in-place share, which includes both new and switching patients, remains very and now, reflects roughly 37% patient share in the U.S. as well as leadership in nearly 20 key countries around the world. Skyrizi is also now approved for its second major indication, to treat adults with active psoriatic arthritis, further enhancing its compelling profile in dermatology. Field promotion is now active globally and early feedback from physicians has been very positive. Given Skyrizi’s demonstrated skin clearance and joint efficacy in our PSA clinical program, with nearly 30% of patients visiting dermatologists, having both, skin and joint involvement, this new approval will sustain Skyrizi’s strong momentum. In addition, we are preparing for the launch of Skyrizi’s in Crohn’s disease, an indication with very meaningful long-term revenue potential, with regulatory approvals in both, the U.S. and Europe anticipated this year. Rinvoq also continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of more than $500 million were up 14% on a sequential basis. Prescriptions in RA remain strong with a total market share of more than 5.5% in the U.S. and nearly 5% across key international markets. We’re very pleased with the competitive labels for both PSA and atopic dermatitis, where we are making excellent progress with their launches globally. In atopic dermatitis, dermatologists appreciate key elements of Rinvoq’s new label, including the incorporation of stringent skin and itch endpoints, reflective of the performance in our registrational trials, as well as an adolescent indication and dosing flexibility. Managed care access is expected to ramp fairly quickly for both atopic dermatitis and PSA in the U.S. We are also preparing for the launches of Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis and axial SpA with regulatory approvals for both indications anticipated this year as well. Overall, we continue to feel very good about the performance and progress we’re making with both, Rinvoq and Skyrizi, which are expected to contribute more than $15 billion in combined risk adjusted global sales in 2025. In hematologic oncology, global revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 4.7% on an operational basis. Venclexta once again, delivered robust growth. Sales were up 34% on an operational basis with strong share performance across all approved indications. Imbruvica global revenues were down 2.7%, reflecting a slower than anticipated market recovery in CLL and increased share pressure from newer therapies. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.6 billion, up 19% on an operational basis, including robust double-digit growth for both, Vraylar and Botox Therapeutic. I’m also very pleased with our performance in migraine, where we have a portfolio of multiple distinct therapies to address the full spectrum of this disease. This includes our two leading oral CGRP therapies. Ubrelvy for acute migraine, which delivered total sales of $183 million, up 13% on a sequential basis, we anticipate robust sales growth again this year based on Ubrelvy’s competitive profile, continued strong new patient starts and a rapidly expanding CGRP segment. And we also have Qulipta, the only oral CGRP treatment specifically developed for the prevention of episodic migraine. The launch is going extremely well. When considering both paid and bridge volume Qulipta is already capturing nearly 20% of the new-to-brand share in the preventative CGRP class. Roughly three months post-launch, this is an incredible accomplishment and it’s a testament to Qulipta’s demonstrated efficacy, including rapid and meaningful reduction in migraine days. We expect commercial access for Qulipta to ramp quickly in the first half of this year. In eye care, revenues of $960 million were up 3.9% on an operational basis, including $364 million in sales from Restasis. Lastly, Mavyret were $427 million, down 10.1% on an operational basis, as treated patient volumes remained suppressed compared to pre-COVID levels. Overall, I’m very pleased with the performance and the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs.

ABBV,2022-02-02,2022-02-02,,2022-02-02,2022-02-02T09:00:00-05:00,0,2022-02-02,prepared,,Michael Severino,"Thank you, Jeff. We made significant advancement across all stages of our pipeline in 2021, and we expect continued progress again this year. In immunology, we had several recent important regulatory updates. We implemented safety and indication updates to our RA label for Rinvoq, and also received FDA approval in psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis to curing strong labels that highlight Rinvoq’s favorable benefit risk profile in both new indications. In atopic dermatitis, we received approval for both the 15 milligram and 30 milligram doses, and based on the impressive levels of skin clearance and itch reduction demonstrated in our development program, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new treatment option for adult and adolescent patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, who have not responded well to other systemic agents, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or biologics. We also have regulatory applications under review for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial SpA. We expect an FDA approval decision next month for ulcerative colitis, in the second quarter for ankylosing spondylitis, and in the fourth quarter for non-radiographic axial SpA. In Europe, we anticipate approval decisions for ulcerative colitis and non-radiographic axial SpA in the second half of the year. We’re nearing completion of Rinvoq’s registrational program in Crohn’s disease, which is the last major indication expansion program for Rinvoq. We recently announced positive top-line results from the first Phase 3 Crohn’s induction study, where Rinvoq demonstrated a very impact on clinical remission and endoscopic response in a difficult-to-treat refractory patient population. We expect to see results from the second Phase 3 Crohn’s induction study and from the maintenance study in the first half of this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2022. Also in immunology, we recently received FDA approval for Skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis, an important indication expansion for this asset. Based on the strong joint efficacy and the high level of skin clearance that Skyrizi provided in our registrational trials, we believe Skyrizi will be very competitively positioned as an effective new treatment option for psoriatic arthritis patients. We also have regulatory applications under review for Skyrizi in Crohn’s disease with approval decisions expected in the U.S. next month and in Europe, later this year. We’ve seen impressive results in our Crohn’s disease program, and we believe Skyrizi has the potential to become an important new therapy in this market, where there continues to be considerable unmet need. We’re making very good progress with our early-stage immunology pipeline as well, where we are developing novel agents with the goal of significantly advancing the standard-of-care across our core areas, by providing deeper and more durable responses. Our anti-TNF steroid ADC ABBV-154 is a novel approach for delivering a potent steroid that has the potential to provide durable remission in diseases such as RA, PMR and Crohn’s disease. We expect to see preliminary data from our Phase 2 dose ranging study in RA in the fourth quarter of this year. We also expect to see Phase 2 proof-of-concept data in PMR and Crohn’s disease in 2023. In dermatology, our early-stage efforts are focused on developing oral agents that can provide clear skin with durable responses. Our RoRγT inverse agonist, ABBV-157 is designed to more effectively inhibit IL-17 production compared to pure antagonists, which has the potential to result in a greater impact on skin inflammation. We’ve recently been again a Phase 2 dose ranging study for 157 in psoriasis. Moving to oncology, where we continue to make good progress across all stages of our pipeline. We recently received an FDA breakthrough therapy designation for Teliso-V in second line plus advanced or metastatic nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer, based on the encouraging results we’ve seen to-date in our clinical program. Treatment options for patients who have exhausted platinum-based chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy are limited to single agent chemo, which typically provides response rates of only 15% to 20%, with a median overall survival of less than one year. Prognosis for these patients is very poor. While targeted therapies have been approved by the FDA for the 3% to 4% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations, there are currently no therapies approved, specifically for the much larger group of patients, who exhibit c-Met protein overexpression. Patients with overexpressed c-Met represents about 25% to 30% of the advanced or metastatic nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer population with wild-type EGFR, which corresponds to an incidence of approximately 35,000 patients each year in the U.S. In stage 1 of our Phase 2 study, we saw promising efficacy in heavily pretreated patients who received Teliso-V, including a 54% objective response rate in those with highly expressed c-Met. The second stage of the Phase 2 study is ongoing and has the potential to support an accelerated approval in second-line plus advanced metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. We expect to see additional data from this study next year. We also recently began the clinical program for our next-generation c-Met ADC, ABBV-400, which utilizes a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload to potentially drive deeper tumor responses in patients with both, intermediate and high levels of c-Met expression. We also expect to see data this year from several important indication expansion programs for Venclexta, including results from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation as well as results from our program for Venclexta in previously untreated higher-risk MDS patients, where we received a breakthrough therapy designation. We plan to submit our regulatory applications to the FDA in the first half of this year for an accelerated approval in MDS, and late in ‘22 or early ‘23 for multiple myeloma. Both indications represent important expansion opportunities for Venclexta and will help drive long-term growth for our oncology portfolio. We are also making very good progress with epcoritamab, where we continue to generate strong data in early-stage studies to support our view that epcoritamab has the potential to become a differentiated and best-in-class CD3xCD20 bispecific across several B-cell malignancies including diffuse B cell and follicular lymphomas. We’ll see monotherapy data in the third quarter from the Phase 2 expansion cohort in DLBCL, which has the potential to support a submission for accelerated approval in the second half of this year. We also have a Phase 3 study ongoing in third-line relapsed/refractory DLBCL and we plan to initiate several additional Phase 3 trials this year, including studies in earlier lines of therapy for diffuse B-cell lymphoma in multiple combinations, as well as in follicular lymphoma in combination with rituximab and Revlimid. This year, we’ll also see additional data maturing from our cohort expansion studies for ABBV-383, both as a monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care and novel agents in multiple myeloma. We believe our BCMA-CD3 bispecific has the potential to be differentiated on efficacy, safety and dosing interval and can be best-in-class across multiple lines of therapy. We plan to initiate Phase 3 studies later this year in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We also continue to make good progress with Navitoclax in myelofibrosis, where we’ve seen strong mid-stage data supporting our view that Navitoclax has the potential to provide disease modification, which we believe will lead to improved and durable clinical outcomes for patients. We expect a Phase 3 data readout and regulatory submissions in the first half of next year, with approval anticipated near the end of 2023. Moving to neuroscience, where we expect several important pipeline events in 2022 as well. We recently completed discussions with the FDA and are preparing to submit our application for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Based on the totality of the data and the strong benefit-risk profile demonstrated in our clinical program, we believe Vraylar has the potential to be competitively positioned as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. We expect a submission in the first quarter and an approval decision by the end of the year. We’ve also completed our registration-enabling program for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease. In our Phase 3 studies, 951 proved superior to oral levodopa/carbidopa in reducing motor fluctuations in this advanced population, and we believe our innovative new delivery system represents a potentially transformative improvement to current treatment options. We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications in the first half of this year in the U.S. and Europe, with both approval decisions anticipated in early 2023. And we expect to see Phase 3 data for Qulipta in chronic migraine prevention later in the first quarter and plan to submit our regulatory applications in both, the U.S. and Europe this summer, with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2023. So, in summary, we remain focused on continuing to execute on our pipeline programs and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones across all stages of our pipeline in 2022. This includes important indication expansion for on-market drugs and data readouts and regulatory actions for key late-stage assets as well as proof-of-concept data from several early-stage NME programs. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2022 financial outlook.

AbbVie once again delivered outstanding performance while also advancing our strategic priorities. The strong results across our portfolio continue to support AbbVie’s long-term growth outlook. Starting with fourth quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.31, up 13.4% compared to prior year and $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were $14.9 billion, up 7.5% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.3% of sales, an improvement of 240 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.6% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 22.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $571 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.5%. Shifting to 2022, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $14 and $14.20, reflecting growth of 11% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $4.74 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We expect adjusted net revenue of approximately $60 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.8% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect Immunology Global sales to grow double digits, including U.S. Humira growth of 8%, International Humira revenue of $2.6 billion at current exchange rates, Skyrizi Global sales of $4.4 billion and Rinvoq Global sales of $2.7 billion. In hematologic oncology, we expect Venclexta global sales of $2.3 billion and Imbruvica global revenue of $5.4 billion. The Imbruvica forecast assumes market recovery in CLL, offset by share erosion from increased competition. For aesthetics, we expect global sales of $5.9 billion, including $2.6 billion for Botox Cosmetic and $1.7 billion from Juvederm. For neuroscience, we expect global revenue of $6.9 billion, including Botox Therapeutic sales of $2.7 billion, Vraylar sales of $2.2 billion, Ubrelvy sales of $800 million and Qulipta sales of $200 million with commercial access increasing rapidly in the first half of the year. For eye care, we expect global sales of $2.9 billion, including $700 million from Restasis, which assumes no generic competition in the first half of 2022. Lastly, we expect Mavyret global revenue of $1.7 billion. Looking at the P&L for 2022, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.8 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $12.7 billion. This guidance includes approximately $2.5 billion in expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition. We are forecasting the adjusted operating margin ratio to expand by 120 basis points to approximately 51.5% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense approaching $2.2 billion, our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12.7% and our share count to be roughly flat to 2021. Turning to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $13.5 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas: Immunology sales of $6.2 billion, HemOnc revenue of $1.7 billion, aesthetic sales of $1.3 billion, neuroscience revenue of $1.5 billion and eye care sales of $900 million. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 51% of sales, and we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.10 and $3.14, excluding approximately $1.22 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie’s strong business performance and outlook continue to support our capital allocation priorities. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $24 billion in 2022, which is net of roughly $1 billion in Skyrizi royalty payments. This cash flow will fully support a strong and growing dividend, which we have increased by more than 250% since inception; continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down just above $12 billion of debt in 2022 and estimate a net leverage ratio of 1.8 times by the end of the year. Our strong cash flow also allows for continued business development, with approximately $2 billion allocated annually to augment our pipeline with the most promising external technologies and innovative therapies. In closing, we are very pleased to AbbVie’s strong results in 2021. And we expect to deliver robust performance in 2022 and over the long term.

So, the RA market after the drug safety and label is progressing as we anticipated. So, I’ll give you some sense, and I’ll refer to sort of in-play share because you have to be a little bit careful in the December, January time frame with overall volumes in the market. But right before the Drug Safety Communication, we had about a 16% in-place share in RA, which was just right behind Humira. So very, very strong. If we look at where that’s trended over the fourth quarter, it’s dropped about 20%. Okay? So, it’s about 14 reported in October, just over 13 in November, very consistent with what we thought would happen. So, about a 20% shift in new-to-brand starts over that time period. And what we see from the market is it’s exactly as we would expect, very, very stable, no change really in second-line plus and doctors start to suppress their starts in first-line consistent with the label. So, what we’re going to see is that as basically the promotion kicks back in here after December in the first quarter, we’re going to see that type of stability, which we can see is very, very clear from our overall share in our weeklies and start to progress as we shift and pivot towards that second-line plus. So, the market is responding very similar to our expectations that we’ve been talking about in terms of overall RA. Obviously, PsA is going to help build upon that RA dynamic and then ultimately, later in the year, the big axial approvals as well. So, everything is progressing as we thought it would progress from a market perspective. In terms of atopic dermatitis, listen, I said in my prepared remarks, we’re very pleased with the label. We have those stringent endpoints of the EASI 90, the high skin clearance, very powerful itch reduction are reflected in our label. We obviously have both doses approved. The market, I can tell you, has been very pleasantly surprised about the adolescent indication, which is -- it’s very important. So, that’s basically -- we’re going to start to see that ramp. It won’t -- we don’t think it’s going to be slow. And to your point, in terms of our ability to start to capture patients, it’s happening already. We obviously haven’t reported any of the TRxs yet, but we can see it in the market. And typically, it’s falling into a couple of areas. First, dupi failures, not a surprise, and there’s a reasonably significant number of people after 4 or 5 years that just have failed and exited the market. They’re going to come back in. We have reports from our research and our teams over partial responders to dupi that just aren’t doing well, in particular with the itch. We see some early starts there. And then, of course, challenging patients in general, we are seeing starts there as well with those higher levels of skin involvement. So the market seems to be progressing as we expected. It’s not surprising that as we look at the development of the second-line market, we’re going to see initially most of the starts in the dupi partial responders or the nonresponders, which is a fairly significant population. Also, as I mentioned, that we will start to see our access ramp fairly quickly here over the first part of the year. So, we’re encouraged.

I was wondering if you guys will be in a position to give us some sort of a floor number in 2023 based on payer contracts. Sometimes this year, obviously, the market is looking for that. And then, when I talk to payers, it seems a lot of the decisions about what product they would use longer term will not happen in 2023. That will happen in 2024. You kind of talked about kind of like a decline and then a quick ramp-up. Do you see the floor here in 2023, or do you see it in 2024? And then, if I could sneak one more. You have one of the largest differences between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings in the industry because of that Allergan acquisition.

I think if you look at the guidance we provided thus far, I mean, I think that’s consistent with how we see the market playing out overall. We’ve said basically you should be thinking about 45% erosion, plus or minus 10%, that’s probably a reasonable range. Nothing has really given us any indication that it should be different than that at this point. I think we will be in a position as we move later on this year to potentially be able to provide some more specificity around that. We should be through all of the contracting at that point, in a better position to be able to understand the ramp and the change that will occur over that period of time, and we certainly want to provide guidance when we have confidence that we can give you a high degree of specificity of what that guidance looks like. As it relates to your question about floor for Humira, I think your question is, will the floor for Humira be in ‘23 or ‘24. And I believe you’ll see further erosion from ‘23 to ‘24 on the Humira business alone. But what we have described is we returned to growth on the overall business. So, you have to think about it from the perspective of this underlying growth engine that gets suppressed in ‘23 by the significant erosion that you see around Humira, both price and some volume. And then, as that continues, it continues at a slower pace when we get into ‘24. So, the overall business has the ability to be able to drive growth for the total Company. But yes, Humira would continue to decline in ‘24.

So when you look at our adjustments to specified intangible amortization, I’d say intangible amortization is like 70% of it and this is on the $4.74 guidance that we’ve given this year. And that will continue. Obviously, those things fall off over a number of years. But I would say that’s probably a level that I would assume would be present for the next several years. Another big component is kind of the contingent consideration given that we’re -- that’s purchase accounting, and we record that accretion as such, that will certainly fluctuate over time. But I’d say those are the two biggest components of the guide this year. And certainly, integration costs are starting to wind down, so you would expect to see those come down.

As we move into 2022 and the COVID dynamic shakes out, we’ll be able to see the impact of competition versus COVID. Assuming that a significant chunk of the U.S. slowing growth rate or decline is due to competition, what can be done to recoup the momentum against the narrative, particularly of Calquence? And then second, in terms of your aesthetics business, you terminated your contract with Medytox liquid formulation. There are competitive products coming to market as well as increasing price competition.

And you’re right that we still have the continuing lingering effect with COVID, and Rob addressed that in his comments. So, we still see the market versus ‘19 levels down about 10% and even marginally down from 2020 in Q4. So we anticipate that that will moderate go forward. And then we’re left to manage the competitive impact. So, we are seeing competitive BTKs have some impact on Imbruvica, but we’re also seeing the competitive impact from our own Venclexta. So we have to start to think about looking at the combination of the AbbVie position, which is still very, very strong. To give you some sense in second-line, we have 45% share of the market, and it’s even higher in third-line, and it’s in the 30s for frontline. So, we have to continue, which is our strategy to highlight where we have a lot of distinction, which is the strength of our data across every comparator in CLL, the overall survival benefit, and then also bring the strength of our overall portfolio. So, that’s how we plan to mitigate it. As Rob mentioned, we see market recovery offset by some share pressure on Imbruvica, mitigated by positive Ven impact. So, that’s how we see the market develop as we go into 2022. We also are seeing some pricing pressure in some select segments that are also contributing to the share loss for Imbruvica. And obviously, we -- as much as we can, we keep the pricing discipline in the market moving forward.

And certainly, as you look at Botox, both here in the U.S. and internationally, it competes today against a significant number of competitive alternatives that are available. I think it’s a pretty impressive position that Botox has in the market. When you look at the brand equity that it has, when you look at the confidence that injectors have in using the product, they tend to describe it as the most forgiving of all the toxins that they have experience with. And then there’s obviously a fairly significant customer loyalty aspect to Botox with the loyalty programs and Allergan has a very significant loyalty program that offers patients incentives to be able to use the product and to go back and get repeat procedures. Having said all of that, we feel confident in the position that we have competitively against the competitive alternatives that we see out there and those that we see coming. We have a very active R&D effort in the aesthetics R&D group now that’s looking at next-generation toxins. Two in particular that we highlighted in the comments earlier are we had a short-acting toxin that’s in development that’s progressing very nicely, and we have a true long-acting toxin that’s in development as well. And we believe that those will help grow the market. But, if I look at the market now, obviously, we’ve seen significant acceleration in the market since we’ve activated many of the strategies that we put in place after acquiring Allergan. But if I look at our overall share, overall share has stayed very steady, in fact, might have ticked up one point in the latest set of data. So, that tells you that we’re not only growing the market very rapidly but we’re continuing to compete quite effectively against the alternatives that are out there. So, I’m not overly concerned about what I see on the horizon. I think, we have the opportunity to build the market even larger with some of the next generation toxins that we’re working on when we bring those to the marketplace.

Just a couple of questions I have related to more of the longer-term guidance you’ve given. In the past, you had talked about your HemOnc franchise sort of in peak sales or sales I guess in 2025 of around $13 billion. When you updated some of your numbers earlier last month, I don’t think you updated that one. So, I’m just curious if you still think that that’s a reasonable sort of 2025 expectation? And then, the other one is around Ubrelvy, where you’ve sort of stayed with this guidance of sort of more than $1 billion in peak sales. But you’re already guiding to $800 million of sales just in this current year, pretty early in the launch. So, I’m just wondering if you can maybe give a little better sense of how you’re viewing sort of the longer-term opportunity for Ubrelvy and maybe if you want to mention Qulipta, I know that’s early, but at least for Ubrelvy, do you think there’s significant upside to that $1 billion number you’ve mentioned before?

So, I’ll cover the first one, and then I’m going to have Jeff cover the Ubrelvy question that you’ve asked. So, it’s a good question. Obviously, the HemOnc market in the areas that we participate in, in particular, I would say CLL has changed over the last several years. I think one of the -- certainly, one of the things that was not ever anticipated in that guidance was the impact that COVID would have on the market and the reduction that we saw in the number of new patients, which was quite sizable. And that obviously wasn’t contemplated in it. And the second thing is we are seeing certainly more competitive pressure, both from price and some volume than we anticipated in that time frame. Having said all of that and -- well, I’d say a third item is, certainly, Venclexta is performing well as well. And I’d say, it’s tended to exceed some of our expectations, at least at this point within the launch trajectory of the brand. So, all of those have factors in what we’re describing here. I’d also say we have done a nice job of building out our HemOnc portfolio from an R&D standpoint. When I look at some of those assets that I described in my opening comments, I think they’re going to have a very significant opportunity. As an example, one that I didn’t mention there would be Venclexta and the t(11;14) multiple myeloma population. That could be a very significant opportunity, we feel good about that. We should get a readout on that. And we think that could be a significant contributor to both improvement in in-patient therapy, but also a significant improvement in the overall revenue in the franchise. And then, you have things like Navitoclax and epcoritamab and 383, those are all significant opportunities to be able to drive growth. So, I still feel confident in the overall ability for us to grow our HemOnc franchise. Having said that, I would say, Imbruvica is under more pressure than we anticipated. When we put that guidance out, at that point, we didn’t even contemplate a follow-on BTKs in any meaningful way. But we do see more competitive pressure there. But overall, I’d say, I still feel very confident in our ability to be able to grow that, that will be a growth franchise for the Company over the long term.",418.0,165.0,11.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.012121212121212121,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.0,0.05454545454545454

Certainly, we’re very pleased, as I mentioned in my remarks, over the momentum on Ubrelvy. We continue to lead in that acute space. And the early results for Qulipta are also very strong. Now, a lot of it is going to depend on how that CGRP market develops. So, if you think about it in this way, and this is how we think about it is, is it’s about in terms of new patient capture for the total Ubrelvy market, where we also compete with another player from Biohaven. It’s about 18% to 19% of the market. And the market is also with the expanded triptan market, of course. So, if you look at that, the payers certainly like you to step through one or more triptans. When you look at the population that may not be eligible for a triptan or fails a triptan, the estimates are typically up to 30% to 35%. And so, the market has potential room to sort of double into that epidemiology. So, you can kind of run the numbers there. I mean, we often get the question, is it over $1 billion? Is it closer to $1 billion or is it closer to a higher number. But nonetheless, we’re pleased. Certainly, it’s exceeded our expectations so far, and Qulipta has as well. So, I think there’s more room for the market to run, but we’ll have to see.

So, why won’t 2022 look more like or even better than 2021 in terms of earnings power? And secondly, there was no mention of the CF program even in the upcoming milestones.

And when I look at all of the businesses individually, and I look at their ability to be able to perform, I’m extremely confident in the trajectory that we have going forward. Specifically, we’re assuming as an example, in HCV that there’s still a COVID impact in HCV. So, I wouldn’t say the pandemic is completely gone in 2022. But, I’d say, overall, the brands are performing well. We’re investing in the business to ensure that we continue to be able to drive long-term performance.

Aesthetics, we’ve seen that the strength of the investment in aesthetics in the way we’ve been able to grow the market. So that’s really important. At the same time, we’re expanding operating margin. We’re exceeding our expectations for synergies. And so, you’re seeing us deliver another year of operating margin expansion. So, I’d say, we’re top tier in operating margin, very healthy P&L profile.

We certainly are in a position now to be able to commit that we would give earnings guidance in the third quarter. I think clearly, we’ll be able to give a better feel for what that erosion curve looks like. And could that ultimately end up being at least a pretty good perspective for us to be able to build off of what earnings guidance would look like. It might. I think if we’re in a position where we can confidently provide that guidance, we would provide it. But I certainly think we’ll be in a position where we have very good visibility as to what that erosion curve will look like. And at that point, we can tighten it a bit and be able to provide a higher level of specificity. We understand it’s an important issue for investors. As far as EPS is concerned, in 2023, we have said that we expect EPS to decline in 2023. So, I don’t think any investor is -- that would be a surprise to any investor.

And we’re still tracking to that overall timeline. There were some challenges towards the end of the year, where a number of patients were expected from Australia, for example, and Australia shut down because of COVID and we had to shift that enrollment. So, we perhaps have slightly less data than we would have hoped to have had at this point in the year. But again, we’re still tracking to be able to make that go/no-go decision by the end of the year, because it’s important to keep in mind that these are short studies.

If you look at the performance of Rinvoq and inflammatory bowel diseases, both in UC where we have the full data set and in Crohn’s disease, where we have an important component of the induction data set, the performance across the board is very, very strong. Not only in terms of just overall response rates that are measured, but particularly when one looks at deeper measures of response, clinical remission, mucosal healing, major clinical response, which is the combination of remission and endoscopic improvement. And across the board, we’re driving very high levels of disease control. And we think that feature of the drug, combined with the overall benefit risk position us to compete very effectively against not only oral competitors but many competitors, all competitors in the field. When we look at those data to our eye, given the limitations of cross-study comparisons, we see response rates that just aren’t paralleled in the field. And so we think that there is a very real opportunity for Rinvoq and our view of its role in IBD reflects that. With respect to mixed induction and maintenance regimens, it’s important to keep in mind that there are no data to support those sorts of regimens. All of the programs look at induction, followed by maintenance, which is usually a step-down in dose from the induction dose. And that’s the data set that physicians will have. Now, it’s important to keep in mind that in the long term, patients often lose control and then they need to be reinduced with a new agent. And one of the very strong features of Rinvoq and quite frankly, Skyrizi also shares this characteristic, is it has very durable response. So, it does maintain response for a very long period of time in the studies that we have continued to follow, including our long-term extensions from Phase 2 and our Phase 3 program. So, we think those are also very strong attributes to the products.",345.0,156.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.03205128205128205,0.02564102564102564,0.00641025641025641,0.0,0.0,0.00641025641025641

And I will tell you that at least as far as the U.S. is concerned, there has not been much of an impact on aesthetic volume, unlike what we saw when there was an actual shutdown. And obviously, you would think shutdown, you’re going to see the volume go down. But I’d say here, we’re seeing very little impact on the volume. So, we have factored in that we don’t expect a major disruption going forward. And I think the data would clearly support that that’s a reasonable position to take. And as far as the business overall, I mean, I can tell you, we’re very pleased with how the business is performing. I think that group is executing at a very high level. And certainly, the resourcing and the dedicated structure that we put in place, I think, are helping a lot in major geographies like the U.S. and China. We’re obviously comfortable with the guide that we provided. It is an area that we’re going to continue to invest in and continue to drive. And I think it’s a market that I think is extremely attractive. And it’s going to require both us to continue to execute and invest in it appropriately to grow the market, but also to build out more assets that meet patients’ needs to be able to expand the market. And so, we’ve almost doubled the R&D investment that we have in aesthetics since we took it over. And we have a number of programs that I think are very exciting programs. Some of the biostimulatory and regenerative fillers that we’re working on now, I think, could be exciting opportunities like tropoelastin to be able to stimulate tropoelastin in patients using fillers is an exciting program that continues to advance. And so, it’s going to require both. It’s something that we’re absolutely committed to continue to drive.

It’s an important new indication if we see -- when we see the data and it were to be approved. And I’ll give you some perspective. Obviously, we’ve talked about how much we really like our portfolio of migraine. You got Botox on chronic with the injectors. Obviously, you have Qulipta right now in episodic and of course, Ubrelvy in acute. So, the Qulipta chronic gives us quite a bit of flexibility, and it’s a nice catalyst. Even though episodic is a bigger market in terms of patients, obviously, chronic patients do consume a lot of medication. Largely, if you think about the market structure, you’ve got injectors, meaning they inject Botox or you have non-injectors. So, to bring in the first oral that -- for people that don’t choose to have a Botox-injectable practice, that’s quite attractive. And we think it builds in our story over the strength of Qulipta first-in-class designed specifically for these indications. So, it’s a very nice catalyst if it were to be approved. And so, we’re anxiously looking forward to that. The other thing I would note, which is further off and it’s obviously something that would have to play out through the studies in Mike’s organization, was chronic migraine is so difficult that the potential for patients to have combination treatment. So, in other words, a Botox Therapeutic plus a simple oral drug like Qulipta could bring this concept to that segment of the market called migraine freedom where you’re really trying to get the headaches down to as low as possible. And so, again, it’s further off, but it shows you the flexibility that we have as we continue to build out Qulipta across our migraine portfolio.

Certainly, one of the areas that you want to be able to look at is your ability to be able to stimulate collagen so that your own body can produce collagen to be able to provide support and filling in a specific area that you desire. And there are some products on the market today that provide that. One of the negatives of those products is you don’t get the immediate filling effect that you normally get with a filler, where you get physical filling immediately upon the procedure. You get a little bit of swelling that occurs. So, for a very short period of time, you will get what looks to be filling, but then that swelling goes down. And then for a period of time, the patient has to wait in order for them to get the collagen impact, and that takes a significant period of time. So we have a technology in-house that we acquired, and we’re further developing that combines both physical filling and collagen stimulation in one product. So, you get the immediate filling effect of a normal filler. And then, as that starts to resolve over time, you get the collagen impact that’s building over that same period of time to provide long-term filling. So, I would say that most of these technologies that we’re working on are market expansion opportunities, so that’s one example. The second example would be one of the areas that is important for patients is what we describe as skin quality, the smoothness of your skin essentially. And one of the things that provides smoothness of your skin is the elasticity of the skin. So, tropoelastin is an example of a product that we have in development that will allow the body to be able to produce more elastin. So, you can inject this product and it will provide, we believe, we have to prove this in the clinical studies, that would provide not only some level, not a dramatic level of filling but an ability to be able to provide elastin information along those areas and be able to smooth the skin out. That would clearly be a market expansion opportunity, today there really aren’t fillers that do that. They can stretch the skin with the physical filling, but they don’t really provide smoothing of the skin. And so, those are two examples of what we’re working on.",435.0,190.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.05789473684210526,0.005263157894736842,0.005263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842

I’ll start with the question on Qulipta and Botox combo use and then Jeff may want to add and take the second question. With respect to that combination, it really goes back to what Jeff said before, this concept of migraine freedom. If you think about chronic migraine, these are patients who have 15 or more migraine days a month. That’s a migraine every other day, and these are debilitating attacks. So a substantial reduction in that is great. But, what patients and physicians are really seeking is an elimination of the migraine so that they can be free to go across their daily lives, to go about their daily lives. And given the options that are out there today to really get to that level in those most severely affected patients. Combination therapy is an obvious place to go, particularly when it’s complementary approaches that work through different mechanisms. And so you would expect their effects to be independent and additive. And where you have a treatment like Botox, it has a long track record, is infrequently administered and has a long duration. So, it’s that thinking that led to that combination trial. And I do think we would also agree that there is significant interest in treating physicians around these approaches.",220.0,97.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.030927835051546393,0.010309278350515464,0.0,0.0,-0.030927835051546393

Just to add to that, that’s exactly right, is the -- it’s so logical and there’s so much unmet need, to Mike’s point, in chronic migraine with half a month, sometimes these migraines last for days. And so there’s a lot of desperation. And when the thought leaders and the headache specialists see the impact of Botox and how simple Qulipta is and how strong that is, they go right there.

I’ll have -- I’ll let Jeff talk a little bit about the total available market, what we see as far as the size of that market going forward.

I mean it’s different than the -- obviously, the market is basically over-the-counter or prescription high glasses or readers, right? So, this is the first ever product that basically is a drop or a reading drop, right? So, when we start to break down the data and you take a really, really big market, tens and tens of millions of patients with presbyopia. But we also largely see from the clinical study, it really works the best for moderate to severe younger people, not older people. So, as we basically make the cuts, it’s still a substantial market size, but it’s not as large as you might think if you just look at all the presbyopes that are better in the United States. But nonetheless, it’s early days where we have a sales force that’s calling on our optometrist, also ophthalmologists. What we see from the early results is significant interest. We haven’t started our big consumer push, which will come later, later in this quarter. It is an older glaucoma product that’s been reformulated. So, there’s a little bit of learning from the ophthalmologists who really understand glaucoma products. But overall, the early results are it works, it works as anticipated. It works quickly within 15 minutes. It lasts for 6 to 8 hours. And so, again, when we look at the price point, it’s not a reimbursed product. It’s a cash pay product. We have, to Rick’s point, fairly modest expectations.

It continues to deliver very strong results, high overall response rates, very deep responses, good complete response rates across a number of indications, DLBCL and follicular lymphoma both. With respect to the confidence in accelerated approval for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, when we look at the data, we think it clearly exceeds the benchmarks of available therapies in highly pre-treated refractory patients. So, we would think that accelerated approval should be supported by those data, will allow the data to continue to mature from the expansion cohorts and have our final regulatory discussions later on this year to set up that accelerated approval submission. So, it certainly is in our planning, and we think it’s very supportable based on the data. With respect to confidence in Vraylar and MDD, we’re confident in that -- we’ve been confident. We were confident when we saw the data and looked at the strength of those data and looked at the relevant precedents for molecules that have achieved indications, not only in depression, broadly speaking, but in adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. We’ve completed all of the regulatory discussions that we need to have for the submission, and we’re planning the submission shortly as we described in my prepared remarks. In terms of potential for an AdCom, it’s really too early to comment on that. We typically start to have those conversations with the agency a few months into the review process. But, based on the data and based on the precedence, it’s not something that we would anticipate. However, if the agency were to have one, it wouldn’t concern us either.

I'll briefly comment on our overall performance, then Jeff, Tom and Rob will review our first quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. I'm pleased with the excellent start to 2022. It further reinforces our confidence in the long-term fundamentals of the business. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenue of more than $13.5 billion was up 5.4% on an operational basis, also above our expectations. These results demonstrate strong momentum across several key products and portfolios, including robust double-digit operational revenue growth from Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Neuroscience and Aesthetics. Skyrizi is performing exceptionally well. We are achieving impressive market share gains in psoriasis, which remains a significant market opportunity. Skyrizi's recent launch in psoriatic arthritis as well as the anticipated regulatory approval in Crohn's disease should also serve as important growth drivers over the long-term. Rinvoq is also contributing compelling sales growth. Subscription trends in RA have recently stabilized as we expected and we are making excellent progress repositioning the brand as the leading second-line agent based on the robust data generated across our broad development programs. The early launch trends for Rinvoq in both atopic dermatitis and psoriatic arthritis are highly encouraging, with commercial access and paid prescriptions expected to ramp significantly over the coming months. We anticipate that these two new indications, along with the recent U.S. approval in ulcerative colitis, should add substantial revenue growth for Rinvoq over the long-term. Neuroscience remains an exciting opportunity for our company. Vraylar continues to have strong momentum across our currently approved indications and the pending regulatory approval in major depressive disorder represents a significant upside to current projections. In migraine, our portfolio of distinct therapies with Ubrelvy, Qulipta and Botox Therapeutic is demonstrating robust double-digit sales growth. With the migraine market anticipated to roughly double in size over the next several years, there is significant headroom for continued revenue growth with these compelling therapies. Aesthetics is once again exceeding expectations. The category continues to grow robust double digits, especially in toxins and fillers, where there is substantial opportunity for further market penetration. Our commercial team is executing at a high level with targeted promotion and enhanced digital services, including our Alle loyalty program driving strong market share performance across our major brands. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie, and I'm extremely pleased with the evolution and momentum of our diverse portfolio. We're making excellent progress with the launches of several new products and indications, which will collectively add meaningful revenue for AbbVie as commercial access ramps for each of these opportunities over the remainder of this year. We're off to another exceptional start, and our long-term growth prospects remain strong. I'd now like to take a brief moment to thank Mike Severino for his contributions to the success of AbbVie over the last eight years. As you know, Mike has decided to leave AbbVie at the end of May to pursue another career opportunity, and we wish him all the best. I'd also like to take this opportunity to formally introduce to you Tom Hudson. Tom joined AbbVie back in 2016 as the Head of Discovery and Early Development. In 2018, Tom undertook responsibilities for AbbVie's entire discovery organization. Then in 2019, was promoted to the Head of AbbVie R&D and Chief Scientific Officer, where he assumed responsibility for all of AbbVie's R&D. Tom has an impressive background as a clinical scientist. His medical specialty is in clinical immunology and allergy. Tom played a critical role in the human genome project while working at both the Whitehead Institute and MIT, where Tom led the team that mapped the human genome. Tom was also instrumental in the international half map project to refine the genetic architecture of the human genome. Tom went on to further lead the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, which included discovery and translational cancer research with a clinical network of more than 1,000 investigators. Tom will be providing an update on our continued pipeline progress to you later in the call. But first, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.

We continue to demonstrate strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with Immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.1 billion, reflecting growth of 8.1% on an operational basis. Humira global sales were approximately $4.7 billion, down 1.8% on an operational basis with low single-digit revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across international markets, where revenues were down 17.9% operationally.  Skyrizi global revenues were $940 million, reflecting positive momentum in both approved indications. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is demonstrating impressive market share gains globally. Skyrizi now accounts for approximately 23% of the total prescription share in the U.S. biologic market. Skyrizi's in-play psoriasis share, which includes both new and switching patients, also remains very, very strong and now reflects roughly 40% patient share in the U.S. and a clear number one leadership position.  Skyrizi is performing exceptionally well internationally, where we have now achieved approximately 10% psoriasis share across our top 12 markets, as well as in-play share leadership in more than 20 key countries. While we were early in our launch in psoriatic arthritis, we are encouraged by the uptake in this indication. In the dermatology segment, Skyrizi has already achieved in-play patient share of more than 10% in the U.S.  Internationally, Skyrizi PSA is now approved in 45 countries, with reimbursement expected to increase throughout the year. Importantly, we are also preparing for the launch of Skyrizi in Crohn's disease, which represents another important long-term growth driver with approval decisions anticipated this year.  Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $465 million, demonstrating continued strong growth. As anticipated, we have seen an impact on new patient starts following the label update and Rinvoq prescriptions have now stabilized in the U.S., with in-play market share currently 12% in RA. We expect growth in the second line plus RA setting going forward where our field force is now focused on leveraging compelling data from two important Phase III trials. First, SELECT-CHOICE, which demonstrated Rinvoq's superiority versus ORENCIA across key efficacy parameters, including clinical remission in previously treated RA patients. And second, the open-label extension of SELECT-COMPARE which demonstrated that many RA patients with an inadequate response to Humira are able to achieve remission after switching to Rinvoq.  Early feedback suggests this updated Rinvoq RA messaging is resonating very well with healthcare practitioners. Internationally, Rinvoq share continues to ramp in RA with a total market share of approximately 5.5% across key geographies. We are also making excellent progress with Rinvoq's newly launched indications, including atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis.  Managed care access is expected to ramp strongly for each of these indications over the coming months. As we build access, initial prescriptions are covered by our BRIDGE program. which provides free patients or free goods to patients until formulary coverage is established. As a reminder, the volume from our BRIDGE program is not captured in third-party prescription data.  I'll start with atopic dermatitis. We are seeing new patient starts accelerating as we build access. When you include prescriptions from our Bridge program, Rinvoq total in-play AD share is already in the mid-teens. So, we are pleased with the early adoption and repeating prescribers. As an oral option that provides significant skin clearance and itch relief, we believe Rinvoq has a strong differentiated position in this highly underpenetrated AD market. In PSA, we are seeing a nice uptake in Rinvoq's in-play share, especially in the rheum segment, where the severity of joint or skin manifestations of the disease can vary significantly by patients. And importantly, we have also launched Skyrizi in the rheum-PSA segment this quarter, giving us two very compelling therapies to address the wide range of PSA patient types, regardless of how their symptoms present. We have also launched our first indication in the IBD segment, Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis, where we are seeing a significant long-term opportunity in the second-line plus setting. Nearly 50% of UC patients are currently on or have used TNF therapy, so the addressable patient population is substantial. Given the strong benefit risk in this indication, we believe Rinvoq will be a welcome therapeutic option for UC patients and physicians. Turning now to hematologic oncology. Global revenues were more than $1.6 billion, down 0.6% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.2 billion, down 7.4%. There are two factors impacting our Imbruvica results. First, we are seeing greater market share erosion in new patient starts than originally anticipated from newer therapy, including other BTK inhibitors, as well as our own Venclexta. Second, we continue to see higher-than-expected COVID suppression on new patient starts in CLL, which as a treat-to-progression therapy, has impacted the total BTK treated patient market. Our guidance assumes a market recovery over the course of this year, but it's too early to determine exactly how this may play out, given the continued impact from recent COVID variant. Despite these dynamics, Imbruvica remains the market-leading therapy for total patients across CLL and several other major blood cancers. Based on the magnitude of clinical data and real-world evidence generated for Imbruvica, showing sustained disease control as well as overall patient survival, we are confident it will continue to be a meaningful product for AbbVie over the long term. Venclexta, however, is helping to offset some of the headwinds facing Imbruvica. Global sales were $473 million, up 21.1% on an operational basis. In the US, Venclexta's the clear market share leader in frontline AML, among patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy and recently achieved leading new patient share in second line plus PLL. We are also seeing robust momentum internationally, with strong performance across all approved indications. Additionally, we continue to make excellent progress building out our hem/onc portfolio, with several compelling late-stage assets, such as epcoritamab for B-cell malignancies, Navitoclax for myelofibrosis and ABBV-383 for multiple myeloma, expected support -- expected to support sustainable long-term growth. Turning now to neuroscience, where revenues were approximately $1.5 billion, up more than 20% on an operational basis, including robust double-digit growth from Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic and Ubrelvy. Ubrelvy is performing very well and continues to be the market-leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine, with sequential demand growth observed. Qulipta is also demonstrating exceptional uptake in migraine prevention, with recent total prescriptions performing ahead of comparable branded launches. Qulipta is now capturing nearly 25% on of the new-to-brand share in the US preventative CGRP class when we consider both paid and bridge volume. We expect commercial access to continue to ramp strongly over the remainder of the year. Qulipta has also recently demonstrated positive results from a registration-enabling study for the preventative treatment of chronic migraine, which we plan to submit to the agency for potential expanded use in the US as well as to support regulatory applications across the international market. This indication, if approved, will provided added differentiation for Qulipta as the only oral CGRP therapy for the preventative treatment of both episodic and chronic migraine. In our other notable therapeutic, eye care revenues of $771 million were down 2.8% on an operational basis with recent generic competition for Restasis unfavorably impacting our results. Mavyret sales were $380 million, down 4.6% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes remain depressed compared to pre-COVID levels. So, overall, I'm extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we are making with recent new product launches. We remain on-track to deliver strong revenue growth once again in 2022. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D program.

We recently received FDA approval for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, a disease where there continues to be a significant unmet need for therapies that can provide high response rates and durable remission. In our UC development program, Rinvoq demonstrated some of the highest rates of remission and endoscopic improvements seen in Phase 3 studies. Importantly, Rinvoq also provided durable responses sustained through one year of treatment. Given the strong benefit risk profile, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new medicine for patients. Our regulatory applications for Rinvoq in UC remain under review in Europe and Japan, with approval decisions expected in the second half of this year. Also in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we recently reported positive topline results from the second Phase 3 induction study for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease. Similar to results from the first induction trial, in this induction study, Rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on the disease as measured by clinical remission and endoscopic response. We expect to see results from the Phase 3 maintenance study later in the quarter with our regulatory submissions for Rinvoq and Crohn's disease expected in the third quarter and approval decisions anticipated in 2023. Rounding out Rinvoq's development programs in rheumatology, we also have regulatory applications under review in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA. We expect an FDA approval decision in the second quarter for AS and decisions in the fourth quarter for non-radiographic axial SpA. Moving to Skyrizi, where in the quarter, we announced an update regarding our regulatory application for Crohn's disease in the US. Following an FDA request for additional information, primarily related to the on-body injection device used for maintenance dosing, we provided additional data for the device from an ongoing real-life use study, which showed that patients can safely and effectively use the on-body device to self-administer Skyrizi. After responding to the agency's request, we received a 3-month extension of our Skyrizi submission in Crohn's disease. We remain confident in a strong benefit risk profile for Skyrizi in Crohn's disease and we now expect a decision in June. Moving now to our Oncology Portfolio, where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our heme and solid tumor pipeline. We recently announced positive top line results from the first expansion cohort of the Phase II study, evaluating epcoritamab in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma who have received at least two prior lines of therapy.  Epcoritamab performed extremely well as a monotherapy in these heavily pretreated and high-risk patients, demonstrating an overall response rate of 63% with a median duration of response of 12 months. These results are particularly encouraging, given that nearly 40% of patients had failed CAR-T therapy. We plan to discuss these results with regulatory agencies about the potential to support submission for accelerated approval in the second half of this year. We continue to make good progress with the indication expansion programs for Venclexta and remain on-track to see results from the Phase III CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation in the second half of this year. In our Venclexta MDS program, based on feedback from the FDA, we have recently modified our regulatory strategy and now intend to submit data from our ongoing Phase III program. Venclexta remains under Breakthrough Therapy Designation for MDS and we continue to have a high degree of enthusiasm for Venclexta in this indication. We expect data readout from the Phase III study and our regulatory submission for MDS in 2024. In Neuroscience, the FDA recently accepted our application for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Based on the strong benefit-risk profile demonstrated in our clinical program, we believe Vraylar will be an important new therapy in this patient population, and we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to patients suffering from major depressive disorders.  In the area of migraine, we recently reported positive topline results from a Phase III study evaluating Qulipta for the prevention of chronic migraine. Qulipta performed very well in this study with both doses meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints, demonstrating Qulipta's ability to significantly reduce migraine days for patients suffering from chronic migraine.  This summer, we plan to submit our regulatory application to the FDA for Qulipta in chronic migraine and also plan to submit data from our Phase III studies in both chronic migraine and episodic migraine to support regulatory applications in markets outside the US. In our cystic fibrosis program, we recently completed an interim analysis of a Phase II proof-of-concept study evaluating our triple combination therapy. The results – the efficacy results from this interim analysis did not meet our prespecified criteria for advancing this triple therapy in development. This study was designed with a 28-day run-in treatment period, with a dual combination therapy containing our C1 corrector and potentiator, followed by a 28-day treatment period, with a triple combination, which included the addition of our C2 corrector, ABBV-119. This allowed us to independently assess the therapeutic potential of our C2 corrector. The results showed that the addition of 119 did not provide a meaningful improvement in FEV1 or reduction in sweat chloride concentration over our dual combination therapy. During the run-in treatment period, we were able to again assess the efficacy of our dual therapy, which performed well, providing efficacy consistent with results for the existing dual accommodation therapy. So based on the performance of our dual therapy, we plan to continue our CF program. We have an additional C2 corrector, ABBV-576 in Phase 1 studies that we plan to advance into a new triple therapy with our existing C1 corrector and potentiator. 576 is structurally distinct from our previous C2 corrector 119 and has a better PK profile and provides higher drug exposure, which has the potential to deliver better efficacy. Our plan is to begin a Phase 2 study for this new triple combo by early next year. And in Aesthetics, we recently began the Phase 3 program for our short-acting toxin in Glabellar Lines. This novel toxin is designed to provide rapid onset of action and a short duration of effect, which would lower the barrier for adoption for certain segment of consumers. We expect to see data from this program next year with regulatory applications also anticipated in 2023. So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year, and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2022. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance and financial outlook.

AbbVie's first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio, including double-digit growth from Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta, Neuroscience and Aesthetics. We also continue to deliver strong P&L performance, with another quarter of robust operating margin expansion, while fully funding the business for long-term growth. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, reflecting growth of 9.3% compared to prior year and $0.04 above our guidance midpoint. This includes an $0.08 unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&D expense that was not factored into our original guidance. Total net revenues were more than $13.5 billion, up 5.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Net revenues came in above our guidance despite the entry of generic competition for Restasis. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51.4% of sales, an improvement of 150 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 10.9% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.1% of sales. Net interest expense was $539 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.1%. Turning to our financial outlook, we are updating our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to include the $0.08 for acquired IPR&D expense that was incurred during the first quarter. As a result, we now expect full year adjusted earnings per share between $13.92 and $14.12. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $59.4 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.4% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue guidance includes updated Restasis sales of approximately $400 million. Moving to the P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of 84.5% of sales, adjusted SG&A expense of $12.5 billion, and an adjusted operating margin ratio of 51.8% of sales. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.6 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.38 and $3.42. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across multiple areas. We are making significant progress with new product launches and the pipeline, underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term growth outlook.

So, I mean, the script trends are down, and you mentioned that we are -- for new starts, you are losing some share to the competition. When you think -- can you please characterize how much share you are losing? And do you think it will stabilize over time? And when you look at Imbruvica and Venclexta combined, do you think the franchise can grow going forward from here?

So, as I mentioned in my comments, we are seeing greater share erosion. Imbruvica continues to be the leading share in the later lines, although we have lost our frontline share position to Calquence. And obviously, Venclexta is also moving there. So we see a couple of things that are taking place. So, we have that share erosion that's putting some pressure on the brand. And then clearly, we see the continued suppression of the market. So, it's kind of like a double hit. If we think of this over the short, mid and longer-term, what I would say would be this. So, in the short-term, meaning this year, we projected the share decline and that includes some stabilization, but we still think the brand is under some pressure from other BTKs and Venclexta. And basically, we have flat guidance this year. And some of that includes a recovery of the market back to sort of more normal levels and we'll have to see how that progresses over the year. If I think more about the midterm, I think what's important context there is, new patient starts essentially make up roughly 13% to 15% of Imbruvica. So it's got a very, very large installed base, about 85%, maybe a little bit more in terms of what that's going to happen. We're not seeing any changes in persistency or items like that. So we think that we have a very good sense of stability for the brand over time in terms of what this may mean. And so that's basically how we think about it. To answer your other question, if you look at the combined share, AbbVie has quite a strong position. We have roughly 33% of total share in the front line and we have between 42% and 46% of second-line plus. So clearly, Venclexta is able to offset as I commented in my remarks some of those pressures. So it's very important for AbbVie. It's going to be a very big brand over the long-term. In the short-term here in midterm, the growth is going to be more challenged moving forward.",368.0,150.0,7.0,7.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.04666666666666667,0.04666666666666667,0.02666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0

And I'm probably going to answer a little broader because I think it is important. I understand the interest in trying to understand how to model 2023, it's obviously important to us to model 2023 as accurately as possible. And I think if you step back, obviously, contracting is one portion of a variable that will impact the speed at which biosimilars are able to adopt – be adopted in the market.  If you step back and look, there's probably four key variables that will impact, what that adoption rate looks like. One of them is obviously, what will Humira's access be post biosimilars entering the marketplace? And this is the period where you would normally be doing the contracting around that. I think we'll do well in being able to be co-positioned versus biosimilars in the vast majority of covered lives here in the United States. But that process isn't done, and we're not in a position to be able to ultimately, give you any further update until we're a little further along in that process.  The second variable that will impact what 2023 looks like is, how will the biosimilars price? We don't know that. Obviously, we have seen how they price in markets outside the U.S., but there's no market exactly like the U.S. internationally. And so that's a variable. We're making some projections of what we believe that pricing will look like. But that's ultimately something we're going to have to see how it plays out.  I'd say the third variable is, how competitive will these biosimilars be? It's going to be by the summer of 2023, there's going to be a lot of biosimilars in the U.S. market, but they're not all the same. And how competitive will they be against what is Humira today? And what are the bulk of patients use as it relates to Humira. And what I mean by that is interchangeability and a number of other factors are going to play into the competitiveness of those biosimilars. And I'd say the fourth variable, and it's not something that people think about that much, and that is the ability of a biosimilar to be able to supply the U.S. market. There's no market like the United States for Humira anywhere around the world. In the United States, it's significantly larger than any other market around the world. There are certainly biosimilar players that are like an AbbVie, and I would expect them to have manufacturing capacity. There are generic players that could have sufficient manufacturing capacity, and then there are very small companies. But I think anybody -- any payer that's going to want to convert in any significant way to a biosimilar, they're going to want confidence that they can have a reliability of supply of that biosimilar and we've spent years building the network that we have. We have full redundancy of every aspect of the manufacturing process on Humira. And we've never had a problem supplying the U.S. market. So, I think we can be viewed as kind of the gold standard. So, those are the variables that are going to impact what this transition looks like. The guidance we've given so far is this 45%, plus or minus 10%. I think at this point, that's still the best information that we can provide. Later this year, I think some of these variables will be clearer to it. And we may be in a position to be able to provide some more information to investors, and we would do that. Some will not. Pricing will not be clear at that point. We're not going to know how they're going to price until we actually get into -- they actually get into the marketplace. So, I think that's the way to think about these variables.

I would just add that we've been trying to give investors some directional guidance on how to think about 2023 beyond just the Humira, 45% plus or minus 10%. We've talked about Aesthetics growing high single digits annually over the next decade. You can get a sense based on Jeff's response today and the way to think about Imbruvica. In terms of operating margin, I've talked about that pulling back to the 46% to 47% range with no cuts to investment because we're going to return to growth very quickly. So, we're going to continue to invest in this business. And as I look at Street consensus, I see modeling of cuts in SG&A not necessarily reflecting the appropriate operating margin levels. So, it's something just to keep in mind. And then even -- we've talked about the tax rate growing one point per year on average. Obviously, you saw this year, it only grew 0.2 points. Other years, it may go higher. So, we've tried to give the Street some ideas of the way to think about 2023 model in advance of our formal guidance.",193.0,92.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010869565217391304,0.0,0.0,0.0

So, we recently reported data from the expansion cohort of relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients. We reported an overall response rate of 63% with a median duration of response of 12 months. One thing that's really important to bear in mind is that this is a pretty refractory patient population with a median number of prior therapies of 3.5 in a range up to 11 in at the upper end. And importantly, just under 40% of these patients have failed prior therapy with the CAR-T. Overall, the safety profile remains manageable with the vast majority of the cases of CRS at class effect with these agents being Grade 1 and 2. To directly address your question, we are not yet ready to reveal additional detail about the data. They will be revealed at a forthcoming medical meeting.

I mentioned that we see roughly in the mid-teens now after about three months, which we're very pleased in and some more flavor on that. If you think about the HCPs and the doctors that prescribe in the US now, you've got about 9, 000. Those are the dermatologists and some allergists. There's about 3,000 of those physicians that are the big prescribers. They're very productive. Those 3,000 are the ones that are driving Skyrizi, for example, or other big brands in psoriasis.  So we see, after just about three months, we see almost 1,000 doctors that have prescribed Rinvoq. And so that's driving that 15%. Some of it depends in terms of where the in-play share ends up, how many of the competitors come in. We're not really sure that baricitinib will come into the market. We'll have to see. We haven't seen much Pfizer activity yet. To give you some sort of international perspective in the Canadian market, we're seeing where there's really just Dupi and Rinvoq at this point after a couple of quarters, we're seeing a 30% in-play share in Canada.  So we are, as I mentioned, very, very encouraged with the early adoption. In particular, my comment around, how fast once you see the first prescription take place with some of those productive doctors, how fast they go to the second or third. To give you some flavor of what we see in the US, and again, the data is early, we see, as expected, the majority of our use so far in that dynamic market are not switches necessarily. We see about, let's say, 1/3, believe it or not, that are not even exposed to Dupi. And the doctors are saying, look, I've already given another oral systemic, for example, but the itch and the skin is so severe that they're going to go -- I'm going to go right and get the relief with Rinvoq.  And then maybe the other two-third, you see Dupi partial responders, particularly related to the itch, just isn't suppressed as much, and they still have some skin involvement. Or there is, as we've highlighted before, a warehouse of Dupi non-responders that has been built up over the last four years. So that's the behavior that we see. Again, I'm very encouraged on the early results, not just in the US but around the world. Rinvoq is going to be a real player in this underserved market.",435.0,170.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.01764705882352941,0.01764705882352941,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.0058823529411764705,0.0

Two questions. First on epcoritamab, the data looks great. Could this molecule immediately start taking share from CAR-T, or do you think physicians will want to see durability data before selecting a bispecific ahead of a cell therapy? So that's the first question. The second question is, I'm trying to sift through the answer to the Humira question just a moment ago. On the one hand, it seems we need to consider that Humira could be more resilient in 2023 than expected. On the other hand, the Street needs to raise spending assumptions.

The fact that we saw such remarkable activity in a patient population that had failed CAR-T does not imply that the medicine should be positioned after failure of CAR-T. I think they are two very different classes of medicines, as you know. CAR-T has significant challenges with respect to the need for -- to be prior to administration. Whereas the safety profile with epcoritamab is extremely manageable. And again, I don't want to repeat what I said earlier on around CRS. So, overall, we see a very strong benefit risk profile emerging for the medicine. And therefore, our intention is to move the medicine into earlier lines of therapy initially gain an approval with respect to -- gain approval in refractory DLBCL and after that move the medicine into earlier lines of therapy.",148.0,68.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04411764705882353,0.058823529411764705,0.014705882352941176,0.014705882352941176,0.0,-0.014705882352941176

Yes, look, I think it's a great question, and we've gotten that question a lot. What's the erosion going to be in 2023? And is it going to be lighter in 2023 and therefore, spill more into 2024. And I think that's a reasonable question to start to think through. I'd say as I step back and look at it, I would tell you this. Look, at the end of the day, it could be lighter in 2023. That would force more of it out into 2024. If I look at the business, that's a good thing. We give us higher cash flows in 2023 than what we would be projecting now. Ultimately, I think there will be a settling out between 2023 and 2024. We'll still get to the levels that we have described or at least that we are modeling. And I think the important thing is, look, Humira is going to play out over these two-year period of time. What's important to AbbVie, though, is what's that underlying growth that's driving the business and is going to sustain the growth on the other side of the LOE. That's the critical aspect of it. The Skyrizi, the Rinvoqs, our Neuroscience pipeline, Aesthetics, it's all of those major growth drivers that we have because that growth is going to be suppressed in 2023 and somewhat maybe in 2024. But as soon as that pressure is off, that's when it reemerge and be able to deliver growth on the other side of it. And so what we're focused on is, obviously, we're going to try to manage the 2023-2024 dynamic to the extent that we're able to. But that's not the most critical part for the business.

So the way that we see the market for the other ILs, I do think that there will be a segment of conservative dermatologists that will attempt to sequence. And I think that largely that they'll be disappointed because it seems the newer agents are very, very difficult to distinguish from Dupixent. I think certainly, there could be market access dynamics that start to appear with subsequent ILs, I think that's something that we will watch and you would want to watch.  I think what's, again, maybe not appreciated as we watch the early quarters of performance in Europe and the first quarter of performance here in the US, is that there's significant amount of early adopters and dermatologists that will go right to a JAK inhibitor, as I mentioned. They're not always sequencing through Dupi. And it's because the severity of some of these patients and the level of the clinical involvement is very, very significant.  And so, we do see what you would call a significant amount of naive use based on the profile of the JAK inhibitor. Now these are early adopters. These are people that have already contemplated the risk benefit and I think that's important. And so, the way that we see the market developing is that, when physicians would start with Dupi, which will be in a significant proportion of patients, it's not clear at all that their next step will be another IL that has been approved or will be approved.  In fact, we think it's more likely that they will move towards the best JAK that can get to these high levels of skin clearance, the EZ 90 plus almost no perceived itch. And I think that's the endpoint that this market is going to move towards and Rinvoq is the drug that clearly can deliver on that promise. And so that's how we see the market developing, and that's why we remain encouraged on the early results around the world from what we're seeing with the agent.",355.0,145.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,0.013793103448275862,0.027586206896551724,0.041379310344827586,0.0,0.0,-0.013793103448275862

First one for me is just can you elaborate a bit more on Rinvoq coverage, both in AD and UC. I guess just trying to get a sense of where we are today and what's the outlook for the next few quarters? And maybe as part of that, it seems like you're seeing some nice uptake in your BRIDGE programs. Can you just comment when you expect we should start to think about those translating over to third-party Rxs and that would be maybe more visible to the outside world in terms of how that uptick you're seeing? And then my second question was just on Q1 itself. Were there any notable either payer adjustments or gross to net issues? I guess Humira, for example, it seems like the low single-digit growth was a departure from recent trends. I'm just trying understand a little bit better what happened in the quarter.

So, with your first question is -- we're very confident that we are going to get to high levels of paid access for Rinvoq and Skyrizi's new indications. So, typically, what we'll see based on the approval timeline, we'll be ramping up into the -- by the middle of the year up in the high 90s in terms of our access -- for commercial access. So, I think that everyone should be confident that, that's where you're going to start to see this bridge program start to fully convert as the months go by into the paid prescription. So, typically, that's the timing we're looking at. You're going to see very strong momentum on paid access by -- towards the end of next quarter is what we've guided towards. So, that's the answer to your first question. I think if you think about -- and maybe just to frame the Humira question. The Humira fundamentals are -- and the market fundamentals are quite strong. You see the markets are performing nicely. Our market share growth trends, we haven't seen any trend shift. They've been largely stable. There's some sequential decline based on the size of the market and actually our own brand, Skyrizi and Rinvoq that are playing very strongly into these markets. What I would say is that, in some cases, Q1 can be quite unique over the years. You've got the issue with the plans resetting their deductibles, you've got issues with doctors that have to put in another prior authorization for the year. And so you do see some co-pay and sort of deductible dynamic. But we think that's really a first quarter type of event, and it's largely been very consistent with what we expected.

So, as we highlighted and Tom highlighted, the NDA has been accepted, and we're confident in the approval. I think what we said in the past is that just with the base indication. So, before we get that approval, I mean, the FDA has to still approve it towards the end of the year. We believe that we can ramp towards a $4 billion opportunity. So, that would mean our share just in the base indications of a unique profile with the mania, the mix manian depression, the bipolar depression, we moved somewhere up sort of doubling our share penetration. So right now, we're at about 2.7% TRx share. So we we'd really get close to doubling that based on the momentum.  And then MDD would build on top of that. And so it's significant. I mean, the physicians that we've talked to when we show them the profile are very pleased. First, they know Vraylar, they like Vraylar, they like the strong efficacy, they highlight nonsedating, they highlight at least verbally a brightening effect of the agent, minimal weight gain, metabolic effects. And so as they think about that, how that would translate to adjunctive MDD, they like that profile. The other piece that we hear is they like the starting dose. They like that starting dose of the 1.5 milligram dose, which is what we believe that ultimately will be approved. We'll have to see. So easy to start, easy to take, well tolerated. And so to your point, we believe that MDD will offer some upside and acceleration to the brand's momentum when we achieve it. A – Liz Shea: Thanks Chris.

So, the Ubrelvy scripts from a legacy publicly out third-party data, it looks like the gross to net – some net pricing is back to where we were in 1Q '21. And just trying to understand if this is just a seasonality of things or 4Q to 1Q dynamic or maybe there might be something broader where net pricing for these products is going down.  And then tied to that, with Qulipta, as you mentioned, look, the prescription numbers are pretty good as it builds up here. I'm curious now that you have sort of two products in that market, does that impact how you're thinking about the opportunity, especially from a pricing side or sort of payer negotiation side?

If you look at year-over-year, you'd see that in Q4, as you mentioned, Q1 year-over-year is relatively flat. I would think about it that way for the full year as well. So, you do tend to see a suppression in Q1 because of plans resetting that dynamic we see in the US market. But then over the course of the rest of the year, you do see higher pricing.

I mean, actually, since we launched Qulipta, Ubrelvy has accelerated. So, we have to -- because we can't see the competitor because you can see the whole thing. But when we factor Nurtec by 8 versus 16, and we try to understand the acute dynamic, we can see that we're clearly the market-leading acute CGRP and that's nice to see. The physicians really like Ubrelvy, the markets are robust. I think what you're seeing is what Rob highlighted in terms of the overall performance. I didn't really fully appreciate your second question in terms of the access. I can give you a broad overview. Obviously, we're seeing great momentum with the brand. Much of the brand is still because the access is ramping is still bridged, just like we discussed there with the immunology agent.  So we think, again, by the middle of the year, we're going to see commercial access really start to ramp, and you'll see the conversion start to take place. What's nice is that we're confident in that. We think that our price points and net price or negotiations are going well. And because of its unique profile, as an agent, basically, the strength of the drug is really significant in terms of its performance against episodic migraine. We feel like we're in good shape.

Well, one, we didn't think that, that would happen wide scale as the market develops anyway. But even if it did, our label is already behind a TNF.

Can you talk more broadly about how you see the expansion of Rinvoq and Skyrizi into the IBD indication? So how is the initial launch for Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis going? I know it's early days, but what's the outlook there given physician receptivity around the product? Are physicians saying they're excited to have Rinvoq for Crohn's as well? And also, how do you see Skyrizi fitting in with Crohn's versus Rinvoq?

So we are very, very encouraged by the IBD momentum that we can build. And we're right on the cusp of it. And to give some sense is basically this market -- the market of Crohn's and you see that – it actually has fairly high biologic penetration.  When we do our research and our engagement with the physicians, what they typically have done for more than a decade since the availability of Remicade and then Humira, they really hang on as much as possible to their first-line use. They try to intensify, they do all sorts of things because it's quite scary for the physicians and the patients because no one set a different standard of care. So when you start to look at the healing rates that we start to see with Rinvoq in UC, the healing of the bowel, the remission rate, the combination of what we can see, this market looks very, very good to have both of those assets come in with higher standards of care. So we're very, very encouraged and we think that the IBD market is probably underappreciated in terms of what that looks like. And the patients are so challenged with their disease because it's quite severe with the bowel preparations, the hospitalizations, all of these things, having two assets is a great thing to bring to the market. Certainly, in the US, it's likely we see that with UC today that you're going to have later line use based on the labeling.  Skyrizi is not going to have that limitation. So, you can imagine that you have an ability to co-position to sequence appropriately to think about how you bring that whole portfolio around the world and that's how we see it. We're quite encouraged that we would have both Rinvoq for Crohn's and Rinvoq for Skyrizi in the market. And it's kind of very similar to my comments I made on what's happening with PSA today in rheumatology, where both of those assets Rinvoq for PSA and Skyrizi PSA are in the market together working as a portfolio. To get to your first point, it's been only a month or so with our UC launch, but the physicians, gastros are very encouraged with the profile. They've not seen the level of remission or the level of healing before in any asset. So, there's quite a wow reaction to the efficacy profile. They realize that they have to think about, I've got to think through my patients that are not doing well on TNF or have cycled through a TNF and are struggling. And I mentioned that's a pretty large addressable population. It's at least 50% of the market today. So early qualitative results are quite strong. And the BRIDGE results are also quite strong.

And in Q1, we did see US toxin and filler markets, both growing in the mid-20s percent. And we expect that sort of growth to continue for the rest of 2022.  And the way to think about it is similar amount of absolute volume growth as 2021, but of course, off of a larger base. And in terms of what's driving that market growth, we're seeing very strong demand trends supported by our increased commercial investments, for example, increased consumer activation for acquisition and retention, field force expansions in key markets. And we see these trends also supported just by fundamentals and aesthetics that will continue in the long-term. People think about aesthetics more like health and wellness. It's been much more destigmatized, and we see factors like social media and word of mouth continuing to drive aesthetics in the future. Your question around the pandemic, I would say that we are seeing an impact right now in China, and we anticipate that this recent surge of COVID cases in China which has resulted in lockdowns across several major cities, has reduced patient traffic into aesthetic offices in China. And China is a top market for aesthetics. So, we expect this to impact our near-term international performance for both toxins and fillers. I should also mention that Russia is a key market for fillers globally. And as the tragic events in the Ukraine have unfolded, we have suspended operations for our Aesthetics business in Russia. So, although absolute aesthetic sales in Russia are modest, like I said, Russia is among one of the largest filler markets in the world. So, we expect to see an impact on our filler performance in coming quarters. But despite these dynamics, we do not need to change our total guidance for Aesthetics.

Again, it is our intent when we have data that are these strong to continue to engage with the agency on those programs to explore potential costs to accelerated approval.

So the BRIDGE transition will be very efficient. So, what I mean by that is because of the connections that we have with the payers and our specialty pharmacy network, we're able to – once access is achieved rapidly and appropriately transition patients from the BRIDGE to basically their paid pharmacy in their prescription.  So, there's not going to be lingering bridge effects, particularly in the immunology space. So, once it starts to move and that access ramps, the BRIDGE transition is quite fast. And that can be within weeks or a month. And we know that that's the case because we have the model from our earlier launches from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So ultimately, once you start to achieve those high levels of access, BRIDGE programs drop very, very fast, and the vast majority, the very vast majority is paid prescriptions. So it's very efficient, and I hope that helps.",169.0,70.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.02857142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04285714285714286

I’ll briefly comment on our overall performance. Then Jeff, Tom, and Rob will review our second quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.37, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenues of approximately $14.6 billion was up 6.1% on an operational basis, in line with our expectations. This performance reflects robust double-digit operational sales growth from immunology, where Skyrizi is exceeding our expectations with impressive market share gains in both psoriasis and PSA. Skyrizi’s recent U.S. approval in Crohn’s disease will add yet another source of long-term growth. As a result of the strong performance we’ve seen in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for Skyrizi. Rinvoq is also demonstrating strong growth. RA continues to perform in line with our expectations, following the label update, and we’re making very good progress with all of the newly launched indications, including PSA, AS, atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis, which collectively represent a significant long-term growth opportunity. Neuroscience is another area with outstanding performance Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic and Ubrelvy and Qulipta each demonstrated double-digit sequential sales growth. Pending regulatory approvals for Vraylar in major depressive disorder, Qulipta in chronic migraine and 951 for the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease represent additional near-term growth opportunities for our neuroscience portfolio. Turning now to aesthetics, Botox Cosmetics once again performed very well with sales up more than 20% on an operational basis. Demand for toxins remains strong with high teens growth in the U.S., despite inflation dynamics. As expected, Juvederm performance was negatively impacted by COVID-related lockdowns in China, as well as the suspension of our operations in Russia. Additionally, in the U.S., we had a difficult prior year comparison with a promotional event that we ran last year. We also saw a modest impact in the quarter due to economic pressures. We continue to expect positive full year growth for Juvederm driven by the lessening COVID impact in China and two new filler launches in the U.S. which will benefit growth in the second half of the year. In hematological oncology, Imbruvica continues to be unfavorably impacted by a delayed market recovery for new patients starting therapy in CLL and increasing competition. These ongoing dynamics will have an impact on Imbruvica’s projected 2022 revenues. As a result, we will be adjusting our full-year guidance to reflect these impacts. Venclexta to continues to demonstrate robust share performance in both CLL and AML, with sales up double digits on an operational basis. Venclexta also has registrational studies ongoing in additional attractive indication, such as multiple myeloma in the t(11;14) patient population with Phase 3 data forthcoming, as well as high risk MDS. Additionally, we have an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies to address critical unmet needs in both, blood cancers and solid tumors, which are expected to support the next wave of AbbVie’s growth in oncology. In summary, the diversity of our portfolio, once again allowed us to deliver another strong performance, despite the challenges we see in the CLL market and increasing Imbruvica competition. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are performing exceptionally well and are on pace to deliver approximately $7.5 billion in combined sales this year. Neuroscience demonstrated balanced double-digit growth driven by migraine and Vraylar and continued robust Botox cosmetic growth offset some of the U.S. inflationary impact to our filler and body contouring portfolios. As a result, we are confirming our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $13.78 to $13.98, representing growth of more than 17% at the midpoint. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on commercial highlights.

I’m very pleased with the momentum across our therapeutic portfolio, including the continued progress we’re making with new product and recent indication launches. I’ll start with our immunology portfolio, which delivered total revenues of $7.2 billion, reflecting growth of 19.2% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were approximately $5.4 billion, up 6.8% on an operational basis with 9.6% growth in the U.S., partially offset by international performance where revenues were down 7.3% operationally due to biosimilar competition. Skyrizi is performing extremely well, well ahead of our expectations. Global revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 33% on a sequential basis. We continue to advance our leadership position in psoriasis where Skyrizi’s total prescription share of the U.S. biological market has increased to approximately 26%, driven by an in-play share of new and switching patients that is now approaching 50%. We have also achieved in-play market share leadership in 23 key international markets, including Japan, Germany, France, Canada, and Australia.  Psoriatic arthritis is also adding significantly to Skyrizi’s momentum, where we are now approved in 54 countries. In the U.S. dermatology segment, where approximately 30% of patients exhibit both skin and joint involvement, Skyrizi is already achieving an in-play patient share of nearly 20%. We have also launched Skyrizi for PSA in rheumatology, where we’re seeing strong utilization, which is driving accelerated share growth. Our recent launch of Skyrizi for Crohn’s disease in the U.S. represents the first new biologic approval in six years for an area where there continues to be considerable unmet need. We believe Skyrizi represents a highly effective and differentiated treatment option for Crohn’s patients, including the potential to provide meaningful levels of endoscopic improvement with novel and infrequent dosing. Managed care access is expected to ramp strongly for this indication in the coming months. Turning now to Rinvoq, where we’re seeing good momentum across each of the approved indications. Global sales of $592 million were up more than 27% on a sequential basis. Prescriptions in RA remained strong with a total market share of 5.8% in the U.S. and approximately 6% across key international markets. Rinvoq is now achieving an in-play RA share of approximately 13% in the U.S. In PSA, Rinvoq continues to see nice uptake, especially in the room segment with commercial access now equal to RA. We also recently received FDA approval for ankylosing spondylitis and European approval for non-radiographic Axial SpA, further expanding Rinvoq’s potential across rheumatology. In atopic dermatitis, new patient starts are tracking in line with our expectations with Rinvoq’s in-play patient share in the mid-teens. Strong commercial access in AD, which is also now equal to RA and PSA, is expected to considerably increase paid prescription volume in this highly underpenetrated market over the remainder of the year. Lastly, our recent launch of Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis in the U.S. is progressing well. And we recently just received European approval for the same indication. Commercial access in the U.S. is ramping strongly, and we are seeing encouraging new patient starts. Physician feedback regarding Rinvoq’s approved profile in UC has been favorable, especially given the very high rates of remission and endoscopic improvement demonstrated across our UC development program. The addressable patient population for Rinvoq in UC is substantial, with nearly 50% of patients currently on or having used TNF therapy. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.65 billion, down 7.9% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 17.1% and below our expectations. The CLO market continues to remain challenging in the U.S. with new patient starts down double digits relative to pre-pandemic levels. Now, as you may recall, our initial 2022 Imbruvica sales guidance contemplated a partial market recovery, which, unfortunately, we have not yet observed. In fact, the latest data reflects new patient starts in the U.S. were actually down high single digits versus last year. So, based on recent trends, we no longer believe it’s prudent to anticipate a meaningful market recovery in CLL over the second half of this year. Therefore, we will be removing this assumption from our 2022 guidance. In addition, increasing competition from newer therapies, including other BTK inhibitors as well as our own Venclexta also continue to lower Imbruvica’s share of new patient starts, especially in frontline CLL. Despite this increasing competitive pressure, Imbruvica continues to be the total market share leader across all lines of therapy in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $505 million, up 21.2% on an operational basis. In CLL, we continue to see share gains in the U.S. and across all major international markets. We’re also seeing continued strong performance in AML. Venclexta is now approved in 80 countries and in many markets is already considered the new standard of care for frontline AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. As a result, we are seeing ramping market share throughout the countries where we have launched. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.6 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of $492 million were up 13.9% on an operational basis, reflecting continued share gains in the U.S. atypical antipsychotic market. Our launch preparations remain well underway in anticipation of our MDD approval in the fourth quarter. This is a potentially large indication that would represent incremental upside to our current projections for Vraylar. Within migraine, Ubrelvy remains the market-leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine with revenue of $185 million, up 34% on a sequential basis. Qulipta continues to increase its leading new-to-brand share in the U.S. preventative CGRP class when we consider both, paid and bridge volume. We continue to make good progress with expanded commercial access, which will support strong Qulipta sales growth over the remainder of this year. We are also pursuing the commercial approval for Qulipta as a preventative treatment in patients with chronic migraine in the U.S. as well as a new therapy for Europe, potentially further strengthening our competitive product profile and long-term growth opportunity. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well in chronic migraine as well as its other indications with total sales of $678 million, up 14.5% on an operational basis. So overall, I’m pleased with the commercial execution across the therapeutic business. Our broad portfolio of differentiated therapies and new launches is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D programs.

I’ll start with immunology where we had several notable pipeline updates in our inflammatory bowel disease programs for both, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We recently received FDA approval for Skyrizi in Crohn’s disease, and we’re very pleased with the label which reflects a strong benefit risk profile that Skyrizi demonstrated as an induction and maintenance treatment for this condition. Based on its profile, we believe Skyrizi will be a highly effective and differentiated treatment option for patients with Crohn’s disease. Our regulatory application for Skyrizi in Crohn’s disease remains under review in Europe with an approval decision expected near the end of this year. Also in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we recently received European approval for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis. And we’re excited to bring this new, highly efficacious oral option to patients suffering from this often debilitating disease. In the quarter, we also completed a registrational program for Rinvoq in Crohn’s disease, reporting positive top line results from our Phase 3 maintenance study. We recently submitted our regulatory applications for Rinvoq in this indication and expect approval decisions next year. Once approved for Crohn’s disease, Rinvoq will have completed development programs for all the major rheum and gastro indications covered by Humira plus atopic dermatitis. The strength of the data generated in our clinical programs should position Rinvoq as a highly differentiated treatment across this broad indication set and enable Rinvoq to deliver significant value to AbbVie over the long term. And just this morning, we announced that we received European approval for Rinvoq in non-radiographic Axial SpA, which rounds out Rinvoq’s label in rheumatology. Moving now to our oncology portfolio, where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our pipeline. At the recent EHA meeting, we presented results from the large B-cell lymphoma expansion cohort in the Phase 2 study evaluating epcoritamab in patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy. In this study, epcoritamab was well tolerated and drove very deep and durable responses in challenging to treat highly refractory patients with large B-cell lymphoma. We recently discussed these results with regulatory agencies and based on the strength of the data, we intend to submit regulatory applications later this year for accelerated approval of epcoritamab in patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma. We expect approval decisions in 2023. We continue to make good progress with the indication expansion programs for Venclexta and remain on track to see results from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation in the second half of this year. As a reminder, we’ve seen very promising results in this population in prior clinical studies with Venclexta showing high overall response rates and meaningful trends towards prolonged progression-free survival. The level of efficacy we’ve seen suggests that t(11;14) patients may be particularly responsive to Venclexta and this agent has the potential to become an important biomarker-driven treatment option in the multiple myeloma market. In neuroscience, following successful completion of our Phase 3 chronic migraine prevention study, we submitted our regulatory application to the FDA for Qulipta in chronic migraine. Chronic migraine is defined as 15 or more headache days per month with at least 8 of those days associated with migraines. This is a debilitating disease that affects nearly 10% of people suffering from migraine, significantly impacting their quality of life. If approved, this would be another differentiating feature for Qulipta as it would be the only oral CGRP approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. We also submitted data from our Phase 3 prevention studies in both, chronic and episodic migraine to support regulatory applications in markets outside the U.S. We expect approval decisions in the U.S. and in Europe in 2023. In the quarter, we submitted our regulatory application in the U.S. for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease. This innovative delivery system has the potential to become a transformative treatment option for patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease by providing DUOPA-like efficacy with less invasive nonsurgical administration. We also expect to submit our regulatory application in Europe later this year with approval decisions anticipated in both, the U.S. and Europe in 2023. Now, I’d like to provide a few updates on some earlier-stage programs where we have new data and are advancing programs in development. In immunology, we recently obtained encouraging data in a Phase 2 study evaluating Rinvoq in systemic lupus, an autoimmune multisystem disease. In our study, Rinvoq demonstrated greater response rates as well as a reduction in flares compared with placebo. We’ll see longer-term data in the coming months, which will allow us to make a decision on moving Rinvoq into Phase 3 for lupus. In oncology, where we have a pipeline of promising early-stage programs aimed at solid tumors, we are beginning to see very exciting data from several programs. Our anti-GARP antibody, ABBV-151 is designed to block the immunosuppressive activity of regulatory T cells, which leads to increased T cell effector functions in the tumor microenvironment. This reactivates the immune system against tumors, enhancing the antitumor immune response triggered by a PD-1 inhibitor. In our Phase 1 program, we’re combining 151 with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in cancer patients who are refractory to or relapsed after PD-1 as well as evaluating this combination in PD-1 nonresponsive tumors. Based on the preliminary efficacy we’ve seen in the dose expansion cohorts for multiple solid tumors, including a deepening of responses over time and prolonged durability, we recently declared proof-of-concept for 151. We plan to advance to Phase 2 in several solid tumors, starting with urothelial cancer. We’re also expecting additional data readouts later this year in other solid tumor indications, including colorectal cancer, which may enable further expansion studies in this hard-to-treat cancer type. We will also begin new studies to explore a broader set of solid tumors where GARP is implicated as a critical immunosuppressive pathway, based on tumor tissue analyses. We’re also making excellent progress with our next-generation c-Met ABBV-400, where the emerging clinical data is very promising in several solid tumors. This asset is similar to Teliso-V as c-MET ADC that uses a microtubulin inhibitor payload. Teliso-V received breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of patients with a subtype of lung cancer with high levels of c-Met overexpression. The toxin warhead for 400 uses a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload, which is similar to irinotecan, a chemotherapy that is used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. By targeting c-MET positive tumors with ADCs bearing different warheads we believe we can broaden the range of solid tumors where c-MET therapies can be used. In our Phase 1 program, we are seeing good responses in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and remain encouraged by these early efficacy signals. So in summary, we’ve seen tremendous progress across all stages of our pipeline in the first half of the year, and we remain on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2022. So, with that, I’ll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance and financial outlook.

AbbVie’s second quarter results demonstrate the strength of our diversified portfolio. Momentum from new products and recently launched indications allows us to maintain our earnings outlook despite market dynamics for Imbruvica, higher inflation and the stronger U.S. dollar. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.37, reflecting growth of 11.2% compared to prior year and $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.14 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $14.6 billion, up 6.1% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51% of sales, an improvement of 220 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.8% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 20.8% of sales. Net interest expense was $532 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 13.4%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are confirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance between $13.78 and $13.98. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $58.9 billion, reflecting growth of 6.5% on an operational basis. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.7% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following updated assumptions. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $4.8 billion, an increase of $400 million due to strong market share performance. For Imbruvica, we now expect global revenue of approximately $4.7 billion, given the lack of recovery in the CLL market and increasing competition. Moving to the P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales and continue to forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of 51.8% of sales. Turning to the third quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 2.1% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.55 and $3.59. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, we delivered strong performance again this quarter, including meaningful contributions from new products and recently launched indications.

I’ll cover the first one, and then Tom can cover the second one. So, we are in the process now, as we’ve indicated before, of negotiating with the managed care organizations and the PBMs to establish our contract position for Humira in 2023. This is a normal time that you would go through that. It is progressing as we would expect. I would say we’re midway through that process right now. I would expect it to conclude near the end of the third quarter, early the fourth quarter. At that point, that’s an important part of refining our model for 2023 in particular. And what that will tell us is that the positions that we have formulary status for 2023 in for Humira, and that will help us define clearly the volume aspect of it. And so, that’s going well, and that’s going to be an important part of us being able to refine that model. And so, as we get further along in that process, that will give us the ability to be able to potentially refine the model that we have. Now, the one thing that’s important to remember in all of this is price is the other key aspect here. And there, we won’t know real pricing until the actual event starts to occur. So, we will make assumptions around what that price looks like. And I think those will be informed assumptions, but they are just that they’re assumptions. And so, that’s the one piece that will still be somewhat of an unknown until we see the landscape start to play out in 2023, and particularly in midway through 2023 when more biosimilars enter the market. So, as we get more information and we can provide more clarity, we’ll certainly try to do that, but I think that’s where we are right now.

Andrew, I’ll try to break down the question in different parts because you’re right, there are many TGF-beta assets. This one is unique, GARP. Most of the TGF-beta assets work either antibodies against receptors to be active for TGF-beta or TGF-beta itself that’s in circulation on cells. But GARP blocks the inactive form of TGF-beta before it’s released from TGF-beta. And we believe that actually is a differentiated mechanism, also allows that specificity to what’s happening in TGF-beta in the tumor as opposed to other systems in the body. At the beginning of this, we thought -- we had already had people that published that they are very good TGF-beta signatures that exist. And I can tell you that GARP signature follows tracks with TGF-beta signatures. And that’s often seen in all solid tumors as susceptive tumors that express these pathways. It’s a very common immunosuppressive mechanism. That’s why people and us are interested in it. We learned -- initially, from data, we kind of suspected that people who actually had a nice hot tumors but were not responding to PD-1, often had, at least from published work -- actually had a higher TGF-beta signature. So, we thought that was a reason to mechanism why these patients with hot tumors were not responding. And a lot of our initial clinical strategy there was actually to go after hot tumors where PD-1s had relapsed or refractory. And we thought we could augment the PD-1 checkpoint response by doing this combination. We did not see monotherapy activity, but in combination, we did. And that’s why our first data sets and expansions like I’ve just discussed in urothelial cancer, this project started earlier, we’re seeing data that’s suggesting that this is correct that you need to reflect both the pathway of TGF-beta and PD-1, to get a response. And those, again, in multiple tumor types we’re seeing these responses and we’re moving forward. At the same time, to bring it to colon, we could also see the same signatures of TGF-beta and GARP in cold tumors, but we weren’t sure that since they’re not IO responsive, whether we’d get a response, we would get a clinical response. So, we did start some investigations. And yes, we did see some responses in cold tumors. They happen over time, sometimes they appear, the tumors are stable for 3 months, maybe 6 months, and then you see these responses appear. They’re very durable, 1 year, 2 year, very unusual. These are patients with advanced disease that have very poor prognosis in Phase 1 studies. So, we saw some, I would say -- we sometimes say in academic column exceptional responders. And so, we decided to expand. So, those data sets are newer, are happening right now. I probably will have the data at the end of this year. But yes, we’ve seen responses to this combination. And to answer your question, so the signatures we’re looking at are not the CMS or kind of histology-based signatures on the tumor. It’s more signatures of the inflammatory response that we can measure in the tumor, and it has to do with both, inflammatory T cells, which are there for the killing, but also the inhibitory TGF-beta signatures. And of course, we’re going to continue to investigate this. I don’t have all the answers for you today, but it certainly has been exciting to see how this program has evolved.",602.0,260.0,4.0,9.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.03461538461538462,0.04230769230769231,0.0,0.0,-0.019230769230769232

Just wanted to make sure that you are maintaining your 2022 aesthetics guidance of $5.9 billion. Rob, I didn’t hear you call it out, so I’m assuming that was a reiteration, just given what you’re seeing with Juvederm in the U.S. And then the second question I had relates more of a, I guess, strategic one, Rick. I know you’re still going through the conversations with 2023 for Humira. But, as you think about providing an update to guidance, whether that happens with the 3Q results or with the 4Q results, do you think you’ll be able to provide some outlook on 2024 because I think something investors are discussing now is just if the possibility of the impact is more in ‘24, how we should think about revenue margins in ‘24 versus ‘23. So, just wondering strategically how you’re thinking about that at this point, not asking for guidance, more just thought process.",158.0,60.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.016666666666666666,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0

So, Terence, I’ll take both of those questions, and then Rob can certainly jump in here if he has something he wants to add. We are maintaining the aesthetic guidance as we’ve indicated. Certainly, we have seen good, strong performance on the toxin side of the business, and we would expect it to continue. As we look at the filler side of the business, as you’ve noted, it was lighter this quarter than we’ve seen historically. And I’d say that was driven by a couple of issues. It was certainly driven by the China- Russia issue outside the U.S. In the U.S., we did have a very successful promotional program that we ran last year. So, it was a tough comparison versus last year. But I’d also say, we have seen some glimpses of what could be inflationary pressure on that business or it could be pent-up demand for vacations. And Carrie can certainly go through more detail if there’s a follow-up question. But I think as we look at the business overall, we’re comfortable maintaining the guidance now. We believe that Botox will continue to perform very well. And obviously, we’re doing more things to be able to drive the toxin side of the business. It’s at a price point where it should be less sensitive to inflationary pressures. The price point for toxin is about $500, I think, right, Gary? And where fillers are almost twice that or maybe even a little more than twice that. So clearly, from a disposable income standpoint, fillers are more challenging for people than toxins are. And so that’s the rationale behind it. And certainly, as we look at the overall performance of the AbbVie business, we have plenty of opportunities with the diversity of our portfolio to cover any potential shortfall if we ended up having an issue. So, that’s why we’re comfortable maintaining the guidance. And I think we need to see more time play out here to see exactly where we are from a U.S. inflationary impact. On the second question, as it relates to an update on ‘23 and potentially something on ‘24. I think the way you’ve described it is accurate. When we have more information, we’ll try to provide that. And when we’ve gotten to a point that certainly by the fourth quarter call, we’re going to provide you guidance on what we think will happen in 2023. But if we can provide something on the third quarter call, I wouldn’t be looking for guidance. I think that’s not a good expectation. But certainly, potentially a little more clarification on what our contracting status looks like at that point and how that will translate into what we think. And if we can refine the model to a greater degree, we would certainly provide that. As it relates to 2024, certainly, I’m not going to -- we’re not in a position we’re going to talk about 2024 right now. And I think that would be a little bit unlikely because not all these contracts will be two-year contracts. And so, you really won’t know what your volume position is at that point. And as I said, you won’t know what the pricing is going to be, particularly midway through the year. And so, I think those will be important things to be able to dial in to where the forecast is going. I’d say, overall, we feel good about the contracting position that we’re in. And then, I’d say, the other thing is, I know investors really want to try to model this between ‘23 and ‘24. I understand why you want to do that. Certainly, we obviously would like to do that to the greatest degree possible. But, when you step back and you actually look at the performance of AbbVie and how you will value AbbVie and what AbbVie means going forward, it has relatively little to do with Humira, and that shape of that curve between ‘23 and ‘24. And certainly, by the end of ‘24, we should reach a point where we’ve achieved some level of stability on the tail of Humira. What AbbVie is all about is these other products like Skyrizi and Rinvoq and Vraylar and Ubrelvy, the aesthetics business, Qulipta. Those are going to be the things that drive it. So, if you want to focus on something and it’s what we focus on internally is that underlying growth engine that will emerge on the other side of whatever erosion Humira ends up suffering before it hit some level of stability and tail is those assets and then what comes out of the pipeline. Those are the key things that are going to create that growth between 25% and 30%. And that’s the part that we -- I would say, we’re obviously managing Humira to the greatest extent we can. But that’s the part that we as a team are focusing on. And I think that’s the most important part because that is the AbbVie going forward.",862.0,338.0,13.0,7.0,7.0,5.0,0.0,8.0,5.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.020710059171597635,0.020710059171597635,0.014792899408284023,0.0,0.01775147928994083

So, you said that pricing from the competition will be key unknown for next year. As you get into contracts this year, for the next year, how rigid or flexible these contracts are from the pricing point of view when PBMs realize that the biosimilar is giving an X or Y pricing, or would that be more of a 2024 issue rather than 2023?

So, Jeff, if you want to add anything in, feel free to jump in and add. Typically, when you contract for an asset like Humira, you’re contracting for a formulary position. And there aren’t volume requirements or other kinds of requirements. I think it’s also -- it would be prudent to assume that biosimilars will be on these contracts, whether it’s one or more than one that will coexist with Humira. So, price plays an important role in that because they will coexist. And so, I’d say -- and as that becomes fluid, you would have to make decisions around how you try to deal with that to maintain the kinds of volumes that you want to maintain. And we’ve said all along, the strategy that we’ll have in the U.S. is similar to the strategy that we had internationally, and that is maintain as much volume as we can at the highest level of profit that we can maintain it at. And that is the logic that we will employ. But that doesn’t mean we won’t have to be somewhat responsive to prices in the marketplace on Humira.

The big dynamic change for Skyrizi here, largely what you’re seeing is from the psoriatic arthritis indication. And obviously saw very, very large sequential moves. And let me give you some sense of what we’re looking at. So, we’re seeing that we’re putting more and more basically headroom into the overall share position, first in psoriatic disease, so that’s psoriasis plus PSA. So, we’re at 26% in terms of total TRx share and moving very, very nicely up. So, that’s being driven by this PSA acceleration. So first, remember that the PSA indication, we were the -- really the last large product that didn’t have that indication. So first, what happens is it starts to interact very positively in the dermatology segment. So, as I mentioned, about 30% of patients both have skin and joint involvement. And so we actually had a lower despite the fact that we had the leading psoriasis share, we had a lower psoriasis share because we weren’t covered with the joints with that indication. So, you see an immediate, very rapid acceleration of our overall derm business that I highlighted. Secondly, strategically important to the performance is that we’re able to launch the PSA indication for Skyrizi in rheumatology. So, it starts to work together with the Rinvoq PSA indication, and the rheum segment is 3 times as large as the derm segment. So, it’s a very, very good dynamic in terms of our momentum in two large segments, even before we get to Crohn’s. Now, I would say that as we’ve talked about before, I mean, Skyrizi is a very special product, very unique dosing, very stable, incredible efficacy. And so, we are encouraged on the early results of Crohn’s. It’s too early to start to see numbers or et cetera.

So, if you recall, earlier in the year, we got asked the question, I said PSA for Skyrizi was going to contribute about $200 million this year. It’s probably closer to $400 million now with the guidance range, given the very nice uptick we’ve seen in PSA. But part of that guidance raise is also the strong share performance in psoriasis. So, it includes both. In terms of Crohn’s, that hasn’t changed. We’ve set approximately $100 million this year as we ramp access for Crohn’s.

Certainly, that is a -- the new assets are a very important part of our growth story for hem/onc. Certainly, as I mentioned, we’re still continuing to ramp around the world with CLL. We have more and more impressive data, particularly in the unfit frontline population. We have five years of data in the fit population for frontline for Venclexta. We’re encouraged with the myeloma data, which is very unique in terms of biomarker driven approach for the (11;14).

I’m just -- and what I was just trying get your hands around, what type of magnitude of impact you’re talking about here in terms of either of its inflation or economic sensitivity to that business.

And as Rick said, there was a onetime promotional event that we ran in the U.S. for Juvederm in Q2 of last year, and it was highly successful, and it increased sales in the sales space, which created the challenging prior year comparison. So, that was the key driver. But as you noted, there is also this impact -- economic impact that is suggestive of some early changes in consumer behavior. And that really isn’t surprising in light of the inflationary pressures that we’re seeing on discretionary income. And as Rick said, the filler market is likely more sensitive to that than toxins for a few reasons. We mentioned the price point. So a price point of closer to $1,000 versus $500 for toxin, also the nature of the filler business is different than toxin from a patient dynamic and treatment dynamic and that there are more -- there’s a longer interval between treatments for fillers versus toxin, which is sort of like a more regular treatment paradigm a few times a year. Also, the patient bases are different. When you think about the toxin patient base and Botox Cosmetic, the majority of the patient base is continuing patients versus more of a reliance on new patient acquisition. And so, those are some of the factors we’re thinking about when we think about the deceleration of the filler market in Q2 but while the market has slowed and despite the performance in Q2, we do continue to expect a positive second half growth for U.S. Juvederm, really weighted more in the fourth quarter as we’re going to launch two new fillers in the fourth quarter. And those two new fillers will get us into incremental categories for HA fillers, including jawline and skin quality, which will help to drive some incremental demand at the end of the year.

We’re -- we don’t see some significant pressures on Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Now, we always have discussions with the payers, we look at our contracting strategy. But I think we fall back on our clinical evidence that we have on these two major assets. I mean, we have four head-to-head trials against other major competitors with Skyrizi, where we have just really growth superiority versus whether it’s an IL-17, whether it’s Humira, which one day will be biosimilar, STELARA, et cetera. So just the pure performance there and the momentum, it’s clearly a distinguished asset. We’re going to be first in terms of Crohn’s to start to establish that new area and build the market there.

First, Rick, in the past, you have laid out four factors that will dictate Humira’s trajectory in 2023. The first two were Humira access and biosimilar price, and it’s clear it’s too early for any news on either of those points. But the second two were competitiveness of biosimilars, which you said in part was interchangeability and also the biosimilar ability to supply the market. So, those two factors, three and four are things that won’t fluctuate and presumably, you have some visibility on that now. So, I’m just wondering if there’s anything unusual occurring there. And in discussions, how important is interchangeability with payers. The second question is, and I apologize if I missed it, but are there any updates on the TNF steroid conjugate and is Phase 2 RA data still expected this year?

So, you are correct. That is what I described a meeting or two ago as the four variables. I would say, when you think about interchangeability, I think you have to think about it in the backdrop of not just interchangeability, but also what is the profile that is the closest to Humira today? And we can look at all the biosimilars and have -- we have pretty good visibility as to what that profile looks like. And what I would say is, to get a profile that is interchangeable and is consistent with the current Humira that’s predominantly in the marketplace today, that’s probably going to occur in the summer of 2023. There should be one or two biosimilars that have a profile that looks like that. And that would make it somewhat easier for an organization to make a switch. So, I think that will play an important variable. Nothing has changed in the last few months in what that profile looks like. And then obviously, supply is an important aspect that certainly anyone that we’re looking at making a significant change in their position with Humira is going to want to make sure that they’re going with a company that has the ability to be able to produce at volume, at significant volumes, Humira, and they can do it sustainably. So, there are certain players that I would say clearly have that ability to be able to do it, similar to us. Certainly, no one does it at the scale of us or anywhere close to the scale of us. But there are also a lot of small players that I think supply is going to be an important aspect and going to somewhat limit the ability to be able to have broad market impact. And so, those are going to be important dynamics as we negotiate with the various managed care organizations. I can tell you that we’re talking through those kinds of things with them.

Maybe one that’s more broad policy and then another one that’s maybe a little bit more detailed. So, maybe first for Rick. I know you guys keep pretty close tabs on healthcare policy. Just on the most recent Senate Democrat drug pricing language in the reconciliation bill. The provisions on the face of it seemed pretty manageable in terms of direct impact from pricing controls, but there’s been some concern around this being just the start of something larger in terms of price controls. Any thoughts from you guys on this would be appreciated. And then, maybe a more detailed question on ABBV-951. I know you guys haven’t provided specific guidance on this or on Duodopa, but there seems to be a lot of recognition of 951 among movement disorder KOLs as a real improvement in terms of overcoming reticence around Duodopa. Just how should we be thinking about 951 vis-à-vis Duodopa, if approved?

I mean, I think if you look at the drug pricing proposal that’s out there, it’s certainly an important issue for us, and I think it’s an important issue for patients. I think if I look at that bill, and I’m assuming that if there were something that were to pass, it would be somewhat consistent with what was in the build back better for the Senate Finance text. And so far, it looks like that, but obviously evolving a bit here as we go along. And if I look at it in total, what I’d say is there’s a couple of positive things in there. Certainly, most notably, the $2,000 cap out-of-pocket costs for patients and the ability to be able to smooth, I think that’s an important step in increasing affordability, especially for patients in Medicare Part D. And so, that’s something we’ve been supportive of. We’ve been vocal that we think that’s an important step forward. What I’d say on balance, this is a bill that has far more negatives than it has positives in it. And I think although it may not be short term that challenging from a financial standpoint, I think the long-term implications of this bill are pretty significant. And they really hinge around this so-called negotiation clause that’s in there and how that’s being implemented, particularly for small molecules. And if you’re familiar with it, essentially what it says is that CMS or we’re assuming it will be CMS, has the ability at a certain point in time to be able to negotiate a price on a set of drugs. And by the time you get there, it will be a big set of drugs that they’ll have the ability to be able to negotiate on. And the key issue is this. Essentially, they have full latitude to basically decide whatever price they want the drug to be. And I wouldn’t necessarily call it a negotiation because the only alternative that the manufacturer has is to accept a 95% penalty on their revenues or, in essence, take a 95% discount. So, it’s not a negotiation. We should just call it what it is. It’s price controls is what they’re basically putting in place if the language stays the same. And ultimately, I think the real challenge is how we invest in this as an industry in innovation. If you take small molecules as an example, I’ll walk you through an example that illustrates the point that I’m going to raise here. If you take a small molecule, it says at year nine after the first approval, CMS has the right to be able to negotiate the price on that drug. So, if you take an oncology drug as an example, how do we develop oncology drugs in this industry? And what do the regulatory authorities typically require us to do, to be able to develop an oncology drug. Well, they typically require you to do and what we typically do is we go to patients who have failed on all the existing therapies, fourth-line patients, fifth-line patients. And we take whatever drug we have and we determine, do we have a positive benefit risk in that patient population. If we find that we do, then we seek approval for that drug in that patient population, so that those patients will get the benefit of that drug. And then, we start to work our way up towards front line. Those who refractory patients are typically very small populations of patients, right? And you can never get a return on a drug just on that patient population. And then, you work your way up to front line, or second line, or wherever you end up. That process typically takes 7 to 9 years because of the length of the trials. So essentially, with this, by the time you got to the larger populations, you’d be within a year or two of when CMS could change the price. But one, it’s impossible to figure out what the return is going to be, so how do you invest? Two, it really puts negative pressure on you not to continue to develop new indications. But the most detrimental part of it is to patients who need these drugs or small indications or in later stage. Because you’re faced with the dilemma -- and this is a horrible dilemma, right, as a company and for patients. You’re faced with a dilemma of do I choose not to seek approval in those late-stage patients, so I don’t start the clock and wait until I’m closer to frontline before I start the clock. That is not the right policy. And I would say, on balance, this bill will have a couple of things that are good for patients that I’m fully supportive of. But unless Congress wants to harm patients and harm innovation in this industry, they need to change that part of it. It doesn’t make sense. It’s shortsighted. Now, they can change it in a couple of different ways. They can determine, okay, what is a floor price or a maximum discount by year and then you can calculate the return on investment that you’re going to have on the drug or they can at least make it consistent with biologics that are out 13 years. Otherwise, the investment in small molecule oncology drugs or neuroscience drugs, which Medicare patient populations are highly dependent on new innovative drugs in those areas because they’re elderly patients, are going to suffer. And the CBO report that was published back in April of last year clearly pointed that out. So, this isn’t something I’m just saying or industry is just saying. And in fact, if anything, I’d say, they probably undercall the magnitude of the impact. So, this is an important issue. We all know the affordability and access for Medicare patients is important. But you don’t need to destroy the innovation model in the process in order to provide that. And so, I’m hopeful that we’ll see some movement here and some rationality will play out.",1064.0,445.0,14.0,13.0,8.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,0.03146067415730337,0.029213483146067417,0.017977528089887642,0.006741573033707865,0.006741573033707865,0.0022471910112359553

So, I think some perspective is globally, DUOPA is about $0.5 billion brand. And certainly, we’ve said that we believe that 951 could certainly double that up or more. I’ll give you the perspective of why we think that way. So, if you look at the advanced Parkinson’s patients, about 85% sort of cycle when they stay on these generic orals that become less and less and less effective. And the only thing they can really do, and that’s about 15% of the market, the advanced Parkinson market, is they can move to either deep brain stimulation or DUOPA. But you got to go through a surgical barrier. So, the families and the patients are forced to think if I need to get improvement in my symptoms and my quality of life, I’m forced to basically think about do I get a hole in my head or a hole in my stomach with a gastric surgery. This is going to be a subcu. And so, we see in our market research that at least 40% to 60% of people never want to move towards DBS or DUOPA. So, we think this is a way where we can start to expand and create a new market segment, in essence, a subcutaneous segment where you don’t have to take that risk on the surgery. And like you mentioned in the movement disorder centers, there’s a significant amount of experts that are excited about this new option, and we believe that it’s going to be a real innovation for patients without having the surgery.",276.0,110.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.02727272727272727,0.03636363636363636,0.03636363636363636,0.0,0.0,-0.00909090909090909

Ultimately, if more of it happens in ‘24, you obviously have another year of growth for all your growth brands. And so, you have a different floor in that scenario. But most importantly, it’s what happens in ‘25 and beyond. When you look at this company with the growth drivers we have, we’ll be delivering high-single-digit growth in ‘25 and beyond, which is industry-leading. We’ll have the lowest LOE exposure in the industry in the second half of this decade. And so, we’re focused on the long term, we feel very good about the prospects of this business. But as it stands now, the most recent direction we’ve given is expect that first year erosion, so that 45% plus or minus 10%, which then play out to a return to growth in ‘24.

I’m a clinical immunologist, and I know how we’ve been using steroids, they can give very profound and deep immunosuppression, decrease inflammation, and that’s often used in severe cases when patient shows up. So, we know that the response is very strong, but there are a lot of side effects. And, when our problem is always weaning, the steroid’s out in the clinic. So here, again, the combination of immunomodulator like TNF and steroid have that potential of giving us that deep, deep response very quickly to remove the immunosuppression. And based on the data we’ve seen preclinically in our Phase 1 studies, we’re not seeing those biomarkers or side effects in the bone or brain, a cortisol or others. So we’ve already demonstrated that, and we have nice data. The other -- so that’s my enthusiasm. We expect to see deep responses, durable responses with much well better tolerated than steroids. Our program -- and we’ve shown this also is that we’ve actually believed in the platform and we’re developing steroid ADCs for other targets to target other immune systems -- other immune cells, more specifically around some T cells or some B cells or some fibroblasts. These programs are coming forward. We think this is a profound platform in immunology to go after different biologies -- in very targeted steroid suppression of different specific immune cell types, and that’s going to play out over the next couple of years. So, based on the data we saw, we expanded the platform to other biomarkers getting into other specific immune cell types. Of course, we’re quiet because we need to see the data, all -- the study has been fully recruited, actually moved faster than we expected. And the day was randomized. We’re just going to see the data in the fall because it’s a blinded study. But the enthusiasm is there. And we’re also, of course, seeing that data, and then we have PMR because we also started studies there in Crohn’s disease.

So, the way we’ve talked about Humira erosion, it’s played out in Europe as we saw that steep erosion in year one, more moderate erosion years beyond. In our modeling now, that’s probably the best way to think about it is deep erosion year one, more moderate. You’ll have an annualization impact in year two, but more moderate beyond that.

We saw 600 unique gastroenterologists start to write prescriptions, which is quite interesting and good, a positive. And about half of those customers had never written a JAK inhibitor.

Dovetailing on what Tom just walked through, things that we want to see are consistent with how we develop in immunology, certainly raising standard of care. So, the way this was designed was to have that anti-TNF and then that direct delivery to avoid systemic side effects of the steroids. So, you’d see sort of that one-two punch as Tom was describing and see that depth of response. So, once we see that type of information along with how it looks from a steroid standpoint, metabolic effects, bone effects taken together will give us a great sense of where it could fit before anti-TNFs, even after we’re studying patients that have failed anti-TNFs in this Phase 2 study. So, taken together, that will give us a really good sense of where to go. And then remember, we’re also going to get data in polymyalgia rheumatic. It’s not an uncommon disease, and these patients are -- many of them are steroid-dependent, 50% or so three years and going and they can’t withdraw from steroids and maybe a third can be 5 plus 6 years. They’re stuck on steroids. So we’ll see that data where we’re able to prevent them from flaring and to be able to reduce their systemic steroid dose. So, there’s multiple facets to this and potentially a number of opportunities and then later on in Crohn’s disease as well.",249.0,117.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.03418803418803419,0.017094017094017096,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.017094017094017096,0.017094017094017096

For Skyrizi, if I could just return to this question of how you’re thinking about the long-term guidance. I think on Skyrizi, recalling that you said $7.5 billion, consisting of about 6 from the psoriatic complex. And yet you’re almost already approaching something close to $5 billion. So, can you tell us how you’re thinking about how that could factor in any long-term thinking? And then, for epcoritamab, positioning of that treatment in the overall treatment paradigm.

So look, we’re very encouraged by Skyrizi’s continued strong performance. We remain confident in our ability to achieve or exceed that 2025 guidance. Now, keep in mind, I mean, the Street also reflects that too. Street is about $400 million higher than that $7.5 billion. That said, we don’t intend on frequently updating that guidance. Obviously, we’ll provide that guidance update every few years or if there’s an event or there’s a major disconnect. So obviously, if the Street was way off, we want to point that out.

So I’m not going to go through all of the data points again, we’ve described them several times in the public domain. What I would remind you of is that we’ve observed extremely robust efficacy in a heavily pretreated population. Now it’s true to say that 40% of those patients have sailed CAR-Ts, but 60% of those patients didn’t sail CAR-T. Therefore, our expectation, our intention, rather, and as we’ve mentioned earlier on in Tom’s prepared remarks, we are anticipating filing for accelerated approval during the second half of this year. And I think that what you can expect is that we believe that the total population, the total relapsed/refractory population, whether or not they sail CAR-Ts should have access to epcoritamab because of the strength of the data overall. In terms of future positioning, we’ve also discussed in the past our intention of initiating multiple phase -- additional Phase 3, the confirmatory study for the DLBCL application what would be the confirmatory study, the Phase 3 study is ongoing. That’s in the relapsed/refractory setting.

So, we’ve started to talk to different types of physicians, whether they’re in the CAR-T centers or certainly the community centers. We’re increasingly believing that this lymphoma is treated in the community centers. And so, what we hear, at least at a high level from our research so far is wow, that efficacy is incredibly impressive, even after CAR-T. But where they go is this simple subcu of epcoritamab may be the fastest way to deliver T cells to my patients I’m dealing with. So to build on Neil’s point, that data doesn’t look like it’s niching the drug. In fact, it looks like it’s sort of contributing to the idea of like this is a democratized type of medication for the lymphoma.

Allergan, obviously brought us a tremendous amount of diversity. That transaction has been highly successful and has really changed the look and the shape of AbbVie and it has clearly enhanced our performance, and we’ve done quite well. Our focus is continuing to look for opportunities to be able to fill out our portfolio in areas that we believe there are opportunities to bring in strategic assets.

I'll briefly comment on our overall performance then Jeff, Tom and Rob will review our third quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie continues to perform very well, a testament to the strength of our broad, diversified portfolio. I'm especially pleased with the performance of our immunology assets, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.66, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenues of $14.8 billion were up 5.4% on an operational basis, in line with our expectations. Immunology once again demonstrated impressive results with Skyrizi and Rinvoq now on pace to deliver more than $7.5 billion in combined sales this year, well ahead of our initial expectations. This performance is especially encouraging, recognizing that we're in the early launch phase for both assets in IBD and PSA, as well as Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis. Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established outstanding launch trajectories across existing and new indications, giving us a high degree of confidence in the collective potential of these two assets to ultimately exceed the peak revenues achieved by Humira, achieving the strategic objective we had for replacing Humira. We also saw a continued strong double-digit operational sales growth from several additional key products, including Botox Cosmetic, Vraylar, Venclexta and Botox Therapeutic. This strong momentum is helping us offset some of the interim economic pressure we now see in our Aesthetics portfolio. Based on these results, we remain confident in the outlook of our business and are reaffirming the midpoint of our full year 2022 EPS guidance at $13.86, which represents strong double-digit growth. As many of you are aware, we have a leading consumer-facing aesthetics portfolio, which is largely cash pay. We have been monitoring the global economic situation. Based on all the data we have been observing, especially in the U.S. with both the consumer confidence index and real personal consumption expenditures trending down and continued high inflation, these factors are putting pressure on consumers' discretionary spending. This metric correlates with a slowdown in treatment procedures that we're seeing across the aesthetics markets, impacting the growth rates for toxins, fillers and body contouring. While our U.S. aesthetics market share remains stable across both toxins and fillers, we now believe it's prudent to adjust our full year aesthetics forecast to reflect the moderating market growth over the near to medium term, which is expected to predominantly impact Juvederm as well as our body contouring portfolio products, which represent higher price points for consumers. While it's difficult to predict the duration of these economic dynamics, we expect these conditions to persist into 2023. As consumer confidence improves, we would once again expect the market growth to accelerate. Our aesthetics portfolio experienced a rapid and sustained recovery following the 2008-2009 recession, so we anticipate any impact will be transient. Over the long-term, the aesthetics business continues to be an extremely attractive, underpenetrated market with significant growth potential. The current market dynamics do not change our long-term guidance for aesthetics and we remain confident in our ability to achieve total sales of more than $9 billion in 2029. I also want to provide a brief update on the outlook for 2023. With regards to the status of contracting for Humira, our intent has always been to maintain broad formulary access so that we can compete effectively with forthcoming biosimilars. We are making very good progress consistent with this objective, and are currently projecting formulary access for at least 80% of all U.S. covered lives. We expect this percentage to increase further as we conclude additional contract discussions between now and the end of the year. As a result, we anticipate strong access for U.S. Humira throughout 2023, and project biosimilars will share access as they become available. We will provide sales guidance for Humira on our fourth quarter call. While we're not issuing 2023 guidance today, it is important to note that when we issue our EPS outlook, we expect the lower end of the range to represent for earnings. So while it's possible 2023 could outperform our guidance regardless of the shape of the erosion curve, we don't anticipate 2024 earnings will be lower than the initial 2023 EPS guidance given the momentum and growth from another year of our ex-Humira portfolio, which is expected to more than offset any incremental Humira erosion in 2024. We know that many investors have an interest in the timing of AbbVie's trough earnings, whether that would be 2023 or 2024. The guidance range will provide and give investors additional clarity regarding our expectations for the company's core EPS.  In summary, we continue to deliver strong results and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth. To that end, as noted in our news release, today we're announcing a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.41 per share to $1.48 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2023. Since our inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by 270%. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.

We once again demonstrated strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter. I'll start with Immunology, where we are well positioned for sustained leadership in this extremely attractive market. Total Immunology revenues were more than $7.6 billion, up 16.4% on an operational basis. We remain very excited about the long-term potential for Skyrizi and Rinvoq which are already having a significant impact on AbbVie's growth and performance, contributing approximately $2.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, representing nearly 15% of total company net revenues. Skyrizi continues to exceed our expectations. Global revenues were $1.4 billion, up 12% on a sequential basis. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is capturing nearly one out of every two new and switching patients in the U.S. biologic market, with our leading total prescription share increasing to approximately 27%. We have also achieved total market share leadership in a dozen key international markets, including Japan, Canada and France. Psoriatic arthritis is ramping very nicely, with an expected global sales contribution of approximately $500 million just this year. Our PSA performance is especially strong in the U.S. Dermatology segment, where we have already achieved 10% total market share. Lastly, our launch of Skyrizi for Crohn's disease in the U.S. is progressing very well. Early prescription trends as well as feedback from gastroenterologists has been overwhelmingly positive, especially given Skyrizi's convenient dosing and strong clinical profile. Importantly, commercial access for Skyrizi Crohn's is now equal to psoriasis and PSA with sales in this indication expected to ramp significantly over the next several quarters. Given the momentum we are seeing across the indications; we will be raising our full year sales guidance once again for Skyrizi. Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $695 million, demonstrating more than 17% sequential growth, we continue to see positive momentum in RA, with total market share increasing to more than 6% in both the U.S. and across key international geographies. Global prescriptions are also ramping nicely in PSA ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA, a testament to the strong clinical profile Rinvoq has demonstrated across the broader rheumatology segment. Rinvoq is now the only JAK inhibitor with global approval for all four major Rheum indications. In atopic dermatitis, we continue to see strong demand for Rinvoq, particularly in the second-line setting. U.S. in-play market share is tracking in line with our expectations and we were making excellent progress internationally, with in-place share ranging now from approximately 20% to 35% across our major markets. AD remains a highly underpenetrated market globally and an attractive long-term growth opportunity for Rinvoq. Lastly, in ulcerative colitis, we are very excited by the early prescription trends in the U.S. In the second line plus setting, Rinvoq is already achieving the second highest in-place share, which is now approaching 20% in just a few months’ post launch. Physicians have been pleased with Rinvoq's high rates of endoscopic healing as well as the speed of onset. With over 70% of bioexperience UC patients currently on or having used TNF therapy, the second line plus opportunity for Rinvoq in UC is substantial. This strong adoption in UC among gastroenterologists is also encouraging for Rinvoq's potential in Crohn's disease as well. We are on track for U.S. and EMA regulatory decisions in the first half of 2023. Global Humira sales were approximately $5.6 billion, up 3.9% on an operational basis with 7.4% growth in the U.S., partially offset by international performance where revenues were down 16.8% operationally due to biosimilar competition. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.65 billion, down 9.9% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 17.4%. The U.S. performance continues to be impacted by an incrementally challenging CLL market, with new patient starts down approximately 20% relative to pre-COVID levels. Given the U.S. CLL market has been consistently lower than our expectation in the past several quarters, we are now reducing our view of the total size of the addressable patient population for this indication going forward. We also anticipate further share erosion following the recent unfavorable change to the NCCN guideline preference for Imbruvica in CLL, as well as increasing existing and new competition. These market and shared dynamics are expected to have a flow through impact on Imbruvica’s 2023 performance.  Venclexta global sales were $550 million up 11.3% on an operational basis. Continued share gains across both approved indications are being partially offset by a softer CLL market in the U.S. and a higher foreign exchange impact on international revenues. As a result, we will be adjusting our full year sales guidance for Venclexta. Longer term, we anticipate our oncology portfolio will return a growth driven by several promising new products and indications such as epcoritamab for DLBCL, and follicular lymphoma, Venclexta new indications for multiple myeloma and high-risk MDs; navitoclax for myelofibrosis; and Teliso-V for nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer. We are beginning launch preparedness activities for several of these important opportunities and look forward to bringing new treatment options to patients. In neuroscience revenues were nearly $1.7 billion, up 8.3% on an operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of 554 million were up 20.2% on an operational basis reflecting continued market share momentum. We continue to anticipate the regulatory approval and the commercial launch of Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder this quarter, which would make Vraylar the only antipsychotic, as a dual partial agonist approved to treat the most common forms of depression, both bipolar I, and adjunctive, and DD. Within migraine, our market leading oral CGRP portfolio contribute $222 million in combined sales this quarter. Ubrelvy prescriptions increased high single digits sequentially while total revenues were unfavorably impacted by a one-time prior period accrual adjustment of $40 million related to patient access program costs. Excluding this one-time adjustment, Ubrelvy sales were up more than 20% versus the prior year. Qulipta revenues nearly doubled sequentially as we continue to make very good progress with commercial access. Potential label expansion in the U.S. as a preventative treatment in patients with chronic migraine and new therapy approvals in Europe represent additional opportunities to support Qulipta's strong momentum. Botox Therapeutic is also performing very well with total sales of $699 million, up 10% on an operational basis. In chronic migraine, which accounts for roughly 45% of our therapeutic sales, Botox remains a foundational preventative treatment, and the clear branded leader for existing as well as new patient starts. Lastly, our launch preparations are underway for ABBV-951, a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's. We anticipate approval in the first half of next year and believe ABBV-951 has the potential to achieve peak sales in excess of $1 billion. So overall, I'm very pleased with the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D programs.

In the area of immunology, we had several important regulatory milestones since our last earnings call, receiving FDA approval for Rinvoq in non-radiographic axial SpA and positive CHMP opinion for Skyrizi in Crohn's disease. These developments demonstrate the continued progress we are making with a global indication expansion of our next-generation immunology assets. In the quarter, we also saw longer term data from our Phase 2 study for Rinvoq in systemic lupus, where strong responses and flare reductions continued through 48 weeks of treatment. Based on these results, we plan to advance Rinvoq development in this indication and will be discussing our Phase 3 program with regulatory agencies in the coming months. Now, I would like to provide a few updates on our earlier stage immunology pipeline. We recently began a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis for our RIPK1 inhibitor, ABBV-668. This small molecule inhibitor is designed to address chronic inflammatory diseases by preventing necroptosis and reducing TLR4-driven inflammation. This could be a differentiated approach that has a potential to provide significantly improved efficacy to patients suffering from ulcerative colitis. We look forward to providing updates as data mature. Turning now to ABBV-154, our anti-TNF steroid conjugate, which is being evaluated in multiple indications. We recently completed the primary analysis for the Phase 2 dose-ranging study in RA patients. The hypothesis for this program was that by delivering the steroid directly to the site of inflammation, you could drive higher rates of efficacy with limited or no effects of systemic steroid exposure. In this study, all doses of ABBV-154 met the primary endpoint of ACR50, as well as the majority of secondary endpoints at week 12. At the medium and high doses, ABBV-154 delivered ACR scores that are similar to Rinvoq or slightly better, which validates the platform's ability to drive high levels of efficacy. The safety profile for ABBV-154 was generally consistent with the safety profile for adalimumab. As part of our safety assessment in this study, we analyze metabolic parameters including cortisol levels. The data showed minor decreases in cortisol levels at the higher exposures, which are consistent with evidence of systemic steroid effects. Given the number of effective therapies available in RA and a more limited use of steroids in these patients, we do not plan to move forward in development for the RA indication. However, we continue to believe ABBV-154 has the potential to provide a benefit in other diseases such as PMR and Crohn's disease, where steroid use is part of the typical treatment paradigm. Our exploratory Phase 2 studies in these two indications are ongoing and we expect to see data from the PMR study in 2023 and from the Crohn's study in 2024. Also in the area of immunology, we recently made the decision to stop the clinical studies and discontinue development for ABBV-157, our RORγt inverse agonist. This decision was made due to new findings observed in our preclinical chronic toxicology study. Moving now to our oncology portfolio where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our pipeline. We recently submitted our regulatory application in Europe and our partner, Genmab, submitted an application in the U.S. for epcoritamab in relapse-refractory large B-cell lymphoma. We're seeking accelerated approval based on the positive Phase 2 study results for epcoritamab in this indication where we saw very deep and durable responses in these highly refractory patients. We expect decisions in both U.S. and Europe in 2023. We are also nearing completion of the registrational studies for two additional key programs in our heme/onc portfolio; Venclexta in multiple myeloma; and navitoclax in myelofibrosis. We remain on track to see results from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation near the end of this year. Following the event-driven data readout, we anticipate submitting our regulatory applications in the first half of next year. For navitoclax, we remain on track to see data in the first half of next year from both the Phase 2 REFINE and the Phase 3 TRANSFORM-1 trials. Results from both studies will be included in our regulatory submissions, which we expect in the second half of 2023. Moving to neuroscience where we have applications under active review for several key assets. We anticipate a decision from the FDA in December for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. We believe Vraylar has a potential to be an important new therapy in this patient population and we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to patients. We also expect a decision from the FDA in the first half of next year for a ABBV-951, our innovative, subcutaneous level levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. And in the area of migraine, we have regulatory applications under review in both the U.S. and Europe for Qulipta as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine with decisions expected in the first half of next year. If approved, this would be another differentiating future for Qulipta as it would be the only oral CGRP approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. This is a common and debilitating disease that significantly impacts quality of life, and we look forward to making this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. And in eye care, our partner REGENXBIO recently announced positive interim data from the Phase 2, AAV8 dose escalation trial for RGX-314 using in-office, suprachoroidal delivery for the treatment of wet AMD. RGX-314 continues to be well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events, and a meaningful reduction in treatment burden was observed at six months across all dose levels. Two pivotal trials evaluating RGX-314 for wet AMD using subretinal delivery are active and enrolling patients. So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress advancing our programs this year and we look forward to many more important pipeline milestones in the remainder of this year and into 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook.

The continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq are helping offset the impact from higher inflation and the stronger U.S. dollar. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.66, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.02 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $14.8 billion, in line with our guidance and up 5.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 2.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 53.4% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 85.4% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 10.8% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 0.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense up 20.9% of sales. Net interest expense was $497 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.9%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are narrowing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $13.84 and $13.88. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the third quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $58.2 billion, reflecting growth of 5.5% on an operational basis. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.9% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following updated assumptions. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $5.1 billion, an increase of $300 million due to strong market share performance. For Venclexta, we now expect global revenue of approximately $2 billion, based on a lower market outlook in CLL and unfavorable foreign exchange. For Aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, given the impact of higher inflation on near-term market growth and due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Moving to P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of approximately 85% of sales and forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 52% of sales. Turning to the fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $15.2 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 2.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.65 and $3.69. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie’s strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated $17 billion of free cash flow in the first nine months of the year, and our cash balance at the end of September was $11.8 billion. Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie’s long-term outlook, today we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2023. And we remain on track to achieve $30 billion of cumulative debt paydown by the end of this year, bringing our net leverage ratio to 1.8 times. In closing, AbbVie’s strong performance allows us to reaffirm earnings expectations in the face of economic pressure. And with our diverse portfolio, we continue to be well positioned to deliver long-term growth.

And I know you – appreciate some of the access commentary you made at beginning of the call, but are there any surprises so far in these discussions as we think about where either rebates or price is settling out for Humira? And I’m really sure I was trying to get my hands around, I think previously, you’ve commented you expected U.S. Humira erosion to be down roughly 45%, plus or minus 10%. And I just was wondering if that range holds given what you know today about the negotiations? And if I could just do a quick follow up, second question, immunology. There was a European JAK update out this morning, and I just was wondering any impact you expect to the Rinvoq franchise for that? Just maybe some context about how relevant, I guess, Europe was as part of the mix? And does that label update kind of impact your outlook at all?

I’ll cover part of that question, and then I’ll have Jeff fill in on any additional commentary around the contracting. I think first, if we talk about the 45%, plus or minus 10%, that is the range that we gave. We’re obviously working on doing the final forecasting for 2023. As we’ve said in the past, there are two major components, which will play into that forecast. One is how are the biosimilars priced, that will certainly have some impact. We won’t know that until we actually get into the market and start to see some of that activity. But the other big component is obviously our coverage, our access coverage for Humira and the position that Humira has on those formularies. I would say that negotiating by Jeff’s team is going very well. As I mentioned in my comments, we’re at about 80% of all covered lives now, and I would expect that to rise to a level that’s above 90% as we move towards the end of the year. Once we have a final number there, it will allow us to do the final modeling for 2023, and that’s at the point where we’ll be able to refine that 45% plus or minus 10%. I’d tell you it’s going on track. I would say there’s no surprises, and I’d say I feel good about how the negotiations are going with all the major managed care organizations and PBMs. Jeff, anything you’d add there?",257.0,100.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.01,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.01

And as we’ve communicated before, our principles of co-existing over time with one or more biosimilars seems to be the way that the market will play out. And certainly, like we saw in Europe that we had the principle of – for patient continuity to concede pricing to maintain that patient access.

So the next step here after PRAC would be moving to the CHMP here in November, and then the European Commission should finalize this. We expect December or January. So PRAC completed their review, and what we see in the labeling is an update in warnings, and this is related to outcomes of the oral surveillance study. And in particular, in Section 4.4, which is the warnings, there’s a list of subgroups that were found to be at risk based on analysis from oral surveillance. For example, patients greater than equal to the age of 65, those that are at risk for cardiac events, smokers, for example. And in these patients, the use of JAK inhibitors would be after a consideration of other therapies, if I’m paraphrasing, if no suitable alternatives.

I was under the impression that we’d get more granularity on Humira erosion this quarter, and you’re saying that’s really going to come in Q4. So, I’m wondering did I kind of not hear it right before, or has something changed? And then second question is just on contracting in general, my understanding is that payer contracts, really not rock solid. They can be reopened when there’s a change in the marketplace on things like pricing, in this case of biosimilars. So, when we do kind of get whatever next level of guidance we get from you, isn’t that going to continue to remain fluid? Because market dynamics won’t all play out as of January, we’ll get to mid next year, you’ll get more entrants, you’ll know pricing better and that sort of thing?

So, I think we’ve talked a number of times on these calls about what we project in the third quarter call, and I believe what we said is that we would ultimately provide you an update on where we were in the process. And so that’s what we attempted to do. I can’t give you a number for 2023 until I know what the total access is, and not all those contracts are done yet. They’re proceeding well, so I feel good about that. But until we actually know that the contract is solid and we know what that access looks like, we can’t give you an accurate projection. And I understand the desire by the investment community. I understand what that number is, but I think you probably also understand that we want to give you the most accurate number that we can give you, and we don’t want to give you a number that’s not accurate. And so it is going to require us until we get to the fourth quarter call to provide that for you. You are correct, in a sense, about the way you describe how these contracts work. They can be reopened at some point in time. I wouldn’t say that’s all that common usually, and in particular, I’d say around this kind of a situation, you’re going to anticipate what you think is going to happen in the second half of the year and try to position the contract in a way that it can ultimately deal with those changes going forward. But you are correct to say that they could reopen a contract if they chose to do that. There are various kinds of contracts that we use. In some cases, there are penalties or repercussions that would have to come into consideration if a contract got reopened at some point in time. They’re not all like that, but many are like that. So it varies. And I’d say generally speaking, your concept is valid. But I would say it’s probably a little less fluid than the way you necessarily described it, particularly in this environment where we know there will be a number of biosimilars coming in. So you anticipate that we’ve built the contracts around that set of assumptions.

While there are typically, there are typically out clauses based on timing or other dynamics I think one of the considerations is obviously, as we’ve highlighted before, most of the biosimilars are going to be coming in the second half of the year. So to some degree, that actually limits if it was a rare case. And they typically are rare where a contract is blown up or renegotiated in the middle of the year. That length of time that’s left in 2023 for some of those payers to let’s take a negative action puts some natural constraint on them in terms of when they would time that out.

Obviously, there’s a couple components to that. So we have – while all the contracts aren’t fully complete with the ones that we’ve done. We’ve done some significant modeling work to understand if we’re retaining the ability to stay on the formulary. We would model our volume like how much would we retain versus would go to one or more biosimilars. That’s something that we can understand. And we have made base case, both first half and second half pricing assumptions based on those contracts. Now what’s been highlighted in the last couple of questions is there’s still uncertainty on the rest of the contracts that are yet to been secured and also a bid on that second half price dynamic.

I think if I step back and I look at where are we today. We have been for the last several years operating with an approach of roughly $2 billion to add incremental pieces to the business. We’ve effectively used that over the last several years to be able to build some additional, particularly, I’d say early stage pipeline assets to the company. We’re continuing on that same approach right now. Now having said that, we obviously have paid down debt very rapidly. We will be in a position where if we chose to do something, we could do something. I’d say if I look at the business today and I look at how it’s performing around the expectations that we had for the business going forward, I would say there’s no need for us to be able to do anything in that area. And I’d go back to the original premise of what we described to the investment community of what we believed would happen when biosimilars entered the U.S. market for Humira. What we said was that we believe the bulk of the erosion would occur in 2023, some additional erosion in 2024, in 2025 and beyond. We would return to significant growth. We’d be able to deliver high single digit growth from that point forward through the end of the decade. That’s what we said. Everything I know about the business today would suggest to me that we are able to do just that. And we’re confident that we’re able to do that with the portfolio we have and the late-stage pipeline and additional indications that we have coming forward. Having said that, I can also tell you that, over the last 10 years, we’ve demonstrated to ourselves and hopefully to you that we can acquire businesses and assets and we can integrate those and we can successfully drive those. And so if we found something that we thought was very important to add to the business, we certainly have the financial wherewithal and this business has tremendous cash flow. We could do that. I can tell you we don’t see that right now. So I wouldn’t assume that. And the other thing I’d point out is, as an example, the most important thing, and I know everyone is focused on what that erosion curve is going to look like, including us, to be honest, but – and I know why. But probably the single most important thing for us going forward to hit what I described to you a moment ago is that underlying non Humira business growing at a rate that it can drive those expectations. And that’s key and I’d say there’s two factors that are most important around that. The first is that Skyrizi and Rinvoq grow fast enough that they can more than offset that they can essentially grow through all of the erosion that occurs on Humira and deliver incremental performance of above and beyond that. And I feel highly confident in that. I mean, when you can look at the trajectories of those assets now in the early phase we’re in right now in IBD and PSA. I would say, I have a very high level of confidence that they will perform at that level or well above that level. Then the second thing is all the other growth assets they have to be growing fast enough that they can get us to be able to grow at that rate that I described. And if you take this quarter as an example, and you look at the business without Humira, the underlying growth is about 6.5%. And remember that 6.5% is absorbing the economic impact we see in the aesthetics business and the market and competitive dynamics that we see in Imbruvica. So that’s – that tells you that underlying growth is pretty strong. And so I think those are the important things that investors have to focus on. And the erosion curve is certainly one of those. And I’m sensitive to the fact that you want to know when you’re going to hit trough earnings, and I recognize that. And that’s why we wanted to provide you some assurance of what that trough earnings is going to look like.",736.0,295.0,11.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.03728813559322034,0.020338983050847456,0.02711864406779661,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288

So if I look at the aesthetics business, we’re clearly seeing this economic pressure in the U.S. And I would expect that we will see that to continue into 2023. Certainly, it’s difficult to predict what will happen in the U.S., will it get worse? Will we go into a recession? Will it stay about the same? I’d say, we’re looking at this extremely carefully. But good news right now I would say is that the factors that we’re looking at that seem to be driving this consumer confidence and behavior the most in the U.S., appeared to have stabilized at the levels that they’re at. And so I would say that’s a positive thing. Now it’s fluid because obviously if the economic situation got worse in the U.S., my guess is they would trend down again. And so – but at least it appears right now that they’ve stabilized and maybe even ticked up just a little bit, moved in a positive direction just a little bit. I think it’s very difficult to predict. Here’s what I would assume. I would assume that a significant part of 2023 we will have an impact on it. Now also recognize that we saw this phenomena as we said in the last call start in May. We weren’t sure at the time whether it was the summer season starting a month early or it was the economic impact, because we had been watching the indicators and they trend down several months ahead of that. But we didn’t see an impact until the month of May. So the point is, when we hit May and beyond, we’re going to be lapping the impact. So the negative impact will be softened on the business. So we’ll return to better growth rates no matter what just mathematically, right. So – but I think the best prediction we can have is it’s going to have an impact in a good part of 2023. I think it’s the best way for us to think about it. Now again, the rest of the business has an opportunity to be able to offset that as we saw in this quarter.",387.0,160.0,12.0,6.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,6.0,0.0,0.075,0.0375,0.06875,0.0,0.0,0.0375

If you think about what happened in 2008 and 2009, the business declined high single digits and then we saw, after that very robust growth in the mid-teen to the next decade. So given that penetration rates are still very low today. There’s clearly ample opportunity to grow this market. I think once you get on the other side of the economic impact which we expect to be transient. We still expect as business to deliver long-term growth as Rick highlighted earlier, we’re still on track for that. Long-term high single digit growth getting to greater than $9 billion by 2029.

So the first thing I just want to caution, put a word of caution before I answer your question directly around inpatient stay, which is that the patient population that our competitors studied with the BCMA, CD3 is quite different in terms of overall benefit risk. So the indication that was granted was in fifth line plus multiple myeloma, which is very heavily pretreated and frail population. So to extrapolate any interpretation of benefit risk from that population into the relapsed/refractory DLBCL population that we have studied and filed for with epcoritamab would not be valid, so just a word of caution there. That said the study that we have filed had required for a 24-hour patient stay overnight – one overnight stay. However, in subsequent studies we are aiming to remove that requirements so patients would not require – be required to remain overnight. And we do believe because of the emergent and stable overall benefit risk for epcoritamab, a couple of things that we believe that it has the potential to be best-in-class, and we also believe that our strategy to remove overnight stays is a very valid one and reasonable one to pursue.

First on in Imbruvica, I'm assuming that Imbruvica is going to be included in the Top 10 CMS lists for price negotiation under Medicare next year. Assuming that's correct what do you think about the impact on net pricing from Imbruvica. Do you anticipate pricing – net pricing coming under pressure prior to 2026, given the contracting that's expecting to take place among your competitors to secure favorable positions given their catastrophic coverage burden on PBMs post the IRA implementation? So is the impact going to get brought forward for the class including for Imbruvica before you actually get the price cut coming? And then then seconds with epcoritamab, there's been some interesting data on the importance of profound B-cell depletion in lupus using CAR T assets, as CD20 bispecific could get to a similar level. I'm wondering whether you have interest in pivoting epcoritamab and exploring it in refractory lupus as one of your competitors already is particularly given you have a subcu administration, which obviously has some advantages?

So when we – obviously we're still studying very carefully the IRA and we're also discussing directly with CMS not just through pharma, but our own company in terms of how they're going to basically select the different drugs that will be negotiated. That's a little bit unclear at this point. It's not unreasonable based on the size of Imbruvica to suspect it will be one of the earlier drugs that could potentially be negotiated, so just to clear that. In terms of what may take place before that potential negotiation in 2026, I would expect to see some modest changes in rebate. We see very small levels at this point now but we do have a third competitor coming.

First, I'll say it's actually was very exciting to see that paper showing that B-cell depletion can actually put patients with very severe lupus in remission. It's a very small study. Some five patients, but everyone's looking at this as a, even with is a surprise because we used to think we had to affect many mechanisms themselves in lupus. So that was one of the reasons it's so difficult. I used to be part of a lupus clinic in Montreal, so I know the challenges with patients. So what we're looking at right now is we're asking yes, the answer to your question is can we use our existing assets and collaborations to see if we can do B-cell depletion, for as a treatment for lupus? The answer is yes. And the type of questions we're asking ourselves is, do we have to have as deeper depletion as we have with in heme malignancies? Nobody knows the answer. That might be important because if you have to have a very deep depletion it might be restricted more to more of the severe patients and again that would be an advantage. But if we want to go to all lupus patients because not all lupus patients are, are flaring all the time. The majority have a normal life. Go to the clinic once a year and just see their physicians when they have flares. So going to a very deep regimen for B-cell depletion might be deemed to too severe. So the questions is yes we're looking at it and trying to figure out what's the right regimen and how to approach that in lupus is very exciting questions, which we're obviously looking into.",309.0,125.0,4.0,15.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.032,0.12,0.032,0.0,0.008,-0.088

Steve, and just in terms of your salesforce question, I mean, we are very encouraged and excited about this potential approval. I mean, obviously we continue to gain share week-by-week sequentially for our base indication – the bipolar indications. And we know that based on the profile that we have with Vraylar. So very, very strong efficacy – proven efficacy of a very good tolerability profile for an antipsychotic, no material weight gain, low metabolic effects, and I think importantly maybe not as appreciated it's, there's no titration. You have a very simple starting dose of 1.5 milligrams. So as we do our research, we see that that profile is very strong as this potential add-on therapy and depression. In the last decade there's been only one drug that's been approved for this indication and that's Rexulti, and we think that's a branded drug, obviously, and we think we can compete very, very well. So we have a big existing sales force and infrastructure. We are gearing up in terms of training.

As you've been spending more time with the GIs, and have your outlooks changed on a potential there as major contributors to the long-term growth for those franchises? So were both of those being used in the treatment paradigms for the respective indications in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis? So that's one. And then secondly, just OpEx came in much lower than we expected, so you seem to be getting better operating leverage than what you originally guided. Are there areas where you've scaled back in spending, whether in Aesthetics or heme/onc if there's pressures there? And how will you be thinking about that into the Humira LOE next year?

I think we've mentioned before that the IBD has been a very important part of our long range plan and when we gave the 2025 guidance, it looks relatively small because they're just ramping down. I would say that as AbbVie we are very, very encouraged. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks on the launch, and maybe I'll start with what we're hearing from the gastroenterologists. I think first is they, they look at both assets and the global guidelines, the impressions and the clinical approach that we hear from the top leaders and also the community gastros is this idea over – I have to start to think about endoscopic healing, higher basically rates of efficacy and more significant clarity on what it's doing in the bowel versus just symptoms. And that seems straightforward, but we see the market moving very, very fast there in terms of understanding and that's what we can deliver, whether it's the Skyrizi data on the endoscopic healing rates with a very, very convenient and strong safety profile, or similar on the Rinvoq side in second line in the U.S. second line for patients that aren't doing well in UC. So we see rapid adoption already as I mentioned, that in the Rinvoq in the United States will be a second line plus based on the label. And we see very, very fast adoption. I'll give you some color on it. Xeljanz had been approved and is approved in UC in the United States, but basically it had very low adoption. We're seeing now in the community that 70% of the prescriptions are coming from physicians that have never written a JAK before. So it shows you that the clinical profile of Rinvoq in terms of its speed and the depth of the response is being viewed very, very well. So not only is that encouraging for Rinvoq, you see as I mentioned we're going to have the approval for Crohn's for Rinvoq in later lines next year as well. Skyrizi continues to surprise us to the upside, as you've heard from the call today. This is viewed increasingly as the preferred frontline drug coming straight out of the gate for Crohn's in the U.S. And the qualitative data that we're starting to see, and we are seeing some quantitative data that looks very strong, too, is that this is viewed as a already as a best-in-class product for Crohn’s, which is a very, very substantial market. So we are very encouraged.

If you look at the benefit we’re seeing, about half of it is actually coming from the stronger U.S. dollar, so it’s more of an FX impact. The other half is spend productivity. We always look for opportunities to drive more productivity in our spend. It’s not so much about scaling back in parts of the business, we always look for ways to spend better, buy better. And ultimately, that helps us. In many cases also, over the long-term, redeploy that investment to drive growth. If you think about 2023, I’ve said – given that 46% to 47% operating margin directional input. I’ve also said we’re not going to cut back investment. We’ll obviously be prudent given that you will see a decline in gross margins next year, but we’re not going to be cutting back investment because we expect to return to growth quickly.

Again, this is very challenging to actually make that abnormal CF protein get to the membrane and act as a chloride channel, and it takes three different drugs to make it effectively to get it to the cell membrane and open up in the right way. And so we all felt that we had – intakes we call them Corrector 1, Corrector 2 and Potentiator, these three different compounds. We always see good results with double our C1 corrector. We think it’s best-in-class. Our potentiator is very good. What we had difficulty is to get a good C2 corrector, and what I presented earlier this year was that it wasn’t good enough. But what we’ve done since then, we will continue to look at better ones and we came out with a differentiated product, 576 [ph], which is structurally different and the data supports higher safety margin, higher exposures, good PK. Hopefully, a single pill. And then we’d be able to get to this – to be able to have this triplet which is really important to be competitive. So again, our doublet, the data we had was very strong.

I’d say that, we obviously have a very experienced Board, and we’ve had an active approach on succession going back to about 2016, 2017. And that process has proceeded extremely well in developing internal candidates to ultimately assume the role when I do retire. I can tell you that there are no plans at all for me to retire in 2023. The most important thing to me and to the Board is to make sure that the business is performing exactly as we expect going forward, and we’re not going to make any transition until we’ve gone through the biosimilar event, and we’re confident in the performance of the overall business. That would be the appropriate time once we’re confident to make a transition at that point. We’ve also had discussions with the Board of what that transition would look like. And assuming it’s an internal candidate, the transition will essentially work where we will name a new CEO. And at that point, I will assume the role of Executive Chair for a period of time thereafter. So I think we have a well-thought-out succession approach.

So yes, we do see frontline use across the globe and even in the U.S. And what we’re seeing is now, as I mentioned in my remarks, we’re seeing in-line in-play share, which is in the high mid-teens right now in the U.S., and it’s higher in the international markets. So there seems to be, as we look to the research and we look to our market – end market performance, there’s really two segments of dermatologists. There’s very cautious dermatologists that are slow to adopt JAKs, and typically, they’ll start in the later line, a second line plus. There is an emerging cohort of a significant group of dermatologists as well that basically are looking at the underlying high efficacy parameters, so basically like the EZ90 skin clearance and almost no discernible itch for the product. They typically are starting to use more and more in the frontline. So the overall balance is leaning towards the second line, but we do see increasing frontline utilization based on the profile of the drug in atopic dermatitis. In terms of the Skyrizi for Crohn’s, we think we’re very, very well positioned for a couple of reasons. One is the overall profile of the medicine is really exceptional, as I’ve highlighted, and we’re going to see very, very rapid adoption both in the U.S. and the external market. In addition, we have anticipated the STELARA LOE. We see that we have an ongoing head-to-head trial versus STELARA to make sure that we can continue to differentiate with direct data that will come over the next year or so, so we’re anticipating that.

I mean, one of the things that we see certainly in the near term is that the formularies in I&I are actually expanding. So many years ago, you might have six or seven preferred agents. The payers are now requesting sometimes up to 11 or 12 preferred agents, so you’re seeing an expansive nature in the short term. Now as you go forward, maybe middle of the decade or later where you have more and more biosimilars, could the U.S. environment move towards sort of a step through? I mean, it’s possible. But we have, again, as I mentioned in my last statement, we have anticipated that with the right types of data, the trials. We have five head-to-head studies in Skyrizi in psoriasis; we have more coming in Crohn’s. And so we think that basically, we have a data-driven approach that’s going to continue to allow us to significantly differentiate our products. The other dynamic that we watch very carefully, and we talked about this during the Immunology Investor Day, is the lines of therapy as there’s more and more high efficacy products that get introduced, continue to expand.

The one thing I would add that as you think about even under a scenario where if we did get to some kind of a step at it, you have to go back and remember that most of these mechanisms, most patients fail, and they fail at a relatively high level and over a relatively short period of time. So even if you had to rotate through you’re going to get to second line relatively quickly, and recycling somebody back through another TNF typically doesn’t work very well for those patients. And I’d say the domain now with the kind of agents that we have in the market now and the level of remission that they can create, the demand among physicians is much higher to get patients into remission as rapidly as they possibly can.

ABBV,2023-02-09,2023-02-09,,2023-02-09,2023-02-09T09:00:00-05:00,0,2023-02-09,prepared,,Rick Gonzalez,"Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll provide perspective on our overall performance and outlook and then Jeff, Carrie, Tom and Rob, who will review our business highlights pipeline progress financial results and 2023 guidance in more detail. Today, we reported another strong quarter and a highly productive year for AbbVie. We delivered full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $13.77 reflecting double-digit growth. Total net revenues of more than $58 billion were up by 5.1% on an operational basis, driven by impressive growth from SKYRIZI and RINVOQ which generated nearly $7.7 billion of combined sales in 2022. As I reflect on our 10 years as an independent company, we have made excellent progress evolving AbbVie into a leading biopharmaceutical company. We have successfully created a well-diversified portfolio with multiple growth platforms in attractive and sustainable markets. This includes the rapid development and launch of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ across all of HUMIRA's major indications, plus a distinct new indication, atopic dermatitis. We anticipate these 2 products will collectively exceed the peak revenues achieved by HUMIRA by 2027 with significant growth expected through the end of the decade. We are also building a substantial portfolio of novel, heme and solid tumor assays for oncology. The anticipated launches and indication ramp of several new products like venetoclax in multiple myeloma and MDS, epacritumab across B-cell malignancies and Teliso-V, a new treatment option in non-small cell lung cancer will collectively support growth in the middle of the decade. We expect continued robust performance in neuroscience with our leading on-market portfolio to address migraine and psychiatric conditions as well as a promising pipeline for neurodegenerative diseases. And we see significant long-term growth potential for aesthetics, an extremely attractive market which is underpenetrated, where we have the leading position in toxins with BOTOX cosmetic and Fillers Rejuvido [ph]. Second, we've established a productive innovation-driven R&D organization with a robust pipeline. Our R&D engine has discovered and developed Five major billion-plus medicines over the past decade. We are committed to pursuing new ways to address patients' most serious health issues and have more than doubled our annual R&D investment since our inception. The breadth and the depth of our pipeline which now includes more than 80 programs across all development stages, further supports our long-term growth outlook. Lastly, we have maintained a strong financial position. to fully invest in innovative science and commercial initiatives across our therapeutic categories to drive long-term growth. We've also used that financial position to support a robust and growing dividend which we have increased by 270% since our inception. And we have also used it as capacity to pursue value-enhancing business development to augment our existing portfolio and pipeline. With these strong operating characteristics, we remain well positioned to absorb the impact of the HUMIRA LLE and quickly return to robust sales growth in 2025. As it pertains to AbbVie's near-term outlook, we anticipate 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $10.70 to $11.10. This guidance range contemplates, we expected headwind from direct biosimilar competition with U.S. HUMIRA sales down approximately 37% which is at the lower end of our previous erosion projection of 35% to 55%. Robust performance from SKYRIZI and RINVOQ which we expect will collectively generate $11.1 billion of revenue, reflecting year-over-year growth of nearly 45%. Revenue pressure in [indiscernible] with recent challenging market and share dynamics impacting IMBLUVICA, partially offset by strong sales growth of venetoclax. Double-digit revenue growth of neuroscience including accelerating sales of Vraylar with our recent MDD approval. Our guidance also contemplates the transient economic impact primarily in the U.S. on aesthetic procedure growth, affecting near-term performance for toxins, fillers and body contouring. Given that it's difficult to predict the duration of economic and inflationary pressures, we have not assumed the recovery in 2023. And finally, this guidance reflects increasing investments in both R&D and SG&A to support our long-term growth opportunities. It's also important to note that while it is possible 2023 could outperform our guidance, depending upon the shape of the HUMIRA erosion curve. We don't anticipate that 2024 earnings will be lower than the $10.70 for of the 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance which we are issuing today. In summary, we are executing well across our business and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.

ABBV,2023-02-09,2023-02-09,,2023-02-09,2023-02-09T09:00:00-05:00,0,2023-02-09,prepared,,Jeff Stewart,"Thank you, Rick. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology which delivered total revenues of more than $7.9 billion, up 19.5% on an operational basis. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are performing exceptionally well, contributing more than $2.3 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting operational growth of 70%. SKYRIZI continues to exceed our expectations, outperforming our initial full year guidance by more than $750 million. Global revenues this quarter were nearly $1.6 billion, up 12.8% on a sequential basis. SKYRIZI is achieving strong market share momentum globally with in-play psoriatic disease leadership in 24 countries and total market share leadership in more than a dozen key markets. In psoriasis, SKYRIZI's total prescription share of the U.S. biologic psoriasis market has increased to more than 28%. And there is substantial room for continued growth in psoriasis based on SKYRIZI's leading in-play share of new and switching patients which remains at nearly 50%. Psoriatic arthritis is also providing a nice inflection to SKYRIZI sales, especially in the U.S. Dermatology segment, where we have achieved approximately 10% share of the total biologic market. And we are also seeing encouraging SKYRIZI new patient starts in the U.S. room segment as well which accounts for more than 80% of all PSA treatments. SKYRIZI is being co-positioned with RINVO to rheumatologists where these 2 products combined have already achieved a leading in-play PSA room share of approximately 16%. In Crohn's disease, we are making excellent progress with the U.S. launch. Feedback from gastroenterologists has been very positive, especially as it relates to SKYRIZI's novel dosing and overall clinical profile. We recently started DTC promotion for this indication and are already achieving a total in-play patient share of more than 15%. Turning now to invoke which delivered global sales of $770 million, representing double-digit sequential growth. In rheumatology, global prescriptions are ramping nicely across RINVOQ's 4 approved indications, RA, PSA, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA. We continue to see positive market share momentum in both the U.S. and across key international geographies. In atopic dermatitis, RINVOQ is demonstrating strong uptake in both treatment naive and second-line patients globally. Feedback from the global derm community supports the importance of RINVOQ as a long-term chronic therapy to control atopic dermatitis, especially as it relates to skin clearance and rapid itch relief. RINVOQ AD prescriptions are trending up globally with 20% to 35% in-place shares across our major international markets and a mid-teens in-place share in the U.S. which are both tracking in line with our expectations. In gastroenterology, the launch trends for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis are very strong. Physicians have been pleased with RINVOQ's high rates of endoscopic healing as well as the speed of onset which has quickly resulted in RINVOQ achieving approximately 20% in-play share in the U.S. second line plus setting. Internationally, RINVOQ UC is now approved in 50 countries with reimbursement discussions progressing in line with our expectations. This strong adoption in UC amongst gastroenterologists is very encouraging for RINVOQ's potential in Crohn's disease as well. We are on track for U.S. and EMA regulatory decisions in the second quarter and are preparing for the commercial launch. Global HUMIRA sales were approximately $5.6 billion, up 6% on an operational basis with 9.9% growth in the U.S. partially offset by international, where revenues were down 16.9% operationally due to biosimilar competition. In the U.S., we have secured broad formulary access for HUMIRA encompassing more than 90% of all covered lives which enables us to compete for patient volume at parity to biosimilars. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.6 billion, down 11.2% on an operational basis. Imbruvica [ph] global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 19.5%. The U.S. performance continues to be impacted by challenging market and share dynamics attributed to the pace of COVID recovery as well as increasing competition. Venclexta global sales were $56 million, up 12.2% on an operational basis, with continued strong demand in both AML and CLL. We are particularly pleased with the international performance driven by robust share gains in the EU and across Asia. In neuroscience, revenues were $1.7 billion, up 5.1% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth. Sales of $565 million were up 15.5% on an operational basis, reflecting increasing market share, primarily in bipolar 1 disorder. Vraylar was also recently approved as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder, marking its fourth approved indication and adding a new substantial opportunity for long-term growth. We are very pleased with the AMDD label which confirms Vraylar's strong benefit risk profile, dosing flexibility with positive efficacy results for both the 1.5 and 3-milligram dose and the ability to reduce depressive symptoms as an add-on for the partial responders who present and this is important, with or without symptoms of anxiety. The AMDD launch is off to a strong start and we are already seeing a nice inflection in total new prescriptions in the marketplace. Within migraine, our leading oral CGRP portfolio contributed $249 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of nearly 30% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and QULIPTA. We are also pursuing in the U.S. commercial approval for QULIPTA as a preventative treatment for patients with chronic migraine which would further strengthen our competitive profile and uniquely position QULIPTA as the only oral CGRP available as a preventative treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine. Rounding out the migraine portfolio is BOTOX Therapeutic, a unique treatment with a dozen approved therapeutic indications and the clear branded leader in chronic migraine prevention. Total BOTOX Therapeutic sales were $728 million, up 10.7% on an operational basis. And last, we continue to prepare for the launch of ABBV-951 in both the U.S., Europe and Japan later this year. 951 represents a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease and a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. So overall, I'm pleased with the performance and the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics.

Full year 2022, global aesthetic sales were approximately $5.3 billion, reflecting growth of 5% on an operational basis. Global Botox cosmetic sales were approximately $2.6 billion, up nearly 21% operationally and global Juvederm sales were approximately $1.4 billion, down roughly 2% operationally. Our global aesthetics portfolio grew in 2022 despite several headwinds, most notably inflationary dynamics in the U.S., COVID-related lockdowns in China and suspension of our operations in Russia. In the U.S. we began to see a slowdown in aesthetic procedures in the second quarter of last year which coincided with the softening in economic metrics. These trends continued through the end of the year with the most significant impact on higher priced more deferrable procedures, including fillers and body contouring. Despite these economic pressures, U.S. Botox cosmetic sales grew approximately 16% in 2022, driven by strong first half sales with growth moderating over the remainder of the year. Similarly, U.S. Juvederm saw strong growth in the first quarter of the year but filler market declines throughout the second half of the year resulted in full year sales being down approximately 17% versus a robust 2021. We continue to track a number of key external economic metrics, including real personal consumption and the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index. While we have not seen major improvements in these metrics, data over the course of the last several months has shown stabilization. It remains difficult to predict the duration of these economic headwinds. But as Rick noted, we have modeled them to persist through the end of 2023. Our international aesthetics portfolio continued to demonstrate robust growth with the strong performance in most major markets, offsetting impacts from China and Russia. International Botox cosmetic sales of nearly $1 billion were up approximately 29% operationally and international Juvederm sales grew approximately 9% on an operational basis. We delivered this performance despite the significant headwinds we faced last year in our 2 largest international filler market, China and Russia. While our aesthetics portfolio in China continues to be impacted by COVID-related headwinds -- the current wave appears to have peaked. We expect the situation to improve through the first half of 2023 with full recovery in China beginning in the third quarter. Despite the transitory challenges we're facing, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our aesthetics portfolio. Consumers continue to be very interested in the aesthetics category and in our brands. We see substantial room for further market penetration across each of our aesthetics categories and are continuing to invest to support long-term growth. Our promotional efforts are focused on driving more consumers into our customers' offices while increasing retention and productivity of existing patients. We have built a best-in-class commercial technology team known for developing our consumer loyalty program, Eli. We have over 5 million consumers who use Eli and more than 20,000 of our customers' offices. We have a series of new technology products launching this year to drive growth in the aesthetics market and support our customers and consumers. Internationally, we are focused on markets with significant growth potential. We have increased investments in injector training and expanded our field force in China which is our second largest market. Latin America which is very aesthetically oriented and Japan which is growing rapidly and is expected to be one of our fastest-growing markets in 2023. Additionally, we are focused on delivering new product innovation. This year, we're launching 2 new fillers in the U.S., VOLUX for improvement of jawline which was approved late last year and Skin Vive for enhanced skin quality attributes, including hydration which is expected to be approved in the first half of 2023. We're also continuing to launch Harmonica, our hybrid bio-stimulatory HA filler in several international markets. The investments we're making to support long-term growth for our aesthetics portfolio, along with the stabilizing economic outlook and improving tobidynamics in China, leave us well positioned for future growth.

We expect significant program advancement across all stages of our pipeline this year. In immunology, we continue to make very good progress with programs in our core diseases as well as in adjacent areas of rheumatology and dermatology, where we are expanding our portfolio. We're nearing completion of SKYRIZI's registrational program in ulcerative colitis which is the last major indication expansion program for SKYRIZI. In the first half of this year, we'll see data from the Phase III induction and maintenance studies for SKYRIZI in ulcerative colitis with our regulatory submissions anticipated later this year. We'll also see data this year from our head-to-head comparison studies evaluating SKYRIZI versus other commonly used agents which we expect will further distinguish its profile from competitive offerings. These studies include our Phase III trial in Crohn's disease versus STELARA and our Phase III trial in psoriasis versus Otezla. Results from these studies will add to the body of evidence supporting SKARIZI as a best-in-category agent in these indications. We're also nearing completion of the core indication expansion programs for RINVOQ. Our regulatory applications for RINVOQ and Crohn's disease are under review and we anticipate approval decisions in the second quarter. RINVOQ demonstrated very strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement in our Phase III induction and maintenance studies and we believe RINVOQ will be an important new treatment option once approved in Crohn's disease. This is a market where approximately 80% of bioexperience patients have used the TNF inhibitor and there remains considerable unmet need for therapies that can deliver high rates of response and long-term remission. Beyond our core immunology indications, we're developing RINVOQ in several diseases where we've seen strong evidence that our JAK inhibitor has the potential to become a highly effective therapy. Our Phase III program is already underway in 1 of these indications, giant cell arteritis. And later this year, we plan to begin Phase III studies for 4 additional diseases, systemic lupus, hidradenitis suppurativa, vitiligo and alopecia areata. Moving now to our oncology portfolio, where we expect several important regulatory and clinical milestones this year. In the area of hematology oncology, we'll see data from several Phase III studies, including results from Venclexta's event-driven de novo trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a T114 mutation and Navitoclax' TRANSFORM-1 trial in frontline myelofibrosis. Results from these studies are expected to support regulatory submissions in the second half of the year for Venclexta and navitoclax in their respective indications. We also anticipate regulatory approval this year for epcoritamab in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma in several major geographies, including the U.S. in the second quarter and in Europe and Japan in the second half of the year. Based on the very deep and drillable responses demonstrated thus far in our clinical program, we believe that epcoritamab has the potential to significantly improve upon treatment options for these patients. We believe that epcoritamab has the potential to become a core therapy for B-cell malignancies. And we continue to make very good progress, expanding our development programs for epcoritamab across several indications. Over the course of 2023, we expect to begin several new studies, including a Phase III study in frontline DLBCL in combination with R-CHOP and multiple Phase II studies in CLL and MCL. We remain very excited about epcroritumab's potential to become a best-in-class therapy across multiple B-cell malignancies and look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Now moving our solid tumor pipeline. We remain on track to see data later this year from our Phase II study evaluating Teliso-V in second-line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. As a reminder, we received a breakthrough therapy designation for Teliso-V, our c-Met ADC, based on the encouraging results from Stage 1 of this Phase II study and the data we'll see later this year has the potential to support an accelerated approval. Our Phase III confirmatory study in patients with overexpressed c-MET is also ongoing. Treatment options for these cancer patients who have exhausted platinum-based chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy are very limited and prognosis for these patients is extremely poor. As a targeted therapy for patients with overexpressed cement which represents approximately 25% of the non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer population, we believe Teliso-V has the potential to become an important new treatment option for these patients. We're also making good progress with our next-generation c-MET ADC, ABBV-400 which utilizes a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload, to potentially drive deeper tumor responses as well as broaden the range of solid tumors where c-MET therapies can be used such as gastroesophageal and colorectal tumors. We expect to see early data from our Phase I program in 2024. Elsewhere in the solid tumor pipeline, we have begun to see encouraging data from several programs which we plan to advance into Phase II studies this year. Our anti-GARP antibody, ABBV-151 is showing strong signals of activity, including deep responses with prolonged durability. Based on this preliminary efficacy, we plan to initiate Phase II studies in several tumor types. We also plan to advance ABBV-647 into Phase II dose optimizing studies this year based on the promising results from our early stage program. This ADC targets PTK7 which is a subset of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and represents approximately 25% of patients and has little overlap with c-MetSo our c-Met ADCs and PTK7 ADC combined will target approximately 45% of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. Now moving to neuroscience, where we recently received FDA approval for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder which marks its fourth indication approval. We're very excited by this approval and pleased with the label which highlights Real or strong benefit risk profile in this indication. Vraylar is an important new treatment option for patients who are currently taking an antidepressant but continue to have unresolved depression symptoms. We also recently received approval in Japan for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. This innovative approach to delivering DUOPA-LIKE efficacy through a subcutaneous delivery system represents a potentially transformative improvement to current treatment options. With a less invasive, nonsurgical delivery system, it also has the potential to significantly expand the patient population currently addressed by DUOPA or other more invasive therapies for advanced PD patients such as deep brain stimulation. We remain on track for approval decisions this year in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we anticipate approval in the first half of the year, with product launch expected in the second half after we secured reimbursement. And in Europe, we anticipate approval in the fourth quarter of this year. And in the area of migraine, we remain on track for an FDA approval decision in the second quarter of this year for QULIPTA as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine. In Europe, we anticipate an approval decision in the third quarter for atogepant as a preventive treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine. If approved, this would be another differentiating feature for Lipa as it would be the only oral CGRP approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. This is a common and debilitating disease that significantly impacts quality of life and we look forward to make this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. And in our aesthetics pipeline, we expect to see results this year from several toxin programs including data from our Phase III study for Botox in platysma prominence with regulatory submission in the U.S. expected near the end of 2023 as well as data from our Phase III study for BOTOX in masseter muscle prominence, where we expect to submit regulatory applications in certain international markets in the second half of the year, including China and Canada. These 2 novel indications for prominent neck and jaw muscles will help to further build our portfolio in the lower phase segment. We'll also see data from our Phase III trial for Bot-AE or short-acting toxin in glabellar lines near the end of this year with regulatory applications plan for 2024. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones again in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2023 financial outlook.

These results include a $0.13 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $15.1 billion, up 3.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 2.2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 52.1% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 86% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.5% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.6% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 20.8% of sales. Net interest expense was $476 million and the adjusted tax rate was 13.4%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2023. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $10.70 and $11.10. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect net revenues of approximately $52 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect immunology sales of $24.8 billion, including SKYRIZI sales of $7.4 billion, reflecting growth of more than $2.2 billion due to strong market share performance across all approved indications. RINVOQ revenue of $3.7 billion, reflecting growth of more than 45% with continued indication expansion and HUMIRA sales of $13.7 billion, including U.S. erosion of 37% and following a loss of exclusivity in late January. With 1 biosimilar currently in the market and potentially 9 more biosimilars available in the middle of the year, we anticipate that sales erosion will be more heavily weighted towards the second half of 2023. In hematologic oncology, we expect VENCLEXTA sales of $2.2 billion and [indiscernible] revenue of $3.5 billion. For aesthetics, we expect sales of $5.2 billion, including $2.5 billion from Botox Cosmetic and $1.4 billion from Juvederm, with growth rates expected to improve when we lap the market slowdown in the middle of the year. For neuroscience, we expect revenue of $7.2 billion representing growth of more than 10%, including Botox Therapeutic sales of $2.8 billion, Vraylar sales of $2.5 billion and total oral CGRP revenue of $1.1 billion, including Ubrelvy growth of approximately 17.5%. For eye care, we expect sales of $2.2 billion and we expect Mavyret revenue of $1.4 billion. Moving to the P&L for 2023. We are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of $6.8 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of $12.4 billion. We forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of 47% of sales. This profile includes a 70 basis point benefit that is fully offset in tax expense given the transition of Puerto Rico's excise tax to an income tax effective at the beginning of this year. We expect adjusted net interest expense of $1.8 billion and we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be 15.3%, including an impact of 1.3 points from the Puerto Rico tax transition. Finally, we expect our share count to be roughly flat to 2022. Turning to the first quarter. We anticipate net revenues of $11.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas. Immunology sales of $5.5 billion which includes U.S. HUMIRA erosion of 27%, Oncology revenue of $1.4 billion. Aesthetic sales approaching $1.2 billion; Neuroscience revenue of $1.5 billion; and eye care sales approaching $600 million. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of 46% of sales and we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 13.3%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.39 and $2.49. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of nearly $19 billion in 2023 which is net of $1.4 billion in SKYRIZI royalty payments. This cash flow will fully support a strong and growing dividend which we have increased by 270% since inception, continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down $4 billion in maturities this year bringing our cumulative debt reduction to $34 billion. Our strong cash flow also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, we are very pleased with AbbVie's strong results in 2022. And with our diverse portfolio, we continue to be well positioned to deliver long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.",746.0,420.0,10.0,8.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.01904761904761905,0.02857142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.004761904761904762

So AbbVie -- when we talk to investors, AbbVie has always been 1 of those. The R&D as a percent of sales has always been low. And right now, even it is still less than 15% and that's the pushback we get that the company cannot grow organically. And in some ways, you have always been playing defensive given that since inception, HUMIRA has always been an issue. Now that you're beginning to get past that, do you think something you'll change -- you want to change fundamentally with the company and the way you allocate internal versus external R&D spend? That would be very helpful.",117.0,50.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.06,0.02,0.0,0.0,-0.06

I think there's a number of dynamics that play into it. when you look at our R&D expense as a profile. One is, obviously, we have a large volume of HUMIRA revenue that requires relatively little R&D support. And so that obviously dilutes out the profile of the business. As we see biosimilar impact, obviously, there will be some impact on that as you know, our revenues were to go down. The second thing is the aesthetics business, we're funding it aggressively to grow it. But by definition, it's not that expensive to be able to fund many of those programs. So it has a much lower profile. So some of it is mix when you think about it. The second thing I'd say is we obviously fund R&D at a level that we believe we can drive productivity. And I think if you look at our productivity over the last 10 years, the data I've seen suggests we are 1 of the most productive R&D engines in the industry. Certainly, when you look at products like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, the return on those assets is tremendous. The third thing I'd say is, look, what drives R&D expense to the greatest extent is when you have large volumes of Phase III programs. And we're coming into a phase as we move forward over the next 3 or 4 years, where we have a number of programs that if they are successful, they will create a scenario where we will increase R&D. So an example of that would be our GARP program. We've seen some incredibly encouraging data out of that program thus far to next-generation immuno-oncology program. That combines with checkpoint inhibitors. And if that program continues to advance the way we see it now, we would want to expand our as our Phase II and then Phase III trials in that program significantly across the relatively broad range of solid tumors. That will require a significant increase in investment to be able to do that. So we tend to drive R&D based on programs that we have a high level of confidence can be productive and can be successful. And we don't constrain R&D in any way from that perspective. Another program will be our AbbVie program. If that program proves to deliver high rates of amyloid reduction and low REA. That will be another program that we want to rapidly move into Phase III. And so I can tell you, I'm very comfortable with the productivity we're getting out of R&D. Certainly, we will want to continue to increase that and that's 1 of our objectives. We always look at programs on the outside to bring them in. And in fact, I'd say over the last couple of years, we brought in a number of programs that are earlier stage programs. And we're fortunate from the standpoint that we have the ability to drive very strong growth, as we've indicated to investors between now and the end of this decade. We can drive high single-digit growth. We're going to return to robust growth in '25. So we're looking mostly for assets that will allow us to drive growth in that late 20s and early 30s time frame. So again, as those mature and they're successful and they go into later-stage development programs, they will drive further need for investment.",602.0,255.0,11.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,0.043137254901960784,0.00784313725490196,0.00784313725490196,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.03529411764705882

If you look at this year's guide, it's a great example of our willingness to increase R&D investment where it's needed. So if you look at we're increasing it from $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion. Those increases are focused on epcoritamab as well as midstage assets such as GARP and PTK7. We also have several new Phase III studies for additional RINVOQ indications which could contribute several billion dollars of revenue in the latter half of the decade.

I think last year, performance was choppy across a number of different franchises. So as you thought about the guidance this year, anything different as you approached it? And then my second question is any other details you can provide on how you're thinking about HUMIRA in 2024.

I think whenever we look at guidance, we look at it and I think this has been our historical practice. We obviously look at guidance as something that we have a very high level that we can execute against that guidance. I would say this year, you've seen that the range is a little bit wider than what we normally project. And we did that based on the fact that as HUMIRA goes biosimilar, obviously, very small changes in the assumptions we're making on erosion for HUMIRA can have a fairly significant impact. So we're right in the range by about $0.10. and that's reflected in this guidance. And so I would say that as we have in historically, we have a high level of confidence we're going to deliver on this guidance. As it relates to 2024, we have provided as part of this guidance, what we are projecting to be a floor because we've gotten a lot of requests from investors about when will we hit the trough and will it be '23 or will it be '24? So maybe to give you a little color around how we think about that. One, the $10.70 is a floor. That doesn't mean that we will go down to $10.70 but it means that we would say to investors that, that's what you should assume is the absolute floor. Now when will that or if it were to occur, when we occur? Will we see the drop in 2023? Or will we see the trough in 2024. And I would tell you that our expectations would be based on this plan, the trough should occur in 2023. But what I would tell you is if we significantly overachieved this plan into 2023 and there's obviously somewhat greater risk it could move into '24. The reason why it is in '23 versus '24 based on our current planning assumptions, is because the strength of the growth platform has the ability between where it will grow in '23 and where we're growing 24% to offset what will obviously be further erosion of HUMIRA in 2024. 2024, you will basically have to impacts on HUMIRA. You will have the annualization of this year. And as Rob said in his remarks, we expect more of an impact in the second half of '23. So when you annualize that, you're going to have an impact that flows through to '24. And then we would expect further erosion of HUMIRA, both price and probably to a greater extent, volume in 2024. But the growth platform has the ability to grow through that based on those assumptions. And so that's the philosophy that we operate with on the guidance.

I think 2022 is an exception. And if you look at on the top line now, we didn't make earnings. So that's important to highlight. If you look at the top line, the 2 biggest factors that drove the miss versus original guidance in 2022 were with Imbruvica and Venclexta, the CLO market, we did not anticipate that, that market would actually not recover. I mean that's -- it's down 20% versus pre-pandemic levels. And then we did see some additional share impact on IMBRUVICA. And then aesthetics, we saw, obviously, in the month of May, we started to see a slowdown in the economy. We had a very strong first quarter. So both of those things really are what drove the top line miss, we made earnings. Now we have factored both those things in the 2023 guidance to give investors confidence that we said it appropriately.

It seems like you're still going to have about a $12 billion U.S. HUMIRA franchise here. So can you just provide maybe a little bit more color of what you're envisioning 2024 to look like for HUMIRA? Like is it reasonable to think about the down 35% to 40% year as we look out to '24. I think we just turn your hands around just the how much growth in that core platform and how much of a headwind, I guess, HUMIRA is going to be facing at the same time. My second question was just on aesthetics trends as we move through this year. You've talked about some signs of at least sequential stability the last few quarters. You're talking about stepping up investments. You've got a couple of new products launching. I guess why shouldn't we think about some recovery in this business as we look out to the second half of the year?",172.0,70.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,0.04285714285714286,0.0,0.0,0.0

We're 2 weeks into the biosimilar activity. So it's a little difficult to give you precise predictions or 2024. I think the way to think about HUMIRA going forward is what we would expect is the most significant impact on HUMIRA is going to be price. And obviously, we're trying to predict going forward what that price will look like. Certainly, as we look at this year, the most significant impact is clearly price. So that's more predictable because we obviously know what the pricing is in the contracts that we've put together. And so I think that's something that we have a high level of confidence. There will be further pressure on price as we move into '24 and there'll probably be further pressure on volume in '24d. But I would say, at the end of '24, I would expect HUMIRA to start to develop a more stable tail of revenue. It will still have some pressure as we move in '25 but '25 and '26 is where we should see that more stable tail for HUMIRA emerge. And that's 1 of the things that allows us to be able to see the underlying growth from the growth platform. So a number of things happen between '23 and '24 and then '25 as we move forward. As you mentioned in your second comment, we would certainly expect that the U.S. economy will start to recover in '24. It may recover earlier than that. And if it does, that would be great. We don't want to put a plan together to assume that because obviously, that's difficult for us to predict. But I think we would all expect that 24 will see a recovery in the U.S. economy. And we would fully expect for the aesthetics business to return back to historical growth rates very quickly when that happens. And so that will be another opportunity for that business to be able to grow. And then I would say Imbruvica is the other key issue for us. as we move forward. We would expect the majority of the erosion that we see on Imbruvica will occur this year and there will be less downward pressure as we move to '24. So that's what allows the growth to be able to come up. What I would tell you even though I don't want to make a; prediction in '24 of what HUMIRA will look like. I think we have a high level of confidence that we have the ability if the erosion curve looks like how we've modeled it now between '23 and '24 that we have the ability to be able to have the growth platform and go through that. So we can absorb that impact. And so far, like I said, it's early on but I'd say so far, we're comfortable with how things are playing out.

I mean the thing to highlight for this year for '23, the way you think about HUMIRA really in the first half of the year, the vast majority of that erosion will be priced. In the second half, you'll see because we've contracted rebates, you'll see a step-up in the price erosion, although you also will see more volume with biosimilars coming in the market in the middle of the year, we would expect more volume erosion. I think as we think about '24, we would expect, based on the contract to see a step up in price but albeit not at the same level as we see in '23 but '24 would be more volume. It's probably the best way to think about it right now.

And so that remains a strong opportunity the now and in the future. But what we saw as we exited 2022 is as these economic metrics were softening, we also saw that reflected in demand for aesthetic procedures. And in our conversations with customers, we saw that reflected in their practices, market research with consumers, where they said, yes, we're interested in the category but we want to see what's going on with the economy, perhaps before a new patient might want to enter the category.

In terms of the Vraylar adoption trend, we had discussed previously because we really have very, very strong access for Vraylar that we would anticipate a pretty rapid inflection in adoption for the depression indication, the adjunctive depression indication. As I mentioned in my remarks, that's what we've seen. So we're quite encouraged. I mean we can see a significant trend break on the new prescription adoption versus what was already a very nice growth rate for the bipolar 1 indication.

And we're also fortunate that after HUMIRA, we have a -- relative to our peers, we have a very low LOE [ph] exposure. So we don't have a lot of downward pressure on the business. Now having said that, we've done an excellent job of paying down the incremental debt from the Allergan transaction, we put that $2 billion cap in place when we did the Allergan acquisition that allowed us to focus again on some earlier-stage assets. And I'd remind everyone that was about 4x what our historical practice has been for those kinds of assets. So there was plenty of capacity to do that. But we're certainly in a position now that if the right thing were to come along, we could do a transaction that would be much larger. We certainly have the financial wherewithal to be able to do that. And we've certainly shown that we were able to do that and create value in the assets that we bring in. The areas that we typically look at are aligned with our therapeutic growth areas. So immunology, oncology, certain areas of neuroscience and eye care, I would say, are the predominant areas as well as aesthetics. We obviously continue to look for opportunities in the states. They tend to be smaller acquisitions, though. And so at the end of the day, I feel good about where we are and we've been quite active. We have a very active business development group. And we'll continue to look at those. And like I said, we find something that's of interest and it could really help us round out a category that we're in, then you should expect us to act on that.",424.0,175.0,10.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.05714285714285714,0.005714285714285714,0.022857142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.05142857142857143

I think the way to think about '24 -- clearly, as we go through the year, we always look at the trends and contemplate what that could mean for flow through in '24. But the reason we gave you that guidance range, we mentioned the $10.70 [ph] being the way to think about it as a floor for '24 is because of the dynamics around the HUMIRA erosion. So if we do better in '23 and more of it happens in '24, then you can at least anchor back to we're not going to fall below that $10.70 EPS floor in our guidance range. So we always would factor in trends but that's the way to think about it. If it's just the erosion on HUMIRA is better this year than we have in this guidance.

I think you should think about HUMIRA in '24. We believe we're going to get to a certain level of price and volume in '24, almost regardless of what happens in 2013 because of the competitive dynamic. And so when we talk about the shift, what we're really talking about is inflating '23. If you anchor '24 is a solid point that we have a high level of confidence of where HUMIRA's tail will be in '24.

So we said for the first quarter, we said it would be 27% erosion. And so -- and that's going to -- the vast majority of that will be priced. And we said because there'll be 9 biosimilars coming to market in the middle of the year, we would expect more of the erosion to come in the second half of the year. So you have to factor that dynamic into the way you look at the quarters that there'll be more erosion in the second half of the year for HUMIRA versus the first half of the year. Then you also have to factor in that you've got things like aesthetics, we haven't quite lapped the economic impact yet, right? So in the first quarter, you have a dynamic where you will see aesthetics still down, right? But when we get into the middle of the year, when we lap it, that also affects your year-over-year growth rates. And then, the underlying performance of the growth platform as we continue to drive those brands, you'll see those growth rates accelerate. So those are all the things that would factor as you look at the quarterly -- really, we've given you Q1 and then full year. We haven't given you Q2, 3 and 4. But that -- those are the variables I would look at. There's not really a whole lot in terms of if you look at investment, for example, that you have to flex. We do tend to see some higher levels typically in the fourth quarter. So, you could -- you could look at historically our investment patterns and use that as a proxy.

The U.S. HUMIRA erosion guidance of minus 37% in '23. How much of that is price versus volume? If I look at what your Q1 U.S. HUMIRA erosion is, so the guidance is minus 27%. Given that volumes for HUMIRA are, call it, 5% positive, that would suggest the price cuts may be in the 30% to 35% range. So can we triangulate off of the Q1 guidance to understand what percent of that minus 37% comes from price? And then the second question, again, goes back to 2024. I know there's lots of uncertainty on the exact rate of erosion for HUMIRA '23. But if you hit that minus 37% right on the nose, would 2024 erosion likely be slower or faster than net minus 37%.",135.0,55.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.12727272727272726,0.05454545454545454,0.0,0.0,-0.10909090909090909

The way to think about it is in the first half of the year, the 27% in the first quarter, is the vast majority of that is price, right? So there is some volume impact but not very much. it's in the second half, what you'll see is in the second half, the overall erosion will step up and think of it as equivalent between price and volume because you're going to have -- we know we'll have rebate rates in some cases, increasing as well as the biosimilars coming to market, we expect to see more volume erosion. So as you think about -- as you're trying to triangulate the price volume with the guidance you've given, 27% vast majority's price, second half of the year, you'll have some more volume kicking in.

And I think Tom mentioned there's still incredible interest in a next wave of dermatologic indications that follow on for atopic dermatitis that he highlighted. And really, as I noted in my remarks, I mean, the amount of excitement around the IL-23 and particularly our IL-23 across these indications is really profound. Now having said that, we are watching the competitive landscape for some maybe potentially some novel orals. We don't see them as major players. As we look deeper in the pipeline, we can see that there is the possibility for combination use of novel biologics or biomarker-driven approaches, particularly in IBD.

So the bar is getting higher and we will continue to do that. But even to show that we're raising the bar, we're also going to do -- we're going to read out head-to-head studies this year with STELARA and Otezla. So another way to kind of show that what we have is really very profound in terms of responses we're seeing with patients. And we continue -- I mean, honestly, we look at the field. We look at competitors. We're hearing data of S1P1 inhibitors but the data appears to be less effective based on a number of patients which are discontinuing treatment and the signals that we see cardiovascular and others that are similar to what we've seen with previous ones. So I mean, again, without having seen the data, it's all difficult to kind of predict how they'll be able to do accept that our data with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI are very strong, durable and again, very strong at the level of endoscopy also. So we think we have already a competitive edge. We continue we'll see PMR data later this year. We have talked about our RIPK1 inhibitor, again, from the coal healing that's in the clinic right now. We're looking at additional indications. So over time, obviously, we're going to look at additional mechanisms. But not necessarily just pushing down on the same cytokines as JAKs but looking at other target pathways of things that happen in the scan or in GI, again, mucosal healing being an tool pathway.

I mean they really are setting different standards of care versus what they've seen in the past. And certainly, the physicians and the payers are recognizing this. I'll give a really quick example on 1 of our major products which is RINVOQ. I mean RINVOQ, based on the label changes that have taken place is already a post-TNF type of dynamic. And so the pricing is going to be the pricing there's no incremental ability to step it, for example. The other thing I would note is on SKYRIZI, we have 4 head-to-head trials against all the major competitors and another one coming with Otezla, as Tom noted. So you start to see that level of performance, whether it's against STELARA, multiple TNFs. Otezla, as I said, that's pending here. And it just becomes very clear that you're just going to achieve much higher levels of clearance and relief.

And frankly, it was a policy decision because we really think that the U.K. government needs to reform that VPaaS. They didn't plan properly for how things might dynamically evolve in the U.K. and it's a very substantial part of the revenue now that is causing problems, I think, across all of the company. So it was a position of policy position, net neutral. It didn't matter, frankly, whether we were in or not and the U.K. is a relatively modest business for us. We are seeing perhaps more importantly, some changes in the German law, as you're probably aware of. And that is, I think, a modest net pressure that will come in Europe in Germany, in particular, because there's the move, as you may know, from 1 year of free pricing to 6 months.

And ultimately, we made the decision around pharma based on that. We have a very significant government affairs group that's been active and been in place ever since we came into existence. Back in 2013, we've grown that organization. We did grow it somewhat this year as well in anticipation of not being part of pharma. We plan on being active as we have been in the past to try to appropriately advocate for things that we think are appropriate for patients.

Rick, on your comments on the HUMIRA scale for starting next year in the U.S. I think when you look at other geographies, international revenues, you're still seeing double-digit declines after 4 years or so. Maybe just give us some context for what you're seeing there broadly versus what we could expect for the U.S. And just to be clear, when you see next year the impact from all the HUMIRA biosimilars, how much do you think that biosimilar STELARA may play a role here when you look at your assumptions for HUMIRA erosion? And then second question, just on the BD front, you guys talked about some of the therapeutic categories that you're interested in.

In other words, we're going to see erosion in 2024. I want to make sure I didn't somehow communicate that, that wasn't the case. So if you look at OUS, I think what's probably deceiving to you is you had different countries going biosimilar at different periods in time. So you can't necessarily look at that as an analog because it's so heterogeneous in the year that those countries went biosimilars. So you are correct. Yes, it is still experiencing double-digit decline but it's been driven by the fact that those countries have not -- some of those countries haven't reached stability yet. But typically -- and the U.S. market is a little different because you have all a large number -- you have a small number of large payers who drive the bulk of the activity in this market. So, it's more like some of the countries that did other kinds of government-wide activity, like in Germany as an example. And there, we do see after a couple of years, we've seen stability. So I think what's misleading you is you're looking at the overall number but you're not factoring into that, the fact that these countries went biosimilar across a number of years.",254.0,100.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.03,0.04,0.02,0.0,0.0,-0.01

So that's something to keep in mind that that's a dynamic that's also playing out for HUMIRA in those markets.

Certainly, we've not seen anything like the 9 that we were -- 9 or 10 [ph] that we're going to see on HUMIRA. And so -- and that price point is quite high actually. If you look at where Stellar is now with the branded program. Now I think maybe more importantly, as we've highlighted before, we've anticipated that entry. And certainly, in Crohn's, we have an ongoing head-to-head trial against STELARA that will read out towards the end of the year. We plan on putting that into promotion if and we believe it will be positive, particularly what we're studying which is that endoscopic endpoint which is really becoming the standard in the gastroenterology space.

So if you think about it, you mentioned immunology as an example. I would say in immunology, we have 2 fundamental objectives that we're trying to drive. There are still areas within immunology, where we believe we can significantly raise the effectiveness of the therapies that are used on patients to drive higher levels of remission or higher levels of endoscopic healing. In other words, better clinical outcomes within the areas that we're in. And so we have a tremendous amount of effort in those areas to bring next-generation assets or as Tom mentioned in his comments, there are opportunities to potentially combine 2 mechanisms together to achieve that level of therapeutic benefit. But then we look outside those areas at the adjacencies. And we look for where are the opportunities for us to be able to bring in either an existing mechanism or something we can either develop within our own discovery group or something that we can acquire on the outside as a mechanism that we don't currently have. But we tend to look for where there are areas of large unmet needs and relatively significant patient populations. So, I use 2 examples to illustrate. Vitiligo. Vitiligo is a disease that's very prevalent. There aren't good therapeutic options in it today at all. We do believe there are mechanisms that will allow you to effectively treat vitiligo. If those are effective, that could be a very significant opportunity overtime. Alopecia is another good example of that. So that's how we focus BD in these areas.

I just had some -- I want to follow up on, you mentioned Vitiligo. With the competition with topical rux [ph] which might have a first mover advantage and then they have an oral as well in Pfizer. How do you see the opportunity for you in vitiligo for RINVOQ? Can it compete? And then my second question last earnings call, you highlighted your GARP TGF beta. So that's 151.

I would certainly say a topical has a place but it is difficult for people that have large areas of their bodies that are impacted by something like vitiligo for a topical to be a manageable therapy for those patients. So an oral for those patients that have more severe disease typically has greater benefit and frankly, better compliance among those patients which ultimately gives you better clinical outcomes. So I think the RINVOQ will stack up against whoever the competitive alternatives are based on the data.

When we look at the valuation of, for example, that indication or HS or alopecia which again are those derm oriented indications that will follow on pretty quickly in the middle of the decade on top of atopic dermatitis. We do exactly what Rick highlighted. We will segment the patients based on the body surface area. We know that the topicals will be important for a certain percentage of population. For example, if it's maybe highly located to the face, that might be more appropriate, at least as the first course of action. But we do believe that in almost all indications that we've looked at for RINVOQ, it just performs exceptionally well in the clinic. And we would anticipate that as well above a base case scenario. Perfect example is Crohn's disease. There will not be another JAK inhibitor in Crohn's disease for the United States just because they just don't work.

Again, we'll see the data, we will report on another quarter call. Thank you, Robin, for the second question. Yes, TGF-beta is a known tumor suppressive pathway and people have tried to drug it to increase the response to immunotherapies. The first-generation TGF-beta because the target is so many parts of the body, you actually have effects, the cardiovascular effects having related to the TGF-beta activity in some of the endothelial cells in the valves and so on of the heart. Here, we're using GARP as our target. GARP is actually a receptor for TGF-beta that's called latent inactive that GARP sound only on Treg cells, a little bit on some fiber some store sales but it's not some in the heart or other tissues. That's what gives us our safety profile and the ability to causing a suppression on Treg cells found in tumor cells as opposed to other places in the body. So that we felt from the beginning was the attribute we needed to go to target this pathway would be something that will be tumor selective and that's what we've been able to see so far.",268.0,115.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.017391304347826087,0.017391304347826087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

So we've actually continued expanding studying CRC but we did see responses in liver cancer where we expected to see it based on expression of TGF-beta. We did see it in bladder cancer and we're expanding in those indications at this point.

So the when you run these patients in, you could have discontinuation rates. And if you include them or not include them, it's going to impact what happens post run in. So for example, when you see our data set, we count the run-in discontinuation and post run-in as you get into the main part of the trial. So you see that in the 20 percentile range or so. And that's fairly consistent with what you would see with a subcutaneous infusion. And it's not clear to us how that data, as you're speaking about is reported. Also, we don't know if that's more than 1 injection is that 2 injections and is it rotated daily. I can tell you about 951. We have dosing exposure that gets up to DUOPA unique from DUOPA to 24 hours. It's a single injection and you can leave it in for 72 hours.",240.0,90.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.0,0.0,-0.022222222222222223

I'm extremely pleased with our start to 2023. With first quarter total revenues and adjusted earnings per share both exceeding our expectations. This performance was driven by double-digit sales growth from several key products, including Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta and Vraylar. Positive momentum from our aesthetics business with strong results internationally and stabilizing consumer trends in the U.S. and in line performance from U.S. Humira where biosimilar erosion is tracking as expected with much of the impact driven by price. Since our inception, we have successfully created a well-diversified portfolio with multiple growth platforms in highly attractive markets, including immunology, hematological oncology, neuroscience and aesthetics. Our commercial execution, including the launch of new products and expanded indications has been outstanding, especially across Skyrizi and Rinvoq and recently with Vraylar and MDD. Each of these assets are expected to contribute significant revenue growth over the decade. The breadth and the depth of our R&D pipeline also supports our long-term growth outlook and we anticipate numerous important pipeline milestones over the next 2 years. In summary, we are 1 quarter into the U.S. biosimilar event for Humira and are managing the erosion well. Most importantly, our growth platform is demonstrating strong performance, exceeding our expectations. We are executing well across all aspects of our business and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance.

We're off to an excellent start in 2023 with each of our 5 key therapeutic areas meeting or exceeding our first quarter expectations, a testament to the strength of our broad portfolio. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $12.2 billion, approximately $400 million ahead of our expectations. First quarter results include continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which remain on track to contribute more than $11 billion in combined sales this year. Growth rates in the first quarter for both products are consistent with our full year expectations. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating momentum across all approved indications and we expect to round out their opportunities in IBD later this year. This includes Rinvoq's anticipated U.S. approval in Crohn's disease as well as Skyrizi's European launch in Crohn's and its global regulatory submission in UC. We are also performing exceptionally well in neuroscience. Total net revenues this quarter were nearly $200 million above our guidance with Vraylar sales accelerating following MDD approval and migraine delivering strong growth. As a result, we will be increasing our full year outlook for neuroscience. Aesthetics is also performing better than expected. We are seeing positive recovery trends in China and some stability in the U.S. market, where we are closely monitoring several economic indicators that correlate with aesthetics procedures, including consumer confidence, personal consumption and Google searches. Although it's still early in the year, these positive trends, especially across our international markets, give us the confidence to increase our full year outlook for aesthetics as well. This continues to be an underpenetrated market with significant growth potential. Based on our robust performance this quarter and the continued strong outlook for our business, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.72 and $11.12. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with the performance of our diverse portfolio. We're off to a strong start to the year, which further reinforces our confidence in the long-term outlook of the business.

I'm very pleased with the strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. Immunology delivered total revenues of approximately $5.6 billion with continued robust double-digit growth from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Skyrizi global sales were nearly $1.4 billion, reflecting operational growth of more than 46%, despite retail inventory destocking in the quarter. Skyrizi is the clear market leader in the U.S. biologic psoriasis market with a total prescription share now at 30%. In psoriasis, Skyrizi has set a very high bar relative to other therapies on the market or in development with differentiated attributes across the categories that physicians and patients deem most important. This includes the rapid onset of action after the first dose, nearly complete skin clearance with multifold higher rates on PASI 90 and PASI 100. High durability of response, which we have demonstrated can increase over time as well as quarterly dosing for maintenance therapy, a convenient alternative to daily oral or more frequently administered injectables. With a nearly 50% U.S. in-play share of new and switching patients, there is substantial room for Skyrizi's continued growth in psoriasis. This best-in-class profile is supporting strong momentum now in psoriatic arthritis with Skyrizi achieving an in-play biologic share of roughly 20% in the U.S. dermatology segment. Skyrizi is also being co-positioned with Rinvoq in the U.S. room segment in PSA where we are seeing increasing utilization among rheumatologists as well. Globally, Skyrizi has achieved in-play psoriatic disease leadership in more than 25 countries and total market share leadership in nearly 20 of those key markets. In Crohn's disease, we are seeing very fast adoption of Skyrizi in the U.S., with a total in-play patient share at approximately 20%, second only to STELARA. Feedback from gastroenterologists is very positive, especially as it relates to Skyrizi's novel dosing and overall clinical profile. We see strong uptake in Japan and Canada as well with the European launch forthcoming. We also recently reported strong induction data for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which Tom will discuss momentarily. Based on the results of that trial, it is increasingly clear that Skyrizi represents a differentiated asset across inflammatory bowel disease and we look forward to bringing this potential new indication to physicians and patients next year. Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $686 million, reflecting operational growth of more than 50% despite similar retail inventory destocking in the quarter. I'm very pleased with the performance in rheumatology with total prescriptions increasing across each of the 4 approved indications. Atopic dermatitis is also tracking in line with our expectations. We continue to see market share momentum globally, including in-play patient share increasing to approximately 17% in the U.S. We are very excited about the growth potential in gastroenterology. Rinvoq has set a high bar for efficacy in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, demonstrating strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement. We're seeing very strong momentum in UC, where adoption has been robust. Rinvoq is now achieving a 23% in-play share in the U.S. second-line plus setting, reflecting an impressive ramp since our launch in UC less than 1 year ago. This accelerated adoption among gastroenterologists is very encouraging for Rinvoq's pending outlook in Crohn's. We are currently launching this indication in the EU, a geography where Rinvoq is the only JAK approved to treat both IBD conditions, and we remain on track for CD approval and commercialization in the U.S. later this quarter with broad formulary access anticipated to ramp quickly over the back half of this year. So we see inflammatory bowel disease continues to be an area of high unmet need. Having 2 novel therapies in IBD with Skyrizi and Rinvoq that each deliver differentiated levels of efficacy is an important step forward for patients. And with these 2 complementary assets, we are very well positioned to compete against other oral or biological agents. Global Humira sales were approximately $3.5 billion, down 24.3% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. remains in line with our expectations with most of the impact driven by price. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.4 billion with continued pressure on Imbruvica, partially offset by robust double-digit growth with Venclexta. Imbruvica global revenues were $878 million, down 25.2% due to increasing competition and the cumulative impact of a suppressed market. Venclexta global sales were $538 million, up 17.5% on an operational basis with strong momentum across both AML and CLL. In neuroscience, revenues were approximately $1.7 billion, up 15% on an operational basis. Vraylar is performing exceptionally well. Sales of $561 million were up 31.3% on an operational basis, above our expectations. We are very pleased with the AMDD label and the launch, which has resulted in a significant uplift in total new prescriptions for Vraylar. With a dedicated sales force that calls on both psychiatrists and primary care as well as ramping DTC promotion, we see an opportunity for accelerated growth across all approved indications. And we will be raising our full year guidance for Vraylar accordingly. Within migraine, we remain uniquely positioned with a portfolio to support complete migraine freedom. Our leading oral CGRP therapies contributed $218 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of more than 45% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. We recently expanded the label for Qulipta, which is now uniquely positioned as the only oral CGRP available as a preventative treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine further strengthening our competitive profile. Lastly, total Botox Therapeutic sales were $719 million, reflecting strong performance in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics.

First quarter Global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.3 billion, which came in ahead of our guidance, primarily due to a faster reopening in China as well as a slightly stronger economy in the U.S. versus our planning assumption. In the U.S., aesthetics sales were $777 million, down 8.1% as we continue to see softness in aesthetics procedures related to inflationary dynamics. As a reminder, we saw a very robust performance for our U.S. performance in the first quarter of 2022, which created difficult comparison for growth in the first quarter of this year. U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $409 million, down slightly on a year-over-year basis. We continue to see a lesser impact from inflationary dynamics on Botox Cosmetic compared to other areas of our aesthetics portfolio due to its relatively lower price point and large install base of loyal repeat consumers. The U.S. cosmetic toxin market was down low single digits in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. Botox Cosmetic continues  be the clear market leader and its share of the U.S. toxin market remains stable. Sales for our U.S. Juvederm collection were down 18% as our dermal filler portfolio continues to be impacted by inflationary pressure on consumer spending. The U.S. filler market was down nearly 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent inflationary environment. Our Juvederm collection remains the clear market leader and share was stable in the quarter. The economic pressure on our U.S. dermal filler business is partially offset in the quarter by strong initial uptake for our recently launched Volux filler, which is approved for the improvement of jawline definition. We expect Volux combined with the upcoming launch of our skin quality injectable [ Skinvive ] to support long-term growth for our filler portfolio in the U.S. While the aesthetics category in the U.S. continues to be challenged due to the fast economy, the key external economic metrics that we track have remained relatively consistent with year-end 2022 levels. Our international aesthetics portfolio continues to demonstrate robust growth with strong performance in Japan, which is rapidly growing and China, which is recovering faster than expected. Sales from our international aesthetics portfolio were $523 million, up 7.8% on an operational basis. International Botox Cosmetics sales grew approximately 17.5% operationally, and international Juvederm sales were down approximately 1.4% on an operational basis. China, which is our second largest market, was negatively impacted by COVID in January and February, but experienced a sharp recovery in March. We expect this level of activity to be sustained throughout the remainder of the year. Recall, our original guidance assumed we would not reach a full recovery until the second half of this year. And in Japan, which is an underdeveloped market and proving to be very responsive to promotion, we continue to make significant investments in injector training, our field force and consumer education. Overall, we are pleased with how our team has been executing through this dynamic environment and remain encouraged by improving trends internationally and stabilization across our U.S. portfolio. These positive trends and continued strong momentum give us the confidence to increase the full year outlook for our aesthetics business. Longer term, we remain extremely confident in our ability to grow the aesthetics business and continue to expect to achieve total sales of more than $9 billion by the end of this decade. Aesthetics continues to be an extremely attractive underpenetrated market and our proven ability to drive consumer demand and develop a strong base of loyal customers as well as bring innovative new products to the market will support robust growth over the long term.

In immunology, we recently received European approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease, making it the first JAK inhibitor approved for this indication. We continue to anticipate FDA approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease next month. We also recently announced positive top line results from our Phase III induction study for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which is a disease with unpredictable symptoms and frequent players making it challenging to manage. In our study, Skyrizi met the primary and all secondary end points demonstrating a very strong impact on the disease as measured by clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic improvement. We're particularly pleased with Skyrizi's impressive performance on the more stringent measures in this trial with approximately 37% of Skyrizi-treated patients achieving endoscopic improvement compared to 12% of patients on placebo. This level of efficacy has the potential to position Skyrizi as a highly effective therapy, and we believe it will be a welcome new treatment option for physicians and patients once approved. Detailed data from this induction study will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting. We expect to see data from the Phase III maintenance study in the second quarter with our regulatory submissions planned for the second half of the year. In oncology, we continue to make good progress across all stages of our hematology and solid tumor pipelines. We remain on track for several important regulatory and clinical milestones this year, including regulatory approval for epcoritamab in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Phase III data from Venclexta's CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory in multiple myeloma patients with a t(1114) mutation and navitoclax's TRANSFORM-1 trial in frontline myelofibrosis. And Phase II data for Teliso-V in second line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which has the potential to support a regulatory submission for accelerated approval. We're also beginning to see very encouraging data for our next-generation c-Met ADC, which uses a more potent Topol payload than our Teliso-V ADC. Based on the data we've seen to date for ABBV-400 in our Phase I solid tumor basket study, we plan to expand the program to earlier lines in colorectal cancer as well as evaluate in other tumors where c-Met is expressed, including pancreatic and liver cancer. Moving to our neuroscience pipeline, where we've recently received FDA approval for Qulipta as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine, making it the only oral CGRP antagonist approved for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. In our Phase III study, Qulipta provided a significant reduction in migraine days as well as significant improvements in function and quality of life in patients with chronic migraine, a common and debilitating disease. As a highly effective oral treatment option, we believe Qulipta will be well positioned in a chronic migraine prevention market. In Europe, we continue to anticipate an approval decision in the third quarter for atogepant as a preventive treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine. Turning now to ABBV-951. We announced that we received a complete response letter for our regulatory application in the U.S. The FDA has not asked for additional efficacy or safety studies related to our drug delivery -- drug device delivery system, but rather they have requested additional information regarding the pump as well as updates to instruction for use. We are working to generate the necessary information, and we expect to respond to the CRL later this year with an FDA action anticipated in the first half of '24. In international markets, we've recently received approval for 951 in Japan, and we continue to expect approval in Europe in the fourth quarter of this year. In our early-stage neuroscience pipeline, we recently began Phase I studies of our selective D3 dopamine receptor agonist, ABBV-932. Our experience with Vraylar has highlighted the potential clinical benefit of achieving D3 selectivity, and we believe that a compound that more selectively engages the D3 dopamine receptor has the potential to provide enhanced efficacy. Our program will initially focus on general anxiety disorder with the potential to expand to other neuropsychiatric disorders. The programs under our collaboration with Calico are also progressing well. We now have 4 assets in clinical trials, including 2 PTPN2 inhibitors in Phase I in oncology. Our eIF2B activator for neurodegenerative diseases and an IGF-1 signaling pathway modulator that will be explored in aging-related diseases. Our most advanced program is the eIF2B activator 7262. The first patient was recently enrolled in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, a Phase II/III study conducted by the HEALEY Center for ALS at Mass General. This trial is designed to evaluate multiple therapies simultaneously with a goal to accelerate the development of potential breakthrough treatments for ALS. Now I'd like to provide a brief update on 2 earlier stage programs in our therapeutic pipeline. In cystic fibrosis, we recently analyzed data from an ongoing proof-of-concept study, evaluating our triple combination therapy. The results from this interim analysis did not meet our criteria for advancing and we are discontinuing our cystic fibrosis program. We also recently reviewed interim data from our exploratory studies for ABBV-154 in PMR in Crohn's disease. Similar to results from the RA study, while we observed efficacy with 154, we also observed some changes in biomarkers that are consistent with systemic steroid exposure at the higher doses. The benefit risk profile does not sufficiently differentiate 154 from other available treatments. So based on the totality of the data across RA, PMR and Crohn's disease studies, we will not be pursuing further development of this asset. Now moving to our aesthetics pipeline. We recently saw data from our Phase III studies for Botox in platysma prominence and masseter muscle prominence. In our study for prominent neck muscles, Botox met all primary and secondary endpoints demonstrating a significant reduction in the unwanted appearance of platysma prominence on the neck and jaw line. This was the first of 3 Phase III studies in platysma prominence with data from the 2 remaining trials expected in the second half of the year, followed by regulatory submission in the U.S. near the end of 2023. Botox also performed very well in our study for prominent masseter muscles, meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints in the trial. Our program is initially focused on China and other Asian markets as masseter prominence is common in Asian populations and there is significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. Based on the results from this trial, we expect to submit our regulatory application in China in the second half of the year. Once approved, we anticipate high demand for Botox in this novel indication, which will help to further build our portfolio in the lower phase segment. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones throughout the remainder of 2023.

Starting with our first quarter results, we delivered strong top and bottom line performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.08 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $12.2 billion, $400 million ahead of our guidance and down 8.3% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 45% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 13.6% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.4% of sales. Net interest expense was $454 million. The adjusted tax rate was 13.7%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $10.72 and $11.12. This earning per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $52.4 billion, an increase of $400 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This guidance includes the following updated assumptions. We now expect Vraylar sales of approximately $2.7 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting strong prescription growth following the MDD approval. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, reflecting the better-than-expected recovery in China and stable economic trends in the U.S. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $13.5 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of 27%. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.6% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of 48.5% of sales. We are modeling a non-GAAP tax rate of 15.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.90 and $3. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.

Just to more broadly answer the question that I'm sure many investors have. If you look at the growth in the quarter, so overall, U.S. demand was up just north of 60% for Rinvoq and Skyrizi. We saw very strong performance across all approved indications, as Jeff highlighted. We did have the 2 partial offsets, one being the retail inventory destock, which I've already quantified. And then price was down high single digits and that's really driven by rebate increases, which is typical when we see the type of volume increase. And we saw Skyrizi sales up 80% last year, Rinvoq in the U.S. up 40% last year. So when you see that kind of volume growth and couple that with the number of indications we had approved, we had 5 new indications for Rinvoq and 2 for Skyrizi.

So on your question on price, yes, the way to think about 2023 price for the year for Skyrizi and Rinvoq would be down high single digits.

In terms of your questions around the aesthetics market, there are 2 key assumptions for the 2023 planning. One was around the U.S. economy and the other was around the recovery in China. When you think about the U.S. economy, we look at Q1 and we see some favorability to our planning assumptions with the metrics that we track, which Rob mentioned, include real personal consumption expenditure and Google. And so in January and February, we saw favorability there. Although in March, there are some potential signs of softening. So we continue to have a cautious outlook for our U.S. business for the rest of the year. The way to think about market growth for the full year would be low -- for toxins, the market would be down low to mid-single digits until we lap the 2022 downturn, which happened around May. And then after that, we would expect flat market growth for the rest of the year. So that's how we think about the U.S. Our other -- our second biggest market is China. And recall, we had assumed that the aesthetics market in China would not recall -- would not fully recover until the second half of the year. Well, in actuality, what we saw was although January was significantly impacted, in February, we started to see improvement. And in March, there was a really steep recovery that we do expect will sustain through the rest of the year. And in other markets around the world, I guess, in Canada and U.K., we are seeing some high inflation impacting consumer demand, but the rest of Europe seems stable right now.",277.0,120.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.03333333333333333,0.05,0.0,0.0,-0.016666666666666666

You said that high single digit, but should we assume like going forward, year-over-year, we should -- versus volumes, should we assume high single-digit decline still going forward for at least for rest of the quarter and then more stable pricing quarter-over-quarter term, just that clarification. And the question is, regarding the I&I pipeline, so you have a leadership position with Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and they are growing. But some of the pipeline products like 154 and 157 did not pan out as you were hoping them to. So what is -- how should we think about the pipeline strategy beyond these 2 products?

If you think about our pipeline, obviously, as we look at Skyrizi and Rinvoq, they clearly have restated the immunology market across most of the segments that we operate in. We view those assets as being able to drive strong growth through the early part of the next decade. Having said that, we're continuing to look for assets in areas where we believe there's still a significant opportunity to restate standard of care. And we obviously explore, as everyone in this industry does many different assets and different mechanisms to try to find those kinds of mechanisms that will deliver that kind of performance. It's interesting. When you look at the 154 platform, it did exactly what we thought it would do from the standpoint of efficacy. But it did it in a way only at the highest dose and at that highest dose, we did see it -- some effects of steroids on some of the biomarkers. And based on the way we think regulators would look at a label for those kinds of products, we didn't believe that would be a competitive profile. But the hypothesis certainly worked around the mechanism. So we continue to look for opportunities. We have lots of runway here to be able to get to those, but we do desire to find some additional mechanisms that will be the follow-on products that should be introduced hopefully near the end of this decade or early into the next decade as the next-generation immunology assets for AbbVie. So -- and I feel good about the progress that we're making there. We're continuing to explore a number of other areas. And we're continuing to look both internally and externally at different assets that we can bring into the company to be able to do that. To your question of being able to bring assets into this market, we don't believe that we would be encumbered because immunology is a very crowded space from a competitive standpoint. And that's one of the most important criteria that you look at from an FTC standpoint. So we believe we have freedom to operate across most of those segments from an FTC standpoint as well. And on price, maybe Rob and I will tag team this one to make sure it's clear. It is common that when you go out and you add indications in this industry, that when you negotiate those contracts to be able to get access, it does require some level of price concession. I would say we're on the lower end of what you typically would have seen with the speed at which we got access for Skyrizi and Rinvoq for those indications and the breadth of that access. And so we certainly would expect this year and last year to be the areas where you saw the most significant amount of price because those are the years that we added the majority of the indications, you would expect that to moderate. So then going forward, the way to think about it is, then it's only really driven by volume at that point. And volume typically requires much more modest kinds of price as you go forward. It's not 0 price. You shouldn't have that expectation. But I would not have an expectation of high single digits going forward.

So a question on PBMs, which are under renewed scrutiny. If there were material changes to the rebating structure currently in place, would that put big incumbent products at risk because it might remove the so-called rebate wall? And more generally, do you think there is any chance of some of the proposed legislative changes actually becoming law? And then secondly, any collateral impact you're seeing on Skyrizi or Rinvoq since Humira biosimilars have launched?

I think the way that we think about our brands is the first place that we look at is how distinctive they are. I mean we've got 4 head-to-head trials with Skyrizi and another one on the way where we can clearly differentiate the product. And we have many as well on Rinvoq. So we've really thought about it from a development standpoint. And I would say the perspective is somehow there was a restructuring of the PDMs, which I don't think is imminent. And the rebate sort of approach disappeared. It disappears for everybody. I mean all of these I&I products have a fairly reasonable rebate load and there would be a different basis of competition, which we would do very, very well. So we're not concerned about sort of a fundamental structural change relative to these 2 products, which are very distinctive. If we look at your second part of your question, which is it's really the same answer, which is we don't see that there are going to be significant impacts of Humira biosimilars on the performance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And one perspective, let's take Rinvoq is sort of a very simple way of thinking about it. It's already in the United States, a step behind TNF and it's performing at that level because you see such expansion of second and third lines in that space. And Skyrizi is very, very distinctive.

I'd say the environment hasn't changed materially in the last 24 months from my perspective. I still think it's certainly more difficult to raise money for biotech companies. So it probably makes them a bit more willing to engage with players like us or engage in a process, if they're at a point where they've generated data that makes them attractive. But I'd say the interest level in that engagement is similar to what has been for the last 12 to 24 months. And there's a lot of opportunity to be able to find assets that are in the biotech area. The question is you have to find the right kind of asset and you have to find one that's attractive and meet your needs. And I'd say being able to negotiate a transaction, I think, is a reasonable probability. I'd say prices are still relatively high. And so valuations for good assets tend to go at a pretty high level.

So for Navitoclax, it's the combination with the JAK2 in myelofibrosis. And there, we're looking to be better than monotherapy with JAK2 in that space and improving spleen size and symptoms like abdominal pain, fullness, fever, fatigue. Also, perhaps uniquely, what we've observed is also an improvement in bone marrow fibrosis and a decrease in variant allelic frequency. So that's what we would be looking for, and we should get a readout by midyear or so. For Teliso-V, in lung cancer, EGFR wild type with high c-Met and that's the indication where we have breakthrough therapy designation. Around the end of this year, I would say that's where we would see a readout. What we've seen in earlier data cuts is an ORR above 50%, which is quite a bit higher than what would be expected in standard of care in that second, third line setting.

And maybe I'll make a little bit of a comment on Teliso-V because I think you mentioned 400. I think the early data that we're seeing in 400 is impressive to us. There's no question about it. And I think we're going to have some data presented at this ASCO, right, where you'll have an opportunity to see that in CRC. Now having said that, Teliso-V, as Roopal said, does get very good responses in c-Met highs. But to get a broader set of c-MET population, we do believe you need to move to the Topol warhead and seems to get deeper responses and more durable responses. Data has to play out over time, but it appears to be a very good platform for c-MET. And so we need the data to mature, and we need to develop more data in that area. But I'd say the early data is pretty encouraging. You'll have a chance to see a snippet of that at this ASCO. As far as leadership changes, I'd say it's similar to what we've said in the first quarter or fourth quarter, I can't recall, last year around succession. We obviously have a process in place. We have a very experienced board. I've had many, many discussions with the Board about succession. The Board knows I'm committed to be here to ensure a successful and smooth transition. The criteria that we're operating against is we need to completely get through the transition for Humira biosimilars here in the U.S. I'd say, so far, I'm pretty pleased with how the transition is going. And I'm even more pleased with the way the growth platform is operating right now. And in fact, if you look at it this year, the growth platform is going to deliver mid-single digits and it's going to do it despite the headwinds that we see on Imbruvica and the headwinds that we're seeing from the economy on aesthetics. Once the aesthetics business returns to its normal growth rates and much of the pressure on Imbruvica starts to subside, we should see that growth rate increase significantly as we move into '24 for the growth platform. And obviously, returning to robust growth in '25 and deliver high single digit from that point forward. So that's the expectation that we're working against. So we want to make sure that the business is operating the way we want it to. We want to make sure that we're through the biosimilar erosion to the point that we believe it is predictable. And then obviously, the second part of the criteria is ensuring that the candidate that will succeed me is ready to do that. We can make a successful transition.

I think that, as I mentioned, it's -- the share is very, very impressive. So we have a 30% total market share now which is really putting significant headroom against any other drug in that category by a lot. And one way to think about it is, I think what you're asking is how much further can it run? And it can run quite a bit further. To some degree, if you think about it, so we're capturing on the dynamic share roughly 50%. So 1 out of every 2 patients. And our market share is about 30. So theoretically, over time, right, unless there's some disruption, which we don't see significant disruption in the market, your total market share is going to move towards that in-play share. Now that takes many, many years. But as we look at the fundamental momentum that we can achieve, it's still very, very significant. Add on to that, that basically, we're still in the rest of the world, starting to really see the PSA ramp. And remember, PSA has a very significant impact because it's treated by derms and it was sort of the last remaining gap that we had, so you're going to see continued momentum in the international markets and the U.S. market and we have a long way to run. And I'd be remiss if I didn't say how fast again that we're growing in both Crohn's right now and very exciting data in UC. And that market is very, very dynamic.

So if U.S. Humira does better and we outperform in '23, then we could see the trough in '24.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2023 is an important year for AbbVie as we experience Humira biosimilar competition in the U.S. market, and as we execute our long-term diversification growth strategy. Now roughly seven months into the year, I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we're making against these objectives. The U.S. Humira biosimilar impact is playing out as projected and slightly better than our planning assumptions. We are competing very effectively with the various biosimilar offerings. We have exceeded our guidance in burst in second quarters with the overachievement predominantly driven by our growth platform, the base portfolio, excluding Humira which, as you know, is the critical driver in our rapid return to growth in 2025 and beyond. To that point, this platform demonstrated operational revenue growth of nearly 8% this quarter with growth expected to further accelerate in the second half of this year. We are also once again raising our full year revenue guidance by $1 billion, which is on top of the $400 million sales increase we delivered in the first quarter for a total overachievement of $1.4 billion. And lastly, we are making good progress with our pipeline, across all stages of development, including recent strong data for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis as well as the recent U.S. approvals for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease and Epkinly in relapsed or refractory DLBCL, both important new therapies for patients. So in summary, I'm extremely pleased with the strong momentum and execution across the business. It reinforces our confidence in our ability to return to robust growth in 2025 with high single-digit compounded growth rate to the end of the decade.

We are demonstrating strong execution across our business with each of our five key therapeutic areas beating expectations. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were nearly $13.9 billion, more than $350 million ahead of our guidance with the vast majority of the beat coming from our ex Humira growth platform. In immunology, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating impressive growth with sales for both therapies up more than 50% versus the prior year. These two agents have achieved differentiated clinical profiles, including head-to-head data versus Humira and other novel therapies. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are now collectively approved across 10 large indications, and we are forecasting combined revenue growth of more than $3.5 billion this year. With ongoing programs in several additional disease areas, we expect both Skyrizi and Rinvoq to deliver robust growth into the next decade and significantly exceed Humira peak revenue. U.S. Humira is also performing well. The first half erosion coming in better than our expectations due to volume. We have been carefully analyzing the biosimilar marketplace, where the total number of competitors has now expanded to 8. While many of these biosimilars have been added to payer formularies, Humira continues to maintain strong parity access. Based on the volume trends and parity access, we now anticipate U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 35%, an improvement of two points versus our original guidance. Neuroscience is another area that is outperforming expectations. Based on the current run rate, this portfolio is now on pace to add more than $1 billion of incremental revenue this year. with continued strong growth from Vraylar as well as our leading migraine portfolio. In aesthetics, the outlook continues to improve. We delivered positive growth this quarter, driven by strong international performance and stabilizing trends in the U.S. These positive trends give us the confidence to once again raise our full year guidance for aesthetics. And as a clear market leader, we are focused on expanding the aesthetics category with increased commercial investment and continued innovation to support robust long-term growth. Given the strong and balanced performance across our diverse portfolio, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.23 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $11.10. In closing, our operational execution has been outstanding, and we are very well positioned to deliver on our commitments in 2023 and beyond.

I'll start with immunology, which delivered total revenues of $6.8 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi continues to perform exceptionally well. Global sales were approximately $1.9 billion, reflecting very strong operational growth of 51%. Our performance in psoriasis continues to be impressive. Total prescription share in the U.S. biologic market is now at 32%, double the share of the next closest biologic therapy. When you consider that Skyrizi is capturing roughly one out of two every in-play patient, which are either new to therapy or switching, there remains substantial opportunity for continued robust sales growth. And based on the available clinical data we are seeing from emerging competitive therapies in psoriasis, including orals, we feel very confident in Skyrizi's long-term potential with robust sales growth expected through the early part of the next decade. We are also seeing very nice prescription growth in psoriatic arthritis, especially in the U.S. dermatology segment where Skyrizi is approaching the leading new patient biologic market share. Skyrizi's momentum across psoriatic disease is very solid globally as well with total in-play share leadership in nearly 30 key countries. Turning now to IBD, where Skyrizi has demonstrated a very compelling clinical profile, including strong endoscopic data paired with convenient dosing. Uptake in Crohn's disease has been rapid, with total in-play patient share of approximately 25% in the U.S., roughly at parity leadership with Stelara. This uptake is very encouraging for Skyrizi's potential in ulcerative colitis, where we recently reported positive maintenance data with approval and commercialization anticipated next year. Given the momentum we are seeing across all of the approved indications, we will be raising our full year sales outlook for Skyrizi. Moving now to Rinvoq which delivered global sales of $918 million, reflecting operational growth of nearly 57%. A key element of Rinvoq's success is its strong differentiation. It is now approved across seven distinct indications, including four in rheumatology, two in IBD as well as atopic dermatitis. It's the only potent daily oral medication with compelling head-to-head data against multiple novel therapies, including superiority to Humira in RA and Dupixent in AD. It's the only JAK inhibitor now approved to treat both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And we have established strong and broad commercial access for each of the core diseases with formulary coverage for Crohn's expected to ramp quickly over the next months. As it pertains to Rinvoq's book performance, we are seeing increasing prescriptions across each of the room indications globally, further market share momentum in atopic dermatitis, including now high-teens in-play patient share in the U.S. and robust uptake in IBD, where Rinvoq has demonstrated strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement. Rinvoq is now capturing roughly one out of every four in-play ulcerative colitis patients in the second line plus setting. And the early data for Crohn's, which launched just in May, also shows a very strong ramp in new patient starts. We remained well positioned for continued momentum in this new indication as the only jack inhibitor approved to treat Crohn's disease.  This level of performance, along with the development of ongoing projects across several other diseases, such as giant cell arteritis and systemic lupus in rheumatology and multiple additional derm indications, reinforces the long-term potential for Rinvoq with strong sales growth expected through the early part of the next decade. Global Humira sales were $4 billion, down 24.8% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. remains slightly better than our expectations due to volume with the vast majority of the impact this quarter driven by price. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were approaching $1.5 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $907 million, down 20.8%, consistent with our expectations. Venclexta global sales were $571 million, up 15% on an operational basis with strong demand for both CLL and AML, and we are particularly pleased with the international performance here, following continued reimbursement progress in the EU and inclusion in China's national reimbursement list.  We also recently received the U.S. approval for Epkinly in third line plus DLBCL further expanding our on-market portfolio in hem onc. Early prescription trends have been encouraging, with a more robust opportunity expected as we progress development in earlier lines of therapy. We also anticipate approval and commercialization in Europe and Japan later this year. In neuroscience, revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 14.2% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to exceed our expectations. Sales of $658 million were up 33.9% on an operational basis with increasing momentum across all indications following the MDD approval late last year. Within migraine, we remain the clear market leader with unique treatment options for both acute and chronic conditions.  Our oral CGRP portfolio contributed $292 million in combined sales this quarter reflecting growth of more than 30% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Lastly, total Botox Therapeutic sales were $748 million, up 11.3% on an operational basis, reflecting nice momentum in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. This franchise continues to outperform our expectations, and we will be raising our full year guidance for the collective neuroscience portfolio. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance and execution across the therapeutic portfolio with growth expected to accelerate through the second half of the year.

Second quarter global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.4 billion up 2.9% on an operational basis with strong performance from our international portfolio offsetting the economic impact in the U.S. U.S. aesthetic sales were $829 million, down 6.2%. Our U.S. portfolio continues to perform well from a competitive perspective. And as expected, the aesthetics markets continued to be impacted by lower consumer spending related to inflationary pressures, which weighed on year-over-year growth rates. U.S. Botox cosmetic sales were $420 million, a decline of 6.5% versus the prior year. While the U.S. cosmetic toxin market declined low single digits in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis, growth rates improved through the quarter, with June showing a return to positive year-over-year market growth.  Botox Cosmetic continues to be the clear market leader, maintaining strong and stable share despite new competitive entrants. U.S. Juvederm sales were $125 million, down 14.5% on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see a more pronounced impact from inflationary dynamics on higher-priced, more deferrable procedures such as Filler. The U.S. Filler market declined approximately 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent inflationary environment. Our Juvederm collection remains market leader and share was stable in the quarter. The economic metrics that we track for the U.S. have largely stabilized. Our consumer market research shows a meaningful recovery from last summer and those intending to get treated with toxins and fillers.  Additionally, we have now lapped the beginning of the market downturn, which occurred in the second quarter of last year. Based on these factors, we expect growth rates for the U.S. facial injectables to improve in the second half of this year. Our international aesthetics portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well with strong results in many key markets. Second quarter sales were $555 million, reflecting operational growth of nearly 20%. The International Botox cosmetic sales of $265 million increased approximately 14% on an operational basis and International Juvederm sales were $243 million, up approximately 28% on an operational basis. Growth in the Asia Pacific region, particularly robust as aesthetic treatment rates in China have fully recovered to pre-COVID levels.  We continue to anticipate strong normalized growth through the remainder of the year in China. We are very pleased with the strong performance of our international aesthetics portfolio over the first half of the year and continue to expect similarly strong results in the second half. In the third quarter, we will be facing a challenging year-over-year comparison due to a shipment timing benefit we saw in the third quarter of 2022. This is expected to result in relatively flat growth for our international portfolio in the third quarter. On a full year basis, we expect our international aesthetics sales to grow high single digits. We continue to invest to drive future growth for our aesthetics portfolio with a focus on enhanced promotional activities, improve digital products and services through our Alle platform, sales force expansion, and injector training.  We continue to invest in our pipeline as well, and we remain committed to a regular cadence of new product introductions and indication expansions for Botox cosmetic and Juvederm. We recently announced the FDA approval of SkinVive, the first hyaluronic acid filler in the U.S. for improved skin smoothness of the cheeks, which, along with the recently launched Volux filler for jawline contouring, will help sustain our leadership position in the U.S. filler market. Our investments will allow us to maintain a strong leadership position in the highly underpenetrated and rapidly growing global aesthetics markets.  We remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our aesthetics portfolio and continue to expect to deliver greater than $9 billion in 2029. In the near term, the improving aesthetics outlook in the U.S. and continued robust international performance gives us confidence to once again raise our full year aesthetics guidance with an expectation for continued operational growth over the back half of the year.

We had a substantial amount of activity across our R&D pipeline, resulting in new approvals and advancements of several programs. In immunology, we received FDA approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease, marking its seventh FDA approval across gastroenterology, rheumatology and dermatology. In our Crohn's development program, Rinvoq demonstrated a very rapid and strong impact on symptoms as well as endoscopic improvement.  Given its strong benefit risk profile, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new medicine for patients suffering from moderate to severe Crohn's disease. While Crohn's disease approval marks the completion of the core indications, we believe Rinvoq revokes the potential to become a highly effective therapy in several additional important diseases. We recently began Phase III studies for Rinvoq in systemic lupus, hidradenitis, suprativa, and we remain on track to begin Phase III studies in alopecia areata later this year.  We'll also see later this year from a Phase II study in vitiligo, which could support advancement to Phase III in this indication as well. Moving to Skyrizi, where in the quarter, we announced positive top line results from our Phase III maintenance trial in ulcerative colitis. In this study, Skyrizi met the primary and key secondary end points at week 52 compared to the withdrawal arm, demonstrating that patients continuing treatment with Skyrizi maintain high levels of clinical remission as well as more stringent endpoints such as endoscopic improvement, histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement and steroid-free remission. It's important to note that approximately 75% of the patients in this study had failed advanced therapy, including not only anti-TNFs, but also other biologics, JAK inhibitors and S1P modulators. This represents a very difficult-to-treat population in ulcerative colitis. Skyrizi's strong performance in patients with and without failure to advanced therapies including patients who were naive to advanced therapy demonstrate its utility across the spectrum of moderate to severe UC patients.  We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications in the third quarter with approvals anticipated in 2024. We also recently published results from a head-to-head trial comparing Skyrizi to Otezla in patients with moderate psoriasis with Skyrizi demonstrating clear superiority to Otezla on all primary and ranked secondary endpoints at week 16 and 52. At week 52 of this study, 64% of patients achieved absolute skin clearance as measured by PASI 100 an SPGA clear compared to just 3% for Otezla, underscoring Skyrizi's ability to drive very high and durable responses in these moderate patients. In addition to higher clinical efficacy outcomes, the patients treat with Skyrizi which is a self-injectable administered quarterly reported improvements in health-related quality of life measures and greater treatment satisfaction compared to those treated with Otezla, which is an oral administered twice daily.  Additionally, Skyrizi demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability compared to Otezla. The rates of adverse events, including serious and severe AEs were numerically higher with Otezla than with Skyrizi treatment. Previous to -- similar to previous studies, Otezla treatment was associated with high rates of gastrointestinal distress such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, which resulted in a 7% discontinuation rate in the first 16 weeks of treatment compared to no discontinuations for Skyrizi patients. We're incredibly pleased with these results, which further underscores Skyrizi's position as the best in category treatment for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, providing very high efficacy, durable responses a safe and tolerable profile and convenient quarterly administration. In oncology, we received accelerated approval in the U.S. for Epkinly as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who had received two or more systemic therapies.  We also recently received positive CHMP opinion with an approval decision in Europe expected later this year. DLBCL is a very aggressive disease where later-line patients have limited options. We're extremely excited to bring this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients. In the quarter, we also announced positive top line results from the follicular lymphoma cohort of a Phase II trial evaluating Epkinly in patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy. In this study, Epkinly performed very well as a monotherapy, demonstrating an overall response rate of 82%. We are pleased with these results and plan to discuss these data with regulatory agencies about the potential to support a submission for accelerated approval. Beyond the mid-stage studies supporting accelerated approvals in later lines of therapy.  We also have Phase III trials ongoing in earlier lines of DLBCL and for follicular lymphoma, and we look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. In our navitoclax program, we recently saw top line results from the Phase III TRANSFORM one trial, evaluating navitoclax in combination with ruxolitinib in for patients with treatment naive myelofibrosis. This study met the primary endpoint at week 24, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of patients who achieved complete volume reduction of at least 35% compared to rux plus placebo. For the primary endpoint, the navitoclax combination showed a doubling of improvement over rux alone with 63% of patients on the navitoclax combination achieving SVR35 compared to 32% in the rux plus placebo combination.  In this study, the navitoclax combination did not achieve the first ranked secondary endpoint, which was improvement in total symptom score at week 24. Additional follow-up data on SVR and TSS as well as other endpoints are expected in the fourth quarter of this year. We plan to wait for these more mature data before engaging with regulatory agencies in order to have a more comprehensive picture of the patient's clinical response and clinical benefit that navitoclax can provide. Looking to the remainder of this year. We remain on track for several additional data readouts from our late-stage oncology programs, including Phase III data from Venclexta's CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with t(114) mutation. As a reminder, this is an event-driven study, and we're just waiting -- we're waiting for just a handful of remaining events. So, we'd expect to have these data in-house in the coming months.  And we remain on track to see Phase II data for Teliso-V in second-line plus advanced non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer in the fourth quarter. We're also making very good progress with several earlier line, earlier stage solid tumor programs. We recently initiated a Phase II study for ABBV-151, our anti-GARP antibody in hepatocellular carcinoma and plan to begin Phase II in several additional solid tumors over the course of the next 12 months. At the recent ASCO meeting, we presented promising initial results from a Phase I study evaluating our next-generation c-Met ADC, ABBV-400 in several advanced solid tumor types. We're seeing responses across multiple tumors, indicating broad activity. Results in late-line colorectal patients were particularly encouraging, where monotherapy treatment with 400 resulted in a confirmed overall response rate of 22% well in excess of standard of care, which is typically less than 2% to 3%.  We're also encouraged by the durability of response seen in these early results. These patients had an average of five prior lines of therapy, so this level of efficacy is very encouraging. Based on these results, we plan to start our Phase II program later this year, beginning with a second line colorectal cancer study. Now moving to neuroscience, where in the quarter, we received a positive CHMP opinion recommending approval of atogepant for migraine prevention. We anticipate a decision in the coming months. And if approved, atogepant would be the only oral CGRP antagonist approved in Europe for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. This is a debilitating condition that impacts tens of millions of people in Europe, and we look forward to making this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. Also, in the area of neuroscience, ABBV-916, our A-beta antibody for Alzheimer's disease is rapidly advancing to dose escalation studies. This antibody is demonstrating a long half-life and very low antidrug antibodies, both important attributes to achieve a best-in-class profile for our A-beta antibody. Dose selection in Phase II is expected to begin early next year. And lastly, in our aesthetics pipeline, we recently submitted our regulatory application for Botox in masseter muscle prominence in China, which is the initial focus for our program given the prevalence of masseter muscle prominence in Asian populations and a significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. In our platisima prominence program for Botox, we remain on track to see data from two additional Phase III studies later this year with our regulatory submission in the U.S. expected near the end of the year. So, in summary, we had a very productive first half of the year across all stages and therapeutic areas of our pipeline, and we look forward to the second half of 2023 with several important clinical and regulatory milestones. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.",1512.0,798.0,37.0,17.0,7.0,6.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.046365914786967416,0.021303258145363407,0.008771929824561403,0.007518796992481203,0.0,0.02506265664160401

I'm very pleased with the performance and outlook of the business, including the strong momentum from our ex-Humira growth plan. Starting with our second quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.15 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $13.9 billion, more than $350 million ahead of our guidance and down 4.2% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.7% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect high single-digit sales growth from our growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 47% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.5% of sales, acquired IP R&D expense of 2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $454 million, the adjusted tax rate was 15.8%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.23 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $11.10. This guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $53.4 billion, an increase of $1 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This guidance includes the following updated assumptions with more than half of the sales improvement attributed to our ex-Humira growth platform. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $7.6 billion, an increase of $200 million due to continued strong performance across all approved indications. We now expect neuroscience sales of approximately $7.7 billion, an increase of $300 million, reflecting robust prescription growth for Vraylar following the MDD approval as well as better-than-expected performance of Botox Therapeutics and Qulipta. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.4 billion, an increase of $100 million, primarily reflecting momentum from Botox Cosmetic. Lastly, we now anticipate U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 35%, resulting in a sales guidance increase of $400 million based on volume trends and strong parity access. Moving to the P&L. We continue to anticipate adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales and now expect adjusted R&D expense of $6.9 billion, SG&A expense of $12.7 billion and an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales. Turning to the third quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $13.7 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 40%. And rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.80 and $2.90. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered strong top and bottom line performance, and we are very pleased with the momentum of the business heading into the second half of the year.

And can you talk anymore at this point or when you see that floor happening? And then my second question is around IRA, and you obviously a lot of focus there. I'm curious if you have any thoughts around what the first list of products around September 1. Are you expecting AbbVie products to be included in that first group of 10. And then infused just Rinvoq specifically and how you see that might be at risk from IRI, given you bring obviously a lot of life cycle development there. And is there a chance that a life cycle may not be quite as long? Or kind of how are you thinking about prioritizing investing in a small molecule like Rinvoq?",157.0,64.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.015625,0.015625,0.046875,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'll take the first question and then maybe Rob and I can also tag team on the first one and the second one as well. So if you look at the floor, if you step back and look at how the business is performing. Obviously, the business is performing extremely well. And a significant part of the over achievement is not the Humira business. In fact, of the $1.4 billion we're raising, as Scott said, only $400 million of it is Humira. So $1 billion of it is the growth platform. So all that speaks. We have very strong momentum going into 2024. And we talked before on these calls about, well, when will the trough year occur. And as you think about the floor, I think you have to sort of think about the trough year at the same time. We said in the past that if we significantly overachieved in 2023, that would increase the probability that the trough year was in 2024. And we said that in the backdrop of primarily thinking about it as Humira overachieving. And obviously, now what we're seeing that it's the majority of the other products that are overachieving the growth platform. So as we look at '24 and as we look at the trough, I think we have to let the year play out a little bit further to see where we're going. But I would say that we're feeling pretty -- we're feeling very good about '24. And the growth of that non-Humira business could more than offset the over performance that we're seeing this year, especially the over performance that we're seeing on Humira. So it's too early to raise the floor. But what I would tell you is the performance that we're seeing now gives us a tremendous amount of confidence of what '24 looks like.

When you look at it, it's really across the key therapeutic areas that will drive long-term growth. We've raised Skyrizi, aesthetics, neuroscience, and also Humira. So we do feel very good about the performance of the business. We've debated when we update the floor that will come at some point may not come until we actually give the Q4 guidance -- on the Q4 call of 2024 guidance, but as we look at it, the fundamentals of the business are very, very strong, and we're seeing performance across all of the therapeutic areas.",123.0,56.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571

In our planning assumptions, we have assumed for some products to be impacted here early on. Imbruca is obviously one product that we're looking at carefully. I would say it's right from how you would calculate it based on the data that we would have, it would be right on the bubble of where the cutoff would occur in those first 10 products. So it could be 10, it could be 9, it could be 11, depending upon how some other products. And I say it that way because remember, we're using the data that we have, we're not 100% sure that, that is the data that CMS is going to use. So there's not perfect clarity around it. But I would say that's one that we obviously have on the radar screen and we're looking at carefully.

That remains. We looked at what it means in terms of inflation penalties, party benefit redesign, negotiations. So we did make assumptions around that. I think Rick is correct in that there is still enough uncertainty we're going to know soon, right? September one is when they expect to announce the first list. We have modeled it, but we feel good even with IRA although it does have an impact -- has impacted everyone in the industry, we can still deliver on our long-term growth expectations. On your question -- and I think keep in mind, too, when you look at the Medicare percent of business for AbbVie. In the U.S., it's about 20%. Globally, it's a little bit lower, obviously. And so you look at us relative to our peers, we have a lower percent of the business as exposed to Medicare. And then when we look at specific at Rinvoq, you have to keep in mind with Rinvoq with indication expansion, the percent of sales you're talking about by the time it potentially be selected for negotiation, potentially in the later part of the decade, you're talking about something where like 10% to 12% because if you keep in mind, new indications, in many cases, serve younger patient population. And so that's the way we're looking at Rinvoq continuing to develop it. We obviously have a number of indications that could launch later in the decade. We feel very good about that. Those indications can collectively contribute a couple of billion dollars of revenue. We'll continue to drive that robust growth we expect from Rinvoq and Skyrizi as well.

I guess first, can you just elaborate in terms of what you're seeing with biosimilar Humira as we think about kind of the price and volume dynamics. I guess specifically, any surprises from your side in terms of how this is playing out? And then just any qualitative comments you can provide about how you see this kind of translating as we kind of think out to 2024? And then my second question was just on the Skyrizi updated guidance. Just a little bit more color on that $7.6 billion of at this point, how much is coming from psoriasis versus psoriatic arthritis versus this Crohn's launch that seems to be off to such a strong start.

So in a nutshell, we haven't been surprised at any of the dynamics that we've seen play out, we've called it very, very accurately. So again, nothing that's really other than some small volume holding on a little bit better that's really different. So we're quite pleased with how our contracting and access has played out. And that parity access for Humira has been important. And again, it's what we believe would happen. We think it's good for patients, obviously, who can maintain their therapy with very little volatility, and it certainly provided us with a lot of predictability. And so I think we've managed sort of the first half with the Amgen launch and then the second half dynamics very, very well. And if you look to '24, as I've highlighted before, we do have 2-year agreements with some of our accounts. And we negotiated those in good faith, and we expect them to be honored. And remember, these are parity contracts for both '23 and '24 with Humira access coexisting with these multiple biosimilars. So I would say based on these dynamics, we're confident that Humira access will remain quite meaningful in 2024. And we know that as more biosimilars become established, we're also, as we've highlighted, appropriately planning for some volume loss in those certain so-called wax-sensitive accounts over time.

Just to give you some color, both in terms of the '23 guidance and the erosion assumptions around that, and then I'll talk about '24 briefly as well. In the first half of the year, obviously, the vast majority of that erosion came from price. We saw very little volume impact. But now with eight biosimilars on the market and some pursuing a low act strategy, we have assumed high single-digit volume erosion in the second half of the year, which would put the full year volume impact at mid-single digits. The rest of the 35% comes from prices we've negotiated those higher rebates and maintain strong parity access. Now while we're not providing '24 guidance today for U.S. Humira, it is reasonable to assume that there will be additional price erosion. Some will come from the annualization of the rebates that increased in the second half of this year and some will come from rebate increases negotiated for 2024 parity access. I'd also expect more volume erosion in '24, given the midyear entry of biosimilars this year, especially those that are pursuing a low act strategy. We've taken a close look at consensus estimates, analyst estimates have a very wide range the difference between the lowest estimate and the highest estimate approach is $4 billion. However, I'd say the average of those estimates appears to be a reasonable expectation for next year. Obviously, we'll give formal guidance likely on the Q4 call, which is our customary practice.

One clarification question and then one question. So clarification. So Rick, you mentioned that you think, like, again, at this point, you're not talking about increasing the floor, but you feel comfortable about the floor EPS range of $10.70. Is that fair to be in 2023 or '24, that's the first clarification question. And then second one is, when we talk to investors, they do feel comfortable about the ex-Humira portfolio. But one question that cuts up all the time is that, I mean, the lack of shiny object or pipeline beyond Skyrizi and Rinvoq. To the extent you agree with that assessment, how do you plan to mitigate that? Or is there anything in the pipeline that investors are missing at this point?

So as far as the $10.70, I would tell you that we feel highly confident in the $10.70. So there shouldn't be any concern there. And as I said, with how the growth platform is performing, we would expect to update at some point the floor. And obviously, by the way I'm saying it, the update would be in an upward direction. So hopefully, that gives some clarity around the floor.  And when you think about the pipeline, what I tell you about the way we operate is we design our investment in R&D to be able to deliver the kind of growth that we expect for the business over the long term, both short term and the long term. Our expectations of the business haven't changed. Our expectations are to build a strategy that allows this business to grow at the top tier and be able to do it over the long term and do it in a consistent way. And I'd say, as I look at our historical performance, we've obviously delivered on that. But as I look at forward-looking performance through the end of this decade and into the early part of the ‘30s, we're highly confident we can deliver high single-digit growth with the pipeline that we have now, and ultimately, with the assets that we have in the marketplace and how they're performing in the marketplace and their ability to be able to drive significant growth. And you see that in the performance that we're delivering now. If you look at the growth platform's growth in first quarter, and then look at it in the second quarter, it's accelerating at a very good pace, and it will continue to accelerate as we go through the rest of this year. And that once we get to a stable tail or relatively stable tail on Humira will be that growth that emerges to be able to drive the company, and that's what gives us such a high level of confidence. But I think when you look at our pipeline, certainly, we invested significantly in Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and that investment is paying off extremely well. We have a number of assets in our pipeline that will continue to help accelerate that growth as we move forward. So venetoclax for t114 and MDS are in samples of that. 951, we should do any submission and get that product on the marketplace. There’s a huge need for that product in the marketplace. And a number of other assets, I won't go through every one of them. The rest of our investment in R&D has really been focusing on assets that are designed to be able to sustain our growth from 2030 - ‘40 forward. And so as I look at our pipeline, and I know you don't have as much visibility as we do, but when I look at our pipeline for things like the 400 platform and the cement platform that we have, the data we're seeing in CRC, non-small cell, that's a significant opportunity for us [indiscernible] is another significant opportunity for us. Our neuroscience portfolio is 916 and other assets is another significant opportunity for us that will emerge in that time frame. We have a next-generation BTK degrader that we're excited about. We have a second-generation BCL-2 that we're very interested in pursuing in multiple myeloma. And so there's a number of assets here that just haven't emerged to the point that you have clear visibility on all that data, but we do have visibility to where they're progressing. And so I think it's just hard for you to assess that earlier pipeline, but it's really designed to deliver on that long-term growth. So we're confident between now and the early ‘30s. And as that pipeline matures and the data comes out, three is another good example of where we have a lot of data now that is demonstrating that is probably best in class for a bispecific in myeloma. And so as that data emerges, you're going to get more visibility to it.

So M&A, I mean, obviously, we have a very active group who's constantly working in the area of business development. We're primarily focused in the areas that we operate in franchises. So think of things like immunology, neuroscience, certain areas of neuroscience, oncology, aesthetics, as an example, we constantly look at and then eye care would be, I would say, the key areas of focus.  As I said before, we don't need anything to be able to drive that high single digits. Obviously, if we can grow even faster, that's a good thing. I think all of us recognize that. If we find assets that are out there that are later-stage assets, and they fit our strategy and they fit the kind of target product profile that we would expect because we only look for assets that can significantly change standard of care. That's what we're good at. And so we evaluate lots of things, but many of them don't meet that threshold that we're looking for. But if we find something, we would obviously pursue it. If it was in an area that we thought we could maximize the value of it. And so, we'll continue to do that.  So like I said, I feel good about where we are and what we can drive, and I feel good about how we're looking at assets that are in the outside. We certainly have the financial wherewithal to be able to acquire assets that are out there. And as we've mentioned before, we obviously acquire larger assets. And so we continue to look at those.

So in terms of DAXI, it's been more than six months since their launch and the uptake has been quite limited from our perspective in the low single digits. So for context, as we benchmark our competitive launches. And you would benchmark this launch versus the most recent toxin to enter the U.S. market you would see it's tracking to about 25% of where another product would be at the same point in its launch. And in terms of customer feedback, we continue to hear that expectations are just not being met on duration, that expectations on the customer side and on the consumer side.  So we have yet to see impact on Botox share and Botox will continue to be the clear market leader as the other toxins compete for the number 2, 3, 4 position in our customers' offices.

One of the aspects that we have that I highlight and we look very carefully at, we look at both sort of in-play capture which I often refer to, for example, right now, the in-play capture for Skyrizi in psoriasis is about 50%. So we're capturing one out of every two patients. And our market share is about 32%, as I highlighted. So theoretically, as we study these markets that if there's not major innovation or major disruption that comes in place. And we really don't see that in psoriasis. You get such a high level of efficacy with Skyrizi, your market share, so the 32% starts to ramp up over time towards your in-play capture because you get the persistency effects and the fall off that take place in the market.  So really, when you look at that, I could say the same thing, for example, with Rinvoq. I mentioned that it's capturing 25% of second line plus in-play share. It has like a 3% market share. So in terms of the ability to sort of grow that market share over time, we really monitor that capture rate in the early years, and then you just sort of -- the in place sort of pulls up your market share over time. So that's why we're quite encouraged at the speed of the ramps that we're seeing there and the ability to move that market share.  Now when we study the models, you don't fully get there because typically, something else launches, time goes by. But we can feel very, very encouraged as we look at our in-play momentum that the market share starts to approach that over our long-range planning cycle.",300.0,131.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.022900763358778626,0.007633587786259542,0.007633587786259542,0.0,0.0,0.015267175572519083

So the team is very excited about that. And what was described earlier. The unmet need is still quite high, and we still believe in a very strong profile in that asset.  Along the lines of combinations, as you mentioned, on GLP-2, we feel with something like Skyrizi, the data that we've seen in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis there's still potentially an opportunity to even increase endoscopic or mucosal healing even higher. We're seeing high ranges already 50%, 60%. And but we can still potentially go higher and something like a GLP-2 can directly address mucosal healing. So that could be a potential combo.

Obviously, the FTC appears to be applying a lot more scrutiny to transactions. Having said that, I would say even before this happened, we would always evaluate an acquisition of a product or a company in the backdrop of what we thought the competitive environment would be our position in that market, meaning we didn't necessarily go out and try to do transactions that we thought would be extremely difficult from an FTC standpoint. So, I think the way we think about the FTC situation now is, look, it may require more time to get acquisitions through it may even require that you're willing to pursue litigation in order to get those through. But in the end, if your position is that what you're trying to do is not anticompetitive. You will be able to ultimately prevail in that process. And I think we're seeing that as some of these transactions go to court. Some not in our own industry, but in other industries, I think that's playing out. And so, I think ultimately, it will end up being more of a delay, but not something that staples your ability to do things that are appropriate to do. That's my perspective on it.

And really some of the key Juvederm brand have just become available in China in the past few years, and we'll continue to have, like I said, a cadence of Juvederm launches in China. And then our increased investment all over the world and continues to drive our filler business and gives us a lot of optimism there internationally. Now in the U.S., we have said that the inflationary dynamics have impacted the U.S. market for filler and more than toxin just by the nature of the filler pricing and procedure.

And so, for all those reasons, we believe that the top -- the filler market will continue to improve in the second half of the year. although it will lag the toxin market recovery a bit. Now in terms of the question around Ozempic, we have been keeping an eye on that and how these weight loss products could have an impact on the aesthetics market. And what we see is that really anything that gets a consumer engaged in their appearance, including products like Ozempic are a positive tailwind for the aesthetics business.

It's a great question because, look, I think we all know there has been some question out in the marketplace since the first quarter about I&I pricing. And so let me try to frame our perspective on the pricing because I think there's some misconception that's developed in the marketplace to some extent around I&I pricing. I guess the first thing I'd say to you, this is a market we know well. We've been in this market for a long time. We're obviously a leader in this market. So, it's a market we know extremely well. And obviously, we know any trend that's occurring in this market to a high degree of detail. And what I would tell you is that we see no fundamental change in the way pricing is being dealt with in this marketplace nor do we expect to see any fundamental change that occurs in the foreseeable future. So that brings me to the rebate question in the first quarter. And I would tell you that we're operating exactly the same way we have historically operated in this segment as it relates to rebating or discounting. When we get a new indication or a new product, one of the things that we evaluate is -- okay, what level of rebating should we do in order to maximize two things for the product. The speed at which we can drive the ramp and the ultimate peak sales that we can drive for that asset. We weigh those two things against how we look at contracting and getting on formulary. And so when you get an indication, you make a trade off. Do I want to be on formulator? I don't. If I do, I have to provide some level of incremental rebates. Is that a financially positive decision for the asset in the company. And if it is, we make that decision. And I would say that Skyrizi and Rinvoq are classic examples of that strategy. And I would say, look at how they're performing. We're going to grow those two assets despite the increased rebates, $3.5 billion this year. And that's a pretty good trade-off. I don't know, Jeff, anything you'd add?",394.0,165.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.024242424242424242,0.0,0.006060606060606061,0.0,-0.006060606060606061

I mean this fact base of seven indications in one year in one category with one firm, it's just -- it's really unprecedented. It's not going to happen again. And I think it's important to think about how it works. I mean, when you get a new indication and they're sequencing over time, you've got to clear the payer's P&T clinical committee, and they don't meet every day. They meet every couple of months. So there's a process there. And then you've got to be added to the formulary structure. So you either have to somehow gain a new spot by indication or replace a competitor. And that's not easy as well. And so that's why what we see in the marketplace. Many competitive firms have to offer these free or bridge programs and not just for a quarter or 2, sometimes there are multiple quarters or years until that access ramps. And I would say, in contrast, Rick, as you noted, on average, we achieved fully paid access for those seven indications in about 60 days, really, really unprecedented. So that means we had to give very little free goods we had almost immediate paid access and profit flow and then, of course, that rapid revenue accumulation that you highlighted. So definitely the right trade-off, and we don't see that recurring.",243.0,113.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.02654867256637168,0.0,0.02654867256637168,0.0,0.0,0.02654867256637168

On OUS Humira, you're obviously well past the initial biosimilar way, but you're still seeing some sequential decline. So what's the context here? And is there a dynamic that could impact Skyrizi or Rinvoq even indirectly OUS?

If you look at the '23 erosions, about $600 million it's really split in, I'd say, three buckets. About $300 million of it is new biosimilar markets, markets like Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico. Those are -- remember, we have additional waves coming in. So that's the next wave coming in so about half of it is that. And then I characterize about $200 million being really the impact of new agents like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, right? So you have agents that deliver higher standard of care, and so you're going to see share erosion just through that dynamic. And fortunately, we've brought forward our own products that do that. And so I'd say of that $600 million, $200 million is roughly that. And then in the international markets, you typically see some, I'd say, low to mid-single-digit price erosion, just typically year-over-year. So that's about another $100 million. So it's important to characterize it the right way. It's not so much markets that were biosimilar several years ago. It's more recent biosimilar markets, our own competition from our own agents as well as the typical price erosion you see in the international market.",213.0,91.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.04395604395604396,0.01098901098901099,0.0,0.0,-0.04395604395604396

So we'll continue to monitor the spleen volume reduction and see how that looks towards the end of the year. And if it maintains the high level that Tom described, that's something that definitely a positive. The other things that we'll get that will reveal themselves over the longer term as the marrow fibrosis and that, along with the spleen volume reduction and actually some of our earlier data may be correlative for survival events. So we'll get an early look at those. And then in terms of tolerability, what we've seen thus far is consistent with what we've seen initially, and it is a titratable dosing. So the clinicians can tailor in the study to what the patient needs. So more to come by year-end.  Liz Shea Okay. Thanks, Jeff. And that concludes today's conference call.

AbbVie continues to perform exceptionally well. We once again delivered an excellent quarter with results ahead of our expectations. We are now several quarters into the U.S. biosimilar event for Humira and continue to effectively manage erosion. We have been able to maintain significant volume with the majority of the impact to date driven by lower price.  Importantly, our growth platform, the base business excluding Humira, which includes a well-diversified portfolio with multiple leading products in highly attractive markets across immunology, neuroscience, oncology, and aesthetics continues to demonstrate robust performance and outperform expectations. This platform, which is the critical driver in our return to rapid growth in 2025 and beyond, delivered strong double digit revenue growth this quarter, a considerable acceleration from the first half of this year.  We anticipate this platform, which is led by Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Vraylar, and Botox will continue to drive significant revenue growth going forward. At the same time, we have several promising R&D programs with the potential to contribute meaningfully in the latter part of this decade and into the 2030s. This includes next generation approaches in immunology, a focus on bispecifics, ADCs, and novel I-O in oncology, as well as innovative therapies to potentially treat a range of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.  In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the continued strong momentum and execution across our business. The growth platform is substantially outperforming our expectations, giving us the confidence to once again raise our financial outlook, including upgraded guidance for floor earnings, which Rob will share momentarily. And further underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today, we also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend, which we have grown by more than 285% since our inception.

Our results once again demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio and support AbbVie's long-term growth outlook. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, which is $0.14 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $13.9 billion, roughly $225 million ahead of our guidance. The performance of our ex-Humira growth platform continues to be very strong with revenue growth above 12% this quarter, including more than 50% growth from both Skyrizi and Rinvoq, our best in category immunology medicines. We continue to anticipate that these two products will collectively exceed Humira peak revenues by 2027 with robust growth expected into the next decade. Neuroscience also delivered strong performance with operational sales growth of more than 20% this quarter, driven by our leading portfolio for migraine and psychiatric conditions. And lastly, aesthetics performance was highlighted by the return to growth of the U.S. toxin market.  This outstanding execution across our well-diversified portfolio gives us the confidence to once again raise our near-term financial outlook. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance by $600 million and have now raised total revenue by $2 billion since our initial guidance in February, including more than $1.4 billion from our ex-Humira growth platform. As a result, we are also raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.25, and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.19 and $11.23. Given the strong momentum of our growth platform, which is significantly outperforming our expectations this year, we are now raising the floor guidance for 2024 adjusted EPS to $11, which is $0.30 better than our previous expectations. This floor guidance continues to exclude any impact from IPR&D expense. As is our typical practice, we'll provide our formal EPS guidance range for 2024 on the fourth quarter call.  Finally, today, we are announcing a 4.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.48 to $1.55, beginning with a dividend payable in February 2024. Since inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by more than 285%.  In summary, I'm very pleased with the strong execution across our portfolio. We remain confident in our long-term outlook, including a return to robust revenue growth in 2025 with a high single digit CAGR to the end of the decade.

We once again delivered strong results across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter. I'll start with immunology, which delivered total revenues of nearly $6.8 billion exceeding our expectations.  Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to demonstrate impressive growth and are now on pace to deliver approximately $11.6 billion in combined sales this year. This performance is especially encouraging, recognizing that we are still in the early launch phase for both assets and IBD, an area of high unmet need where we are very competitively positioned with two complementary assets, each having generated strong response rates and durable remission across our development programs.  Skyrizi total sales were $2.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of more than 50%. This robust performance includes further share gains in psoriasis, where we remain the clear market leader, capturing roughly one-third of the total prescriptions in the U.S. biologic market, and approximately 50% of in-play patients who are either new to therapy or switching. Increasing momentum in psoriatic arthritis, where Skyrizi is now the leading in-play biologic therapy in the U.S. dermatology segment, as well as continued rapid uptake in Crohn's disease where we are capturing roughly one out of every four in-play patients.  Importantly, we recently announced positive results from SEQUENCE the ninth and perhaps the most impactful head-to-head study across our development program for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. SEQUENCE is a Phase 3 head-to-head study in Crohn's, which demonstrated Skyrizi's superiority versus Stelara across key efficacy parameters, including impressive, statistically significant differences in both clinical and endoscopic remission. The detailed data from this trial were presented earlier this month, and we plan to share the findings more broadly now via our medical personnel and representatives in the field. We anticipate these strong head-to-head results will clearly support Skyrizi as the best in category therapy for Crohn's, which is important for continued rapid share capture. So based on this very positive data as well as our continued momentum, we will be once again raising the full year sales outlook for Skyrizi. Moving now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of nearly 60% with increasing prescriptions across each of the approved indications. In particular, I am very excited about Rinvoq's growth potential in gastroenterology, where uptake is exceeding our expectations. In ulcerative colitis, Rinvoq is now capturing more than 25% total in-play patient share in the U.S. second-line plus setting, nearly at parity to the current market-leading therapy. And in Crohn's disease, Rinvoq is ramping very significantly. The inflection we are seeing is even faster when compared to our time aligned launch in UC just last year. Given this impressive momentum in IBD, we will now be raising our full year sales outlook for Rinvoq. Global Humira sales were more than $3.5 billion, down 36.2% due to biosimilar competition. The erosion impact in the U.S. played out largely in line with our expectations this quarter, while performance across our international markets is trending better-than-expected. Turning now to oncology, where total revenues were $1.5 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $908 million down 20% and consistent with our expectations. Venclexta global sales were $590 million, up 14% on an operational basis with strong demand for CLL and AML across our key countries. The U.S. launch of at EPKINLY in third line plus DLBCL is also tracking well with commercialization also now underway in Europe and Japan, following the recent respective approvals. In neuroscience, total revenues were more than $2 billion, up 22% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of $751 million were up 35.4% and we have seen a significant uplift in new prescriptions across all indications, following the approval as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder late last year. Our leading oral CGRP portfolio for migraine contributed $365 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of nearly 65%, as we continue to see strong demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Atogepant was also recently approved as a new therapy in Europe branded as Aquipta, where it is the only once-daily oral CGRP for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine, further strengthening our competitive product profile and long-term growth opportunity.  Lastly, total Botox Therapeutic global sales were $748 million, up 7.4% on an operational basis, reflecting momentum in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. So overall, I am extremely pleased with commercial execution across the therapeutic portfolio, especially with our growth platform, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth.

Third quarter global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.2 billion, an operational decline of 4%. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $759 million were roughly flat to last year as growth for Botox Cosmetic was offset by declines in other brands that continue to be impacted by lower consumer spending related to inflationary pressures. U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $388 million, an increase of 5%. We are beginning to see a recovery in the U.S. toxin market, which posted positive year-over-year growth in the third quarter following three consecutive quarters of declines due to economic pressures. Botox continues to perform very well despite increasing competition. It remains the clear market leader with a strong and stable share, and we have seen little to no share impact from new competitive entrants. U.S. Juvederm sales were $116 million in the third quarter, a decline of 6.4% versus prior year as recovery in the facial filler market continues to lag the cosmetic toxin market. The filler market is improving, however, as a higher priced, more deferrable procedure relative to toxins. The segment of the aesthetics market continues to be suppressed by lower consumer spending. In the third quarter, the U.S. facial filler market was down low teens percentage compared to the prior year.  Juvederm remains the market-leading facial seller in the U.S. and share was stable in the quarter. While the U.S. facial injectable markets continue to be impacted by lower consumer spending in this inflationary environment, we are seeing signs of stabilization and even a return to growth in the cosmetic toxin segment. This gives us confidence in a stable to improving outlook in the U.S. as we end this year and enter 2024. Internationally, third quarter aesthetic sales were $480 million, representing an operational decline of 9.7%. As anticipated, year-over-year performance in the quarter was impacted by a shipment timing benefit we experienced in the third quarter of last year. Results were also impacted by softening economic conditions across major international aesthetic markets, primarily China. Despite the economic pressures that are currently impacting our aesthetics portfolio, we remain very confident in its long-term growth outlook. In September, we began launching Skin Vive in the U.S. And in the next few years, we plan to launch new indications for Botox in the lower face segment, and our novel fast-onset, short-duration toxin BoNT/E. In addition to our R&D programs, we have a robust Alle technology pipeline, which will bring new tech products into the U.S. market to help our customers acquire, retain and cross-sell more aesthetic patients. Our strong leadership positions in both cosmetic toxins and facial fillers combined with the significant investments we're making to drive market acceleration will position us for strong growth going forward.

In immunology, we had two important milestones in the third quarter for Skyrizi in inflammatory bowel disease. Following completion of the Phase 3 maintenance trial in ulcerative colitis. We submitted our regulatory applications for Scares in this indication in the U.S. and Europe with approvals anticipated in 2024. We also recently presented results from the SEQUENCE head-to-head trial comparing Skyrizi to Stelara in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. We're extremely pleased with how Skyrizi performed in this study, which enrolled very difficult-to-treat patients who all failed anti-TNF therapy. Skyrizi met the primary and all secondary endpoints in the trial, demonstrating clear superiority to Stelara on all endpoints at week 48 and with a more than doubling of effect in endoscopic remission at 32% of Skyrizi versus 16% for Stelara and endoscopic response at 45% versus 22% for Stelara.  Furthermore, steroid-free clinical remission was 61% for Scares versus 40% for Stelara. So these compelling head-to-head Crohn's data combined with the additional indication approval for ulcerative colitis expected next year will further position Skyrizi as a highly effective, durable, safe and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease. We continue to make very good progress with the second wave of Rinvoq development programs as well in addition to the ongoing Phase 3 programs in GCA, lupus and HS, we recently began the Phase 3 program for Rinvoq in Alopecia Areata. We also recently announced positive top line results from a Phase 2 study for Rinvoq in vitiligo. In this study, Rinvoq met the primary and all secondary endpoints at week 24 and demonstrating a significant improvement in both facial and total body vitiligo scoring measures compared to placebo.  Importantly, these results continued to improve through week 52 of the study illustrating Rinvoq's potential to provide significant skin repigmentation to patients suffering from vitiligo. Based on these results, we're advancing Rinvoq to Phase 3 in this indication with studies expected to begin soon.  Moving to oncology, where in the quarter, we received approval in Europe and Japan for epcoritamab as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, were received two or more systemic therapies. These approvals represent important regulatory milestones for EPCO, and we look forward to bringing this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients in these international markets. We also continue to make good progress with the development programs in earlier lines of DLBCL and follicular lymphoma and we look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. In our Venclexta multiple myeloma program, we recently announced top line results of a Phase 3 CANOVA trial evaluating Venclexta plus dexamethasone compared to PomDex in relapsed/refractory patients with a T114 mutation. In this study, the primary endpoint of IR CSS PFS was longer with VenDex versus PomDex but did not meet statistical significance. accommodation also resulted in numerically higher response rates and longer overall survival compared to PomDex. While the differences in efficacy measures were not statistically significant, we believe the totality of the data show a benefit with the Venclexta combination and we plan to discuss the results with regulatory agencies. We'll provide updates on the program as they become available.  Behind Venclexta, we have several exciting multiple myeloma programs emerging from our earlier stage pipeline. We continue to make good progress with our BCMA CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 and where we're nearing completion of the dose optimization work and are on track to begin Phase 3 studies in the first half of next year. At an upcoming medical meeting, we plan to present updated Phase 1 efficacy and safety results as well as monthly administration dose data. We're also making good progress with our next-generation BCL2 inhibitor, ABBV-53, which is currently in Phase 1 studies and we'll provide updates as the data become available.  Now moving to Neuroscience, where in the quarter, we received approval for Aquipta in Europe, which is now the only oral CGRP antagonist approved in Europe for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. And lastly, in our aesthetics pipeline, we recently announced top line results from a second Phase 3 study evaluating Botox in platysma prominence, similar to results from the first Phase 3 study, all primary and secondary endpoints were met with Botox demonstrating a significant reduction in platysma prominence and vertical neckband. We anticipate a regulatory submission in the U.S. here the end of the year.  In addition to indication expansion for Botox, we continue to advance our novel toxin pipeline. We recently announced positive top line results from two Phase 3 trials evaluating BoNT/E, our rapid onset, short-acting novel toxin in glabellar lines. BoNT/E performed very well in both studies meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints compared to placebo. BoNT/E was well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified. We're very pleased with these results, which demonstrate this toxin's rapid onset of action and short duration of effect. Patients treated with BoNT/E showed an improvement in glabellar lines as early as 8 hours following injection and a duration of effect of 2 to 3 weeks. This highly differentiated clinical profile could offer patients a novel option compared to currently available neurotoxins. We plan to complete the remaining development work over the course of the next few quarters and anticipate submitting our regulatory applications in the second half of next year. So in summary, we continue to make good progress across all stages and therapeutic areas of our pipeline, and we look forward to several more important milestones in the remainder of this year, including Phase 2 data for Teliso-V and second line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which has the potential to support an accelerated approval. Phase 2 proof-of-concept data for our anti-IL-1 alpha beta bispecific antibody, lutikizumab in hidradenitis suprativa, and regulatory approval in Europe for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa, carbidopa delivery system for advanced Parkinson's disease. We also plan to submit updated 951 data in the U.S. near the end of the year.

The strong performance we are demonstrating from our ex Humira growth platform continues to support AbbVie's long-term growth outlook.  Starting with our third quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, which is $0.14 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.04 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were $13.9 billion, roughly $225 million ahead of our guidance and down 5.8% on an operational basis excluding a 0.2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect double-digit sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform.  The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.7% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.4% of sales acquired IP R&D expense of 0.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.9% of sales. Net interest expense was $398 million. The adjusted tax rate was 15.7%.  Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.25 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $11.19 and $11.23. This guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the fourth quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $54 billion, an increase of $600 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% and unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. The updated revenue forecast contemplates a full year sales increase of $300 million roughly split evenly between Skyrizi and Rinvoq, reflecting strong uptake in IBD. The remaining $300 million full year sales increase is primarily attributed to better-than-expected performance of international Humira and Restasis.  Moving to the P&L. We continue to forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of roughly $1.7 billion. And we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.5%, reflecting IP R&D occurred through the third quarter.  Turning to the fourth quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $14 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.87 and $2.91. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated more than $16.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow which is net of approximately $1.1 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments in the first 9 months of the year.  And our cash balance at the end of September was approximately $13.3 billion. Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today we announced a 4.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payment in February of 2024, and we remain on track to achieve by the end of this year, $34 billion of cumulative debt paydown since the Allergan transaction, maintaining a net leverage ratio around 1.8x. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong.

So since we provided that guidance in February, recall we gave a $10.70 EPS floor to really help investors model earnings regardless of whether the trough recurred in '23 or '24 we've raised growth platform sales by $1.4 billion covering immunology, neuroscience and aesthetics. We're seeing the IBD indications for Skyrizi and Rinvoq very nicely, and we continue to capture more share in their other indications, both Vraylar and our migraine portfolio have outperformed our share forecast and the strong recovery of Botox has led us to raise guidance for aesthetics twice this year. So given the clear over-performance of the growth platform, we decided to raise the floor to $11 ex IPR&D. We hope this provides investors the view of the low end of the 2024 guidance range and also confirms that '24 will indeed be the trough year. And given that we expect to deliver a high single-digit CAGR from '24 to the end of the decade, it should allow investors to value the company with a better growth multiple.",178.0,88.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.03409090909090909,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011363636363636364

So the first part of the question is it seems like across the board, there is a 10% quarter-over-quarter decline on all the products. Can you help us understand what's happening sequentially? And then if you are keeping the guidance, it seems like there would be quite a bump in fourth quarter.

So one thing to keep in mind is that we mentioned in the last call that we had some dynamics in the international market when you look at the growth rates where we had more difficult comparison because of some of the -- some stocking that occurred in the prior year, that's something to keep in mind. We also do have a certain amount of seasonality that occurs in our business in the U.S. in particular. So those are things to keep in mind. I'd say as we look at it, we're very encouraged by the return to growth of the U.S. toxin market.  Botox is performing very well, and we're certainly doing a very nice job maintaining our share position despite competitive pressure. So I'd say we're very pleased there. I'd say on fillers, what we're seeing is probably more of a lag in the recovery. And if we've studied this market historically, we do tend to see a lag and that's really relative to thinking about the price point for fillers versus toxins. It's natural to assume that the recovery will take a little bit longer. So we are seeing that recovery take a little bit longer. We're still very, very encouraged by the trends we're seeing. We're very excited about the new fillers we've launched, both SkinVive and Volux. We're starting to see some nice share momentum come from those new introductions. And so from that standpoint, we feel very good. And then as we've been monitoring the situation in China, as all of you I'm sure have been watching very carefully. We saw, as you recall, a very strong recovery in the first half of the year. We've seen it moderate, and we're keeping a close eye on that. And so that's something we're obviously paying a lot of attention to. Now we look at the rest of the international business, it's growing nicely. And so as I think about the guidance for this year, I'd say we're fairly close. We're not overly concerned. We don't adjust guidance for plus or minus $100 million. If it was greater than that, we would consider it. So that's something to keep in mind. But as we look at this, the long-term outlook for this business, we're very confident. When you think about the U.S. toxin market, it's historically grown in the mid-teens and it's still heavily underpenetrated in the low single digits.  And market growth is really the key to deliver on our long-term outlook. We've seen this market rebound very strongly following a period of economic pressure, and we've demonstrated time and again that we can increase new patient starts for our promotional efforts. And something I think probably isn't appreciated is that we do have several innovations that can accelerate that growth. And when you think about the master and platysma indications for Botox, those can each add a few hundred million dollars. Our novel short-acting toxin BoNT/E has the potential to activate new patients that could really drive an inflection in market growth. As you think about one of the biggest barriers for new patients is fear of an unnatural look, and the short-acting toxin opportunity is a great way to unlock that. And then if you look at our regenerative fillers pipeline, those are aimed at providing both short- and long-term treatment benefits for consumers.  And as I mentioned, we're also very excited about the new fillers we've launched both SkinVive and Volux. So with this business, you see us go through some cycles with economic pressure. But over the long term, we feel very confident that we can certainly deliver very robust growth and deliver on that real than $9 billion expectation for 2029.",676.0,298.0,13.0,8.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0436241610738255,0.026845637583892617,0.016778523489932886,0.0,0.0,0.016778523489932886

And then the second one was on Humira for 2024. And I think, Rob, you might have commented last quarter of your comfort with where consensus sits.

Yes, we're very comfortable as we see things start to evolve and close here as we move into 2024. I mean if you think about all the indications that we've had 7 over the last 18 months, I highlighted in my remarks, 9 head-to-head trials. We're just a very, very nice position for Skyrizi and Rinvoq as we move into '24 to continue some very strong momentum that we're seeing in the actual. So quite confident in terms of how we're looking at that. And to your key point there on the price, we continue to see that we're not going to have a repeat of what we saw this year. And remember, the background there were those 7 indications that came very fast all on top of each other. And so that was the root cause of that -- of those concessions that won't repeat. Next year, we have really one more big indication, not 7, and that's Skyrizi you see that Tom highlighted.

On HUMIRA, I think if you think about the annualization rebates that given the rest increase in the second half of this year, so you have an annualization impact, and the additional rebates to secure parity access next year, really price should be the main driver of the erosion in '24. I mean volume will have an impact, particularly in wax sensitive accounts, but price will make up the vast majority of the erosion next year. And while we're not giving '24 guidance today, as you've mentioned, Chris, I've highlighted the average, it was about $7 billion when I mentioned that was a reasonable expectation for U.S. Humira next year.

Yes, I think as we look at the business, as Rob indicated, we're extremely comfortable with how the growth platform is performing. And I'd say how we're managing the biosimilar erosion, which gives us a lot of confidence that we can deliver this high single-digit going forward. From '25 -- going forward through the end of the decade. So I'd say the bulk of what we're looking at, and we're in a fortunate position from that standpoint. There are many companies in our sector we need to go out and do lots of BD to be able to drive the growth that they're trying to achieve. We're not in that position. But I'd say the bulk of what we're looking at is we're looking to add assets that could give us incremental pipeline and revenue growth towards the end of this decade and into the 30s. That's what our -- the bulk of our focus is on. .  And I'd say if I look at AbbVie's track record, certainly, BD has been a critical part of how we've grown this company over the last 11 years. And I'd say, for the most part, we have done a pretty good job when we acquire assets and bring them in we can make them perform quite well. Skyrizi is a good example of that. Certainly, Allergan was another good example of that, and there are many others. So I'd say we value BD as a very important tool and how we should grow the business and how we should position our leadership positions in these franchises. Our primary focus is within the franchises that we're operating in. So let's take immunology as an example.  I would say our greatest focus in immunology is to continue to add additional mechanisms in particular, that could be used in combination in order to create deeper levels of clinical response in areas like IBD, rheumatology and other areas. So we continue to look for those. We have several already that are in development now, like Luti, like RIPK1 and several others in our pipeline, but we'll continue to look for additional assets that we could add to that. And like I said, especially focused on combination therapy because we think that is the way to get much deeper clinical remission or responses in those patients who aren't responding to things like Skyrizi, Rinvoq, which obviously performed exceptionally well.  So that's a big area. Oncology is another big area. We have a high level of interest in next-generation CAR-T technology. We have a high level of interest in T cell engagers beyond our BCMA product. I think as we look at that asset continue to develop, we are very convinced it has a best-in-class profile. And it shows us that for the right indication, T cell engagers can be extremely effective, and they're much easier to use and can be much more broadly brought to patients and CAR-Ts, at least the current version of CAR-Ts. So I'd say that's an area that we have a high level -- in psychiatry, we're interested in additional assets in anxiety and mood, and a variety of other assets, but that gives you some feel for it. And we obviously have the financial wherewithal to go out and do transactions. We need to make sure we find the right transaction. So it's a value-enhancing asset for the company.

A question on obesity and its interface with I&I and a lot of other drug categories, frankly, are views that payers have to cover OBD medicines. And if that's correct, it's a big expense, and payers will be looking for offsets. One-off that would be for payers to squeeze other therapeutic areas as hard as they can. An example could be I&I, where there's now a really good product, your own HUMIRA at a much lower price. So we're wondering how much payers might start to force a step edit for products like Skyrizi?

And I think you've got to take a step back regardless of the obesity issues and think about the overall strategy that we pursued, which was 1 of fundamental distinction. And I'll take your point over some of these head-to-head trials, and there's 9 of them, right? So if you take Skyrizi, just in psoriasis, we have gross superiority versus every mechanism in the category. So a head-to-head of gross superiority versus Humira versus the leading IL-17 COSENTYX versus the oral Otezla, and we also have versus Stelara. So fundamentally, when payers think about stepping or not stepping or how they would think about that, there's a medical dynamic there and that distinctiveness that we have across our program is very, very important to help manage maybe the urge of the payers to think of formulary structures like that. If you think about your comments that you have -- that you heard yesterday or the day before, that's a very different dynamic.  I mean, if you're not that different or you have the same efficacy as a Humira, it's not going to go that well on some of these formularies. And so I think you got to take a step back and look at the fundamental distinctiveness that we have on both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And I think my last comment would be, let's take Reno, which is growing very fast, 60%, okay? All of that is in the second-line plus setting. So from a strategic standpoint, it's already stepped. And so when you take a look at those dynamics, we remain quite confident that as we rely on the power of raising the standard of care, that will help us navigate any of these scenarios, whether it's related to obesity or not.",312.0,122.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.040983606557377046,0.00819672131147541,0.00819672131147541,0.0,0.0,0.03278688524590164

But the two questions I have actually, one is maybe building on Terence's question around business development base in the pipeline. I think we get a lot of other questions just around sort of the underappreciated assets within your pipeline. I don't know if you can maybe just comment on that. I know there's a couple of assets that you plan out things people are overlooking where they might be some underappreciated upside? And then the second one is just on the charge you took today or this quarter on Imbruvica regarding the Medicare drug pricing program.  And obviously, I understand why you did. I'm curious on the amount and the timing of why you're doing now, I suppose I may be willing to see how the losses play out or negotiation process plays out.

So on the pipeline, I think as I look at the pipeline and how we built the pipeline and how it's playing out, I think -- I don't know that I would call it underappreciated because you don't necessarily have access to all the data that we have on some of these programs. But we obviously invested significantly over the last several years in rapidly developing the indications for Rinvoq and Skyrizi and a lot of our focus had been built around that. But in parallel, we were advancing a number of other programs along the way.  And I would say the investment that we made on Skyrizi and Rinvoq are pretty clear the kind of return that we are getting for those assets. I mean, they're growing at a phenomenal rate. In fact, in the not-too-distant future, the combination of those two products on a running rate basis will be larger than Humira, to give you some idea of how rapidly those products are growing and how large they are. But if I look at our pipeline, the real meaningful programs that we have in our pipeline that will be true needle movers for the company, there are several of them that are advancing now I think we have a high level of confidence in 400, our topo warhead platform with our c-Met version of that, we're seeing very encouraging data in CRC. We'll follow that with non-small cell lung cancer. And that platform is demonstrating to us that it is a broad-based platform that we can expand to a number of other areas. And that should be a fairly significant opportunity for us going forward. Later sort of the '27, '28 timeframe, I think it's going well have meaningful benefit play through. And then I'd say the second one is 383, our BCMA bispecific. As we indicated earlier, we're seeing more and more data out of that program that clearly tells us this has a best-in-class profile, high levels of efficacy and very good safety and very convenient dosing.  We think it has that ideal profile to be able to enter this market. And as you know, multiple myeloma is a very large market. There are very significant products in this market. So those are two opportunities. I would obviously say, $16 million. And some of our TA programs are also exciting programs that are running in parallel to these. We'll be getting more data on those next year. And I think those have significant opportunities as well. The third program I talked about is in our eye care business. It's our REGENXBIO program for both wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy. We're seeing some very, very encouraging data out of that program, and that could be a nice opportunity for us as well, and it continues to advance. So there are a number of important programs that you'll start to see more and more data as we go through '24 and into '25 that I think will give the market an opportunity to be able to better assess those.",541.0,225.0,16.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.07111111111111111,0.008888888888888889,0.0044444444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.06222222222222222

So I think a couple of things. As we have signaled in some of our regulatory filings, our last 10-Q, for instance, we had indicated that if we were to be selected in the negotiation process under the Inflation Reduction Act, that there would likely trigger an impairment. And so we had anticipated that this would be happy. And so the timing really relates to the fact that under the rules, you have to look at the fair value of that intangible asset with respect to future cash flows. And so the accounting rules would require that we would make that analysis upon selection as we had kind of previewed in our filings. And so we went through the process under that triggering event to determine what the impairment should be. And I would say that when you look at that impairment, the magnitude of the impairment is driven by a number of factors, but really, one of the biggest factors that you're seeing there is it requires you to discount the future cash flow. So as we calculate the future cash flows, looked at what we had assumed was a reasonable assumption on the price, you discount those back. And so that creates part of the magnitude of this adjustment. In terms of the negotiated price that we assumed, I think we're in the middle of these negotiations, and it really wouldn't be appropriate for us to talk about what that is. But we looked at a number of factors, and we think that process is going to play out. Certainly, we will see on February 1 in a private conversation with CMS what they anticipate at least an initial thought on price, but it won't be finalized until September 1 of next year. And so we will see what that price is as the process plays out.",324.0,130.0,1.0,5.0,6.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.007692307692307693,0.038461538461538464,0.046153846153846156,0.007692307692307693,0.046153846153846156,-0.03076923076923077

So when we've looked at the operating margins we talked about in the past, for '23 and '24, we talked about those being very, very similar. So when you think about the operating margin that we've talked about for this year and next year, it's really about 46% to 47% range. This year, our guidance is 46.5% and we would expect operating margin in '24 to be very similar to what we're seeing this year.

I mean the IBD market is very, very attractive. If we think back historically, we were always, frankly, a little surprised at how fast Humira back in the day grew when we started to achieve the UC and the Chrome's indications. And again, I would say we're very, very pleasantly encouraged about the momentum. The momentum is very, very significant. So there is significant headroom. And what we see in the market dynamic is that unlike what you might think that patients would always want to rotate off of their medications because of the severity of the disease, actually physicians haven't been able to really move the market very much over the years, simply because it's very dangerous to try to go to another drug that hasn't provided any increase in benefit for those patients. It puts those patients at risk. So when you look at what Tom had highlighted, our ability with two complementary assets -- for example, in the U.S., Skyrizi position in the early lines, Rinvoq position in later lines, both of which have exceptional performance criteria versus the market. That gives us a lot of confidence. The other thing that gives us a lot of confidence because there will be more competitive entries in the future is we think our profiles are going to hold up exceptionally well. And then there's the commercial executional component in most of the countries around the world, we have dual sales forces that basically will carry two products with four big indications. So our ability to compete in the market for share even as it gets a little more competitive over time, is still going to be very, very strong. So lots of headroom in the market, lots of unmet need in the market, and we believe we have the best position in the market for the foreseeable future.",331.0,149.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.06040268456375839,0.013422818791946308,0.020134228187919462,0.0,0.0,0.04697986577181208

On your question regarding 2025 guidance, we do periodically update the long-term guidance for our portfolio. We're obviously very pleased with the momentum we're seeing both from Skyrizi and RNA, particularly in -- if you recall when we provided -- last time we provided guidance for Skyrizi, we had about $2.5 billion of revenue in IBD in 2025 and it was $1.8 billion for Rinvoq. And those are obviously ramping very nicely. We have a lot of confidence. We periodically update that guidance, we'll find the right time to provide a holistic update to our long-term guy.

That's our IL-1 alpha beta bispecific antibody. That's an in-house antibody. And we have observed data where there's resistance to anti-TNF and other biologics with patients with 1 beta signal. So we'll be entering into ulcerative colitis looking at a potential biomarker approach. But in addition to that, we will also be looking at a set of combinations as was already mentioned, for example, with Skyrizi, we have Lutikizumab. We have other agents as well. RIPK1 was also mentioned. There's also some partnerships that we have is another mechanism we're interested in. And another one I'll mention is an IL-2 mutein. All of these are under assessment. And we do believe either you find a biomarker approach where you can see the high efficacy or if you want to see real transformational efficacy, you're going to have to go a combination approach. So those are the assets we'll be looking at. Now moving on to the question, I think it was around depression and suicidal ideation if I heard it correctly. This was in an IL-17 class agent that was recently approved. We've also observed a similar warning and precaution previously also in the IL-17 class. In fact, that previous asset, in fact, had a REMS in place. Remember, Skyrizi is an anti-IL-23 very different class. And to date, with all the data that's been generated across numerous indications, we don't see that type of signal at all nor do we have any of that in our label.  And as we look at psoriasis therapy, that particular agent that's been mentioned has been available in Europe and our physicians really don't tell us that there's much of an uptake there. So Skyrizi continues to perform well. Also, our label does not have the high rate of fungal infections that have been observed with the new 1 in the '17 class -- and also, we've talked a lot about IBD. We -- the Skyrizi doesn't also lead to IBD, which is another risk for the IL-17 class. And also with our dosing regimen -- you get it at 0 and week 4, and then it's quarterly after that. With the new one, I think there's 5 doses that are required and potentially every 8 weeks or in heavier patients every 4 weeks.

We've been -- we certainly -- when we talk about 400, we're also talking about going in different space than lung and breast, where there's a lot of competition, like colon cancer, gastric cancer, pancreas. So c-Met is a target that's expressed in many other tumors, and that's why we've developed this with topo warhead, so we can go to a broader set of tumors. And that's where we're seeing a very good data with ABBV-400 even unselected patient population, third line plus, we saw a 22% response versus 2% to 3%. What's also interesting about this is -- it's not just for colon cancer, but most chemos, most treatments and GI tumors have a lot of toxicity, a lot of diarrhea.  And one of the things that excite the clinicians about this program is actually a very low rate of diarrhea. So what makes that not only can we see some efficacy in third line, but it sees we can move to earlier lines and combined with other therapies have higher efficacy. So there's a lot of unmet need in GI tumors. And so this data, again, we're going to have more data in our next cohort at the end of this year. In CRC will have different doses, and we'll also have potential cutoffs of biomarkers. So moving very well, but we're actually in a big space, in GI tumors, as I've mentioned, even our GARP program, also where we've shown the best data is in liver cancer, where c-Met is also expressed. We have opportunities to go explore places where there's a big unmet need and the competition is not the same. Now the other targets because we talked about topo platform. We have others, 706, which is already in the clinic with 6. Next year, we'll be going to 2 other indications, which for which there's less competition in terms of ADC space.

I think you may be also reflecting on some of the ESMO data that came out I will mention long a little bit, we still see an opportunity with Teliso-V. We're going to get data later this year. But what we've already observed is 50% ORRs in a biomarker-selected population in the EGFR wild type. If you look at some of the data that has come out, the ORRs are probably right around 20% to 30%. We don't have all the breakdown of all the different lung subtypes. But 1 approach is to use a biomarker and then select the patient population rather than going so broadly that was observed at ESMO. The other thing I would say reflecting on the data that came out, if you looked at EGFR mutants in lung, you see some higher levels of efficacy, either in the frontline or second line in that space. But that comes at a cost, and that's a chemo-like adverse event profile. And those are things like nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia, fatigue. These are things that you may see slight increases in efficacy, but clearly, patients don't want that. And like -- as Tom was mentioning with our platform and including Teliso-V, we have an opportunity there in the mutant side to combine with osimertinib, which has a nice profile. And those mutant patients when they progress, half of them have highly expressed c-Met. So that's where a combo looks good. And then we're also seeing 50% ORR in that segment as well. And we have a plan to get into Phase 3 into that next year. And then as we think about heme, we spoke about 383, which we feel has best-in-class potential. And one of the things that we're observing with that one is the high level of efficacy. [PRFs], we're driving down past grade 3 and now driving down to get past grade 2.  So that enables the potential where you may not need hospitalization. And what you see now with the BCMA dual engagers is not just hospitalization but a REMS. And what we would add to that is dose spacing potentially every other month. So that one is a very nice profile, and we're moving into Phase 3 with that one, and we continue to conduct a variety of combinations there so we can move into earlier lines of therapy in multiple myeloma. We are still moving into earlier lines in Phase 3s with EPKINLY in heme, which is another dual engager. We have an asset called 453, which is our next-gen BCL2 blocker. And then we have a BTK degrader called 101 that's also in clinic.

I mean it's something that we're -- we look very closely at -- we continue to think that the Humira tail will emerge sometime in '25 or '26. And that's looking at some of the international analogs, how we think we see pricing may move I mean the one thing that we do believe is that you're not going to have a small molecule like tail, which is virtually nothing. There's going to be a sub-segment of patients that are going to stay on Humira. It's going to be modest, whether it's low price or low volume, but it will be there even in an interchangeable world. We don't necessarily believe that since we've outperformed here in volume in '23 that that's going to fundamentally change our view on the tail at this point. And again, we're still highlighting that. In terms of Stelara, obviously, we think in the U.S. that will not come until -- and I think it was recently confirmed this week until sometime in '25. And so overall, we think that's a modest net positive for AbbVie in terms of how that may play out. But that's not the primary driver of our strategy. Our primary driver of the strategy is how distinctive we are across our indications with Skyrizi versus Stelara, which I've already highlighted.

As Scott mentioned, our net leverage ratio is around 1.8x. And I have said previously that as long as we're going to pass back to 2x that leverage in 2 to 3 years, that's the way we're thinking about balance sheet capacity. So as we look at it, there's nothing from a balance capacity standpoint that would limit us today for pursuing the opportunities we'd be interested in. So that's not a limiting factor.

If you think about it, we're delivering dividend growth both in '23 and '24, while earnings are not growing, right? So then you look at the payout ratio we're at, we're going to be in the mid-50s. And we have said that over the long term, if you look at just across the industry as well, I'd say a good target is in, say, the mid- to high 40% payout ratio, which would mean that during this period where you see our payout ratio go up in the future, we're very committed to growing the dividend. We'll continue to grow the dividend, but we would expect then earnings would grow faster than dividend increases. So I would say we've gone through this period for a couple of years where we are still delivering a very nice dividend growth despite earnings declining. But given our commitment to that dividend, we're going to continue growing it. We'll likely see it step up from here, but not at the same rate as earnings growth because that payout ratio right now will be sitting in. So that's the way we think about it. Over the long term, we want to deliver a healthy, sustainable, growing dividend. And so we have a long view on this, and we are committed to delivering that growth to investors. And so that's the way we're thinking about it. We're going through a period of a couple of years here where earnings aren't growing. And then we see us return a robust growth, we'll step up that dividend again, but it's -- that's a dynamic that we're balancing here.",290.0,122.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.00819672131147541,0.0,0.0,0.02459016393442623,0.00819672131147541

Our performance this quarter tops off another excellent year for AbbVie, with results well above our initial expectations. I'm particularly pleased with the performance of our growth platform, the base business excluding Humira, which delivered full year sales growth of more than 8%, with revenue growth accelerating to more than 15% in the fourth quarter. The strength of our diversified growth platform has not only enabled us to successfully absorb the largest loss of exclusivity event to date across our industry, but it's also supported continued investment in our business for long term growth. These investments include: higher adjusted R&D expense, which was increased by nearly $600 million in 2023 and will be ranged substantially again in 2024 to support several promising pipeline programs like 383 in multiple myeloma. 400, our next-generation ADC for several solid tumor types and [Moodi] for HS, as well as inflammatory bowel disease. The proposed acquisition of ImmunoGen and their portfolio of ADCs accelerating our entry into the solid tumor space and strengthening our oncology pipeline, as well as the proposed acquisition of Cerevel, a unique opportunity to augment our presence in neuroscience with the pipeline of differentiated assets. We also increased our quarterly dividend which we announced in October. Since our inception, we have grown our dividend by more than 285%. In summary, our operational execution has been outstanding and we have considerable momentum heading into 2024, including an expected return to operational sales growth just one year following the US Humira loss of exclusivity, driven by our growth platform. We remain confident in our long-term outlook, including a return to robust growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through the end of the decade.

We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $11.11, which is $0.63 above our initial guidance midpoint, excluding the impact of IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $54.3 billion, roughly $2.3 billion ahead of our initial guidance. Most importantly, each of our five key growth areas outperformed our initial expectations. As it pertains to AbbVie's near-term outlook, we are focused on three key priorities. First, driving strong performance of our ex- Humira Growth Platform. This platform is the critical driver of our return to robust growth in 2025 and beyond. In our therapeutic portfolio, we have several key brands including Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Vraylar, Ubrelvy, and Qulipta, which are each expected to contribute double-digit sales growth in 2024. We also expect meaningful growth for aesthetics this year, driven by improving market trends in the US and continued execution across our international business. We are well positioned to drive strong long-term growth in this highly under-penetrated market. Second, we are focused on prioritizing investment in our pipeline, which encompasses numerous opportunities to elevate the standard of care for patients. We anticipate updates this year from several important R&D programs including approvals for Skyrizi in UC, 951 in the U.S., and potentially accelerated approval for Epkinly in third line plus follicular lymphoma. We also anticipate regulatory submissions for BoNT/E, our novel short-acting toxin, and potentially Teliso-V, an advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And third, we are focused on closing and integrating ImmunoGen and Cerevel. These two exciting opportunities represent substantial sources of revenue growth well into the next decade. We remain on track with the anticipated closing of both deals in the middle of the year. Today, we are also reaffirming our long-term sales outlook, which includes a return to robust revenue growth in 2025 with a high single digit CAGR through the end of the decade. Included in this outlook is an updated forecast for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Based on the impressive growth of both therapies, which we expect will collectively generate approximately $16 billion of revenue in 2024, we now anticipate Skyrizi and Rinvoq will collectively exceed more than $27 billion in sales by 2027 with robust growth continuing into the next decade. This updated forecast reflects an increase of more than $6 billion in revenue compared to our prior 2027 guidance. We expect global sales for Skyrizi to reach more than $17 billion in 2027, reflecting continued share capture in psoriasis where we are the clear market leader, as well as strong uptake in IBD. And we expect Rinvoq to achieve more than $10 billion of global sales in 2027, reflecting continued market growth and share momentum across each of Rinvoq's approved indications, including four in rheumatology, two in IBD, and atopic dermatitis. This forecast comprehends modest contributions from several new disease areas for Rinvoq, which we anticipate will be launching in the second half of the decade. These new indications have a collective peak sales potential of several billion dollars. Our updated forecast also includes higher estimates for Ubrelvy and Qulipta. We now expect total oral CGRP peak revenue of more than $3 billion, reflecting an increase of more than $1 billion. Our previously issued long-term forecasts for aesthetics, Vraylar, and 951 remain unchanged. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie. We are demonstrating outstanding execution across our portfolio and our long-term outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.

ABBV,2024-02-02,2024-02-02,,2024-02-02,2024-02-02T09:00:00-05:00,0,2024-02-02,prepared,,Jeff Stewart,"Thank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $6.9 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi total sales were approximately $2.4 billion, reflecting operational growth of 51.6%. Rinvoq total sales were more than $1.2 billion, reflecting operational growth of 62.8%. On a full-year basis, Skyrizi and Rinvoq delivered more than $11.7 billion in total combined revenue, an impressive increase of $4 billion year-over-year. And as Rob just described, we see substantial room for continued growth across each of their currently approved indications. You can get a good sense for this momentum by looking at the relationship between the current in-place share, which includes new and switching patients, and the total prescription share just today. For example, our performance in IBD has been very strong for both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. In Crohn’s disease, these two treatments together are already capturing roughly one out of every three in-play patients across all lines of therapy in the United States, while their combined total prescription share is only in the mid-single digits. You see a similar trend happening in ulcerative colitis for Rinvoq, and we anticipate launching Skyrizi for this indication later this year. So significant opportunity remains for revenue inflection in IBD, especially given their respective efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles. Across some of the other notable indications, Skyrizi is capturing roughly half of the in-place psoriasis patients in the U.S. biologic market relative to a total prescription share, which is in the mid-30s percent. Rinvoq is capturing high teens in-play share in the atopic dermatitis market, while total share is in the high single digits. Similarly, in rheumatoid arthritis, Rinvoq is capturing mid-teens in-play share, while total share is roughly 7%. So, again, we see substantial headroom for share gains in addition to the typical robust market growth across rheum, derm, and gastro. Plus, we are planning to have up to five additional indications for Rinvoq across several sizable markets that will potentially provide another significant revenue inflection in the second half of this decade and into the 2030s. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $3.3 billion, down 40.8% due to biosimilar competition. The erosion impact in the U.S. played out largely in line with our expectations this quarter, while performance across our international markets continues to trend better than expected. In the U.S., we have once again secured broad formulary access for Humira in 2024. While there will be some step down in coverage year-over-year, we will still have parity access to biosimilars for the vast majority of U.S. patient lives. Turning now to oncology, where total revenues were $1.5 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $903 million, down 19% reflecting continued pressure in new patient starts. Venclexta global sales were $589 million, up 13.7% on an operational basis, with strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. The early prescription trends for Epkinly in third line plus DLBCL have been encouraging with commercialization now underway in the US, Europe and Japan. We also anticipate the potential label expansion for follicular lymphoma later this year. Lastly, we have two new and exciting opportunities in oncology. Pending completion of the transaction, we will add Elahere to our portfolio. Elahere is a first-in-class ADC therapy approved for ovarian cancer, which is already demonstrating impressive uptake in the U.S. market. I look forward to welcoming the ImmunoGen commercial team to AbbVie. And Teliso-V, another novel ADC which has demonstrated very promising data in lung cancer. Teliso-V would further expand our scale and growth potential in solid tumors. In neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, total full year revenues were more than $7.7 billion, reflecting impressive absolute sales growth of nearly $1.2 billion. In the quarter, total revenues were approximately $2.1 billion, up 22.4% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of $789 million were up nearly 40%. We continue to see significant momentum in new prescriptions across all indications following the approval as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder just over a year ago. And our leading oral CGRP portfolio for migraine contributed $348 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 40%. We anticipate continued robust demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta this year, including the expansion of Qulipta, the only once daily oral CGRP for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine into the international markets. Based on the strong momentum, we have raised the outlook for our CGRP portfolio and now expect total peak sales from Ubrelvy and Qulipta combined to exceed $3 billion. Total Botox therapeutic global sales were $776 million, up 6.7% on an operational basis, reflecting momentum in chronic migraine, as well as other approved indications. And lastly, we recently launched 951 in both Japan and Europe, and we are pursuing commercial approval in the U.S. later this year. This treatment represents a potentially transformative next generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease and $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the commercial execution across our diversified portfolio, especially the growth platform, which is demonstrating very strong momentum as we head into 2024.

Fourth quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.4 billion, an operational increase of 6.9%. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $884 million increased 5.7%, marked by accelerating market growth and strong key product performance. Fourth quarter U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $453 million, an increase of 7.3%. We continue to see sustained momentum in the recovery of the U.S. facial toxin market, which was a primary driver of growth in the fourth quarter. Botox Cosmetic remains the clear market leader with strong and stable share, despite new competitive entrants. U.S. Juvederm sales were $156 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of more than 20% versus the prior year. This robust growth was driven by the strong launches of Volux and SkinVive, which continue to drive new consumers and greater penetration in the dermal filler category. Consistent with our expectations, the U.S. filler market recovery trails out of toxins, but it's continuing to show improvement as year-over-year growth was roughly flat in the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, we are pleased with the momentum of our U.S. aesthetics portfolio. We expect full year sales growth as our market leadership positions us very well from a competitive perspective, and we anticipate continued recovery in both toxin and filler markets. Internationally, fourth quarter aesthetic sales were $487 million, representing an operational increase of 9%. We experienced strong performance in most regions and growth benefited from the impact of China's COVID lockdowns in late 2022. Within China, the softening economic conditions that emerged in the third quarter continued to impact results. Consistent with what we experienced in the US, the economic slowdown has impacted fillers more than toxins, based upon their relatively higher price. We anticipate economic headwinds will continue in China over the near term, balanced against our expectations for continued strong performance in other international regions. Looking to the long-term, Aesthetics remains an area with very low market penetration. And we have demonstrated our ability to drive growth through investments in our customers, consumers, and innovation. As such, we anticipate Aesthetics will be a strong growth portfolio for years to come and remain confident in our ability to deliver more than $9 billion of sales by the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.",383.0,210.0,14.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.06666666666666667,0.009523809523809525,0.023809523809523808,0.0,0.0,0.05714285714285714

In 2023, we saw significant evolution of our pipeline with multiple data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals, as well as expansion of our R&D efforts with the announced ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We expect to continue this progress with numerous important clinical and regulatory milestones anticipated this year. In immunology, we recently announced positive topline results for lutikizumab our anti-IL-1 alpha beta bispecific being evaluated in hidradenitis suppurativa. In the Phase 2 study, lutikizumab demonstrated higher, high score of 50 and high score of 75 measures, as well as improvement in skin pain compared to placebo. These are very impressive results considering all patients who were inadequate responders to anti-TNF therapy. And 70% of the patients were early stage three, which is the most advanced stage of the disease. Based on these results, we plan to begin a Phase 3 program in HF later this year. We also plan to evaluate lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's, given the role that IL-1 likely plays in these diseases. Patients with UC who have an IL-1 beta signature have shown resistance to anti-TNF and other biologics, providing strong rationale for a potential biomarker approach. Additionally, we believe lutikizumab has the potential to be used in combinations to provide transformational levels of efficacy in IBD. We plan to evaluate combo approaches with lutikizumab and Skyrizi, as well as with other pipeline assets in Crohn's. Our Phase 2 studies in IBD are expected to begin later this year. Our regulatory applications are under review for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis. With approval decisions expected in the US and Europe later this year. Once Skyrizi is approved in UC, along with Rinvoq, we will have two assets with different mechanisms of action in IBD, both offering very high levels of efficacy. AbbVie will be very well-positioned with an industry-leading suite of treatment options for patients suffering from moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We continued to make very good progress with the second wave of development programs for Rinvoq. With Phase 3 studies underway in five new indications, giant cell arteritis, lupus, HF, alopecia areata and vitiligo. We anticipate data readouts for these programs over the next three years, beginning with data from our GCA study this year. Moving to oncology, where we continue to make very good progress across our heme and solid tumor programs. In the area of hematologic oncology, we'll see data in the second half of this year from the Venclexta Phase 3 VERONA trial in treatment-naive higher-risk MDS patients, with regulatory submissions and approvals, anticipated in 2025. For Epkinly, we anticipate regulatory approvals in third-line or greater follicular lymphoma later this year in both the US and Europe. We also expect to begin several new Phase 3 studies in 2024, including studies in second-line DLBCL and frontline follicular lymphoma. At the recent ASH Meeting, we presented new data for our BCMA CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 in multiple myeloma. 383 is engineered for high-affinity binding to BCMA on malignant cells, and low affinity binding to a unique CD3 epitope on T-Cells, which has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse events associated with other T-Cell engaging BCMA-based therapies, while preserving high levels of efficacy. We're very encouraged by the data emerging from our Phase 1b study, which show treatment with 383 is yielding deep and durable responses. With a lower incidence and severity of CRS. With this profile, we believe 383 can be a highly effective and tolerable treatment for multiple myeloma. While potentially allowing for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment. All attributes, which would make it very appealing to both patients and physicians. We remain on track to begin a Phase 3 monotherapy study in third-line multiple myeloma this year. And we plan to begin combination trials in earlier lines of therapy in 2025. In the area of solid tumors, we recently announced positive topline results from the Teliso-V Phase 2 LUMINOSITY study in previously treated non-small cell lung cancer. Teliso-V demonstrated strong clinical benefits across key endpoints, including, overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival, with a tolerable safety profile. We believe these results have the potential to support accelerated approval. And we plan to discuss the data with regulators in the coming months. Pending alignment with the FDA, our submission is planned for the second half of this year. We're also making good progress with our next-generation c-Met ADC ABBV-400, which utilizes the same c-Met blocking antibody as Teliso-V, but has a proprietary Topo-1 warhead to afford deeper and more durable responses with an improved therapeutic index. We remain on track to see data this year from the non-small cell lung cancer and gastroesophageal cohorts from our Phase 1 study. And based on the progress we're making in our colorectal program, we plan to begin a Phase 3 study later this year in third-line CRC. We also continue to make very good progress with our anti-GARP antibody ABBV-151. Our Phase 2 study in second-line hepatocellular carcinoma is underway, and we plan to begin several additional Phase 2 studies this year, including frontline HCC, frontline lung cancer and metastatic urothelial cancer. We look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Now moving to Neuroscience where we recently announced the European launch of ABBV-951 for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We also recently provided our complete response submission to the FDA for 951 with an approval decision anticipated in the second quarter. Our novel subcutaneous levodopa, carbidopa delivery system has the potential to offer meaningful benefits over current treatment options and others that are in development. 951 delivers significant improvements in off-time and on-time with a less invasive non-surgical system. It can deliver high levodopa doses similar to the amount provided by DUOPA. And it doesn't require combination with oral drugs to achieve high efficacy. 951 also provides a full 24-hour benefit, which should result in less morning akinesia. We're extremely excited to bring this transformative therapeutic option to patients in Europe and the US once approved. In our Aesthetics pipeline, we recently submitted our regulatory application in the US for Botox in platysma prominence. We anticipate an approval decision in the second half of this year. And we remain on track to complete the remaining CMC work this year for BoNT/E, our rapid onset short-acting novel toxin. Following completion of the remaining work, we plan to submit our regulatory application in the second half of the year, with approval anticipated near the end of 2025. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous regulatory and clinical milestones again in 2024. I also look forward to integrating the ImmunoGen and Cerevel teams and pipeline assets into our R&D organization once those transactions close this year. These two transactions significantly strengthened our oncology and neuroscience pipelines with the addition of several novel assets that have the potential to become innovative new therapies for many patients.

We have substantial momentum across the portfolio to support our long-term growth outlook. Starting with our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.79, which is $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.15 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $14.3 billion, $300 million ahead of our guidance, and down 5.4%. Most notably, these results reflect 15.3% sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 43.8% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D expense of 13.4% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 2% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.7% of sales. Adjusted net interest expense was $363 million, the adjusted tax-rate was 17.2%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2024, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $11.05 and $11.25. This earnings per share guidance includes dilution related to the ImmunoGen and Cerevel acquisitions of $0.32, which assumes closing in the middle of the year. Please note this guidance does not include an estimate for required IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect total net revenues of approximately $54.2 billion, reflecting a return to modest operational growth. At current rates, we expect foreign-exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast contemplates the following approximate assumptions for our key products in therapeutic areas. We expect global immunology sales of $25.6 billion, including Humira sales of $9.6 billion, including US erosion of roughly 36%. Skyrizi revenue of $10.5 billion, reflecting growth of more than $2.7 billion due to strong market-share performance in psoriasis, as well as robust uptake in IBD. And Rinvoq sales of $5.5 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 40% with continued market growth and share momentum across all approved indications. On a full-year basis, we anticipate that our strong volume growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq will be modestly offset by low-single digit negative net price. In oncology, we expect sales of $5.7 billion, including Imbruvica revenue of $2.9 billion and Venclexta sales of $2.4 billion. As well as contributions from Epkinly, and partial year sales from Elahere. For Aesthetics, we expect sales of $5.7 billion. Including $2.9 billion from Botox Cosmetic and mid-single-digit revenue growth from Juvederm. For Neuroscience, we expect revenue of $8.9 billion, representing growth of more than 15%, including Vraylar sales of $3.4 billion, Botox Therapeutic sales of $3.2 billion and total oral CGRP revenue of $1.6 billion. For eye care, we expect sales of $2.2 billion. Moving to the P&L for 2024, we are forecasting full-year adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment of 14% of sales, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% of sales, and adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense of $2.1 billion, which includes the partial year cost in 2024 to finance the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.7%. Finally, we expect share count to be roughly flat to 2023. Turning to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $11.9 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas. Immunology sales of $5.1 billion, including Skyrizi sales of $1.9 billion, and Rinvoq revenue of $1 billion. These estimates reflect typical first quarter seasonality as well as low single digit unfavorable net price. We expect Humira global revenue of $2.2 billion, including US sales of $1.7 billion. We also anticipate oncology revenue just above $1.3 billion, Aesthetic sales of $1.3 billion, Neuroscience revenue of $1.9 billion, and eye care sales of $600 million. We are forecasting an adjusted gross margin of approximately 83.5% of sales and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales. We also model a non-GAAP tax rate of 14.8%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.30 and $2.34. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was $12.8 billion. And we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $18 billion in 2024, which includes roughly $1.9 billion in Skyrizi royalty payments. The strong free cash flow will fully support a strong growing dividend, which we have increased by more than 285% since inception, continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down the approximately $7 billion of maturities this year, and also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong.

Just I was looking for a little bit more color on the longer-term immunology outlook. You're targeting $27 billion plus by 2027 and highlighting growth from there. So, I guess my question was just can you elaborate on how mature the existing indications, these products are going to be by 2027? And what type of growth can we anticipate longer-term? And maybe as part of that, it seems like from the comments that the growth beyond 2027 is more skewed towards Rinvoq given the new indications, but [indiscernible] like is it balanced Rinvoq and Skyrizi, or has it become more of a Rinvoq driven franchise in terms of the growth drivers over time?

Maybe I'll walk through a little bit of the process there and answer your questions. So we can see historically actuals and sort of fast forward in terms of the first thing we look at is the bio penetration of these big indications. And there still remain significant headroom in terms of the ability for moderate to severe patients with these diseases to continue to be exposed to these biologics and these advanced orals, absolutely. And we can see for sure that psoriasis still in -- even in the US is about 15%, it's relatively modest, atopic dermatitis, the penetration rate is only about 7%. And then you have higher penetrated markets like IBD and I'll talk about what's interesting about IBD, that’s somewhere in the 40% or 50% range across those. And then we can see clearly as these markets develop and I've highlighted this before that you see line of therapy expansion. So first-line becomes less and less important, as you move towards second and third-line over time. And right now, IBD is a big story about that, that we calculate into our long-term estimates, because it's still largely despite the severity a frontline oriented market, because physicians, just kind of hang on to their frontline agents, that's going to change quite dramatically believe over this mid-term and even in the long-term perspective. We have a good peg on the market growth rates. Many of these market growth rates are very significant, very stable. And we'll have good growth rates going into the next decade because of these dynamics around bio penetration and line of therapy expansion. I highlighted in my remarks around share, share we -- we have a very good competitive position, very high capture rates. And we're really in the sort of low end of the range in terms of the total prescription share, that will feed up and catch up to that. Pricing, I think we talked a little bit. We're not going to give detailed pricing. But certainly, you can see based on Scott's comments that, the idea of a high CAGR on high single-digit pricing is not something we've contemplated. So, we believe that there is significant room for growth even past 2027. Especially, as we'll have more Rinvoq indications coming that we've talked through. So we think that we're going to see robust growth based on our share capture and also how dynamic these markets are into the next decade.",430.0,205.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.01951219512195122,0.01951219512195122,0.0,0.0,0.004878048780487805

I'll just add, you think about the markets, the rheum market is growing low-single digits, atopic dermatitis is growing mid-teens and IBD is growing high-single-digits. So they're very strong market, they will continue to be strong markets for us. And we're also seeing, as Jeff mentioned, there's a lot of headroom in terms of share capture. So we do expect that robust growth to continue beyond 2027 into early part of the next decade. I think your observation is correct. Given that we would expect up to five new indications for Rinvoq. If you look at the rate of growth, Rinvoq versus Skyrizi, I think it's reasonable to assume that Rinvoq would have a higher rate of growth given the new indications, but both will grow very nicely. So, I would certainly encourage you to look at more robust expectations for both therapies with Rinvoq a little bit higher because of the new indications.",167.0,83.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.024096385542168676,0.0,0.012048192771084338,0.0,0.0,0.024096385542168676

I guess what I would say is, I have nothing new to report today, but what I'd indicate is, we've talked about the criteria that we're going to use to make the decision when we're going to make the transition. That criteria is the same, when we believe that we are comfortable, we've navigated the LOE, and the rest of the business is performing at high level. That's the point at which we want to make the transition, because we think that's the best time to be able to transition the CEO position. So I understand there's a lot of interest from investors here, that's logical and clear. Maybe what I can do is, give you a little better perspective on the process that we're going to use in order to make the decision with the Board. I would say, the Board has been actively involved for the last four or five years with a lot of emphasis around ensuring that our internal candidate would get the experiences that we thought were needed prior to making the transition. I can tell you from my perspective, that's gone extremely well. We have regularly scheduled Board meetings several times a year where we specifically talk about succession and the progress that we're making. At the point at which the business has achieved that criteria that I described before, at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting, then I would make a recommendation to the Board that this is the proper time to be able to make the transition. The Board would vote on that recommendation. At the end of that vote, we would send out an announcement to investors. And what you can expect when you get that announcement is that, we would make an announcement that we were going to make the transition out at some point in the future, in all likelihood four months to six months in the future. And the purpose of that is to make the final transition between myself and that person. And that'll take four months to five months in order to be able to do that. I would say it's also very likely at that time, based on the discussions I've been having with the Board, is that, I will be named the Executive Chair for a period of time, and the purpose of that will be to make the transition of the full position over a period of time. So I think it's a very well thought out, I think very well managed process.

So we established many years ago now this HS market with the approval of Humira. And we thought it was a relatively small market, and it turned out to be quite a surprise. There is a significant amount of patients around the world that suffer from HS, it's already a multi-billion dollar category. And we think it's going to continue to expand. And I say that, because we can see that like IBD, there's just some new approvals just coming. So, everyone sort of holds on Humira as long as they can if they're exposed to a biologic. And so we see the same dynamic as you start to see IL-17s come into this space, and certainly, we're very excited about lutikizumab because of the profile that we're seeing emerge in the clinic. So it's a significant commercial opportunity. And I would say that when we look back over all the Humira indications, over the last decade or more, HS was one of the most rapid indications that moved to $1 billion plus business.

Part of it starts, I would say, almost 15 years ago with our insights in Crohn's disease with Humira, as Jeff was discussing, where we started to see efficacy in patients that had HS. We saw a good amount of overlap between Crohn's and HS. So that's part of it. Now that doesn't really pan out for IL-17, but what we've observed with IL-1 beta in particular is that, our internal data and external data do show elevated expression signals with one beta. So we think we have that opportunity with luti, because it also covers 1 beta and we have two shots at this, right. One is, to go specifically and look at a biomarker-driven targeted profile where we would be able to distinguish which patients actually have that higher expression. And the other approach, which we maybe weren't talking about years ago because we didn't have a product like Skyrizi which have high efficacy and very strong safety profile in Crohn's. What we have now is the opportunity to also look at in combination.

But we think those are really government actions and government rules. And so, we see that the market we believe will play out largely like it has with the other government channels, that it's a unique dynamic in terms of essentially a forced negotiation that we think will be contained largely in the Medicare space. So that's how we view the world.",138.0,60.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.016666666666666666,0.0,0.016666666666666666,-0.03333333333333333

Yes, we do see impact on neutrophils, it's dose-driven. However, I think we think about inflammatory bowel disease, probably lupus, others to have a different tolerance for benefit-risk, because today in those disease states despite the success that we've seen with Skyrizi and Rinvoq, there's still substantial headroom to lead to more transformational efficacy, not every patient is getting into remission, though high levels, not every patient. So we still believe that a combo can get to that and break that efficacy threshold. The other opportunity there is what we'll do with the combination is obviously optimize the dose to assure safety.

So, I think as you've seen in resistance we've seen that overall survival benefit, a very substantial one, unprecedented thus far. And to your point, the plan is to move into earlier lines of therapy. Secondly, it's also part of the strategy to move into sensitive populations, which is around 55% of the population, resistance is around 45%. And then the third aspect is, we've seen encouraging data in medium expressers of FR alpha. And those are approximately 30% of the patients, high is around 35%. So those are the three strategies to go forward. Now how do we get into earlier lines of therapy? Well, a couple of things, insights that we've seen. One is, we've seen Elahere been able to combine at full dose with carbo-platinum. So that's encouraging, that gives you an opportunity to upfront combine. And then as you stated, maintain on Elahere or with Elahere plus BEV. So the other approaches that we would do getting to earlier line of maintenance is have that upfront therapy and then we see patients that go onto BEV, we can combine with BEV at that time point. And we'll be looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors, which is about the other half of the patient populations, which are HRD deficient. So, taken altogether, we see there is an opportunity. Now, the PFS is going to be a little bit longer, along with OS. So that is something that we're planning for, we'll start these studies as soon as possible, but they will read out in the later part of the decade and into 2030.",281.0,113.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.04424778761061947,0.008849557522123894,0.017699115044247787,0.0,0.0,0.035398230088495575

So we do expect that in the US tail will start to emerge in 2025 or 2026 timeframe. Keep in mind 2024 is the first full year for US biosimilars. We'll have to see what happens with volume uptake this year and also where interchangeability lands. And ultimately, what does contracting look like next year. So, I wouldn't expect us to quantify the tail this year. But it's certainly possible, something we would do either in 2025 or 2026. As it relates to international, you're seeing, I think this year, it's a step-down of about $400 million. Half of that is really the last wave of markets like Canada, Puerto Rico where we're seeing, I'd say, some incremental erosion we would expect this year. And then the other half would be your typical international price erosion you see across therapeutic areas. So not really specific to biosimilars. And then the other quarter of it would be what we're seeing is just the strength of Skyrizi and Rinvoq as these newer agents elevate standard-of-care, you see some share go to those newer agents. And so, probably the best way to think about international would be, if you want to adjust for half of the erosion this year as being more of the final waves, and then you get a sense of what could potentially be the ongoing beyond that. But we'll be more specific, I think we need to see really how the US plays out with this being the first full year for biosimilars, before we can really give you more color.

So what we look at when we see this market at a macro -- at a macro-level, you have a significant number of patients, 85% of patients are just on these oral medication. So, oral [indiscernible]. Okay. And they essentially need to consume more and more and more orals, and sometimes at the end of it they're taken 12 pills a day, it's very, very difficult to manage. But then they're faced with a very difficult decision, which we kind of call like a surgical barrier. And that surgical barrier is to get any sort of more advanced relief, you either have to think about deep brain stimulation, which is a brain surgery or our own DUOPA, which is a GI surgery. So the way we see this market developing is we see that 951 starts to establish a very nice transition zone, because you don't have -- it's a subcu. So a new market segment that starts to emerge before bigger interventions like DBS or DUOPA. And obviously, the ability to basically move quicker to more relief from these chronic oral basically over treatment. So that's how we see it. And as Roopal highlighted, we're seeing some very nice uptake in Japan, where we launched late last year, and also in Germany and some of the first European launches. So that's how the market is exactly playing out. We're establishing essentially a new high efficacy category here with 24 hours of ongoing relief. You can do super specific dosing titration and the pump is much smaller and again, it's a subcu injection that you move around every three days. So it's a nice -- it's a nice opportunity for the company.",299.0,127.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.007874015748031496,0.03937007874015748,0.007874015748031496,0.0,0.0,-0.031496062992125984

First, 916, that's our A beta antibody. What we like about that one thus far, the profile we've seen is a long half-life, which would be good to space out dosing. Potentially higher potency if that holds, and we see robust reductions in beta amyloid that could allow for subcutaneous dosing that's spaced apart. And the other thing we are looking at is potentially lower ARIA. So if we see those three things over the course, I would say, end of this year, early next year, I think that, that would be quite exciting, because it would be a differentiated profile, again a better convenience and potentially better benefit-risk profile. So that's 916. 552 is our SV2A that's our oral medication in cognition that's currently in Phase 2. And we anticipate readout at the end of this year, early next year. Now, that one is being studied in a setting where patient can be on a therapy already like an [Aricept] (ph), or nothing. And we would use the typical ADAS-Cog assessments along with a variety of others including other neuropsychiatric symptoms, like depression. So that's another nice one that could combine with a variety of different assets in Alzheimers. The third one I'll mention is around Emraclidine, which comes from Cerevel. They are at early stages right now in elderly patients. And the goal there would be an Alzheimer's disease psychosis of the six million or so diagnoses, I would say around 40% of these patients present with symptoms of psychosis. So with all the therapies that are in the clinic, we think we have a very nice complementary suite of options that could address numerous symptoms of Alzheimers, because it won't be just one therapy that's going to solve this.

Yes, we did include ImmunoGen and Cerevel in our long-term guide.

So there's nothing that we took down. But just keep in mind that you've got a pretty, pretty wide range. If you look at Street consensus, we're encouraged that it continues to move up. It has moved up over the course of the last quarter, about $3 billion in 2029. It's nice to see that upward movement. But it's still below what we expect. If you think that, that growth rate for the Street is just under 5%, we expect high-single-digits. And so, even with this update, as well as ImmunoGen and Cerevel, we're still high-single-digits.

So I'll start with the US and we have started to see the US toxin market recover the end of 2023. We expect that recovery to continue. And for the market growth for toxins to continue to improve in 2024. For fillers, in the US, in Q4, after multiple quarters of decline, the filler market in the US was somewhat flat. And so, that dynamic of the filler market recovery lagging the toxin market recovery is playing out. And we do expect that recovery on fillers to also continue -- to a lesser degree than toxins, more of a modest growth, positive growth for 2024. And as we look at the beginning of the year here in 2024, we are seeing our patient demand metrics and Google metrics really supporting our expectations here. In terms of China, we do expect the economic headwinds that we saw beginning mid-year 2023 to continue in the near-term with China. And we expect the China Aesthetics market to be flat overall in 2024. That would look like negative market in the first half of the year until the China market starts to recover in the second half of 2024. And we expect that China performance to be balanced against expectations for strong performance in other international regions, including Japan, which has become an important market for Aesthetics and areas of Latin America, like Brazil, which is a highly aesthetically oriented market. It's also important to know in terms of Q1 of 2024, in terms of our guidance there that the growth in the US will be offset by that international decline, specifically in China. So not only the China economic headwinds, but also a difficult year-over-year comp in Q1, because recall, in Q1 of 2023, there was the post-pandemic reopening in China. So that's really how we see the market growth factors in US, China and other parts of the world playing out in 2024.",335.0,159.0,3.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.018867924528301886,0.050314465408805034,0.006289308176100629,0.0,0.0,-0.031446540880503145

To build on the Aesthetics story, I said in the past to get to our guidance of greater than $9 billion, we need to deliver annual growth of high-single-digits on average. And as Carrie just walked you through, we haven't quite seen the recovery for the fillers market yet this year. And we will, but it's not going to be a normal year, we'll see a ramping. And we also had a slowdown in China. But despite that we're still delivering high single digit growth. And given how under penetrated these markets are, we can drive that market growth that's required to achieve the long-term guidance. And then on top of that, we have several innovations that will further support that growth. I've said this before, but the masseter and platysma indications for Botox will add a few $100 million each. Our novel short-acting toxin BoNT/E has the potential to activate new patients who have not started toxin due to fear of an unnatural look. So that could drive an inflection in market growth and market share. And then our region, our fillers pipeline is really aimed at providing both short and long-term treatment benefits for consumers. So we have several avenues to get to our greater than $9 billion guide.

So for 2024, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've guided to 46.5%. When we do return to robust growth in 2025, we do see that operating margin will expand, and will continue to expand as we grow through the decade. I think that when we think about the pace of that expansion, it will be a relatively steady over several years. I would though, if you're modeling that, I would kind of peak it out at around 50%. I think that's where we'll hit a peak at the operating margin. But we do see expansion both in 2025 on that return to robust growth, including the impact of the two transactions ImmunoGen and Cerevel, which should presumably be a full-year at that point in time. But at the full year impact, we see that expansion. And I do think it's worth noting, even at our current levels, we have industry-leading operating margin.

So with respect to the tax rate, we were essentially flat between this year and last year at 15.7%.

What you'll see is a step up in a couple of years when the US tax rates do increase the GILTI rate in particular, will increase. So we see that over a three year period about 1% per year on average. That does include all the impacts of a number of things going on globally with the OECD and some of these -- OECD minimum taxes and other things. I would say the one thing it does not include, you saw just this week, the House passed a tax bill that includes the provision regarding the R&D expensing.

That was the whole objective. And we knew we had to build a very diversified growth platform in order to be able to do that, to be able to absorb that impact and return to growth as rapidly as possible. And so, we as an executive team focused a lot of energy around how do we do that, how do we build it, how do we do it in the right markets. I think AbbVie, I'm obviously biased, I guess, but I would say our commercial execution has always been exceptional in my opinion. We understand the markets we're in extremely well. We understand the competitive environment that we compete in those markets extremely well. We understand the patient journey and how that patient journey is affected by access to medicines to ensure that patients can get their medicines routinely and be able to get the benefit of those medicines. It takes all of those things I think to end up with kind of success that we see with assets like Skyrizi and Rinvoq. But it also takes I think a company that is very good at what I describe as read and react. There are always challenges in businesses as big and as complex as this. And I think the difference between companies that can continue to perform at the top tier, year in and year out is they're good at seeing issues, and then quickly reacting to how they're going to either offset those, or deal with those. We had many of those examples. I'd say the label change on Rinvoq was a great example. But look at where Rinvoq is growing now. And despite that label change many would not have predicted that. Migraine, was a very challenging market for a period of time. We look at how we've operated with Ubrelvy and Qulipta. And the kind of success we've seen against the competitors in those markets. Neuroscience, very different kind of market with Vraylar. That's all about trying to grow market-share and expand your position there with a very good asset. And so, we're good at that, and I think that is the real differentiator. The other thing I'd say is, I think we have been very efficient at our R&D investment. We obviously don't have the largest R&D investment in the industry. But we produced a tremendous amount of return against that R&D investment. Now having said that, as we go forward, we know we need to increase R&D as I've said in my comments. We did a fairly significant increase last year despite dealing with the Humira LOE. And we're going to do another fairly significant increase this year because we had some assets that had very, very significant opportunities like 383 and like 400 and several others. They are going to require a large Phase 3 -- multiple large Phase 3 studies to be able to get the kind of label that we need, and that's another thing, I'd say, we're good at. Understanding how you have a competitive label and building your clinical programs to get that. So, I think it requires all of those things. I don't think there is one magic formula. I think those are the kinds of things that we have honed here at AbbVie an executive team. And we execute very well against those.",631.0,265.0,18.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.06792452830188679,0.018867924528301886,0.011320754716981131,0.0,0.007547169811320755,0.04905660377358491

We've learned a lot from watching Skyrizi and Rinvoq in Crohn's. And to Rick's points, look, we're very careful about how we position these assets, you know how we basically represent them with our medical teams and our commercial teams. And so what we see certainly in our biggest markets, we see that they are actually complementary positioning. So, Rick highlighted the label change, right. So Rinvoq, in the US, is basically indicated for use after a TNF. So it's basically a later-line therapy. Skyrizi, if you look at the Skyrizi, you see results, it's very, very impressive. We've studied some very, very tough patients there. The bio-naive patients, the efficacy is just outstanding. I would say it's best-in-class. So we can see that based on the profile of the agents for many of our representatives, we're able to talk to physicians about the consideration for Skyrizi frontline. And then in later lines Rinvoq. So the cannibalization or the overlap is very manageable and minimal. And what happens is you start to see this, this very significant build for total AbbVie share because of that complementary positioning. So we're quite confident that we'll be able to navigate this very well just as we see in the larger Crohn's market.",235.0,94.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.05319148936170213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05319148936170213

So the short answer is, we have not seen an impact on our Aesthetics business positive or negative so far. That said, absolutely, our customers and our consumers are participating in this market. We are seeing it integrated into some of these Aesthetics practices. And to your point, there are instances where a patient will make a trade-off in terms of her share of wallet. But that said, we do see it as a long-term tailwind anytime people are getting more engaged in their appearance, that's a positive thing for Aesthetics. And as we ask our consumers and our customers about it, really that -- what we've learned is that it does reinforce its long-term tailwind because the majority of people who engage in these medical weight-loss products are more interested in Aesthetics afterwards than they never before.

So our BD efforts continue to be focused on identifying assets, really that can drive growth in the next decade across immunology, oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. But we have what we need in our current portfolio to deliver on growth expectations in this decade. So our external efforts are really aimed at early-stage opportunities, which are typically smaller-sized deals. As we look across the growth areas, if you think about immunology Skyrizi and Rinvoq will drive robust growth into the next decade. So our focus in immunology in terms of BD is really looking for new mechanisms of action that can elevate standard-of-care whether monotherapy or in combination. I'd say there's a lot of interest in combination. In oncology, ImmunoGen really nicely complements our efforts with ADCs, it gives us a head start, an entry in the solid tumor space, that we're not in today. But in addition to ADCs, we're focused on bispecific, multi- specifics immuno onc agents. We also recently announced a collaboration with Umoja studying insight to CAR-T therapy. So a lot of focus in oncology, but these again would be earlier-stage smaller-sized deals. In Neuroscience, Cerevel adds depth to our neuropsych pipeline, but we also have a focus on migraine and neurodegeneration. In eye care, we're extremely excited about the REGENXBIO program in wet-AMD and diabetic retinopathy. But we continue to look for innovation in glaucoma and retinal disease. So we certainly have an interest there. And then in Aesthetics, it's always about looking for innovation that can drive new consumers into our providers practices.

That will occur -- the implementation date is a little bit mixed, because it depends on fiscal year-ends of legal entities, but let's call it 2026 is when we can look at that.

And we have we have contemplated in our planning and long-term guidance, both the Part-D redesign and of course the IRA impacts based on our projections over when some of our drugs might be negotiated. To give you some color on the Part-D redesign, we have clearly a very good visibility over the pricing dynamics that will take place as you say, many of our brands basically will be under the catastrophic redesign component. Now we've also understood based on one of the policy items, which is the cap and smooth, we've also countered some of that price with volume offsets based on patients having the ability to acquire these. Now that volume does not fully offset the pricing impact. But suffice it to say that, that's been very much contemplated into that.

Clearly, and we have contemplated that in the high single digit CAGR, the impacts of IRA. But as you think about the annual progression, it is important to note that Part-D benefit redesign starts in 2025. So that is certainly something you should consider for modeling of annual sales. I mean, that impact by itself, on a net basis could be worth a few points of growth. As Jeff mentioned, the higher cost share with an offset in volume, we have studied the improvement in abandonment rates as we look at the low-income subsidy part of Part-D which doesn't have the out of pocket burden that the standard benefit does. And when we compare the abandonment rates and as you address this issue of out of pocket burden, we would expect the abandonment rates to improve across Medicare Part-D, but not enough to fully offset the higher-cost share. That was something we certainly contemplated. But as you think about the progression of growth, the rate of growth will accelerate starting next year through 2029. So we'll deliver a high-single-digit CAGR. But it's important to note that in 2025, you do have that beginning of Part-D benefit redesign, which adds, I'd say a couple of points of growth headwind that will still allow us to deliver robust growth, but it won't -- you shouldn't think about the same amount of growth every year, it's going to accelerate over the long-range plan.",262.0,121.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.024793388429752067,0.049586776859504134,0.008264462809917356,0.0,0.0,-0.024793388429752067

I'm extremely pleased with our start to 2024 with first quarter results exceeding our expectations. Before we discuss our performance in more detail, I'd like to share my perspective on the planned CEO transition that was announced earlier this year. After serving more than 11 years as AbbVie's first CEO, I have decided to retire from the role effective July 1, of this year and will continue to serve AbbVie as Executive Chairman of the Board. As you heard me say before, it is important that we choose the right time to make this critical leadership transition. The Board and I have been long planning for my eventual succession and now is the opportune time to move forward with the transition. As our business is performing very well and is in a strong position for the long-term. We are successfully navigating the Humira U.S. loss of exclusivity. We have built an outstanding company culture, an important priority and competitive advantage. And our productive R&D engine, which has yielded numerous innovative new medicines for patients will continue to fuel our robust pipeline for years to come. After a multi-year process, our board has unanimously selected Rob Michael, our current President and Chief Operating Officer as AbbVie's next CEO. I have known and worked with Rob for many, many years and he is an excellent choice as my successor. He brings the experience, the leadership and the strategic vision to build on AbbVie's past successes, advance our strategy and enhance shareholder value. Since our inception, Rob has held several important leadership positions that have collectively had a tremendous impact on AbbVie from establishing our financial planning organization to navigating the end of exclusivity for Humira in the U.S., to driving key business development opportunities that have been critical to diversify our business and support long-term growth, including the acquisitions of Allergan and ImmunoGen and the pending Cerevel transaction. Looking back, AbbVie has evolved tremendously as an independent company and our performance has truly been exceptional. Since our inception, we've grown our revenue from $18 billion to $55 billion. Our market capitalization has increased substantially from $54 billion to roughly $300 billion today. We have achieved a total shareholder return of more than 675%, which is top tier relative to our peers. And importantly, we’ve substantially increased our investments in R&D to discover and develop new medicines that have the potential to improve the lives of patients. As I look ahead, our company has never been stronger and our future has never been brighter. We are executing well across all aspects of our business and our long-term growth prospects remain very strong. In summary, it has been a privilege and immensely gratifying to serve with all of my AbbVie colleagues for the past 11 years, growing AbbVie into what it is today. And I look forward to continuing to work with Rob and the leadership team to create meaningful value for our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. And I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our shareholders for the trust and confidence you put in me as AbbVie's CEO. With that, I will turn the call over to Rob for comments on our recent business performance.

Before I comment on our first quarter performance, I want to congratulate Rick on his exceptional leadership of AbbVie over the past 11 years. During his tenure, Rick made several strategic moves that have positioned AbbVie to have a bright future beyond Humira, consistently drove the organization to deliver very strong performance and demonstrated the genuine care for our employees, patients, shareholders and communities that has defined who we are as a company today. It has been my privilege to work closely with Rick over many years, and I look forward to working with him in his role as Executive Chairman. AbbVie's outlook is very strong and I am excited about the remarkable impact that we the remarkable impact that we will continue to have on patients' lives. Turning to first quarter performance, we're off to an excellent start to the year with strong top and bottom-line results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $12.3 billion approximately $400 million ahead of our expectations. This overachievement was driven by our ex-Humira growth platform, which delivered revenue growth of more than 15% this quarter and includes continued robust sales from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, with combined growth above 50% in their fifth full year on the market, as well as double-digit revenue growth from several other key products including Venclexta, Vraylar, Ubrelvy and Qulipta. This broad based sales momentum clearly demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio with multiple growth drivers to support our long-term outlook. We are also making excellent progress with several of our near-term priorities. We recently completed the acquisition of ImmunoGen, which accelerates our entry into the solid tumor market and strengthens our oncology pipeline. The integration has been seamless and we are impressed by the caliber of talent we have welcomed into AbbVie. We also remain on track with the pending acquisition of Cerevel, which we anticipate will close in the middle of the year. Cerevel's pipeline of differentiated assets will further augment our neuroscience portfolio. In addition, we continue to advance our R&D pipeline and invest for long-term growth. This progress includes the FDA's full approval of Elahere for FR alpha positive platinum resistant ovarian cancer, a meaningful first in class treatment for patients and a significant long-term growth opportunity for AbbVie in solid tumors. We also gained U.S. approval of Juvederm Voluma XC for temple hollows, further strengthening our leadership in aesthetic fillers, and we executed several business development opportunities adding novel early stage programs and partnerships in oncology and immunology. Given the strong results this quarter, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.16 and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.13 and $11.33. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie and I am extremely pleased with the momentum of our diverse portfolio. We're off to an excellent start to the year and we are well positioned to deliver a high-single-digit revenue CAGR through the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.

I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $5.4 billion exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi global sales were $2 billion reflecting operational growth of 48%. We continue to see exceptional momentum across all of the approved indications. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is the clear market leader in the U.S. biologic psoriasis market with a total prescription share now above 35%. That's more than double the share of the next closest biologic therapy. Share is also ramping nicely in PsA, especially in the dermatology segment, where we are now capturing one out of every four new or switching in play biologic patients. Globally, Skyrizi has achieved psoriatic in play share leadership in nearly 30 key countries. In IBD, Skyrizi is on track to add more than $1 billion of incremental sales growth this year. We are seeing tremendous performance in Crohn's disease, where our compelling head-to-head data versus Stelara is driving a meaningful inflection of patient share. As a result, we have now achieved in play share leadership in Crohn's across all lines of therapy in both the U.S. and Japan as well as other key markets around the world. And finally, we are preparing for the launch of Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which represents another substantial long-term growth driver. We expect approval decisions in the middle of this year and anticipate rapid access in the U.S. following our launch. Given the robust frontline capture for Skyrizi in Crohn's and the exceptional bio-naive data we have generated in UC, we anticipate a strong launch. Turning now to Rinvoq with global sales of approximately $1.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of 61.9%. In rheum, we continue to see strong prescription growth across each of the four approved indications, and I'm especially pleased with our performance in rheumatoid arthritis, where Rinvoq has achieved in play share leadership in nearly 20 key international markets. Atopic dermatitis is tracking in line with our expectations with continued market share momentum globally. Importantly, we recently announced positive results from LEVEL UP, our second head-to-head study in AD. LEVEL UP demonstrated Rinvoq superiority for patients starting therapy on the 15 milligram dose versus Dupixent across key efficacy parameters, including the high levels of skin clearance and itch reduction. We anticipate these strong head-to-head results will support additional share capture, especially given Rinvoq label use in the U.S., which requires that initiation with a 15 milligram dose. And in IBD, Rinvoq's uptake continues to be very strong. Rinvoq is capturing high teens in play patient share in ulcerative colitis as well as mid-teens in play patient share in Crohn's disease. This performance is especially encouraging recognizing that we're still relatively early in the launch phase for both the UC and CD indications, and the lines of therapy are also expanding, with second line plus growing even faster as patients cycle to newer, higher efficacy agents like Rinvoq and IBD. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of approximately $2.3 billion, down 35.2% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. played out slightly better than our expectations in the quarter with the vast majority of the impact this quarter driven by price. As previously communicated, the recent changes to the CVS template formularies were anticipated in our full year outlook for U.S. Humira and the volume impact is tracking in line with our expectations. Our guidance has also contemplated the impact of additional formulary changes that are expected to go into effect over the course of the year. We continue to anticipate that Humira will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were more than $1.5 billion exceeding our expectations. Imbruvica global revenues were $838 million, down 4.5%, reflecting continued competitive pressure in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $614 million, up 16.3% on an operational basis and we are seeing robust momentum internationally with strong performance for both CLL and AML. Elahere generated $64 million of sales to AbbVie, reflecting a partial quarter of revenue following the February close of the ImmunoGen acquisition. The Elahere sales and marketing team is executing very well and I'm pleased with the smooth integration into our commercial organization. We anticipate that the recent positive updates in the NCCN guidelines for both platinum sensitive and platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients as well as the full label approval, which of course, includes the compelling overall survival data that has never been achieved before in these platinum resistant patients will continue to drive strong Elahere uptake. Lastly, the global launch of Epkinly in third line plus DLBCL is also performing well and we remain on track for the potential label expansion for follicular lymphoma later this year. Neuroscience total revenues were nearly $2 billion, up 16% on an operational basis, again, ahead of our expectations. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of Vraylar with global sales of $694 million, Ubrelvy with total revenue of $203 million and Qulipta with global sales of $131 million. Each of these leading assets continue to gain share and remain competitively well positioned. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well, especially in chronic migraine. Total global sales were $748 million, up 4.5% on an operational basis. And finally, we are very excited about 951, which will be commercialized as Vyalev in the U.S. and represents a potentially transformative next generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. Feedback from the launches in Japan and Europe have been very encouraging and we remain on track for commercial approval in the U.S. later this year. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and commercial execution. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics.

First quarter global aesthetic sales were over $1.2 billion, reflecting a modest decline on an operational basis. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $776 million were roughly flat versus the prior year. We continue to see sustained momentum in the facial injectable market recovery that emerged in the back half of last year. Consistent with the past few quarters, the toxin market grew by a mid-single-digit percentage. We saw similar year-over-year increases in the number of facial filler procedures, representing a return to quarterly market growth for the first time since early 2022. From a competitive perspective, our U.S. aesthetics portfolio continues to perform well. Market share for both Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm was stable in the first quarter as these assets remain the clear market leaders. While we're pleased that the market and share trends across U.S. facial injectables are aligned with our previous expectations, our first quarter results were impacted by customers holding lower than normal inventory levels at quarter end. This dynamic relates to a decision made during the quarter to shift the timing of certain promotional activities into the second quarter. We therefore expect inventory levels to normalize in the second quarter and remain on track to deliver full year aesthetics sales growth in the U.S. Internationally, first quarter aesthetic sales were $473 million reflecting an operational decline of 5.5%. Consistent with our expectations, growth in China was impacted by persistent economic headwinds as well as a challenging comparison versus the first quarter of last year, which benefited from a robust recovery post-COVID. We are monitoring the economic developments across China and continue to anticipate a recovery in the second half of this year. Our pipeline continues to generate important new assets. Uptake of our recently launched Volux and SkinVive products remain strong, underscoring the importance of innovation within aesthetics. Given this context, we are excited for the upcoming launch of Juvederm Voluma XC for the treatment of temple hollows. As the only dermal filler approved for use in the upper face, we anticipate the Voluma XC introduction will activate more consumers and support the long-term growth of our filler portfolio. And within our toxin pipeline, we continue to expect FDA approval of the platysma prominence indication for Botox near the end of this year, enhancing Botox growth potential as a noninvasive treatment to reduce the appearance of vertical neck bands and improve jawline definition. We also remain on track to submit a new drug application for our short acting toxin, BoNT/E, before the end of this year. This novel toxin has demonstrated a rapid onset of action as well as a short duration of effect, meaningfully lowering the barrier for toxin adoption across consumers who have been considering but hesitant to try Botox. Given this profile, BoNT/E has significant market expansion potential as satisfied patients would naturally convert to Botox. Overall, the underlying trends across our aesthetics portfolio align well with our previous expectations and we remain on track to deliver high-single-digit global aesthetics growth this year.

We recently announced positive top-line results from 2 Phase III studies for Rinvoq in dermatology and rheumatology. In the LEVEL UP study, which evaluated Rinvoq against dupilumab in atopic dermatitis, Rinvoq demonstrated superiority on the primary endpoint at week 16, which was a composite endpoint measuring skin clearance and itch reduction. Twice as many Rinvoq patients achieved this very stringent endpoint compared to dupilumab. Rinvoq also demonstrated superiority on all rank secondary endpoints in this trial. LEVEL UP was a study in which patients started on Rinvoq 15 milligrams and could escalate to 30 milligrams if they did not achieve treatment goals, which is how Rinvoq is prescribed for atopic dermatitis in the U.S. We also saw very rapid responses with Rinvoq demonstrating superiority on itch as early as week two and on skin lesions as early as week four. Rinvoq's safety profile in the LEVEL UP trial was consistent with what has been observed in previous studies. There were no serious infections in patients treated with Rinvoq and one in the dupilumab group. The rate of serious adverse events was similar across treatment arms. There were no malignancies, MACE events or VTEs reported in either treatment group. Based on these data as well as results from previous Phase III studies, we remain very confident in Rinvoq's profile in atopic dermatitis, and we believe it offers meaningful advantages over other products on the market today. We also announced positive top-line results from our Phase III select giant cell arthritis trial, which evaluated Rinvoq in combination with a 26-week steroid taper regimen compared to patients receiving placebo in combination with a 52-week steroid taper. In the study, Rinvoq 15 milligrams met the primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrating superiority on sustained remission from week 12 through week 52, as well as on disease flare and reduction in cumulative steroid exposure at week 52. Importantly, Rinvoq's safety profile was consistent with what has been observed in more than 15,000 patients previously studied across controlled trials. The mean age in this population was 71, which is the oldest population studied to date with Rinvoq. And the average prednisone equivalent dose at baseline was almost 35 milligram. Rates of serious adverse events and VTEs were similar across treatment groups. There were no MACE events in the Rinvoq arm, while there were two in the placebo group. Based on the results from the select GCA trial, we believe Rinvoq has the potential to be a safe and tolerable oral treatment option. We plan to submit our regulatory applications for this indication later this year. We continue to make very good progress with our inflammatory bowel disease programs. We anticipate several advancements this year, including the initiation of a Phase II study for lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis. The start of our Phase II Crohn's disease platform study, which will evaluate combinations of Skyrizi with lutikizumab and other novel biologics. And we remain on track for approval decisions for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, with the U.S. expected in the second quarter and Europe in the second half of the year. We also continue to invest in external innovation to expand our immunology pipeline, as evidenced by four deals that we announced in the first quarter. These include the acquisition of Landos Biopharma, which brings an oral NLRX1 agonist currently in Phase II for ulcerative colitis, a partnership with OSE immunotherapeutics to develop a novel ChemR23 agonist antibody for inflammatory conditions, such as IBD and RA. A collaboration with Parvus Therapeutics to utilize their immune tolerization platform to develop novel therapies for IBD, and a collaboration with Tentarix Biotherapeutics to develop conditionally active, multi-specific biologics in immunology and oncology. We are excited to partner with these companies who are all pursuing very innovative approaches to developing transformative therapies. Moving to oncology, where in the quarter, we closed the ImmunoGen transaction, which brings exciting programs in both solid and blood cancers. Last month, Elahere received full approval from the FDA for FR alpha positive platinum resistant ovarian cancer in patients treated with up to three prior therapies. This conversion to full approval was based on data from the confirmatory Phase III MIRASOL trial, where Elahere demonstrated an overall survival benefit and significantly reduced the risk of cancer progression. We expect to see results from additional ImmunoGen programs this year, including data from the Phase II PICCOLO study evaluating Elahere as a monotherapy in FR alpha positive third line plus platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients who are not eligible for retreatment with platinum-based therapies. And we expect to see data in the second half of the year from a potentially registration-enabling Phase II trial for our CD123 targeting ADC, Pivek in a rare blood cancer called blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. Now moving to program updates in hematologic oncology. Based on the totality of the data from our TRANSFORM-1 trial and following recent feedback from regulators, we will not be submitting navitoclax for approval in myelofibrosis, and we will wind down the TRANSFORM-2 study, in the relapsed refractory setting. In other areas of [EMAC], we remain on track for several regulatory and clinical milestones this year, including regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe for a Epinkly in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. The Phase III readout from the Venclexta VERONA trial, in treatment-naive, higher-risk MDS and initiation of a Phase III monotherapy study for ABBV-383 in third-line multiple myeloma. We remain very excited about this asset's potential to become a best-in-class BCMA CD3 bispecific by providing deep, durable responses and low incidence and severity of CRS and with the potential for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment. Moving to other areas of our pipeline. In aesthetics, we remain on track to submit our regulatory application for BoNT/E in the second half of the year. Our rapid onset short-acting toxin as a highly differentiated clinical profile compared to currently available neurotoxins. BoNT/E is designed for patients that are considering using facial toxins for the first time or for a special event and will allow them to experience results over a very short period of time. This novel toxin will complement our existing business as patients would naturally transition to BOTOX following experience with this trial toxin. And in neuroscience, we continue to make good progress with 951, where we have received regulatory approvals in 33 countries thus far and anticipate an approval decision in the U.S. in the second quarter. As Rob mentioned, we remain on track to close the Cerevel transaction in the middle of this year. Cerevel recently announced positive top line results from their Phase III TEMPO-3 trial evaluating Tavapadon as adjunctive therapy to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. In study, Tavapadon met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a 1.1 hour increase in total on time without troublesome dyskinesia compared to patients treated with levodopa and placebo. Tavapadon also met the key secondary endpoint in the trial, providing a significant reduction in off time compared to levodopa and placebo. Two additional Phase III studies for Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease are expected to read out later this year. The emracladine pivotal studies in schizophrenia remain on track to begin reading out later this year as well. We look forward to providing updates on these programs once the transaction has closed.

We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.08 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were $12.3 billion, $400 million ahead of our guidance and reflecting a return to growth of 1.6% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.9% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect more than 15% sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.2% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 82.9%, adjusted R&D expense of 14.7%, acquired IP R&D expense of 1.3% and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.6%. Adjusted net interest expense was $429 million. The adjusted tax rate was 14.8%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $11.13 and $11.33. This increase of $0.16 at the midpoint includes $0.26 of operating overperformance partially offset by $0.10 of higher dilution due to the earlier close of ImmunoGen. As previously communicated, this earnings per share guidance includes $0.42 of dilution related to the recently closed acquisition of ImmunoGen and the pending acquisition of Cerevel. Please also note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $55 billion, an increase of $800 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.9% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast includes the following updated assumptions with the entire sales increase driven by our ex-Humira growth platform. We now expect Skyrizi global revenue of $10.7 billion, an increase of $200 million due to strong momentum across all approved indications. Rinvoq total sales of $5.6 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflecting robust uptake in IBD. Imbruvica total revenue of $3.1 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting lower erosion and Elahere total sales to AbbVie of $450 million, an increase of roughly $200 million, reflecting a partial year of revenue following the February close of the ImmunoGen acquisition. Moving to the P&L for 2024. We continue to forecast adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14%, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5%. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of $2.2 billion, which includes the partial year cost in 2024 to finance the ImmunoGen and Caravel transactions. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 32%, reflecting a step-up in volume erosion and with the recent CVS formulary change, partially offset by a onetime price benefit also associated with that change. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We are forecasting adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 49.5% of sales, and we are also modeling a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.05 and $3.09. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.

I mean so thanks for this guidance. But when we look from 2024 to '25, there are a couple of headwinds that you have highlighted in the past. So obviously, IRA Part D redesign will be there and Humira may have another leg down. And given the volume erosion here, people are a little bit concerned there. Can you help us understand that what is your current thinking on the trough, '24 versus '25? And could you give us some confidence that you can continue to grow in '25 despite these headwinds from IRA and Humira?",107.0,45.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.044444444444444446,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0

I mean, clearly, the ex-Humira growth platform is demonstrating great momentum. If you just think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq alone are growing by more than $4 billion per year. Aesthetics will recover to high single-digit growth. Our neuroscience franchise will grow by over $1 billion this year on the heels of strong momentum for Vraylar and our migraine portfolio and we will have incremental contributions from Vyalev and Elahere in '25. So we have several drivers that will offset Humira erosion next year as well as the Part D benefit redesign impact and allow us to still deliver robust revenue growth. When you think about that redesign impact, it will really spread across our business, most concentrated in immunology and oncology. And we would estimate that total revenue impact could be worth several points of growth, while we'll still deliver robust revenue growth, we will have that headwind in '25. But keep in mind, for us, the IRA impact really hits us in '25 and isn't a significant headwind in the years that follow as products that are subject to negotiation will not have that Part D cost share impact. So the way to think about it is despite that headwind in '25, we will still deliver robust growth, with that growth rate accelerating in the years that follow. And then if you think about on a margin perspective, we're going to continue to expand operating margins. So that will be a tailwind. You should be, though modeling annualization of interest expense from these transactions. And keep in mind that we essentially would have -- think of it as a roughly half year for Cereval and 10.5 months this year for ImmunoGen. So that should be something that you do model for '25. So we'll have robust revenue growth we'll have earnings growth, not quite at the rate of the revenue growth because of that annualization impact. But then when you get to ‘26 and beyond, you have even faster revenue growth and very robust earnings growth. So that's probably the best way to think about the profile of the company. But when you look at that ex-Humira growth platform, there's a lot of momentum there and we are very well positioned to deliver very robust growth.",390.0,185.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,1.0,0.0,0.016216216216216217,0.010810810810810811,0.016216216216216217,0.0,0.0,0.005405405405405406

So first, I'll give a little bit of context to the fundamentals in terms of market growth and market share, which were in line with our expectations. So our market share continues to be strong and stable. For Botox Cosmetic, despite a new competitor, strong stable share at high levels. And then for our Juvederm line continued share strength, even some share pickup in in the past few quarters, as we launch our new products. So like you said, those fundamentals are in line with our expectations. As we were going through the quarter, we really realized that the aesthetics market is quite sensitive to seasonality with Q2 and Q4 typically having the highest volume. And after a few years of COVID and economic disruption, we're now anticipating a return to that typical seasonality. So we shifted investment in some of our sales and marketing efforts into Q2, which impacted customer and sales promotional timing and activities, which then resulted in lower inventory held by our customers in Q1.

Can you provide us with any insights in terms of structural aspects within your contracts that you build in that may help provide offsets. We often have limited visibility.

And frankly, as we've highlighted before can run in the immunology category really through the end of the year. So we have a few philosophies that we look towards, which are -- we want to continue to basically make sure that patients if possible, based on our pricing concessions aren't disrupted because when you start to disrupt patients, they do struggle with the change. It's a change in their treatment course. And so as we look to that, we've historically highlighted that we are negotiating for parity contracts with Humira. And we do put some controls in place in some cases, but not all, we seek multi-year contracts with our payers to try to establish the relationship, the pricing, et cetera and we will think of ways to make sure that those contracts can hold. So they have some teeth in them. They can't just be willy-nilly discarded. And so it is a long-term, in some cases, partnership over a couple of years with these payers. I can't go into the details over exactly how those controls work. But suffice it to say that there's terms and timing and limits in terms of when contracts can be changed even maybe some clawbacks in some cases. So because we want these more sustained relationships because of our position in the category with these great brands, we typically use those sort of techniques and that's how we go for it. So again, it's hard to look forward too much because it is dynamic as we look to '25. But we've been quite successful in maintaining good access for our brands and certainly, Humira is tracking in line with our expectations.",302.0,115.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.017391304347826087,0.017391304347826087,0.02608695652173913,0.05217391304347826,0.008695652173913044,0.0

I think Humira you had mentioned that in 2024, you expected most of the impact would be price versus volume. I think the street has been concerned that we're seeing more volume erosion, particularly with the CVS book of business. I'm just interested in your latest thinking as we think about price versus volume for the remainder of this year as we consider CVS [Signa], et cetera. How should we think about that balance just so there's kind of surprises, I guess we watch these volume trends playing out? And then maybe just on a related topic, can you talk at all about the tail for Humira sales in the U.S.? I guess the part of the question, do you expect that you'll see most players or payers eventually switch out Humira like we're seeing at CVS? And if so, is it still reasonable to think about there being a kind of a decent tale of revenue, I guess, for this product in the U.S. over time?",181.0,67.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.04477611940298507,0.014925373134328358,0.0,0.0,-0.04477611940298507

So I think, first, to directly answer your question. We still as we look forward, believe that the significant majority of our lives will be at parity. So that means our guidance around the majority being price is still holding in our go-forward look. Let me give you some perspective. I had some in my opening remarks over what's happening with CVS. So the first is that, as I mentioned, the step down in volume was really anticipated and based on our analysis of the data, which I'll highlight, it's really right in line with our expectations. Now one of the things in my remarks, I often talk about new to brand or our in-play share capture, and that's a really good way to look at performance, particularly early in launch cycles when you're looking at capture rate or competitive dynamics. I think it's important that investors and analysts need to be very mindful when you have a dislocation or disruption or switching, you can get very, very full at looking at NRx or NBRx because it sort of overinflates what you might be looking at. So I think that's important. The other fact base that we look at is in terms of the step down is we look at other analogs and we look at the Cosentyx Taltz analog or Taltz was advantage in ESI for Cosentyx back in 2019. And we see that typically in this category, almost 90% of the erosion tracks within the first two to three weeks. And that's actually what we're starting to see, we believe with the CVS template following that similar pattern. So if you can't really look at NRx or NBRx, you really have to look at TRx in this case, Chris. And this is very interesting. And we would make sure to guide folks to look at what's happening with the TRx data in the market. And what we see is that not all of the Humira prescriptions are moving to a biosimilar. And if you look at the first two weeks, it's pretty meaningful. Over 20% of the Humira prescriptions are moving to other mechanisms of actions, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And in fact, while we haven't studied this week as much, it actually seems to have accelerated a bit from there. And that actually makes some sense because if you think it from the physician's perspective, when patients are being switched, they often take a break in a pause to say, are these patients really under control, should I consider an alternative. And that's actually what we see playing out in the market. So the pure degradation or step-down from Humira is in line with what we see, but we are seeing a fairly significant move to other mechanisms, as I mentioned, including our own Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And that could be very, very good for patients who are probably getting better care for control of their disease. Now having said that as well, if we look through the rest of '24, we have very solid contracts with our payers through 2024. And remember that these payers can add biosimilars at parity whenever they choose. We saw that last year in the middle of the year, and that's really not different now. So when we look at the structure and controls of our existing agreements, we do not see widespread exclusions for the rest of the year, as we go forward. And so I think we've been pretty consistent with that that select clients will move towards biosimilars over the course of the year. Last year, we saw that with Kaiser and Medicaid plans. We talked about the CVS exclusion for the template business. And we do see that some select plans may take another approach, which we've contemplated as the year goes on, which is they may move new patients to the biosimilar, but maintain the large existing base. And that's quite manageable because really only about 14% or 15% of the patients are new patients that cycle into Humira. So overall, that's our perspective. We're confident things are tracking in line. We're quite interested in this shift to other mechanisms, which is frankly somewhat anticipated, but maybe operating a little higher than we thought, and we still believe that a significant majority of Humira will see it at parity lives in '24. Okay. So the tail we're going to be negotiating '25. And what we've highlighted is we are going to watch exactly how the interchangeables play out. We think we've got a good understanding of that. And so it will probably become more apparent as we move through '25 where that tail may sit. And we've highlighted that it may start to emerge in '25 and probably be much more visible by '26. And that's going to ultimately depend on how over the course of '25, the price volume fully plays out in the marketplace.",852.0,350.0,6.0,5.0,20.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,10.0,0.0,0.017142857142857144,0.014285714285714285,0.05714285714285714,0.002857142857142857,0.002857142857142857,0.002857142857142857

I think it's important to note yes, we've said that the vast majority of the erosion is price. We've talked about that dynamic. If you think about first half, second half, we have the annualization impact given the mid-year step-up in rebates last year. So the annualization impact comes through in the first half, you'd expect price erosion to be greater in the first half or the second half. But at the same time, we did contemplate volume erosion because we were very well aware of the CVS contract. We gave you that guidance. And so we have contemplated that volume erosion, but that's more of a second half versus first half as well as the potential for we knew with an interchangeable coming in, there could be some marginal amount of volume pickup there. So we did put in volume erosion in our guidance, but the vast majority of it is price, but I don't want investors to think that we didn't put any volume into our guidance. We were very well aware of the CVS contract. And I think we made some prudent assumptions on potentially other impacts.

Just wondering if you could maybe frame a little bit for us the opportunity for Skyrizi in UC versus Crohn's disease. I think last time we heard from J&J, Crohn's represented about $7 billion of Stelara sales. Obviously, you guys have made decent inroads there based on your comments. But just wondering think about the dollar opportunity in ulcerative colitis. And then when you were talking through some of the latest Rinvoq data, I was just wondering if there's an opportunity down the road as you generate more clinical data, but also commercial data to potentially revisit the restrictions on line of therapy on the label at some point, or if we shouldn't think about that as a possibility.",136.0,58.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.06896551724137931,0.0,0.05172413793103448,0.0,0.017241379310344827,0.06896551724137931

I mean, if you look at the overall market or revenue, I think it's 65%, 70%. So it's -- Crohn's is very, very significant. Having said that, ulcerative colitis is a multibillion-dollar opportunity for us. It's still a very, very underpenetrated and substantial indication. So it's weighted about 65 -- 35 --70-30, but still, I wouldn't underestimate what ulcerative colitis means. And I think I would add in concert with my prepared remarks, we've seen very, very significant acceleration into frontline Crohn's disease with Skyrizi. And what's remarkable, we studied a very, very difficult population in ulcerative colitis, but we still had substantial amount of naive patients. And the performance in that naive population is exceptional. I mean, it is at the very, very top of the league table terms of overall ability to get to endoscopic clearance and symptom control. And so we like that setup because, obviously, we have exactly the same representatives who are establishing the Crohn's indication in frontline, and we know that we can bring UC very fast afterwards when we get the approval this year. So it's a substantial global opportunity, not the size that we'll see over the LRP with Crohn's, but still one of our largest opportunities that we have in the category.

So the data we keep generating continues to at least drive confidence for sure that the original Phase III that came out with their safety profile, and what we continue to learn even with longer-term data, even in more high-risk patients confirms what we've always seen. And that will continue to drive confidence, I think with our clinicians. Now from a health authority standpoint, I think the position there is that you have this oral surveillance study with upadacitinib, and they're going to apply those findings to the other assets in a similar class probably until there's another outcome study to sort of argue against that -- that's kind of how we see it, now that's in the U.S. I would say globally, there's still an opportunity for many jurisdictions where JAK inhibitors can be at parity. So you might start seeing some more movement there in earlier lines. But as Jeff stated in his prepared remarks, the second line and even third line of many of these indications continues to grow as people now have options where in the past, if all you had was a TNF, maybe you were cycling. But now that you know that there's other therapies you're starting to see people break sooner.

I mean, if you look at the first two weeks to give you some sense, and this is inclusive of the Cordavis Humira. There was a downdraft of about 13,000 prescriptions for Humira from baseline. And the biosimilars captured about -- which was primarily the Cordavis Humira, captured about 10. So there's 3,000 prescriptions or over 20% that we can see in our data moving to other mechanisms of action, including our Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And again, it's very logical because this is just not a one-to-one type of switch like these physicians are interviewing and discussing with patients, their care path forward. And so we think that clearly, some are moving to other mechanisms, and we've seen that in other analogs as well. So we believe the data is accurate. Again, it's early.

I wonder how you see the competitive dynamics evolving in that space? Is this about switches? Or is this about market expectation expansion.

I would say that we're not anticipating like a wholesale restructure of the PBM industry, for example. I mean, we certainly think that there's very reasonable chance of sort of transparency reform, exactly how some of the economics are working, maybe transparencies to the government or downstream to the clients, that's very possible. But a major wholesale change, we don't see that happening in the near-term. Obviously, we are continuing to monitor that and would make adjustments as we might need to. Regarding your atopic dermatitis question, I think the answer is really a bit of both. I think as we've highlighted before, the market here is exceptional in terms of the low bio penetration or oral and bio penetration. It's really only about 4% or 5%. And so I think Sanofi's comments are very well timed. I mean this marketplace is going to grow significantly as this innovation is able to be delivered to the global population with this very serious disease. But we also think this Level Up study is good for our market share penetration, and I'll give you some perspective. Our U.S. market share is lower. It's around 9%. So typically, where our countries have been able to highlight more direct comparisons. We couldn't do that because of the starting dose, I highlighted. We see that most of our international affiliates have market shares in the mid-teens in some cases in the low 20s. And so the ability to bring a comparative study that's directly linked to the U.S. label and show the physicians how you can get to higher levels of control and really patients want -- they want no disease on their skin and they really don't want itch if they can get there.

We're very pleased with the competitive -- our ability to gain market share in these segments. I'll start off with migraine. We continue to be the new to brand share leader in Botox for chronic migraine, and we see that Qulipta is accelerating significantly. So Qulipta is now the leading preventative agent. And what's nice is there's very little interaction with Botox because if you're an injector, you use Botox, if you're not an injector, you have access to a fantastic drug with Qulipta. So Qulipta is really clearly taking over the market leadership position among the injectable and the oral CGRPs. Ubrelvy continues to have a very meaningful and substantial lead over the main competitor, Nurtec and we are seeing some increased penetration into the larger triptan segment, which is key to our long-term growth.

And so both of those are allowing us to continue to gain share. So we're in a pretty good position.

It’s a pleasure to speak with you today as AbbVie’s new CEO. I look forward to building on our track record of success and delivering on AbbVie’s promise to our patients, employees, shareholders and communities. As we begin this new chapter, nearly every aspect of AbbVie’s business is performing at or above our expectations. We are demonstrating a rapid return to revenue growth, with operational sales up nearly 4% through the first half of this year, including robust mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter. Our ex-Humira growth platform, which covers more than 80% of AbbVie’s total sales, will outperform our initial full year sales guidance by more than $1 billion, driven by strong performance in immunology and oncology. In addition, U.S. Humira performance continues to meet our expectations, having achieved or exceeded our guidance in all six quarters with biosimilar competition. The strong performance across our diversified portfolio will drive top-tier high single-digit compound growth through the end of this decade, which will support continued investment to drive growth in the next decade. Turning to our results, I’m especially pleased with immunology, where our leading portfolio is delivering performance well above our expectations. Skyrizi continues to demonstrate strong momentum in psoriasis and Crohn’s disease, where we have substantial headroom for additional share gains and the recent approval in UC will add another source of long-term growth. Rinvoq is also delivering robust growth across all approved indications. We are making excellent progress with late-stage development in five additional indications that we anticipate will launch in the second half of this decade. In oncology, Elahere has accelerated our on-market presence in solid tumors. We also have several exciting pipeline programs, including two novel c-Met ADCs for solid tumors, Teliso-V and 400, as well as 383, our BCMA CD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma. In neuroscience, our leading therapies for migraine and mood disorders continue to gain share and are competitively well-positioned. The pending acquisition of Cerevel will further augment our neuroscience pipeline and we’re excited about what our two companies can achieve together to make a difference for patients with neuropsych disorders. We have certified substantial compliance to the FTC second request and anticipate the Cerevel transaction will close soon. Lastly, we’ve been very active with business development, investing in exciting opportunities that can drive growth in the next decade. Through the first half of this year, we have executed nearly a dozen early-stage deals. These include promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard-of-care in immunology, oncology and neuroscience. In summary, I’m very pleased with the strong momentum of our business. AbbVie’s results once again exceed our expectations and we are raising guidance for the second time this year, underscoring our confidence in the business. The robust performance of our growth platform and the advancement of our pipeline supports AbbVie’s top-tier long-term outlook.

These assets are approved across a broad set of indications and are collectively supported by nine compelling head-to-head studies that demonstrate clear differentiation across multiple novel therapies, which has resulted in strong share capture. For Skyrizi, we continue to advance our clear leadership position in psoriasis, where total prescription share of the U.S. biologic market has increased to approximately 38%. Share is also ramping nicely in PSA, especially in the dermatology segment, where Skyrizi has achieved roughly 15% total prescription share in the U.S. biologic market. And for Rinvoq, we are seeing increasing share across each of the rheum indications, as well as additional momentum in atopic dermatitis, including total prescription share of 10% in the U.S. We are very excited about the growth potential in gastroenterology, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq are on pace to double their respective sales in IBD this year. The adoption in Crohn’s disease has been impressive, with Skyrizi and Rinvoq now achieving a combined in-place share in the U.S. of more than 40%. Skyrizi has achieved overall in-place share leadership in Crohn’s, with in-place share approximately now 13 points ahead of Stelara, following our compelling head-to-head sequence data published last year. This positive trial, which demonstrated Skyrizi’s high efficacy versus Stelara, including a more than doubling of effect in endoscopic remission has driven a significant inflection in performance and we anticipate continued share momentum. Commercialization for Skyrizi and ulcerative colitis is now underway in the U.S., with broad formulary access anticipated to ramp quickly over the next several months. Early feedback from gastroenterologists has been very encouraging, with Skyrizi’s UC data viewed as impressive, particularly for naïve patients who have not been exposed to biologics. We also expect the European launch in the coming months. We also see very robust adoption of Rinvoq in UC, where the brand is now achieving a leading in-place share in the U.S. Internationally, Rinvoq UC is now approved in 75 countries, with reimbursement and share gaining momentum. Having two novel therapies that each deliver differentiated levels of efficacy to treat both of these IBD conditions demonstrates our commitment to transforming the treatment landscape for physicians and patients in this area of high unmet need. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $2.8 billion, down 28.9% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. was in line with our expectations in the quarter and our guidance complicates -- contemplates the impact of additional formulary changes over the course of the year. Importantly, we continue to anticipate that Humira will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were more than $1.6 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $833 million, down 8.2, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $637 million, up 15.8 on an operational basis, with strong momentum across CLL and AML. Elahere is also performing very well, with sales of $128 million and our compelling overall survival data, recent positive updates in the NCCN guidelines and the expansion of commercial resources will continue to drive rapid uptake. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with the prescription trends for Epkinly in DLBCL. Commercialization is now underway for Epkinly’s second indication, follicular lymphoma, in the U.S., with European approval expected later this year. Neuroscience total revenues were nearly $2.2 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of Vraylar, with global sales of $774 million, Ubrelvy with total revenue of $231 million and Qulipta with global sales of $150 million. Each of these leading assets continue to gain share and remain competitively well-positioned. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well, especially in chronic migraine. Total global sales were $814 million, up 9.6% on an operational basis. Finally, we are pleased with the early launch trends for 951 in Japan and Europe, and look forward to bringing this innovative therapy for advanced Parkinson’s to the U.S. soon. Overall, I’m extremely pleased with the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics.

Second quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.4 billion, representing growth of 2.8% on an operational basis. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $863 million increased by 4.4%, driven by Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm growth of 7.1% and 10.4%, respectively. This toxin and filler performance is supported by a consistent recovery in the facial injectable market, as the number of procedures in both categories increased by a mid-single-digit percentage versus the prior year. However, this level of market growth was lower than previously anticipated. Sales for Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm also benefited from a partial reversal of the prior quarter’s inventory destock, which was related to the timing of certain promotional activities. From a competitive perspective, our U.S. facial injectable portfolio remains the clear market leader, with strong and stable market share. Internationally, second quarter aesthetic sales were $527 million, roughly flat versus the prior year on an operational basis, as declines in China were balanced by growth in other international markets. In China, our largest international market, sales growth continued to be impacted by sustained economic headwinds, as well as a challenging comparison to the second quarter of last year, which benefited from a strong post-COVID recovery. Consistent with what we experienced in the U.S., economic challenges have impacted Juvederm sales growth more than other areas of our portfolio, based upon Juvederm’s relatively higher price point. Looking to the rest of the year, we expect our market-leading aesthetics portfolio to continue to perform well from a competitive perspective across the globe. As we evaluate market dynamics and leading economic indicators, particularly in the U.S. and China, market growth trends are below our prior expectations. Based upon this, we have moderated our outlook for the remainder of the year. Despite this near-term dynamic, we remain confident in the long-term growth outlook of our aesthetics portfolio. Global market penetration rates are extremely low and we expect long-term market growth to accelerate from current levels as economic conditions improve. As the market leader, we are also committed to driving growth by activating new patients and launching innovative treatment options. For example, in China, launch activities are underway for the Botox Cosmetic masseter muscle prominence indication. And in the U.S., we will soon launch Juvederm VOLUMA XC for the treatment of temple hollowing and we expect an approval for Botox Cosmetic in the platysma prominence indication by the end of the year. Pipeline catalysts like these in the key U.S. and China markets, along with our significant investment in consumer activation, injector training and practice support, will enable us to grow the aesthetics market and maintain our clear leadership position over the long-term. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Roopal.",462.0,259.0,13.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,0.05019305019305019,0.011583011583011582,0.011583011583011582,0.0,0.003861003861003861,0.03861003861003861

We continue to make very good progress advancing our pipeline with several regulatory and clinical milestones since our last earnings call. I will start with immunology. We received FDA approval for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which marks its second inflammatory bowel disease indication. Skyrizi is now the only IL-23 specific inhibitor approved for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Skyrizi has proven to be a highly effective, durable, safe and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease. And this recent approval further strengthens AbbVie’s leadership position in this market. We also received a positive CHMP opinion recommending Skyrizi for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in Europe, with an approval decision anticipated soon. Earlier this month, we submitted our regulatory applications in the U.S. and Europe for Rinvoq and giant cell arteritis. Our submissions are based on the previously announced Phase 3 results from our SELECT-GCA trial, where Rinvoq demonstrated superiority compared to placebo on sustained remission from week 12 through week 52 on disease flare and showed a reduction in total steroid exposure at week 52. We expect approval decisions for this indication next year. We also recently began a Phase 3 study for lutikizumab, our anti-IL-1-alpha-beta-bispecific in hidradenitis suppurativa. HS is a skin disease that can be debilitating and there are limited treatment options. In our Phase 2 study, lutikizumab demonstrated strong clinical response rates and improvement in skin pain in a very refractory patient population. Based on these results, we believe lutikizumab has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe HS. We look forward to providing updates on the Phase 3 program as the data become available. In the second quarter, we announced two additional immunology transactions as we continue to invest in external innovation to expand our pipeline. These include the acquisition of Celsius Therapeutics, which brings a Phase 2 ready anti-TREM1 antibody for IBD and a license agreement with FutureGen to develop a next-generation anti-TL1A antibody for IBD that is designed to have less frequent dosing compared to other TL1As in development and will be evaluated in combination with Skyrizi. This follows the four immunology deals we announced earlier this year, which, as a reminder, included the acquisition of Landos and their oral NLRX1 agonist in Phase 2 for UC, a partnership with OSE to develop a novel ChemR23 agonist for IBD and RA, a collaboration with Parvus to utilize their immune tolerization platform for novel IBD therapies and a collaboration with Tentarix to develop conditionally active multi-specific biologics in immunology and oncology. Moving to oncology, where we continue to make very good progress across all stages of our heme and solid tumor pipeline. In the area of solid tumors, we recently announced positive topline results from our Phase 2 PICCOLO study evaluating Elahere as a monotherapy in ER alpha positive third-line plus platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer for those not eligible for retreatment with platinum-based therapies. Elahere met the primary and key secondary endpoints in the study, demonstrating an objective response rate of 52% and median duration of response of 8.25 month. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Following discussions with the FDA, we will be submitting to Teliso-V for accelerated approval as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild-type non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer. This submission will be reviewed under FDA’s real-time oncology review program. Teliso-V has also received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. Our submission will be based on the results of our Phase 2 LUMINOSITY study, where Teliso-V demonstrated strong clinical benefits across key endpoints, including overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival, with a tolerable safety profile. Submission is expected in the third quarter, with an approval decision anticipated in 2025. The confirmatory Phase 3 study for this potential accelerated approval is currently ongoing. We continue to see encouraging data for ABBV-400, our next generation c-Met ADC, which uses a topo payload. Recall that we’ve advanced 400 in late-line colorectal cancer based on the deep responses and prolonged durability observed as a monotherapy in our Phase 1 trial. And we remain on track to begin a Phase 3 study later this year in third-line CRC. We’re also seeing encouraging signals of activity for this next-gen ADC in the non-small-cell lung cancer cohort from our Phase 1 study. The preliminary data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. And based on the emerging Phase 1 results, we plan to begin a Phase 2 program for 400 in lung cancer. In the area of hematologic oncology, we received accelerated approval in the U.S. for Epkinly as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of prior therapy. Epkinly is now the only T-cell engaging bispecific approved in the U.S. to treat both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We’re extremely excited to bring this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients suffering from follicular lymphoma. We also recently received positive CHMP opinion with an approval decision in Europe expected later this year. In the quarter, we initiated a Phase 3 monotherapy study for ABBV-383 in third-line multiple myeloma. 383 is designed for high affinity binding to BCMA on malignant cells and low affinity binding to a unique CD3 epitope on T-cells, which has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse events associated with other T-cell engaging BCMA-based therapies while preserving high levels of efficacy. We remain excited about this asset’s potential to become a best-in-class BCMA CD3 bispecific by providing deep, durable responses and low incidence and severity of CRS, with the potential for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment. In addition to our Phase 3 monotherapy program, we have an ongoing Phase 1 study in later lines of multiple myeloma to evaluate 383 in various combinations, including with Pomalyst, Revlimid and Darzalex. Based on this work, we will begin Phase 2 combination studies in earlier lines of therapy next year. Moving to neuroscience, where in the quarter we announced that we received a complete response letter for our 951 regulatory application in the U.S. The CRL is based on observations identified during an inspection at a third-party manufacturing site that was unrelated to 951. The CRL did not identify any issues related to the safety, efficacy or labeling of 951, nor has the FDA requested any additional clinical data or device-related testing. We’re working closely with the site and the FDA to get clarity on timelines and we’ll provide updates as soon as information becomes available. Moving to an update on one of our Alzheimer’s disease programs. We recently completed an interim analysis of a Phase 2 study evaluating ABBV-916, our A-beta antibody. The emerging efficacy and safety profile in this study is similar to what has been demonstrated by approved agents. However, given the evolving landscape, we do not believe 916 as a monotherapy treatment will be sufficiently differentiated from other emerging therapies. As a result, we are discontinuing further development for 916 as a standalone antibody. As Rob mentioned, we remain on track to close the Cerevel transaction soon and we look forward to welcoming the team into our R&D organization. The emraclidine pivotal studies in schizophrenia remain on track to begin reading out near the end of this year. We’ll also see data from two additional Phase 3 studies for davapidon in Parkinson’s disease later this year. We look forward to providing updates on these programs once the transaction has closed and data are available. In aesthetics, we recently received approval for Botox in China for masseter muscle prominence, marking the first global approval in this indication for any neurotoxin. Masseter prominence is common in Asian populations and there is significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. We anticipate high demand for Botox in this novel indication in China, which will help to further build our portfolio in the face-shaping segment. A regulatory application is under review in the U.S. for Botox and platysma prominence, which is another novel indication that will help build our position in the lower face and neck segment. We continue to expect an FDA approval decision later this year. And we remain on track to submit a regulatory application for BoNT/E near the end of this year. A rapid-onset, short-acting toxin has a highly differentiated clinical profile and once approved would offer patients a novel option compared to currently available toxins. So, in summary, we’ve made great progress across all of our therapeutic areas in the first half of the year and we look forward to additional data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2024. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Scott.",1499.0,789.0,24.0,11.0,8.0,6.0,0.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,0.030418250950570342,0.01394169835234474,0.010139416983523447,0.0076045627376425855,0.0,0.016476552598225603

Starting with our second-quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.65, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.52 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $14.5 billion, $450 million ahead of our guidance and reflecting robust growth of 5.6% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect more than 18% sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform. Adjusted gross margin was 85.2% of sales. Adjusted R&D expense was 13.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.9% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.6% of sales, which includes a 6.5% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $506 million. The adjusted tax rate was 18.8%. Turning to our financial outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 to between $10.71 and $10.91. This EPS guidance continues to contemplate approximately $0.19 of dilution for the pending acquisition of Cerevel, which is expected to close soon. Please also note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $55.5 billion, an increase of $500 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast includes the following updated assumptions with the entire sales increase, once again, driven by our ex-Humira growth platform, which is now on pace to deliver nearly $6 billion of sales growth in 2024. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $11 billion, an increase of $300 million due to strong performance across all approved indications. Rinvoq, total revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting continued robust uptake in IBD. Venclexta total sales of approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting momentum in both U.S. and international markets. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.5 billion. Given slower-than-expected near-term market growth, particularly in the U.S. and China, as a result, our total sales guidance for Botox and Juvederm will each be lower by roughly $100 million. Moving to the P&L for 2024, we continue to forecast a full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14% and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5%. We now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales, in line with our previous expectations after including the approximately 2% impact of acquired IPR&D expense incurred through the second quarter. And we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 16.3%, also reflecting the impact of IPR&D. Turning to the third quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.2 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.92 and $2.96. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.

Looking forward to the forward here. The question I had is, last quarter you guys gave some early commentary on how to think about 2025, looking at the business, obviously, momentum in immunology, some headwinds in aesthetics.

So, with respect to 2025, as you know, we haven’t given guidance yet and we’ll provide that at a later time. But we have communicated a few top-level, high-level items to put in context of several dynamics at play next year. We have indicated that we’ll be returning to robust revenue growth, despite the headwinds from Medicare Part D redesign and continued Humira erosion. And when you think about robust growth, we characterize robust growth to be above industry average growth, which we see in the low-single digits. So when you think about the drivers, I mentioned in my remarks that we have $6 billion of growth from the growth platform in 2024 that we’re expecting. $5 billion of that is coming from Skyrizi and Rinvoq alone, our neuros franchise is growing by more than $1 billion and aesthetics has begun to recover from the economic headwinds. In 2025, we see incremental contributions from Skyrizi UC, which was recently approved, as well as 951. All these factors demonstrate strong momentum in the business. And then when you think about the offset of Humira, that erosion that we have expected this year at $4.5 billion. Last year that erosion was $6.5 billion and we do expect another step down in absolute dollar terms in 2025 for that erosion as well. So that will be less of a headwind to growth in 2025 than it was in 2024. So we feel very, very strong about that. And I think from a Part D perspective, we’ve talked about the several points of growth headwinds that we see there. And I think when you model that, you can think about those several points as approximately a 3% headwind to growth. So, overall, very strong momentum from the business with some headwinds, but we feel very confident in our ability to return to robust growth at the topline. Regarding EPS, the bottomline, we see EPS growing in line with that revenue growth that we’ve talked about. So, EPS will benefit from operating margin expansion. We’ve talked about that operating margin expansion will be on the SG&A line as we leverage the revenue growth and drive efficiencies and we have a good history of doing that. So, that operating margin will expand. However, that expansion will be roughly offset by the fact that in 2025, we’ll have a full year of interest expense associated with the financing for Cerevel and ImmunoGen. So robust growth at the topline and in-line growth from an EPS perspective.",427.0,187.0,7.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0374331550802139,0.026737967914438502,0.0106951871657754,0.0,0.0,0.0106951871657754

Maybe first on Rinvoq and Skyrizi, great results in the quarter. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the price versus volume dynamics this quarter? It seemed like results were maybe a little bit stronger than the RX trends would have implied, and I just was wondering if there was anything notable there. My second question was on the immunology portfolio, and as we think about 2025, I know we’re probably in the middle of contracting season right now, but just directionally, what are you anticipating for Humira, and should we be thinking about any incremental pressures on Rinvoq and Skyrizi just given biosimilar Humira dynamics going forward?

So, as noted, we’re very, very pleased with the fundamental momentum on Rinvoq and Skyrizi. So all of the indications are really hitting their stride. So we can see the impact of, obviously, consumer investments we’ve made. We’ve adjusted some of the sales forces. We’ve started to anticipate the ulcerative colitis that’s helped us basically increase our share of voice. And I think the other dynamic in terms of some of the incremental strength has come from this dynamic that we started to see earlier in the quarter where some of the Humira switching that takes place actually starts to accrue towards Skyrizi and Rinvoq because the physicians, when there’s this disruption in the market, will sometimes bring in those patients and start to assess them, and we saw about 20% would move to other mechanisms. So while it’s a component, there are certainly multifactorial approaches why we see this very, very strong volume dynamic and share capture for both of those agents. If I move to the contracting for 2025, obviously, the contract season is in progress and it’s progressing, and the negotiations are well underway. I think it’s important, if you’ll recall, that we already have some multiyear contracts in place that cover 2025, so that’s a positive dynamic. The remaining payer negotiations, as I mentioned, are underway and we anticipate that those will close out during the normal cycle. I would say that, at a macro level, we do expect to maintain parity access next year for Humira for a meaningful portion of lives across all of the channels. Now, that said, our Humira access will certainly be lower than this year as we continue to anticipate and watch certain segments of the market move to adopt biosimilars. And we’ve understood and planned for this, obviously, as we enter that third year of the biosimilars and so we’re well aware of dynamically evaluating how this is going to work out. So, certainly, things are progressing. We already have some in place from those multiyear contracts and we’ll be in a better position to provide some more information, obviously, later in the year as those negotiations or the remaining negotiations fully close out.",387.0,166.0,8.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.04819277108433735,0.018072289156626505,0.024096385542168676,0.024096385542168676,0.0,0.030120481927710843

Just to reiterate an important point that Jeff made, I mean, one trend that we are watching very closely is the switching from the Humira molecule to new mechanisms. I mean, we are starting to see an inflection that is accruing to new mechanisms like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as Jeff mentioned. And it makes sense, doctors that are reevaluating the patients in their practice are likely looking at more than just the patients that are covered by CVS. What we have factored in is the CVS impact. What we didn’t factor in necessarily is an impact beyond just the CVS-wise. And to the extent that trend continues, it would represent a downside for Humira and an upside for Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which is a very good long-term tradeoff for us. That’s an important point.

I’ll take the question regarding EPS growth or earnings growth in line with the revenue growth. So when we look at this, as I mentioned, we’re looking at a couple of things. The SG&A that we’re driving some operating margin expansion, we spent a lot of time focusing on that and we do see some efficiencies that we can drive, and we do have the ability to leverage that. So there will be expansion operating margin, which you would expect to then let earnings outpace the revenue growth. However, there is this offset and we had a very successful bond offering when we set the financing in place for Cerevel and ImmunoGen. So, but that will be an offset to the operating margin expansion.

So, the $11 floor, again, was on an ex-IPR&D basis, where obviously with this guidance, ex-IPR&D, I think, we’re just a little bit over $11.40 and we’re certainly positioned to return to robust growth. I mean, we’re delivering robust revenue growth this quarter. When you look at the outlook for 2025, it’s very strong and so we should be beyond the conversations on the floor at this point. As we think about the tradeoffs for the long-term and the short-term, clearly we have an on-market portfolio today that can drive the growth that we need to deliver on that high single-digit, top-tier outlook in this decade. So our BD efforts continue to be focused on early-stage assets that can drive growth in the next decade, and you’ve seen us execute nearly a dozen deals this year along those lines. These include new mechanisms in immunology that can combine with Skyrizi or Rinvoq or be pursued as model therapies. We’ve also added new platforms, including multi-specifics, that have applicability in immunology and oncology. Our deal targeting in situ CAR-T therapy is another example of a platform investment in oncology. And we added a novel mechanism for psychiatric disorders, given our focus in neuroscience. So we intend to continue adding more depth to our pipeline in our core areas, particularly think about early-stage deals, because what we’re really trying to set up for is that growth in the next decade.

So, first let’s talk about the market dynamics for market growth in the U.S. for facial injectables. So, late last year, we started to see a recovery and a return to growth of the toxin market and we’ve seen that market growth recovery continue this year in that mid-single-digit range. And that’s volume, that is traffic into our customers’ offices and that’s really been consistent for the past few quarters. So, the market dynamics for our business are really driven by patient demand and volume. Although, when we think about price, price is a factor that we’ll be looking for the second half of the year, which will give us some favorable pricing dynamics. We did take a price action at the beginning of the year for toxins and then we’ll have some more efficiency when it comes to our strategic shifts in our pricing promotions for the second half of the year. So, one example of that would be promotions we did last year, for example, around competitive launches that we won’t need to do this year based on the success of our competitive strategy last year. So really our performance is driven by market growth and we also had some nice stability in our market share.

And when Carrie made her remarks and we spoke about it last quarter, we said that would reverse over time. We did see that reversing in the second quarter on a partial basis. And when you think about the reversal of that Q1 destock, you can think about from the U.S. market that really would reduce by 50% or cut in half the growth rates we published for the actual results for both Botox and Juvederm. So we saw that partial reversal of that destocking event and then we will see that continue to unwind throughout the course of the year, especially as we have some of our larger promotional activities and the back half of the year with Botox Day and Juvederm Day, we do see typically an inventory, a stocking uplift from those activities.",171.0,71.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.0,0.0,-0.014084507042253521

With respect to orals, we did do this deal with Landos and this is our NX-13asset, which we’ll anticipate a readout end of this year, beginning of next year. Early data point to good outcomes in ulcerative colitis and this asset works through NF-kappa-beta, so you’ll see what we’ve observed in preclinical models is reductions in IL-6, IL-1, TNF, interferon gamma. And it’s potentially a monotherapy and one that wouldn’t have a boxed warning. So far, the safety data has looked good. But there’s also opportunities, we believe, as you mentioned, combinations, that you could still combine with Rinvoq. And as I mentioned the boxed warning and in certain geographies, Rinvoq is utilized post-anti-TNF. Even with a combo there, there’s still opportunity. The second and third line segments in IBD and across immunology continue to grow, and they’re getting larger and larger as patients cycle through biosimilar anti-TNFs. We’ll see them cycle through, for example, in IBD with IL-1223, like Stelara. So in the future, there’s multiple opportunities. And the way we think about these is do we see an asset that is novel and can address mechanisms that haven’t been addressed yet, and can they complement something like Rinvoq? So if you see a little bit less efficacy, that may be okay if it’s complementary. It may not work necessarily as a monotherapy, but we still see opportunities for a combo. And given the other assets that we’ve talked about that could be IV or sub-cue, we still see a lot of opportunity with Skyrizi. In a platform study in IBD we’ll kick off later this year, looking at various combinations, many of the assets that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, including a TL1A, including our own internal alpha-4 beta-7, could be added on to Skyrizi to drive that efficacy even higher because there’s still a bit of a ceiling effect.

So, Jeff and Rob, just hearing your commentary about how when patients discontinue Humira, a number of them are switching to newer biologics. I think you gave the 20% number going to newer biologics like Skyrizi and then also Rinvoq. But we saw some of this happening in the gastro space with one of the checks we did recently, but I wonder if you could provide maybe a little more color on this phenomenon.

So, the 20% I highlighted, so if you just look from our data, when we just look at the CVS template, so we can see the degradation of Humira that goes down pretty steeply because, remember, it’s an exclusion. So, Humira is no longer widely available at all. So, most of it happens within the first two weeks or three weeks. And in that one segment, we see that the biosimilar doesn’t take up all the Humira loss and we can see it moving to other mechanisms, particularly Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So that’s within, let’s say, the acute biosimilar event. Now, to Rob’s point, what he highlighted is, if you take a step back and you look at the macro market, we’ve started to see in the first quarter and second quarter that the overall molecule, so that’s the adalimumab molecule, inclusive of biosimilars, has started to compress faster than it did before there was the availability of this action that was taken by CVS. So, it’s a doubling of effect, acutely in the segment that takes place with the exclusion and then the wider market. Now, we’re watching this pretty carefully because we haven’t -- obviously haven’t seen something like this before in terms of the compression of a molecule. So, that’s basically the dynamics that we’re seeing. And we do think it’s because some physicians or segments of physicians are, they realize that these biosimilars where there’s an acute interruption, they want to check how the patients are doing. And if they’re not fully in remission when they come in for their appointment, let’s say before the switch, sometimes they’re transitioned at the rates that I described. So that’s sort of the prescriber behavior. Now, where is it coming from? Like, well, we actually see that it is accruing across all of the indications, particularly Humira has quite robust, let’s say, base dynamics in the rheumatology indications. But we can see it in rheum. We can see it in derm. Derm to Skyrizi in particular, which is probably not a surprise given the position. I highlighted a 38% share and a 60% in-place share for Skyrizi and derm. And we also do see it to some degree in gastroenterology. So, to Rob’s point, we’re going to continue to monitor that. If the overall molecule would continue to compress, obviously, there would be some mitigation of some of it accruing over to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and so we’ll have to continue to see how these weeks and months play out here over the third quarter.",458.0,179.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0223463687150838,0.01675977653631285,0.0,0.0,-0.0223463687150838

Roopal highlighted it. Obviously, you have the two big indications with two assets within those indications. And so we have constructed, not just in the U.S., but around the world, a very sophisticated approach in terms of multiple sleeves of representatives and medical experts that are representing both drugs across both indications. And it really is, let’s say, for example, in our largest market, the U.S., it’s relatively easy to execute, because what we see is that our representatives can highlight Skyrizi’s data and potential as the obvious frontline agent, which is obviously tremendous data. I mentioned the sequence data. I mentioned our core data. The naive to biologic data in UC is absolutely fantastic for the Skyrizi data. And then, really ironically, because of the label changes that took place a few years ago, Rinvoq is positioned in later lines. So, really, that sort of approach is highly synergistic in terms of we recommend that physicians consider starting with Skyrizi and the efficacy will be fantastic. But to Roopal’s point, there’s still pressure on that disease and then you have a backstop with tremendous, tremendous data on Rinvoq in later lines. And so that’s how we position it. We look and we monitor the cannibalization. It’s quite modest, and overall, when you look at the dynamic of share capture, it’s quite encouraging to see how the infield teams and the commercial teams are managing all of those assets.

So, the first way to think about it, in the first year 2023, we had very strong parity access across all the channels and we really exited the year around, I think, 97% or something like that. This year, I think, when we look at all the ins and outs, I think, the three-quarter approach is quite reasonable, and as I mentioned in my remarks to early one of the questions, it will certainly be lower next year and I would think that that range would be around that 0.5 point, but again, we’re not fully complete with all the dynamics.

On the aesthetic, thanks for your comments this year and you’ve also moderated your short-term guide accordingly, but you’ve noted that the long-term 2029 guide remains intact. So, with growth around 4% this year in line with that new guide, I imagine next year will be slightly higher, but then it does imply that growth is well into the double digits for 2027, 2028 and 2029 on our calculations. Just what here makes you confident about that level of growth later in the decade? And then secondly, just following up on some of your thoughts on the immunology pipeline, you noted the potential of the utility of multispecifics in immunology. You’ve got a pretty strong bispecific platform. Just what are your thoughts on the data that you’re seeing here? Is there anything in development that we should be looking at?

So you’re right. We’ve guided to a long-term $9 billion in 2029 and we’re not changing that guidance. The guidance changed, as you noted, that I mentioned today is just a short-term guidance change for 2024. We remain very confident in our ability to hit that $9 billion in 2029. When you think about these markets, there’s very low penetration in the markets globally. There’s a lot of excitement in the space and we expect the market to recover and grow at historical rates. I would say when we look at the market growth, we do see that rebounding and growing well. And then you also should think about there’s additional innovation coming that will drive that. So, we have some of the additional indications in Botox that Roopal walked through, as well as the quick onset short-acting toxin BoNT/E that will also drive additional market growth. And so we continue to feel very comfortable with our ability to achieve that on a long-term basis in 2029.",189.0,84.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.05952380952380952,0.011904761904761904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616

So, we continue to be excited about bispecifics, in particular lutikizumab. And it’s an IL-1 alpha, and importantly, also 1-beta. And this, we believe, distinguishes it from earlier generation assets that were singular, and let’s say, only took out IL-1 alpha. We see, I would say, very, very strong benefits in hidradenitis suppurativa and I don’t think that was observed as a pure monoclonal. And the efficacy that we’re seeing is in a 100% anti-TNF failure population and very sick, early Stage 3, 70%. It is one of the most severe, probably the most severe ever studied. So we think there continues to be potential in the bispecific space as you take out multiple cytokines. The way to address it is through engineering of the assets. The other way is combination, so we can get to that bispecific approach through combos. And then, thirdly, I would say earlier in the pipeline is the multispecific approach, which the advantage that could provide is you maintain your bispecific approach, but then a third arm, let’s say, can target specific cells and that could further enhance efficacy, and in particular, safety. And we’re looking at that approach in immunology and as well in oncology, and that was reflected in our partnership with Tentarix.",227.0,96.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,0.0

We’re very pleased with how both of the indications are performing and we monitor them very carefully, certainly with bipolar and aMDD. So when we look at our quarterly surveys of our target physicians and really our whole call cycle, we can see now that Vraylar is the most preferred agent overall for bipolar disease based on its indication set, its tolerability, its efficacy, et cetera. And we’ve really gone to the very top of the lead table for aMDD as well. So, if we look overall on our demand, we’re tracking above 20% in terms of the push. We continue to focus our team and where necessary add share a voice in terms of our sales force.

There is going to be competition, but what we see as a benefit clinically for Vraylar is that full spectrum coverage in bipolar and when you’re able to take mania, you don’t need an adjunctive therapy for that. So that’s a big advantage. The other thing that we continue to hear and probably reflected in our data is the really limited impact on fatigue and sedation. And so what we’re hearing is with Vraylar, patients really don’t have to sacrifice their daytime productivity in order to gain that benefit. And then the other benefit, I would say, with Vraylar is flexible, adjustable dosing.

The other dynamic in terms of Cordavis, I’m not sure that that’s actually changing the dynamics in terms of the negotiations overall.

When you think about the growth profile, the profitability, we have set it up as a fully integrated standalone unit, because it behaves differently than the therapeutics business. We think we’ve actually seen, since we announced the transaction, really strong performance. We’ve exceeded our deal model expectations since we announced the deal. So we think it’s operating very well. Obviously, we’re working through some macroeconomic headwinds. But when you look at, for example, share performance, we had the entry of DAXXIFY last year and we did not lose any share. I think a lot of investors were concerned that we’d see considerable share loss. And so I think the team has done a remarkable job of competing in this marketplace, going through a period with economic headwinds. We’re still very confident given low penetration rates, given our relationship in the field, the potential innovations that we plan to bring forward. It has a very nice fit. And you think about just from a profitability and a growth standpoint, it fits the profile we’re looking for. So I certainly feel it’s a nice fit for the company. As it relates to the election, look, it’s hard to handicap it, whether Democrat or Republican. If you think about we’ve obviously contemplated the Inflation Reduction Act. We’ve come out and said that even with modeling that impact in, that we still expect to deliver on our long-term outlook. Now, I will say our view on the IRA from a policy perspective is we’re certainly in favor of the Part D benefit redesign because it helps address patient out-of-pocket burn. But the price-setting provisions in the IRA will certainly harm long-term innovation in our industry. So, we are hopeful that if it’s a new administration or the current administration, that they’ll reassess those provisions that ultimately are harmful for long-term patient care in the U.S. I mean, it clearly takes away the incentive to launch in later lines of smaller patient populations, which is really a very unfortunate negative outcome for the legislation. So, the way I view it is addressing patient out-of-pocket burden is good policy, but taking away the incentive for innovation is not, and my hope is under either administration, that will be reconsidered.",412.0,199.0,8.0,9.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.04020100502512563,0.04522613065326633,0.010050251256281407,0.005025125628140704,0.0,-0.005025125628140704

AbbVie is performing exceptionally well, and I’m extremely pleased with the execution against our strategic priorities, including continued double-digit sales growth from our ex-Humira platform, the closing and integration of Cerevel Therapeutics and the progress we are making to build and advance a compelling pipeline of innovative medicines. Turning to our results, AbbVie’s diversified portfolio delivered sales that were $260 million above our expectations and reflect robust mid-single-digit operational sales growth. Our ex-Humira platform drove this over achievement, including growth of nearly 18%. The momentum of Skyrizi and Rinvoq is especially impressive with combined sales expected to exceed $17 billion this year, which is $1.3 billion above our initial expectations. And, we see substantial opportunity for continued strong growth well into the next decade. Several other key products also delivered double-digit sales growth, including Venclexta, Vraylar, Ubrelvy and Qulipta. This broad-based performance further demonstrates the strength of our commercial portfolio. For the third time this year, we are raising our full-year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. We are increasing our full-year revenue guidance by $500 million and have now raised total revenue by $1.8 billion since our initial guidance in February. We are also raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.15 and now expect adjusted EPS between $10.90 and $10.94. In addition to achieving strong quarterly results, we have been very focused on investing in the business to generate sustainable long-term performance in the 2030s and beyond. During the quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics, strengthening our neuroscience pipeline. Cerevel enhances our ability to help patients suffering from devastating conditions such as Parkinson’s and schizophrenia. The integration has been seamless and we are excited to have the talented Cerevel team join our organization. Within the Cerevel pipeline, we are very pleased with the positive Phase 3 results and emerging profile of tavapadon in Parkinson’s. And, we remain on-track to read out both pivotal studies for emraclidine in schizophrenia in the fourth quarter. More broadly on the pipeline, we have been advancing key R&D programs across all stages of development. Some notable highlights include the U.S. approvals of Vyalev for advanced Parkinson’s and Botox for platysma bands. The U.S. regulatory submission of Teliso-V for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, and the start of our Phase 2 Crohn’s platform study, which is evaluating Skyrizi in combination with several novel biologics. In summary, AbbVie continues to demonstrate strong commercial, operational and R&D execution. The robust performance of our growth platform once again exceeded our expectations and we see numerous opportunities to drive long-term growth. Further underscoring our confidence in that growth, today we announced a 5.8% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2025. Since inception, we have increased our quarterly dividend by more than 300%. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff, for additional comments on our commercial highlights.

I’m extremely pleased with the continued strong momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. I’ll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $7 billion up 4.8% on an operational basis. Skyrizi global sales were $3.2 billion up 51.5% on an operational basis, exceeding our expectations. We are seeing robust prescription growth across psoriatic disease, with Skyrizi achieving in-play biologic share leadership in approximately now 30 key countries. In the U.S, we continue to capture nearly one out of every two in-play psoriatic disease patients on biologic therapy and we see substantial room for further total share growth. We believe that Skyrizi’s best-in-class profile with nearly complete skin clearance, high durability of response, easy onboarding and quarterly dosing for maintenance therapy sets a very high bar relative to other therapies on market or in development. Skyrizi has also demonstrated a compelling clinical profile in IBD, including strong endoscopic data paired with convenient dosing. This differentiated profile as well as our compelling head-to-head sequence data versus Stelara is supporting very rapid uptake in Crohn’s disease, where Skyrizi continues to gain market share globally, achieving in-play patient leadership across all lines of therapy in the U.S, Japan and Canada. Skyrizi’s U.S. in-play patient share is now approximately 32%, more than double the share of the second biologic treatment. And with Skyrizi’s total prescription share of approximately 8%, we see significant opportunity for revenue inflection in Crohn’s going forward. While we are still very early in our launch in the U.S. and Europe, we also anticipate robust uptake for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis the new indication. Initial prescription trends as well as feedback from gastroenterologists have been overwhelmingly positive. Physicians are particularly impressed with the data that has been demonstrated for naive UC patients, who have not been exposed yet to biologics, where Skyrizi achieved very high results for clinical remission and endoscopic response. We have now secured broad formulary access for Skyrizi in UC, with sales in this indication expected to ramp meaningfully over the next several quarters. So, given the momentum we are seeing across all of these indications, we will be raising our full-year sales guidance once again for Skyrizi. Turning now to Rinvoq, which is also demonstrating robust growth. Global sales were $1.6 billion up 47.4% on an operational basis. We continue to see strong prescription growth across all seven of Rinvoq’s approved indications. I’m especially pleased with our performance in IBD, where Rinvoq’s uptake is exceeding our expectations. Rinvoq is now capturing double-digit in-play patient share in the U.S. for ulcerative colitis as well as Crohn’s disease. Both indications are now available in more than 75 countries with reimbursement and share continuing to increase. I also wanted to highlight our recent performance in atopic dermatitis, where Rinvoq is seeing an acceleration of in-play share following recent positive data from our second head-to-head study versus Dupixent. As an oral option that provides rapid skin clearance and itch relief, we believe Rinvoq’s strong differentiated profile will continue to compete well in this highly underpenetrated AD market. As a result of this continued strong performance, we will also be increasing the full-year sales guidance once again for Rinvoq. Looking forward, we see substantial momentum for both Skyrizi and Rinvoq, including continued share gains across existing indications on top of the typical underlying market growth across room, derm and gastro. Additionally, we are making excellent progress with several new indications for Rinvoq across sizable markets that will have the potential to provide another significant revenue inflection in the second half of this decade and into the 2030s. From a competitive perspective, a key element of Skyrizi and Rinvoq’s success has been their strong differentiation with compelling head-to-head data against several novel therapies. This includes Skyrizi superiority versus Humira, Cosentyx, Otezla and Stelara in psoriasis as well as Stelara in Crohn’s disease and Rinvoq superiority versus Humira and Orencia in rheumatoid arthritis as well as Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. To further support our differentiation, we have another head-to-head study ongoing for Skyrizi versus Sotyktu in psoriasis with plans also underway now for a study comparing Skyrizi versus Entyvio in ulcerative colitis. So given all of these factors, we feel very confident about the long-term growth prospects for both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $2.2 billion down 36.5% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. While Humira share erosion to biosimilars in the U.S. is largely in-line with our expectations, we are now seeing more Humira molecule volume moving to other novel mechanisms than previously anticipated. So, while this has an unfavorable impact to Humira sales, we are seeing a benefit to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which is a very favorable dynamic for immunology portfolio now and certainly over the long-term. Moving now to Oncology, where total revenues were approximately $1.7 billion Imbruvica global revenues were $828 million down 8.8%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL, partially offset by higher persistency rates for existing patients. Venclexta is performing extremely well. Global sales were $677 million up 18.2% on an operational basis. This reflects strong momentum in CLL, especially in Europe, where recent guideline changes recommend combination use of Venclexta Plus BTK inhibitors as a preferred fixed duration treatment versus continuous BTK treatment alone. Growth is also supported by our very strong share position in frontline AML, where Venclexta is the leading treatment for patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. We are also seeing nice sequential revenue growth from Elahere and Epkinly, which are both demonstrating strong launch trajectories. Turning now to neuroscience, where total revenues were more than $2.3 billion up 16% on an operational basis. Vraylar is demonstrating robust performance. Sales were $875 million up 16.6% on an operational basis, reflecting continued new prescription growth in both bipolar disorder and adjunctive MDD. Within migraine, our leading oral CGRP therapies contributed $445 million in combined revenue this quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 22%, as we continue to see increasing prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Global Botox Therapeutic sales were $848 million reflecting strong performance in chronic migraine as well as the other approved indications. Finally, we are very excited for the recent U.S. approval of Vyalev, a transformative therapy for patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease, who are uncontrolled on oral therapy alone. As a less invasive, non-surgical delivery system that can provide meaningful improvements in on-time and off-time, we believe Vyalev has the potential to significantly expand use beyond current device aided therapies. Sales in the U.S. for Vyalev are expected to ramp gradually over the next several quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination. At the same time, we are very encouraged by the interest in uptake internationally, where we have approval now in 35 countries with several thousand patients already on treatment. Longer-term, we anticipate peak sales of Vyalev to exceed $1 billion. So overall, I’m very pleased with the continued commercial execution and performance across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Carrie, for additional comments on aesthetics.

Third quarter global aesthetics sales were more than $1.2 billion representing growth of 1.8% on an operational basis. In the U.S, aesthetic sales of $791 million increased by 3.9%, driven by growth from Botox Cosmetic as well as other brands across our broad portfolio. U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $414 million an increase of 6.5% versus the prior year. Favorable pricing dynamics and facial toxin market growth more than offset modest share erosion. Botox Cosmetics remains the clear market leader. U.S. Juvederm sales were $105 million. Juvederm’s market-leading share was consistent with last year and the overall filler market was roughly flat to the prior year. While the U.S. facial injectable market remains largely stable, growth is below historical rates. As a result, there is a reluctance from customers to maintain traditional toxin and filler inventory levels. Based upon the relatively higher price point of filler procedures in a still challenging U.S. economic environment, Juvederm is more impacted by this dynamic, which can be seen in third quarter results. Internationally, aesthetic sales were $448 million reflecting a decline of 1.6% on an operational basis. Within China, the economic dynamics that weighed on our results during the first half of the year have continued to impact consumer spending. This has created challenging aesthetic market conditions that have been particularly impactful to Juvederm’s performance. Primarily due to this circumstance, we are moderating our Juvederm sales outlook for the year. We are encouraged by the recently announced government stimulus in China. We will continue to monitor for any further developments and how it could positively impact consumer discretionary spending and aesthetic market growth. Although the current dynamics in China are challenging, its potential remains attractive and we are committed to bring innovation to this market that will drive long-term growth. Along those lines, in China, we recently received approval for the Botox Cosmetic indication in masseter muscle prominence, marking the first toxin in the world to have this indication. This approval enables us to market and train to this important treatment option that addresses a top aesthetic concern among many Asian patients. In the U.S., we are pleased that we received FDA approval for the use of Botox Cosmetic to treat platysma bands. This approval positions Botox as the only cosmetic toxin with four distinct indications and enables us to market and train beyond the face for the improvement of neck and jawline appearance. We also remain excited about the opportunity for BoNT/E. Based upon its rapid onset and short acting profile, BoNT/E has the potential to activate new patients that are hesitant to try facial toxins, driving long-term market expansion. Looking to the future, we continue to see significant growth potential for our aesthetics portfolio based upon low market penetration rates, our commitment to introduce novel treatments, our strong customer relationships and our position as the global aesthetics leader. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Roopal.",494.0,274.0,14.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.051094890510948905,0.025547445255474453,0.0072992700729927005,0.0,0.0072992700729927005,0.025547445255474453

Starting with immunology, where we recently began our Phase 2 Crohn’s disease platform study, which will evaluate Skyrizi in combination with several other novel biologics. This study will initially look at combinations of Skyrizi with our anti-IL-1α/β bispecific lutikizumab and our novel anti-α4β7 antibody ABBV-382. We are planning to include additional novel biologics in the future. Our approach in immunology has been to pursue therapies that are well differentiated and have the potential to elevate standard of care. We have clearly achieved this with Rinvoq and Skyrizi across multiple indications, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. As we think about how the IBD market will evolve, we view dual mechanism approaches as having the greatest potential to achieve levels of efficacy that are above current standard of care. We are very excited about the potential for these combination therapies in IBD and we look forward to sharing updates as the data mature. In Oncology, we continue to make very good progress across all stages of our hem and solid tumor pipeline. In the area of solid tumors, we recently submitted our application to the FDA for accelerated approval of Teliso-V as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild type non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Once approved, Teliso-V will become the first c-Met targeted ADC to enter non-small cell lung cancer, a segment with limited options and where patients tend to have a very poor prognosis, especially if their tumors express c-Met. We anticipate an approval decision in the first half of 2025. In the quarter, we also received a positive CHMP opinion recommending Elahere for the treatment of platinum resistant ovarian cancer in patients with high expression of FRα and treated with up to three prior therapies. This decision was based on the positive Phase 3 MIRASOL trial where Elahere demonstrated an overall survival benefit and significantly reduce the risk of cancer progression. We anticipate an approval decision in Europe in the fourth quarter. At the recent ESMO Congress we presented new Phase 1 data for ABBV-400 in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and gastroesophageal cancer. Early efficacy data from the lung cohort are promising with an objective response rate of 48% across all patients in the study and response rates ranging from 60% to 78% in patients with overexpressed c-Met. We are very pleased with the level of activity we’re seeing from our next generation c-Met ADC, which compares favorably to Teliso-V, where we’ve seen objective response rates ranging from 23% in medium c-Met expressors to 35% in patients with high c-Met expression. 400 has the potential to expand our c-Met portfolio into earlier lines of therapy and lower levels of c-Met expression in lung cancer. Similarly, in patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer, 400 demonstrated promising activity with an objective response rate of 29% across all patients. This compares well against combination and single agent chemotherapy, which are the standards of care for patients in second line and third line of therapy respectively. Based on these encouraging preliminary data, we plan to begin Phase 2 studies for 400 in both non-small cell lung cancer and gastroesophageal cancer. Recall, we’ve also advanced 400 in late line colorectal cancer and we remain on-track to begin a Phase 3 study later this year. In the area of hematologic oncology, we received approval in Europe for Tepkinly as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of therapy. Epcoritamab is now the only T-cell engaging bispecific approved in the U.S. and Europe to treat both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Moving to neuroscience, we recently received FDA approval for Vyalev as the first subcutaneous 24 hour infusion of levodopa based therapy for the treatment of motor fluctuations in adults with advanced Parkinson’s disease. Our novel subcutaneous levodopa, carbidopa delivery offers meaningful benefits over current treatment options and others that are in development. Vyalev delivers significant improvements in on-time and off-time with a non-surgical 24 hour delivery system. It can deliver high levodopa doses similar to the amount provided by Duopa and it doesn’t require combination with oral drugs to achieve efficacy. We’re extremely excited to bring this transformative therapeutic option to patients in the U.S. We also recently announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 TEMPO-1 trial, which evaluated fixed doses of monotherapy tavapadon in early Parkinson’s disease. In the study, both doses of tavapadon met the primary endpoint demonstrating a significant reduction in the severity of Parkinson’s disease symptoms compared with placebo at week 26, as measured by decreases in the combined scores for Parts 2 and 3 of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale. Key secondary endpoints were also met in this study. We are very pleased with the emerging profile for tavapadon, which shows it is generally safe and well tolerated and it can drive strong efficacy as a monotherapy in early Parkinson’s and as an adjunctive treatment in patients with more advanced disease. Results from the two Phase 3 studies thus far look favorable compared to other dopamine agonists on the market. And, we believe tavapadon has the potential to become an important new treatment option as a monotherapy for Parkinson’s patients as well as an adjunct to oral levo/carbidopa. We expect to see results from TEMPO-2 later this year, which is our Phase 3 monotherapy study evaluating a flexible dose of tavapadon. Results from our long-term safety study, TEMPO-4 are expected next year. As Rob mentioned, we remain on track to share data from the two emraclidine pivotal studies in the fourth quarter. We also continue to invest in external innovation to strengthen our neuroscience pipeline. We recently announced two deals in this area, including an expanded collaboration with Gedeon Richter to develop novel targets for neuropsychiatric conditions and the acquisition of Aliada brings an anti-pyroglutamate Aβ antibody, which uses a unique blood brain barrier crossing and amyloid aggregate clearing technology. Aliada’s lead antibody has been able to achieve encouraging levels in cerebrospinal fluid with an extended half-life and the potential to be delivered subcutaneously. This molecule could become a best-in-class treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. Aliada’s novel technologies for enabling therapeutics to access the central nervous system also have the potential to be used with other programs across our neuroscience pipeline. In aesthetics, we recently received approval for Botox in the U.S. for moderate to severe platysma bands, marking the first global approval in this indication for any neurotoxin. There is currently a lack of non-surgical treatments available to improve the appearance of prominent platysma bands. And, we believe Botox will represent an important new treatment option for patients who are looking to reduce the appearance of vertical neck bands and improve jawline definition. In our novel toxin portfolio, we remain on-track to submit our regulatory application for BoNT/E around the end of this year. Our rapid onset short acting toxin has a highly differentiated clinical profile and once approved will offer patients a novel option compared to currently available neurotoxins. So in summary, this has been a very productive year thus far for our R&D organization and we are pleased with the progress we’ve made advancing our broad pipeline.

Starting with our third quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3 which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.04 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $14.5 billion reflecting robust growth of 4.9% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Our ex-Humira growth platform, which covers more than 80% of AbbVie’s total sales, delivered reported growth of nearly 18%, once again exceeding our expectations. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.7% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.4%, adjusted R&D expense of 14.2%, acquired IPR&D expense of 0.6% and adjusted SG&A expense of 23%. Net interest expense was $591 million. The adjusted tax rate was 16.2%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.15 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $10.94. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the third quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $56 billion, an increase of $500 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.7% unfavorable impact on full-year sales growth. This revenue forecast includes the following updates to select key products and therapeutic areas. We now approximate Skyrizi global sales of $11.5 billion, an increase of $500 million due to continued strong performance across all approved indications. Rinvoq total revenue of $5.8 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting robust uptake in IBD. U.S. Humira total sales of $7.4 billion a decrease of $400 million reflecting more Humira molecule volume moving to other novel mechanisms, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Imbruvica totaled revenue of $3.3 billion an increase of $200 million reflecting higher persistency rates for existing patients. Venclexta total sales of $2.6 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting momentum in both U.S. and international markets. Aesthetics global revenue of $5.3 billion a decrease of $200 million almost entirely due to lower Juvederm volume which continues to be impacted by challenging economic conditions in key markets. Vraylar total sales of $3.3 billion a decrease of $100 million reflecting continued strong prescription demand partially offset by modestly unfavorable channel mix. And for Botox, we now expect global revenue in the therapeutic space of $3.3 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting robust demand across all indications. Moving to the P&L for 2024. We continue to forecast a full-year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14%, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% as well as an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales, which includes a 2.1% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Turning to the fourth quarter. We anticipate net revenues approaching $14.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.94 and $2.98. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter and excludes any potential impact from the recently announced acquisition of Aliada Therapeutics. Finally, AbbVie’s robust business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of September was nearly $7.3 billion and we generated more than $11 billion of free cash flow, which includes approximately $1.5 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments in the first nine-months of the year. This free cash flow fully supports a strong and growing quarterly dividend, which we are increasing 5.8% to $1.64 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in 2025, as well as debt repayment, where we remain on-track to pay down the roughly $7 billion of maturities this year and anticipate achieving a net leverage ratio of two times by the end of 2026. Our strong cash flow also provides capacity for additional business development. We have executed more than a dozen early stage deals so far this year, and we continue to assess external innovation across all of our key growth areas. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered strong top and bottom line results. I’m very pleased with the momentum of our ex-Humira growth platform, including continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which further supports AbbVie’s long-term outlook.

My question was really just centered around 2025 and just some preliminary outlook there. I guess a specific question, you mentioned Humira volumes are maybe shifting over to newer drugs. You comment at all about just in terms of where the street sits currently with Humira. I think consensus number is about $6.8 billion. Is that a reasonable forecast, or is that something you could see higher erosion given what’s happening with Humira? And, then bigger picture kind of tied to that, the mid-single-digit topline growth, it sounds like the trends you’re seeing here may be a net positive where maybe Humira volumes are declining, but that’s largely moving over to Skyrizi and Rinvoq. I just want to get some context of is that mid-single-digit target still a reasonable one to think about for AbbVie next year?

So yes, we are very confident in that robust mid-single-digit growth, both topline, bottom line for 2025. I think you’ve interpreted correctly that the trends we’re seeing are net positive and that we’re seeing over performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq more than offsetting the dynamics with Humira. And so, as we look at consensus, that’s probably not reflected. So, I think it’s fair to say, there’s a shift that’s required there, but we’re very pleased with the strong uptake for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. As I mentioned in my remarks, we have now delivered guidance increases of $1.3 billion for Skyrizi and Rinvoq in total. We’re seeing tremendous momentum, particularly with the IBD indications across really all indications, but particularly in IBD. And, we are starting to see the dynamic with the overall Humira molecule, where there is the switching that we’re seeing now to other mechanisms, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which is a long-term very positive benefit. So, as we look at the business, we’re very well-positioned. Essentially two years after the U.S. Humira LOE, we’ll be returning to robust top line and bottom line growth, and really performance across many parts of the business, not just Skyrizi and Rinvoq. You’ve seen us perform very nicely in oncology. We’ve obviously over performed our expectations in oncology, very pleased with the earlier returns on Elahere. Venclexta is performing exceptionally well. The guidelines changes in Europe are positive as we think about combination opportunities with BTK inhibitors. So, Venclexta is going to be strong, Epkinly is performing very nicely as well. And, then when I look across the neuroscience franchise, Vraylar is a strong grower. We’re very pleased with the migraine portfolio. Obviously, very excited about Cerevel and doing a number of deals now on the early pipeline both with Gedeon Richter and Aliada that really fortifies the long-term view for neuroscience as well. And, then with aesthetics, while it’s below our expectations for this year, obviously the economic conditions have dictated that. We still have tremendous confidence in the long-term outlook for that business. But, as we look at 2025, we’re very confident in our ability to return to that robust mid-single-digit growth.",403.0,167.0,16.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09580838323353294,0.005988023952095809,0.005988023952095809,0.0,0.011976047904191617,0.08982035928143713

So, we saw this trend start to emerge in terms of this compression of the, let’s say, the ADAM molecule or the ADAM market, the Humira plus biosimilars, just prior to the CVS event and then it accelerated over Q2. And again, we saw it throughout Q3. So, that’s why we’ve adapted our approach here. Other than this dynamic, the biosimilar dynamics are playing out really exactly as we anticipated. And you can see this compression in the IQVIA data. So, really the shrinking of the Humira or the ADAM market is something that’s quite clear. It’s a little difficult quantify over time with full precision, but we can see that the molecule continues to decline sequentially and we continue to see strong share gains as I highlighted for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So, this incremental flow from the molecule compression, it’s clearly a contributing factor to some of the over performance that we saw in Q2 and Q3, but it’s really only one of several. We’ve also had significant incremental investments in the consumer space, the sales force approaches we’ve taken, Chris, the integration of the head-to-head data I talked about. And, certainly now we’re starting to see the impact of the UC launch. So, when we put all that together, we think that the dynamics are net-net quite positive overall.

So, when we look at the data, in particular, I think Jeff highlighted this, in ulcerative colitis with Skyrizi in this naive patient population, this is a patient population that hasn’t seen biologics or other advanced therapies like JAK inhibitors. The endoscopic improvement and this is in label was 76% in the maintenance portion of this. So, it was quite high, in fact, higher than what we’ve observed even with Rinvoq. So that gave us a good amount of confidence that we have the potential to differentiate with all other assets. You heard about the Skyrizi versus, ustekinumab head to head in Crohn’s disease, but this one gives us a unique opportunity there to go head to head with vedolizumab, especially looking at endoscopic improvement. So, for that particular endpoint, you asked about the type of endpoint. There we would think about superiority, because of it being an objective endpoint. Sometimes with symptoms like clinical remission, these could bounce around. That may be one where we consider as non-inferiority. But I would say endoscopic improvements in the field are now believed to be highly predictive of long-term outcomes.

Maybe starting with what we’ve observed with the approval. So, we were encouraged by the lack of a boxed warning, meaning there’s a recognition that this is a unique mechanism of action looking specifically at the muscarinic class. So, we were pleased to see that. I think what was notable for us was the GI adverse events, including how that would play out in terms of longer-term tolerability. Also anticholinergic effects, bladder retention that was something I guess we did not anticipate. You mentioned hepatic monitoring that was something that we didn’t anticipate. The other thing that was notable is along with the BID dosing, there is a food effect. So, you have to wait a certain period amount of time when you eat and after you eat when you can take the pill. So, when we think about our profile, we continue to be encouraged with emraclidine being a single agent, once a day, no food effect. We don’t see the extent of GI effects. We don’t and we have not observed in the Phase 1b data any bladder issues. And when we had looked at that 1b data, we didn’t see any hepatic issues, so we don’t anticipate any type of laboratory monitoring. We were also thinking about neurodegeneration associated psychosis and these patients are typically older and likely more sensitive to anticholinergic effects. So, we continue to see an opportunity in that patient population as well. So, we’ve stated that the data will read out here in the next couple of months in the quarter. The same team is working on wrapping up these two studies. So, depending on how far apart the data are, we’ll probably determine as you stated, is it 1 or 2 press releases. It’s a little early right now for us to tell you is it going to be 1 or 2. But if they’re going to be close together, it’s potentially going to be 1.",347.0,142.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.028169014084507043,0.02112676056338028,0.04225352112676056,0.0,0.007042253521126761,0.007042253521126761

We have a few more nuances and so typically that may take another month or so. Overall, we’re making very good progress on contracting next year. So, in terms of what we’ve highlighted in the past is we do not anticipate any material change for Skyrizi and Rinvoq in terms of the access for next year across Medicare or the commercial plans. We have quite high, very broad access and we assume that will continue. In terms of what we’ve highlighted to anticipate, we’ve said that we do have over our near-term in LRP sort of a negative pricing environment, but it’s modest.

With respect to the oral, I’ll take us back to the Skyrizi head-to-head that occurred with apremilast, which is also an oral. The data were substantially higher from an efficacy standpoint for Skyrizi as was the tolerability along with when we asked patients what did they prefer, they actually preferred quarterly subcutaneous dosing. So, I would think about it that way as well. Now the question would be, it’s a similar mechanism, could the efficacy be better than what has been observed with a apremilast in psoriasis? Well, what we saw in the Phase 2 data, my recollection still is that Skyrizi is a full 50% higher when it comes to full skin clearance at a PASI 100. And that’s where the bar is now at PASI 90 and PASI 100. So, we still see an efficacy advantage. Also the data I’m sharing are Phase 3 Skyrizi data. The data that we saw for the oral 23 was from Phase 2. So, there is a reasonable potential that the efficacy data tend to settle down when you go to a broader patient population, especially those that have had longer standing disease or have seen other therapies like other biologics. So, we continue to feel very good and optimistic about our profile versus any emerging competition. Also, we think about our assets from a global standpoint. And when you think about majority of the countries, they are very driven by efficacy to gain access. And in the oral space, we don’t really see it across the globe. Maybe there’s a couple of countries. I think Jeff has mentioned the U.S., but that space may be referred to as a pre biologic space. So maybe more of an influence on the TIK2 or on a apremilast is how we see it. In terms of other mechanisms that we like, as I mentioned, we like anti L23 the way it’s delivered with Skyrizi, the depth of response, the high durability and the convenience with quarterly dosing. If we can couple that with other assets as part of our combination approach, we think that’s going to be extremely competitive in the future. Mechanisms like TL1a, we think are going to be important, especially from a combination approach, which we have one internally. We think the ulcerative colitis data are encouraging, but from a monotherapy standpoint, not differentiated, especially when you look at the Skyrizi data that I mentioned earlier and Rinvoq. And then in Crohn’s, something like TL1a, we think it really does need a combo. So that’ll be part of our platform along with our novel alpha 4 beta 7, we think that’s also a good combo. And then we’ve also provided very strong data in hidradenitis suppurativa with our IL-1 alpha beta lutikizumab. And we’ve seen some preclinical signals that IL-1 beta could be a driver of disease and resistance to other biologics. So, lutikizumab will also be part of the combo in our IBD platform. So, that’s just some of the mechanisms that we’re excited about. There are several others that are early in the pipeline and we will give you more information about those as the data mature.",548.0,221.0,9.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.04072398190045249,0.004524886877828055,0.02262443438914027,0.0,0.0,0.03619909502262444

So, as we think about the long-term guide, which is greater than $9 billion by 2029, you need to believe that you can have essentially a compound growth around 11% to get there. If we look at the historical growth of this market, it’s been, let’s say, call it low double digits, low teens. As we look at it going forward, we think probably a more prudent assumption is when we see the recovery, something more in the high single digits, right? So, you need something beyond just the market recovery to get there. And when we look at our the innovation that we’re bringing particularly with the short onset, short acting or fast onset short acting BoNT/E that we expect to launch in ‘26. That could really transform the market, because if you think about the number one barrier for patients is fear of an unnatural look. That could really unlock a part of the market that’s dormant right now, plus it could also lead to share gains. And so I think we need to see, 1, how the market recovers, I would say, 2025 and 26 and then ultimately see how the BoNT/E launch ramps in ‘26. At that point, we’ll have a better sense of the $9 billion as we sit here today. If you believe that the market will recover to high single digits and we have a lot of confidence in BoNT/E, we still believe we can get there, which is why we’re not updating that guidance. But I would expect us to reflect more on that more likely in the ‘26 timeframe than in ‘25.",282.0,128.0,3.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0234375,0.0234375,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.0

So yes, I mean, our main focus is our five key growth areas, which includes eye care, includes immunology, oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. And we participate in large markets with high unmet need that have great growth potential. And within those five verticals, we’re building depth across 24 core areas that does include eye care as well. When you think about diabetic retinopathy, wet AMD, prescription dry eye medications. And so eye care does play an important role, albeit it’s not as high of a growth driver as the other four verticals, but it is part of our five. And that ultimately guides both our internal R&D investments as well as our BD efforts, which as you know, continue to be very active. So, far this year, we’ve executed 15 deals along those lines, really focused more on early stage opportunities to drive growth in the next decade. So that’s our primary focus. Now if we see an opportunity for differentiation in a large market with high unmet need like metabolics, we would consider pursuing it, especially if we can help drive growth in the next decade. But again, it would be more opportunistic. We have to see differentiation and right now it’s not our primary focus. But again, we’re open to more sources of growth for the next decade if we see differentiation that we can create value.

I know you mentioned that the team the same team that was originally working on the Phase 1b is wrapping up studies and so forth.

When we did our thorough diligence, that was a major question that we and the broader team had. So, you bring up a good point. Some things that we observed in those two studies that will be the pivotal readouts were what Cerevel was strategically doing. One thing was limiting the number of countries, limiting the number of sites, central review for eligibility criteria, training of raters, certifying those raters, recertifying raters, monitoring blinded data with respect to site activity. So, I think those are important factors that could drive placebo in either direction. So, what we observed was, we would say a good control or at least the best one could do to manage placebo responses. So, it’s hard to know what if there’s any erosion until we see the data. But the effect size that we did see in the Phase 1b was a little over 12 points. So, we think that was a strong separation.

And in addition to the recent deal, we’ll have an option readout with Alector and TREM2 coming up. We have SV2A molecule that would look at cognition and other symptoms. Emraclidine could participate in that space from an Alzheimer’s psychosis standpoint. We have other pipeline assets that are looking at tau, intracellular and even an approach looking at extracellular tau. We did have our own A beta monotherapeutic antibody, which we did read out. It did look good, but it wasn’t fully differentiated. And moving on to the Aliada deal, what we see there is the ability to access the CSF at what we would say at this stage at higher concentrations than maybe other competitors. So, we think that’s a good thing. The other aspect that we like is an extended half-life. So that could lead to convenient dosing. And if this approach plays out than one could consider having subcutaneous dosing even getting out to monthly. And if the efficacy is high because of deeper brain penetration that could result in lower levels, faster and a better able to see cognition benefit in a year or 18 months. So, those are some of the benefits that we would see. The other benefit would be getting to the parenchymal tissue more broadly and that could have a reduction in ARIA, which is probably what is disallowing this to really take off. It’s very challenging to take an elderly family member to get multiple scans and worry about them having stroke like symptoms. So, that would be something else we believe we can address with this asset of having a strong safety profile, tolerability, ease of onboarding and high efficacy and ultimately strong benefits on cognition.",313.0,136.0,6.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.04411764705882353,0.022058823529411766,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.0,0.022058823529411766

I mean, I think about it as having really four main segments, psychiatry, migraine, Parkinson’s and then neurodegeneration. And if you look at what we’ve done to build out the long-term growth outlook for this franchise, obviously, in psychiatry between Cereval, Gedeon Richter, we also had the early stage opportunity with Gilgamesh, really investing in longer term growth in psychiatry. We have actually a very strong franchise in migraine with the oral CGRPs as well as Botox Therapeutic. In Parkinson’s, now the launch of Vyalev, which is performing very nicely outside the U.S., and we expect will also perform nicely in the U.S. The early Phase 3 data we’ve seen so far for davapidone, the mitokinin disease modifying approach, it’s early and Parkinson’s is another investment we’ve made. And then in Alzheimer’s now with Aliada is another I’d say, long-term investment we’re making to grow the neuroscience franchise.

And in the oral space, I don’t know if we’ve seen a new mechanism that could have this type of approach in a very long time. So, it is important to discuss that because the unmet need continues to be very high and Parkinson’s is a place where we believe we can meaningfully participate in. On the effect size question, when we look at the 1b data, it was more than a 12 point differential. So we have observed sometimes a decrement and the question was around if placebo responses move up a little bit. So that being said, we still think we can maintain a very strong effect size coupled with the safety profile. Remember that the issue here in therapy isn’t just about efficacy, it’s about maintaining these patients on a drug that they can tolerate. And the majority of these patients don’t last very long and cycle through these assets and even stop these, especially atypicals without even letting their physicians know and then go on to have a flare and end up in the hospital. So, we think about this as a benefit, risk and tolerability profile and from a weight, metabolic, motor symptoms, sedation, these are major problems with atypicals. And with something like emraclidine, we feel that we can still fully differentiate. So, I don’t know if I’d read into any concerns other than maybe seeing an effect that’s slightly different than what we saw in Phase 1b.

Our fourth quarter performance closes out another excellent year for AbbVie, and I'm very pleased with the significant progress we made in 2024. We executed on our top commercial priorities, advanced our pipeline with key regulatory approvals and promising data, and further strengthened our business through strategic transactions. Turning to our results, we delivered full-year adjusted earnings per share of $10.12, which is $0.49 above our initial guidance midpoint. Excluding the impact of IPR&D expense, total net revenues were $56.3 billion, exceeding our initial guidance by more than $2 billion. Our results demonstrate a rapid return to sales growth, with full-year revenue up 4.6% on an operational basis, despite $5 billion of U.S. Humira erosion in 2024. This outstanding execution is driven by our ex-Humira platform, which continues to outperform expectations, delivering full-year sales growth of more than 18% with revenue growth accelerating to 22% in the fourth quarter. As I look to 2025 and beyond, we are well-positioned with our ex-Humira platform. It will allow AbbVie to deliver robust mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 and exceed our previous peak revenue in just the second year following the U.S. Humira LOE. And given that we have no significant LOE events for the rest of this decade, we have a clear runway to growth for at least the next eight years, including a high single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029. We anticipate a substantial portion of this growth will be driven by robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq to assets are expected to collectively generate nearly $24 billion of revenue in 2025, reflecting growth of more than $6 billion. Based on this strong momentum, we now expect Skyrizi and Rinvoq to exceed more than $31 billion of combined sales in 2027, which is $4 billion above the guidance we provided last year. We are seeing strong performance across all of their approved indications, especially in IBD. And we see several tailwinds that will support growth into the next decade, including healthy immunology market growth, strong share capture given best-in-class profiles, continued robust market access, and momentum from new indications, such as the recent launch of Skyrizi in UC, as well as the potential for five new indications for Rinvoq over the next few years. In neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, we are seeing very robust performance, with sales of $10 billion expected in 2025, reflecting growth of $1 billion across psychiatry, migraine, and Parkinson's. In oncology, I am very encouraged by our long-term growth prospects. This includes our BCL-2 inhibitor, Venclexta; our FRα ADC for ovarian cancer, Elahere; our two novel c-MET ADCs for solid tumors, Teliso-V and 400, and our BCMA-CD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma 383. Lastly, while the recent performance in aesthetics has been impacted by challenging market conditions in the U.S. and China, the category remains very attractive given low penetration rates for facial injectables. When the market returns to more normalized growth, our leading commercial portfolio and forthcoming pipeline will help drive improved performance. Based on the market trends over the last few years, and our assumption for a gradual recovery in the near term, we now expect aesthetics to deliver a high single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029. Turning now to R&D, we have made excellent progress with our late-stage programs. These advancements include recent approvals for Skyrizi in UC, Epkinly in later lines of follicular lymphoma, Elahere for FRα-positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, Vyalev for advanced Parkinson's, and new indications for Botox and Juvéderm. In 2025, we anticipate approvals for Rinvoq in GCA, and Teliso-V for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, as well as regulatory submissions for Tavapadon in Parkinson's, Venclexta in higher-risk MDS, and BoNT/E for aesthetics. We have also added depth to our pipeline by signing more than 20 early-stage deals since the beginning of 2024, including promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard of care in immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. We have significant capacity to continue pursuing external innovation with a focus on differentiated opportunities that can drive growth in the next decade. In summary, I am very pleased with AbbVie's execution in 2024. And expect our diverse portfolio to drive strong growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.

ABBV,2025-01-31,2025-01-31,,2025-01-31,2025-01-31T03:00:00-05:00,0,2025-01-31,prepared,,Jeff Stewart,"Thank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7.3 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi total sales were nearly $3.8 billion, reflecting operational growth of 57.9%. Rinvoq total sales were more than $1.8 billion, reflecting operational growth of 47.1%. On a full-year basis, Skyrizi and Rinvoq delivered approximately $17.7 billion in total combined revenue, an impressive increase of nearly $6 billion year-over-year, exceeding our expectations. These results reflect strong performance across all approved indications. I'll share some highlights in the U.S. Skyrizi total prescription share in the biologic psoriasis market is now approximately 40%, reflecting a very significant lead relative to all major competitors, with in-play capture rates remaining very strong. Over the course of 2025, we anticipate new data for Skyrizi on hard-to-treat areas of the body, including scalp and genital psoriasis. In addition, we expect the readout of our fifth head-to-head study in psoriasis comparing Skyrizi to Sotyktu, which will continue to differentiate the brand versus oral competitors. Rinvoq is now capturing more than 20% in-place share in atopic dermatitis, as our communication around our level-up study versus Dupixen continues to ramp. Recall that in level-up, we showed strong comparative results on stringent endpoints of skin resolution and itch reduction. In RA, Rinvoq is achieving the leading in-place share in the second line plus market, consistent with the brand's label. We see that U.S. physicians are increasingly utilizing only one TNF prior to initiating Rinvoq treatment in RA. In psoriatic arthritis, Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are capturing a leading in-place share in the room category, highlighting the effective co-positioning of both agents in this important segment. Across IBD, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are also capturing substantial portfolio share, given their respective efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles. In Crohn's disease, which is roughly two-thirds of the overall IBD market, these two treatments together are capturing approximately half of the in-place share with total prescription volumes ramping very rapidly. In ulcerative colitis, we are seeing a very strong inflection following the Skyrizi launch in the second-half of last year. Both Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are already capturing roughly a third of the UC in-play market, which supports robust momentum going forward for both AbbVie brands. We see similar performance internationally as well, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq are also achieving leadership positions across our major countries. So, I'm very pleased with this momentum and continue to see a significant opportunity for share gains across our existing indications, in addition to the typical market growth we see across room, derm, and gastro in 2025 and beyond. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of more than $1.6 billion, down 48.7% on an operational basis, primarily due to biosimilar competition, we continue to see molecule compression in the U.S. with volume moving to other novel mechanisms, which has resulted in a benefit to both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We anticipate Humira access will decrease throughout 2025 as more plans move to exclusive biosimilar contracts. It's reasonable to assume that roughly half of U.S. covered lives will continue to have parity access to Humira on a full-year basis, with select exclusionary contracts for existing patients expected to begin around the middle of the year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were approximately $1.7 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $848 million, down 6.2%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $655 million, up 13% on an operational basis, reflecting strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. Lastly, Elahere continues to demonstrate a strong launch trajectory for FR-alpha positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, with global sales of $148 million. Sales in the U.S. are annualizing at more than $600 million and commercialization is now underway in key international markets where we are accelerating regulatory and reimbursement timelines. Moving to neuroscience, where total full-year revenues were $9 billion, reflecting impressive absolute sales growth of nearly $1.3 billion. In the quarter, total revenues were $2.5 billion, up 19.9% on an operational basis. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of Vraylar with global sales of $924 million, Botox Therapeutic with global revenues of $873 million, Ubrelvy with global sales of $303 million, and Qulipta with global revenues of $201 million. Beyond these leading therapies for psychiatry and migraine, we are very excited for an emerging portfolio in Parkinson's disease. We recently launched Vyalev, the only subcutaneous 24-hour continuous infusion of levodopa-based therapy for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. As a less invasive, non-surgical delivery system that can provide meaningful improvements in on-time and off-time, we are seeing very high interest from both physicians and patient communities. Parkinson's experts report significant benefit from the continuous 24-hour delivery and the control of symptoms morning, day, and through the night. While sales in the U.S. are expected to ramp gradually over the next several quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination, uptake internationally is exceeding our expectations. Finally, I'm very encouraged by the data we are seeing for tavapadon for potential use as a monotherapy for early Parkinson's disease, as well as an adjunct to optimize oral therapy for more advanced patients. Tavapadon represents a very complimentary addition to our Parkinson's disease portfolio with Vyalev and Duopa. So, overall, I'm extremely pleased with the commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating very strong momentum as we head into 2025. With that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics.

Fourth quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.3 billion, reflecting an operational decrease of 4.4%. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $839 million declined 5% as challenging market conditions and promotional dynamics impacted key assets. Consistent with recent quarters, the U.S. facial injectable market continues to be affected by suppressed consumer spending that is related to the cumulative impact of high inflation over several years. As a higher price procedure relative to toxins, current conditions are most notably impacting the filler market, which declined by approximately 10% in the quarter. The toxin market remains more resilient, demonstrating low single-digit% growth. Although we continue to be the clear market leader in toxins and fillers, in Q4, our facial injectable share declined by a few points. In October, we launched an updated version of our Alle consumer loyalty program, which was designed to benefit providers by increasing treatment frequency, patient retention, and cross-selling. While some providers embraced the new loyalty program, many felt the new contract was too complex to integrate into their practices, therefore negatively impacting market share and inventory levels. Based on this market reaction, we reinstated our original Alle consumer loyalty program earlier this month. This action has been met with a rapid and favorable response from our providers with encouraging early indicators for sales and market share recovery. Internationally, aesthetic sales were $459 million. This represented an operational decline of 3.2% that was primarily due to lower Juvéderm sales as Botox cosmetic sales were roughly flat on an operational basis. Our international results were impacted by our second largest global market, China, where lower consumer spending related to economic headwinds continues to affect performance. Looking to 2025, we've planned prudently with our outlook for modest aesthetic sales growth. In the U.S., this reflects a gradual improvement in market growth rates and share for both toxins and fillers. Additionally, based on our Alle loyalty program changes, we expect a one-time price adjustment to negatively impact our first quarter U.S. results. Internationally, we are focused on retaining a strong competitive position as we launch multiple new products in China while we closely monitor market conditions and consumer sentiment. In summary, while economic headwinds and key geographies have created a near-term impact on market conditions, we continue to see significant long-term growth potential, given high consumer interest and low penetration rate. Allergan Aesthetics is uniquely positioned to benefit based on our customer relationships, commercial investments, and innovative pipeline.

We continue to make significant progress with our R&D efforts to advance novel clinical programs across all stages of our diversified pipeline. In 2025, we expect a strong cadence of important data readouts, regulatory submissions, and new approvals, as well as many clinical trial starts for key programs. Starting with immunology, regulatory applications are under review for Rinvoq and GCA, with approval decisions anticipated in the second quarter. Data for two Phase 3 Rinvoq programs will be available this year, alopecia areata and vitiligo, and for our HS and lupus programs in 2026. Moving to Skyrizi, data from the head-to-head in psoriasis versus Sotyktu will be available this year. Also this year, to further support differentiation in IBD, a study comparing Skyrizi to Entyvio in ulcerative colitis will be initiated. Additional mid-stage monotherapy and combination studies are planned in 2025, including a Phase 2 study evaluating lutikizumab in atopic dermatitis, a Phase 2 study evaluating Skyrizi and lutikizumab in psoriatic arthritis, and advancement of our anti-TREM1 antibody, ABBV-8736 with the eventual goal to add it to the Crohn's Disease Platform Study as a monotherapy and in combination with Skyrizi. Moving to oncology, where multiple regulatory and clinical milestones as well as phase transitions for key programs are planned. One area that we are particularly excited about is our ADC pipeline, where several assets are aimed at multiple tumor types. Our regulatory application is under review for accelerated approval of Teliso-V as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild type non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The target for an approval decision is in the first-half of this year. This represents a segment of lung cancer with high unmet need where patients have limited options and tend to have a very poor prognosis. If approved, Teliso-V would be the first c-Met-directed ADC for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. We are also rapidly advancing our next-gen c-Met asset. A Phase 3 study evaluating ABBV-400, also known as Temab-A, was recently initiated in patients with c-Met overexpressed refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Temab-A, as a monotherapy, is being compared against chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. This year, data from a Phase 1 CRC study evaluating Temab-A in combination with bevacizumab could enable a Phase 3 study in an all-comers population. Temab-A is also progressing well across lung programs. A Phase 2 study in EGFR wild-type non-small cell lung cancer is being planned, where Temab-A will be evaluated with a PD-1 inhibitor as a frontline combination therapy. In the EGFR mutant segment, results from the ongoing Phase 1 study could enable Temab-A dose optimization studies as a monotherapy in the second line setting and in combination with osimertinib in the first line setting. In gastroesophageal cancer, a Phase 2 trial was recently started evaluating Temab-A in combination with chemotherapy and a PD-1 inhibitor in frontline patients. We are also excited about ABBV-706, an ADC that utilizes the same Topo warhead and linker technology as Temab-A, but with an antibody that targets SEZ6. Encouraging data in small lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, were presented at ASCO last year. And this year, dose optimization and longer term duration data will be available. This readout could lead to the initiation of a registrational study in second line and dose optimization in combination with standard of care in the frontline. Moving to FRα ADC, Elahere is now approved for platinum resistant ovarian cancer in the U.S. and Europe and is currently in Phase 3 development for the platinum sensitive ovarian cancer segment, also, a next generation ADC targeting FRα, IMGN-151 is currently in Phase 1. This year, Elahere will be tested in combination with bevacizumab and a PARP inhibitor. 151 is being advanced into dose optimization as well as in studies with standard of care agents such as bevacizumab, carboplatin and a PARP inhibitor. These mid-stage studies for Elahere and 151 will be used to inform our Phase 3 approach in various settings for ovarian cancer, including induction and maintenance in platinum sensitive patients and in combination for frontline maintenance. Another ADC from ImmunoGen known as PIVAC targets a rare hematologic malignancy called Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm. Based on positive data from the pivotal Phase 2 study, a regulatory application is planned for later this year. If approved, this would be an important new treatment option for patients with this aggressive blood cancer. Also in the area of hematologic oncology, the Phase 3 Venclexta MDS study is nearing completion with an overall survival data readout later this year. Now moving to neuroscience, following the Emraclidine EMPOWER-1 and 2 study readouts, a thorough analysis of the data was conducted to better understand the placebo effect observed in the two trials. Our findings point to a lack of uniformity of placebo effect across sites. When assessing sites beyond those with high placebo response, a clear efficacy signal was observed, albeit more modest than reported in Phase 1b. Therefore, we see a path forward as an adjunct to atypicals and schizophrenia and as a monotherapy in psychosis related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. These are diseases where there is a high unmet need for safe and tolerable treatments that can provide even a modest benefit. Additionally, our intention is to explore higher doses of Emraclidine. This is based on the degree of variability observed in the PK data from the EMPOWER studies. If higher doses are found to be safe and well tolerated, there is a potential opportunity to evaluate Emraclidine as a monotherapy in schizophrenia, as higher doses may result in greater efficacy. A multiple ascending dose study will be conducted this year and data will be available in the early part of 2026. Following this dosing work, Phase 2 studies in adjunctive schizophrenia and potentially monotherapy schizophrenia will be initiated. Dose ranging in elderly patients is ongoing with Phase 2 studies planned in 2026 in patients with psychosis related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. Staying on the topic of Parkinson's Disease, positive top line results from the third Phase 3 trial for Tavapadon were recently announced. In the TEMPO-2 trial, Tavapadon met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a significant reduction in the severity of Parkinson's Disease symptoms compared with placebo at week 26. Key secondary endpoints were also achieved. We are very pleased with the emerging profile for Tavapadon, which shows strong efficacy as a monotherapy and as an add-on to Levo, Carbidopa. The six-month data from the Phase 3 studies show Tavapadon to be generally safe and well tolerated with low rates of adverse events of special interest, such as sedation and impulse control disorder. Longer term safety data will be available this year and regulatory submissions will then follow. Moving to aesthetics, we met with the FDA late last year regarding our BoNT/E submission for the treatment of glabellar lines. We are in the process of generating additional CMC data requested by the agency, which should be completed in the next few months. The regulatory submission will likely occur around the middle of the year. To summarize, there have been significant advancements across all stages of our pipeline. In 2025, we anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones, including many trial starts for key programs.

Starting with our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.16 which is $0.08 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.88 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $15.1 billion reflecting robust growth of 6.1% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.5% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Our ex-Humira platform delivered reported growth of 22%, once again exceeding our expectations. Adjusted gross margin was 83.8% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 15.1% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 23.6% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 34.7% of sales, which includes a 10.4% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $610 million. The adjusted tax rate was 20.2%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2025, our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $12.12 and $12.32. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect total net revenues of approximately $59 billion reflecting robust operational growth of 5.7% despite a roughly 4% net unfavorable impact across our portfolio from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on full-year sales growth. This revenue forecast contemplates the following approximate assumptions for select key products and therapeutic areas. We expect global immunology sales of $29.4 billion, including Skyrizi revenue of $15.9 billion reflecting growth of more than $4.1 billion driven by continued strong performance in psoriasis as well as robust uptake in IBD; Rinvoq sales of $7.9 billion reflecting growth of nearly $2 billion with continued market growth and share momentum across all approved indications. And Humira total revenue of $5.6 billion, including U.S. sales of $4 billion as more plans exclude branded Humira around the middle of the year. This forecast includes a $600 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign. In oncology, we expect global sales of $6.3 billion including IMBRUVICA revenue of $2.7 billion which reflects a $400 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign; Venclexta sales of $2.6 billion, reflecting continued strong demand, partially offset by a $100 million net unfavorable impact from Medicare Part D benefit redesign and Elahere revenue of $750 million. For Aesthetics, we expect global sales of $5.3 billion reflecting gradual improvement in market conditions across global markets as well as market share recovery in the U.S. This includes Botox Cosmetic revenue of $2.8 billion and relatively flat sales for Juvéderm. For neuroscience, we expect global sales of $10 billion reflecting continued double-digit growth. This includes Vraylar revenue of $3.5 billion reflecting continued strong prescription demand, partially offset by a $200 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign; Botox Therapeutics sales of $3.5 billion, total oral CGRP revenue of $2.1 billion and Vraylar sales of $300 million. For eye care, we expect global sales of $2.2 billion. Moving to the P&L for 2025, we are forecasting full-year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 14.5%, adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $13.2 billion and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 47% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2.6 billion which primarily reflects the annualized financing cost for the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.6%. Finally, we expect our share count to be roughly flat to 2024. Turning to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $12.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.6% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas. Immunology sales of $6.1 billion including Skyrizi sales of $3.2 billion and Rinvoq revenue of $1.6 billion, we expect U.S. Humira sales of $900 million. We also anticipate oncology revenue of $1.5 billion, aesthetic sales of $1.1 billion which includes an unfavorable one-time price adjustment due to the reimplementation of the original program, neuroscience revenue of $2.1 billion and eye care sales of $550 million. We are forecasting an operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales and model a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 13.8%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.47 and $2.51. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's robust business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was approximately $5.5 billion and we expect to generate free cash flow approaching $17 billion in 2025, which includes roughly $2.7 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments. This free cash flow will support a strong and growing quarterly dividend, which we have increased by 310% since inception, as well as debt repayment, where we expect to pay down nearly $3 billion of total debt this year and remain on track to achieve a net leverage ratio of 2x by the end of 2026. Our strong cash flow also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, we are pleased with AbbVie's results in 2024 and our financial outlook remains very strong. We have considerable momentum across our diverse portfolio and we continue to be well positioned to deliver robust growth in 2025 and beyond.

So, Skyrizi is up $3 billion. A billion of that is psoriatic and $2 billion is IBD. We're just seeing tremendous ramps early days with IBD. And then, for Rinvoq, it's up a billion from the previous guidance. And that's a mix of roughly $300 million rheum, $200 million derm, and $500 million IBD. So, again, across the board, we're seeing tremendous performance, particularly in IBD. And then, your question on how to think about the growth, we have obviously given guidance beyond '27. But as I look at the sell side consensus, clearly the growth that's in sell side consensus beyond '27 is below our expectations. We would expect to see these markets continue to grow. We would also expect to see continued share gains, albeit as you start getting close to that in place share level, the share curve bends, but you still expect to see some level of share growth. And then, keep in mind, we will have the five, we expect the five new indications for Rinvoq, collectively adding about $2 billion in peak sales and so that will also contribute. So, as I think about the rate of growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq beyond '27, Rinvoq will likely grow faster than Skyrizi because of those new indications, but you'll still see a robust performance from both assets, at least through '32.",247.0,111.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.009009009009009009,0.009009009009009009,0.0,0.0,0.018018018018018018

On your first question regarding Cerevel, so keep in mind, the accounting rules do not allow you to write up an intangible. So, even though we are more optimistic about Tavapadon now than we were at the time of the deal, we can't write that value up. So, that would be the same as what we originally ascribed. We still obviously, as Roopal walked you through the development programs for Emraclidine, still see opportunity in adjunctive schizophrenia as well as neuro degenerative psychosis. And we haven't completely given up on the monotherapy opportunity either, but that's a more heavily risk adjusted opportunity now. So, when you think about the value you have to take into account, the timing, so there's some level of time delay as well as a different probability of success for monotherapy. That's all baked into because you're essentially valuing risk adjusted revenues. You have to take that into account. That said, we're still optimistic about the asset. We're pursuing it in these indications. And again, as I mentioned, we haven't completely given up on monotherapy that will depend on dose ranging.

Carrie spoke about some of the market growth rates that we're seeing coming back in the U.S. for both fillers and toxins. So, we would -- if you model, you would anticipate '25 to be the trough. And then, our long-term guidance is that high-single-digit compound annual growth using '25 as the base year through '29. And if you model that, that's going to put you somewhere north of $7 billion. Certainly, this is a business we continue to be excited about. We think that there are continuing to be low market penetration rates globally, frankly, and we've got some innovation to continue to drive market growth.

And that's because there continue to be barriers for these people who are interested in the category, but not acting around cost and concerns of an unnatural look.

Now, when we think about that volume offset, we've not quantified that in the guidance, but that is part of the 4%. It's a, I would say, in the grand scheme, it's a fairly modest offset overall. And I think part of what you need to do when you think about that volume, recognize that when you look at the patient segments that exist, there's roughly three patient segments and they each take about a third of the business. But this is really something that will impact the standard eligible, and we're working very hard to ensure that people are electing cap and smooth.

And like we talked about before, particularly around the acute event, in this case, this was the CDF exclusion in April, we could clearly start to measure the fact that not all of the switching from Humira was going to the biosimilar. We saw about 20% of it was slipping away into new mechanisms or more advanced mechanisms like Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Now, we've continued to see the molecule compress. And it's just physicians are using just less and less sequentially Humira and the biosimilars over time. I would say it's becoming harder to measure because you're also seeing a lot of dynamics around new head-to-head trials, new indications, new other approaches. So, I would say overall, it's there, but it's relatively modest in the scheme of the volume that is basically accruing from basically the promotion and the profile of the medication. So, it should continue. The more that we see sort of disruption in the market, you'll probably continue to see the molecule on trend continue to compress. Now albeit modest, your other point's very important. These markets are still very, very buoyant and significant. And one of the dynamics that we see over time, and I think we'll begin to see it quite dramatically around the world, particularly in IBD, is that the lines of therapy start to expand. So, it used to be like primarily what was fueling the markets was primarily the new patients coming in off of older traditional medications. But now you're seeing the emergence in atopic dermatitis of the second and third line markets, which are growing quite substantially. You're going to see that significantly emerge in IBD, whereas before physicians were really, really afraid to move people along. So, they did dose intensification, they added more steroids. But now that there's drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq and other agents, you're seeing those market lines of therapy expand. And so, that should continue. And we've contemplated that in our long-term projections.

I think it's underappreciated. And part of it is the first category it will compete in, which is colorectal cancer. I mean, if you look at the response rate that we've seen, let's say, in a smaller or mid-size cancer type, which is ovarian cancer with Elahere, it's quite striking. I mean, Elahere has been the most rapidly adopted ADC in the entire U.S. oncology market. And it's because it entered this market that was basically almost all chemo-based with unmet need where there had been no innovation. And when we look at the entry with 400 or Temab-A into colorectal cancer, it's a substantially larger tumor type, as it's quite evident. And we've already seen very, very nice monotherapy results in later lines, much, much better than we've seen with the old chemo standard of care. And really, it's whether or not they have c-Met or not. Now, the thing that will really cause a big inflection that Roopal can talk about in a moment is that it's the combinability as you go up into the lines of therapies, okay? And that's really going to make this thing inflect and become a very, very significant product for patients in colorectal cancer over time. Now, the studies will have to bear that out. And as well, we're seeing very, very significant early results in lung cancer as well. So, it is, I think it's an underappreciated asset. We'll have a chance with Teliso-V to sort of set the market around this whole c-Met, the modern c-Met area. But it's quite striking. So, first, we establish in later lines, very big cancer directly against older chemotherapy. And then, we move combination as we move forward.

And I think 400 is a good highlight of that. So, we think about what's a good target, meaning high expression on the tumor, low expression in healthy tissue. And then, we are continuing to focus on patient selection, individualization of care, utilizing robust biomarkers, as Jeff mentioned, c-Met. That is the opportunity to optimize benefit-risk and particularly tolerability. With our Topo Warhead platform, we've seen low rates, for example, of alopecia, stomatitis, diarrhea, which others, I think, continue to struggle with. And safety and tolerability, as Jeff has mentioned, are critical. So, we're also very focused on proper dose optimization to get this right, so we're able to combine in earlier lines.

And thank you for acknowledging the strong track record we've had as a company. I would agree with that when you think about the transaction with BI that brought us Skyrizi, with Pharmacyclics that brought us Imbruvica, really gave us the critical mass to be a leader in blood cancers, and then the transaction with Allergan, which gave us three verticals that can really drive long-term growth for the company in neuroscience, aesthetics, and eye care. And then, more recently, the transaction with Immunogen, which really bolstered our ADC pipeline, as Roopal has highlighted. In terms of our go-forward strategy on BD, we continue to pursue assets that can add depth to our pipeline and really drive growth in the next decade. And we have a clear line of sight to growth for at least the next eight years within the company today. And so, my focus is really about bringing in assets that can help drive that growth in the next decade. And since the beginning of 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've signed more than 20 early-stage deals across immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. In immunology, we've added novel mechanisms that have the potential to raise standard care either as a monotherapy or in combination with Skyrizi and Rinvoq. You should expect that strategy to continue. In oncology, we've added new platforms, including multispecifics, trispecifics, T-cell engagers, and in situ CAR-T approaches. And then within neuroscience, it's not always appreciated the work we've been doing in neuroscience above and beyond cerebral. We expanded our discovery collaboration in psychiatry with Gedeon Richter, who discovered Vraylar. We also invested in a novel mechanism for mood disorders with Gilgamesh. And we recently acquired a next-generation A-beta antibody for Alzheimer's from Aliada. Again that is our area of focus. We have these five areas that can drive long-term growth. I mentioned neuroscientist aesthetics and eye care, and of course, immunology and oncology. I mean, these are all large markets with high unmet need. And so, our BD efforts are focused on building pipeline depth in those areas. Now, I should say if we see an opportunity for differentiation in another large market with high unmet need we would consider pursuing it, especially if it can help drive growth in the next decade.

A year ago, it was two percentage points. If there is a change, please, can you identify that? Related to that is my first question. Are you seeing any evidence that IRA Medicare pricing is spilling over to the commercial market? And if yes, to what degree, or is there absolutely none?

With Part D, we really -- we saw that as something that the analysts and maybe the marketplace hadn't fully understood the impact. I think we were one of the first companies to come out and talk with any sort of specificity and granularity around what we saw that Part D impact, mechanics of how it would work, and the impact to it. So, we came out with a guidance number, and I think that has probably, as you noted, the numbers, but it's evolved a little bit over time. I would say it's evolved not necessarily from our understanding of Part D, but because really the mix of the business. So, when we talk about it in the second quarter, I believe I came out and said we saw it would see an approximately 3% headwind to growth from the Part D redesign. We've distilled that number and made a precise number of 4%, roughly 4% today. And really, when you think about when I came out with that 3%, we've seen momentum in the business, and we've seen momentum in the business in areas, immunology and oncology in particular, where we reached some guidance, where we saw have high Part D channel mix. And so, that's really been a business mix change that has led to that 4% change, and that's really kind of what it's amounted to.",250.0,103.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.009708737864077669,0.04854368932038835,0.0,0.0,-0.009708737864077669

So, the underlying growth platform is going to drive $8 billion of growth when you think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as well as neuroscience.

So, as we've negotiated across the commercial books and the Medicare books, we have not seen any spillover or slippage in our actual negotiations over the last cycles. And one thing I would add is that we have seen in '24 some more consumption on the benefit redesign, particularly in our oncology agents. So, for Imbruvica and Venclexta, we actually see lower discontinuations and some more consumption. And so, that's encouraging, because if you remember that Part D sort of had the lead in where the cap moved down to roughly $33,000, $34,000, it'll sequentially move down more to $2,000 with the smoothing next year, which is a good policy, because it's encouraging to see that the change in benefit design makes people stay on their cancer medication a bit longer.

So, when we look at that guidance, that long-term guidance is calling for high single-digit CAGR '25 through '29, so using '25 as the base here. If you do the math on that range, that is something above $7 billion, a little bit north of $7 billion, depending on where it falls within that high single-digit range. So, that's why we've specifically given the range on the high single-digit. The market growth that we've seen historically has been low double-digits, but we're seeing that market we're modeling for now, high single-digit growth during the time period that we've given this long-term guidance.

I'll answer your first question around the obesity market and the aesthetics opportunity. And you're exactly right. It continues to be both a headwind and a tailwind, a headwind in terms of share of wallet as these consumers are making decisions on what they're going to spend for. We see that more for the higher-priced products like fillers. And then, also a tailwind as this gets a new group of consumers or patients interested in aesthetics, and many of our aesthetic providers are administering these products. And so, they see this as an opportunity for lead generation and bringing new patients into the category. So, we do see it as both a tailwind, a headwind in the short term, but a tailwind in the long term. And the question is not if injectables work. We know that these products work well in these patients. It's really about how we can partner with our customers to build it and integrate it into their treatment practice.

So, maybe a two-part question here; first, talk about the current maybe atopic derm growth dynamic, and is there an inflection sort of anticipated?

And to give you some sense of what we see in terms of the inflection. So, we have seen a significant inflection in our new patient capture. And this is despite the launch of other interleukin products over the last year. So, we've ramped to the highest in-place shares that we've had. And it was largely flat in the teens for mid-teens for many, many quarters. And it's ramping up now above 20%. And a lot of that is we've been able to start to distinguish Rinvoq on these stringent endpoints. Basically, like really minimal disease activity where you're taking itch down to a very, very low level. And you're almost completely clearing the skin. And those are the endpoints where we significantly outperform DUPI. Now, having said that, DUPI's still got the vast majority there, but we are seeing, we will see that in-place shares start to build into the TRXs over time, because our TRX share is quite below 20% at that point. I think the other thing that I'd note is that in many, or if not most, of the outside the U.S. markets, our shares are much higher and building even a little bit faster. So, in several large markets, we actually are ahead of Dupixent. And some of that has to do with the way that the label worked during our initial launch, et cetera. But we're quite bullish over time in terms of Rinvoq as this is the best agent in terms of getting to the complete control. Now, having said that, we would and we will continue to look for more assets. Some are in our pipeline as described. But this is a very, very attractive space that we want to continue to invest in.

Both those markets will continue to be important moving forward as will the rest of the world. We see Japan as posting nice growth as being an underdeveloped market that we're able to invest in. And then, the pipeline catalysts will be important in both U.S. and the rest of the world.

When you think about going beyond 2030 with your strategy across the portfolio, can you comment about the potential impact of some of these combination approaches in immunology? Do you expect these to be IP extending?

And then, just a question about a business segment that has been around that you never talk about, which is eye care, how and why does this fit going forward? I understand there's a legacy with the Allergan deal.

Maybe I'll start the ball rolling here on how we think about combos into '23 -- sorry in the 2030. So, the first thing is we have a very strong foundational asset in particularly IBD with Skyrizi. And you've heard me mention other combo studies in the psoriatic arthritis today as well. Now, that we would combine with the multiple assets that we've mentioned over time; TL1A, TREM-1, alpha 4 beta 7, IL-1 alpha beta, lutikizumab that we already have, that we would be able to look at as monotherapies and combo therapies. If they look good as monotherapies, they could also move forward by themselves. For all of these assets, we're also looking at biomarker approaches. Particularly with lutikizumab, but we would apply that same strategy to all of these assets. And as combinations, the goal would be co-formulations. So, as we enter into the clinical study, we're also doing CMC work in parallel to facilitate combination, co-formulation approaches. So, that would also be a convenience factor. And we would want to match with longer acting agents. So, for example, the TL1A we believe to be a longer acting agent. For TREM-1 we're seeing a long pharmacodynamic effect as an example. But then, the next way that we think about this, these combo strategies, is if we start seeing utility there, obviously moving forward with the co-formulation, but we are very competent in making bi-specifics. Lutikizumab is one of those. So, then in parallel we're making bi-specifics that could then also stand alone as single assets. And then, as you've heard recently with our Nimble transaction, we would also be looking at different mechanisms as an oral peptide. The lead one being IL-23, but we're also working on a TL1A. And what's unique and what we like about that platform is the potency, potentially being able to reduce the amount of peptide that's required and these assets having long half-lives. So, if that holds, then you could imagine combinations as a pill with these peptides with that type of profile that we hope to see. So, multiple steps as we think about immunology.",374.0,162.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.024691358024691357,0.0,0.030864197530864196,0.0,0.006172839506172839,0.024691358024691357

AbbVie is off to an excellent start to the year with first quarter results exceeding expectations across several of our therapeutic areas. We also continued to advance our promising internal pipeline and add external opportunities to further strengthen our business and long term outlook. Turning to our first quarter performance, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.46 which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were more than $13.3 billion nearly $550 million ahead of our expectations. I'm especially pleased with the performance of our ex-Humira platform, which delivered robust sales growth of more than 21%. Immunology, neuroscience, oncology, and anesthetics are all performing at or above our expectations. And we are well positioned to exceed our previous peak revenue in just the second full year following the US Humira LOE. Based on this strong performance, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 and now expect adjusted EPS between $12.09 and $12.29. As you are aware, there is speculation that sectoral tariffs could be forthcoming. Any related impact from these tariffs as well as other potential new or reciprocal tariffs have not been contemplated in our guidance. To the extent there is an impact, we believe it would be in line with our peers, given that AbbVie has an extensive manufacturing presence in the United States, including API, biologics, toxins and small molecules. And over the next decade, we anticipate investing more than $10 billion of capital in the US to support our volume growth and our expansion into new areas such as obesity. Turning back to our performance, I'm very pleased with the excellent progress we are making with several pipeline programs that have the potential to be meaningful sources of growth. These include Lutikizumab across several immunology indications, 383 in multiple myeloma and our next generation ADCs, including TmAb A for several solid tumor types and 706 for small cell lung cancer. We also continue to add depth to our pipeline with strategic transactions that can help drive growth in the next decade. This includes the recent acquisition of Nimble Therapeutics to expand our immunology portfolio with oral peptides as well as the license agreement with Gubra to develop an amylin analog for the treatment of obesity. Obesity represents a significant global health concern with high unmet need. This market will continue to evolve with improved offerings, and we believe our program with Gubra has the potential to deliver a differentiated asset. Going forward, we plan to invest further in obesity along with other opportunities across our existing five key growth areas. In summary, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we are well positioned for the long term. AbbVie has a clear runway to growth for at least the next eight years, including a high single digit revenue CAGR through 2029.

I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $6.2 billion exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are performing exceptionally well, contributing $5.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of more than 65%. I'm especially encouraged with our portfolio performance across IBD, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to capture significant share given their efficacy, safety and dosing profiles. In Crohn's disease, which is roughly two thirds of the overall IBD market, these two treatments together are capturing roughly one out of every two in play patients in the US and total prescription share is now in the mid-teens. Internationally, our Crohn's portfolio has achieved in-play leadership in nearly a dozen key countries. In ulcerative colitis, Skyrizi has already achieved the leading in-play share in the US following the launch in the second half of last year. Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are now capturing one out of every three in-play UC patients, a very strong leadership position for AbbVie. We are also seeing strong momentum across indications in dermatology and rheumatology as well. For Skyrizi, we continue to gain share in psoriatic disease, where we have achieved the leading in-play share of new and switching patients in nearly 30 countries and see substantial room for total share growth. For Rinvoq, we are seeing increasing prescription demand globally across each of the room indications as well as additional momentum in atopic dermatitis, the fastest growing immunology market, where we have two compelling head to head studies versus Dupixent. We are also preparing for the global launch of giant cell arteritis, another new source of growth for Rinvoq. We received European approval earlier this month and expect FDA approval soon. The addition of this indication further rounds out Rinvoq's rheumatology label and gives patients with GCA access to a new compelling oral therapeutic option. Overall, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating impressive results across all of their approved indications, and we will be raising our full year sales guidance for both products. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion down 49.5% on an operational basis, below our expectations, primarily due to faster share erosion from biosimilar competition as well as further molecule compression in the US. As a result, we will be lowering our full year sales guidance for US Humira. Moving to Oncology, where total revenues were $1.6 billion exceeding our expectations. Imbruvica global sales were $738 million down 11.9%, reflecting competitive dynamics in CLL. Venclexta global revenues were $665 million up 12.3% on an operational basis. This strong performance reflects continued momentum in CLL as well as shared leadership in frontline AML among patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. We also have an emerging commercial portfolio in solid tumors. This includes Elahere, our leading ADC for ovarian cancer with global sales of $179 million as well as Teliso-V, a potential new medicine for late line non-small cell lung cancer patients with US Regulatory approval and commercialization expected in the next couple of months. Teliso-V will be supported by a dedicated sales force and medical affairs team, which will target academic and community cancer treatment centers to reinforce the importance of c-Met as a biomarker and build relationships that support our emerging solid tumor franchise. Turning now to aesthetics, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion down 10.2% on an operational basis. This was in line with our expectations. BOTOX Cosmetic global revenues were $556 million down 10.7% on an operational basis and Juvederm sales were $231 million down 20% on an operational basis. As we have seen over the last several quarters, economic headwinds have continued to impact market conditions. Based on the trends we are seeing, including a decline in recent consumer sentiment, we are moderating our assumptions for category growth globally and adjusting our full year sales guidance for aesthetics accordingly. While near term aesthetics market conditions remain challenging, the long term prospects for the category remain attractive, given high consumer interest and low penetration rates for facial injectables. I'm particularly excited about BoNT/E, our fast acting, short duration toxin, which we recently submitted for US Regulatory review. This first in class toxin represents a distinctive innovation for the treatment of glabellar lines and has the potential to be an important catalyst for new patient activation into the facial aesthetics category. We anticipate commercialization next year. Moving now to neuroscience, where total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion up 17% on an operational basis, with all key products exceeding our expectations. VRAYLAR global sales were $765 million up 10.3%, reflecting share capture in both Bipolar I disorder and adjunctive major depression. We continue to get very positive feedback on VRAYLAR's profile in terms of dosing flexibility, low sedation and the ability to treat a full spectrum of symptoms. We are very competitively positioned with our migraine portfolio, where all three of our therapies continue to deliver double digit operational growth. BOTOX Therapeutic global revenues were $866 million, up 17%. UBRELVY global sales were $240 million up 18%. And QLIPTA global revenues were $193 million, up 48.3%. And in Parkinson's disease, VYALEV global sales were $63 million reflecting continued strong uptake in Japan and Europe. We are also pleased with the early launch feedback in the US, where revenues are expected to ramp gradually over the next couple of quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination. Lastly, we are making excellent progress with the development of Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease. This first in class D1D5 selective dopamine agonist has a favorable benefit risk profile and the potential to differentiate in several areas, such as sedation and impulse control. Tavapadon could potentially be used as a monotherapy for early Parkinson's disease as well as an adjunctive therapy to levodopa for more advanced patients, which would be a complementary addition to our existing PD portfolio with VYALEV and DUOPA. We expect to submit Tavapadon for regulatory review later this year with commercialization expected in 2026. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the execution and strong momentum across our commercial portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal for comments on our R&D highlights.",1028.0,557.0,28.0,4.0,9.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,12.0,0.05026929982046679,0.00718132854578097,0.01615798922800718,0.005385996409335727,0.003590664272890485,0.04308797127468582

We received European approval for Rinvoq in GCA and expect FDA approval soon. We remain on track for several important data readouts this year as well including Phase III data for Rinvoq in alopecia areata and vitiligo and data from Skyrizi's head to head study in psoriasis versus SOTIQ2 [ph]. Our early and mid-stage immunology pipeline continues to advance. Recent initiations include a Phase II study evaluating Skyrizi in combination with Lutikizumab in psoriatic arthritis and a Phase I study for our next generation TL1A antibody, which is designed to have less frequent dosing compared to other TL1As in development and will be evaluated in combination with Skyrizi in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This summer, we will start a Phase II study evaluating a combination of Lutikizumab and our anti CD40 Ravagalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. Moving to our ADCs and oncology, we anticipate accelerated approval in the second quarter for Teliso-V as a monotherapy in previously treated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with high c-Met expression. This is a segment of lung cancer with high unmet need and when approved, Teliso-V will be the first c-Met directed ADC for these patients. We're also making good progress with tmAb A, our next generation c-Met ADC, a Phase 2 dose optimization study evaluating tmAb A with a PD-1 inhibitor as a frontline combination therapy in EGFR wild type non-small cell lung cancer was recently initiated. In the EGFR mutant segment, we plan to initiate studies for tmAb A as a monotherapy in the second line setting and in combination with Osimertinib in the first line setting. Preliminary Phase 1 results will be presented at the upcoming ASCO meeting. This year, Phase 2 data from our CRC study evaluating tmAb A in combination with Bevacizumab will be available, which could enable a Phase 3 study in an all comers population. Progress also continues with ABBV-706 in small cell lung cancer. Recall, this ADC utilizes the same topo warhead and linker technology as tmAb A, but with an antibody that targets SEZ6. In the Phase 1 study, 706 was efficacious across doses with an objective response rate of approximately 60% in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer. Based on maturing duration of response and progression free survival data, we plan to advance 706 into a trial in a relapsed refractory population and a dose optimization study in combination with a PD-L1 in the frontline with the goal of establishing a chemo sparing regimen as a new standard of care. In the area of hematologic oncology, the data readout remains on track for the Phase 3 VENCLEXTA MDS trial. And if positive, our regulatory submissions would follow later in the year. A regulatory submission for PIVEC in BPDCN is also planned for this year. We continue to make good progress with our BCMA CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 in multiple myeloma. Recruitment is going well in the Phase 3 monotherapy study in later lines, and we are on track to be fully enrolled by early next year. Additionally, we continue to evaluate 383 in various combinations, including with Pomalyst, Revlimid, DARZALEX and Iverdemine [ph]. We'll begin seeing data from these combinations next year, which could enable Phase 3 lines of therapy. Now moving to neuroscience. Interim data from the long term TEMPO-4 Phase 3 study continued to support Tavapadon’s favorable benefit risk profile. Efficacy in both early and advanced Parkinson's patients was maintained beyond a year and the safety profile was consistent with that observed in the previous Phase III studies with no new safety concerns identified. Rates of adverse events of special interest remained low with impulse control disorder and peripheral edema less than 1%, dyskinesia approximately 2% and sedation less than 5%. These results underscored Tavapadon's potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with Parkinson's disease. Our regulatory application is planned for later in the year. Moving to other areas of our pipeline. In aesthetics, the regulatory application for our rapid onset short acting toxin BoNT/E was recently submitted. We also began the clinical program to evaluate co administration of BoNT/E and BOTOX, which has the potential to be co-formulated as a novel product, offering the combined benefits of rapid onset and Botox like duration. In obesity, our partner, Gubra recently announced positive interim results from the first part of a multiple ascending dose study for our long acting amylin analog ABBV-295. This initial phase of the study tested one and two milligrams dosed once weekly for six weeks in healthy, lean and overweight patients. The study showed 295 performed well, demonstrating a dose dependent mean weight loss compared to placebo and a tolerability profile consistent with the results from the single ascending dose study. Mean weight loss in the two milligram cohort, which had a mean BMI of 24 was 7.8% compared to a weight gain of 2% in the placebo arm on day 43. The second phase of this study is ongoing and is evaluating higher doses in overweight and obese patients with 12 week dosing. Titration and longer dosing intervals will also be assessed. Full data from this part of the study are expected next year. To summarize, significant progress continues with our pipeline and we look forward to important data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout 2025.

These results include a $0.13 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were more than $13.3 billion reflecting robust growth of 9.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin was 84.1% of sales. Adjusted R&D expense was 15.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 24.6% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.3% of sales, which includes a 1.9% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $627 million. The adjusted tax rate was 14.2%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.09 and $12.29. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $59.7 billion an increase of $700 million. This reflects an estimated 0.6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange on full year sales growth. This updated revenue forecast includes the following approximate assumptions for several of our key products. We now expect Skyrizi global revenues of $16.5 billion an increase of $600 million reflecting share gains in psoriasis and IBD. Rinvoq global sales of $8.2 billion, an increase of $300 million reflecting momentum across all approved indications. US Humira revenues of $3.5 billion a decrease of $500 million reflecting higher erosion from biosimilar competition as well as further molecule compression. BOTOX Therapeutic global sales of $3.6 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting growth in chronic migraine and other indications. Total oral CGRP revenues of $2.2 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting strong prescription demand. Imbruvica global revenues of $2.8 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting lower erosion. Venclexta global sales of $2.7 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting continued uptake in both CLL and AML across our key countries. And for aesthetics, we now expect global sales of $5.1 billion as we are moderating our assumptions for market growth globally. As a result, total sales guidance for BOTOX and Juvederm will each be lower by roughly $100 million. Moving to the P&L for 2025, we continue to forecast full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $13.2 billion. We now expect adjusted R&D expense of approximately $8.9 billion reflecting additional investment in our robust pipeline for long term growth. We also now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5% of sales, in line with our previous expectations after including the 0.4% unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&D expense incurred through the first quarter. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $15 billion. This reflects an estimated 0.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange on full year sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 49.5%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.26 and $3.30 This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Our guidance is based on current trade rules and does not reflect the impact of any additional trade policy shifts, including pharmaceutical sector tariffs. While it's difficult to quantify in the absence of actual policy details, it's worth noting any related unfavorability in 2025 would reflect a partial year given the timeline for 232 investigation. We are actively preparing for a number of potential scenarios and would expect to put into place mitigation strategies as we have more information. Relative to these dynamics, I would also highlight that AbbVie has a significant US manufacturing presence that spans 11 sites with plans to add four new manufacturing plants to our network, expanding our production for API, drug product, peptides and devices in the United States. As we continue to invest and grow our US operational footprint, we believe a more competitive tax policy building on what was accomplished through 2017 tax reform will encourage a sustainable shift towards US Manufacturing over the long term. In closing, I'm very pleased with the excellent start to the year. We are demonstrating strong momentum across the portfolio and continue to be well positioned to deliver robust growth in 2025 and beyond.

I'll start with kind of where we saw the increase attribute to for the various indications and I'll turn to Jeff for your other questions. So we raised Skyrizi by $600 million to $16.5 billion and that split between $200 million in psoriatic and $400 million in IBD indications. And then with respect to Rinvoq, we raised that $300 million and that's across all of the approved indications.

We're obviously very, very pleased with the performance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq in immunology as you've seen from the report. Maybe to give some perspective, it's not uncommon to start to see in class competition. We've seen that in psoriasis. We've seen that across the board. And maybe I'll just give a little bit of perspective over sort of the historical dynamics that we've seen with the IL-23 category. So for example, if you go back to like 2018, 2019 when the IL-23s were starting to come in psoriasis, the total patient share at that time in the early days was about 7% of the IL-23 class. Now it's over 60%. And if we look at where IBD is, obviously, we launched first with Skyrizi and Crohn's and everything's recently launching here in UC, it's about 7% of the total patient share in IBD. So you can imagine as we start to watch what this category is going to mean to transform IBD, we remain very confident. It's not a zero sum game. We feel very confident in our profile and what we're able to deliver if we look across UC, if we look across our head to head data versus sequence versus the other trials. And so net net, we see very, very strong momentum across the board, regardless of competitors that may come in. And then my thoughts on the Humira tail. Again, as I highlighted and Scott highlighted in his remarks, we are seeing a bit of faster erosions as the biosimilar start to play out. And this is, of course, the third year of the biosimilar event. So it's really not too surprising. We also do continue to see the molecule continue to erode. So as we look and we don't have full visibility and we'll be monitoring the 26 access as we go throughout the year. We do expect it to step down again. Just makes sense. That will be the fourth full year. So we'll have deeper visibility of that tail sometime over the course of the year. But as we said before, the real impact of the tail is when Humira does not have a meaningful headwind to our overall growth as a corporation. So we expect that to start to develop over that ’26 time period.

And the second question I had is on the amylin program there.

So just to, I think, back up and maybe talk about AbbVie's manufacturing network and then I can mention how we're thinking about potential mitigation. I think it's important to know that we have a broad footprint that allows us to assure supply for our patients around the world. And that's really why you've been able to see us avoid supply disruptions during events like the COVID pandemic. I mean and today, we have a robust US manufacturing network with more than 6,000 American workers across 11 sites. As I mentioned in my remarks, that includes manufacturing of API, biologics, toxins and small molecules. For example, our largest product Skyrizi is made in the US for the domestic market. And given our expected volume growth and our expansion into areas like obesity, as I mentioned, we'll continue increasing our US footprint with over $10 billion in planned capital investment during the next decade. In terms of potential mitigation, in the near term, we could take inventory management actions or secure alternate sources of API. We could also look at cost efficiencies and productivity initiatives as a source of mitigation, which we always do. I think what's more challenging is trying to pass the tariff impacts to our customers, especially with penalties in the government channel and with existing contracts in the commercial setting. So I don't see that as a viable source for mitigation. Longer term, we will add more US manufacturing capacity, which is part of the planned capital investment of over $10 billion. So specific to 2025, we would look to mitigate the impact as much as possible with a combination of supply chain actions, cost efficiencies and any additional overperformance from our growth platform. But in the meantime, we have enough confidence in the momentum of our business to raise our guidance this year, which should be viewed as a positive.",336.0,168.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.02976190476190476,0.02976190476190476,0.023809523809523808,0.005952380952380952,0.0,0.0

IP has been looked at as kind of a proxy as to what that impact might be. And certainly directionally, think that is something that would be somewhat telling. That said, when we look at our profile overall, Rob mentioned the strong US presence that we have, but we don't see our profile suggesting any sort of outsized impact for us as a company. The tax rate is something that you can look at, which is essentially when you think of the bookends of the minimum tax for earnings outside the US for tax earned in or income earned in the US that really kind of aligns with where that IP is structured. And that blending of your income kind of produces generally directionally your tax rate. You see us being relatively in line with our peers. And so that suggests that we have a similar IP profile from an overall perspective. I'd also just quickly point out that sometimes with Allergan, as that was a company that we redomiciled back to the US, it was a foreign headquarter company. Recall that Allergan was a series of several companies that were put together over a few years. And those companies all have a significant US presence as well. So Allergan's profile is not dissimilar from ours as a whole either. So I think when you think about that IP profile, it's important from a tariff perspective. It's also very important from a tax reform perspective. There was a lot of progress made in leveling the playing field for US companies in 2017 tax reform that did a lot of good things and really helped invest in the US as well as can create a competitive environment for our companies. We see it as an important piece of building upon that tax reform to encourage further and long term, as I mentioned in my remarks, sustainable investment. So I see a tax reform initiative building on 2017 coupled with tariffs as something that will encourage US manufacturing over the long term, we feel very good about our profile right now.",377.0,170.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.023529411764705882,0.0058823529411764705,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.0,0.01764705882352941

Currently, what the data you've seen were at 1 mg and 2 mg and we have the opportunity here in this study to go several fold higher than the 2 milligrams. And we also have the opportunity to go beyond six weeks, namely around 12 weeks before we get into formal Phase 2b, which I would say around next year, we would go quite a bit longer. The sample size, what you've seen here maybe a little bit larger because of the multiple ascending dose format here. We'll see larger sample sizes once we get into the formal Phase 2b. The other opportunities here are also to look at titration at the 1 milligram or maybe even lower. We don't see any adverse events beyond suppression of appetite. So there's an opportunity to be able to start low and start titrating up to doses quite a bit higher than 2 milligrams, but we're open to watch this study and be flexible. The other important findings would be around muscle and bone. So those would be other things that will be evaluated as well as looking at dosing. The half-life is around 270 hours. So that could give us an opportunity to go twice a month and even potentially monthly. So all that will be captured in this data set.

I think as we've studied the environment, I mean, we are very supportive of a balanced approach that addresses affordability while also encouraging innovation. And you've seen many of our peers reinforcing the importance for the EU to properly value innovation, which we echo and would support any policies that encourage that outcome. That said, we hope the administration contemplates the harm that international reference pricing could have on US healthcare industry and future innovation. I think anything like price controls, cost increases or higher taxes just leaves less investment available across the industry to advance new innovative medicines. That said, I'm very encouraged by the administration's willingness to address the pill penalty in the IRA and is fixing that would support long term innovation in our industry. And so as we look at the push, I think, for the EU to more properly value the innovation is an absolute appropriate push. We're encouraged by some of the policies that really support innovation. And Scott also talked about tax reform. And I think that's an important lever as well as we think about what are the things that will drive investment in the US and drive more innovation. And I think if you just look at AbbVie as an example, we've invested over $5 billion of capital since tax reform in 2017. I mean that includes a new oncology research center in South San Francisco that includes Skyrizi manufacturing capabilities in the US, eye care capacity expansion in Waco, Texas and technology infrastructure upgrades across our footprint, just to name a few. And importantly, as Scott mentioned, tax reform allowed us to acquire Allergan, an Irish domiciled company that we then redomiciled into the US. I mean that transaction enabled AbbVie to continue increasing our R&D investment through the Humira LOE, which is unprecedented. That will ultimately help us really lead to more innovation in our pipeline and ultimately impact patients of the future. So when we think about policy, we think tax reform has provided the right incentives to invest more in the US and more in innovation.

Obviously, we're super pleased with the recent filing on BoNT/E. And as we've highlighted before, the short acting toxin will operate on two different levels for us. First, it will stimulate the funnel. It will basically be a market stimulator because we know there's lots of considerors in the marketplace that are just worried about going to a full strength toxin because it lasts for three to four months. So the approachability of a short acting toxin that works in about 8.5 hours and is gone in 2.5 weeks makes the market much more approachable for the people in the consideration phase. So we think it's going to work on the market and our share, because obviously we've done studies with BOTOX after BoNT/E. Now in the combination use, Carter, it's very interesting. This is more of a pure sort of share play. When we talk to the consumers, many of the consumers are using a lot of BOTOX and you start saying, can you imagine a BOTOX that works almost immediately, so an immediate acting BOTOX. That gives us the potential and we'll have to see how those trials and those studies play out to actually restate the whole market. Because what's remarkable about BoNT/E is that we can see a two grade change in the glabellar lines in 8.5 hours. So nothing has ever worked even close to that fast. So we could even have a premium toxin that sits alongside BOTOX one day or a replacement product for just simply a better BOTOX, an immediate acting BOTOX.

And what about '26 and '27? And then the second question is just on the back of the BoNT/E question. Can you give us a little bit of context as to the pricing strategy for that kind of tester market?

Look, absent policy details, we're not going to get into speculating on the impact. I think you've known us to be a company that once we have a full understanding, we're very transparent and detailed. If you think about how we approach the Part D benefit redesign, as soon as we understood that impact, we were well in advance of the implementation of that discussing the impact on the company.

And I think we're thinking about it quite broadly. So as you stated, there's an opportunity here as a monotherapy. I think the way we think about it is tolerability is key. We see a number of dropouts, upwards of 30% even after a month of starting with the current set of assets. And then when we look over the course of the year, 60% to 70% of the patients will drop. Now there's a variety of factors that drive that discontinuation, but a key component is tolerability. So to have a monotherapy that's tolerable, that provides meaningful weight loss and potentially has other potential benefits. We've seen pre clinically preservation of muscle. We'll have to see if that plays out. But that could be another benefit in the long term. When this launches, we do anticipate many of the patients will have already been on assays that are available today. So it could serve as a nice follow on for folks that couldn't tolerate or came off for other reasons and want to go somewhere else. Now in terms of combinations, recall, when we did this deal, one thing we liked about it, was also the neutral pH of the formulation. So that could enable combinations with a variety of mechanisms.

In terms of the recent data, it's difficult for us to comment. I think that will be a discussion between the company and health authorities regarding the utility of a failed study. That would be their discussion to have. How we look at emraclidine is that we do still see potential and we want to approach this in a stepwise manner. The first step would be to look to see if we can further dose escalate beyond what was previously studied. We saw variable PK levels in those patients from the pivotal studies, some were low and we think there's an opportunity to raise that. So a multiple ascending dose study will be initiated this year and that would apply to potentially monotherapy in schizophrenia as well as the adjunctive setting. So as that data rolls out and if we're able to utilize a higher dose, then we would again stepwise go forward into a Phase 2 setting to further derisk and apply our learnings in terms of trial design. And then if we see strong data there, which could be as a monotherapy, could be as an adjunct and also in neurodegeneration psychosis, then we would move into the Phase 3 setting.

As I mentioned in my remarks earlier, obviously, AbbVie, we have a very broad footprint. An important part of the strategy is to assure supply. And as I mentioned earlier, we went through a global pandemic without any supply disruptions and that strategy certainly paid off. We also have, I'd say, a very robust manufacturing network in the US I think what's been widely misunderstood is Skyrizi as an example, our largest product is made in the US and so when we look at our global footprint, we consider assurance of supply. As Scott mentioned earlier, clearly, obviously, tax has an influence on longer term, how you'd want to structure your supply chain. So certainly, I think with a more competitive tax policy, that sort of provide the appropriate incentives. We try to say we have obviously been ramping our volume considerably. You look at just the performance, just then think about biologics capacity and just the tremendous ramps we've seen for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And so we stay ahead of the curve. We ensure that we are investing appropriately so we can keep up with that demand. I'd say the commercial team puts a lot of pressure on operations because they're performing so well, but operations stays ahead of the curve and invest appropriately. And so when we look at the investment, when I mentioned the greater than 10 billion investment, that takes into account in the US, that takes into account our volume growth that we expect in addition to new areas that we will invest. For example, peptide manufacturing as an example, as we enter that space, obviously now as we enter into obesity, it makes sense to add that capability.

And I'll focus on our two big markets, the US and China. So as I mentioned, we were right on our guidance, right on our forecast for the first quarter. Remember, biggest impact there was the price because we reversed the Alley [ph] redesign from last year. And so when we looked at basically what happened from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, we know we took a market share hit in toxins in that fourth quarter. The good news is we've seen a complete reengagement in the basically the old Alley program with all of our accounts. So things are quite stable. And we actually had a one market share point gain back from where we were. Now we still have to gain some more share over the course of the year to come back to where we were pre the change to Alley. So we have lost year-over-year some share in toxins. In the US in filler, our share is very, very stable. We did not see a significant share impact on the filler side of the business. It's just been sort of a double digit market pressure there. Now in China, I'm quite pleased with the share performance. We've recently had a couple of significant approvals sequentially. We have the masseter approval for BOTOX, which is sort of in the lower face and jawline and also VOLUX, which is in Juvederm. So we've actually seen significant positive momentum in BOTOX share in China as well as positive share in filler. So it's a little variable across the board.

The team has applied machine learning, to these data sets, spatial omics, a variety of different techniques. And the ones that we like are one, the alpha-4 beta-7. We think that could be a good combination. We like Lutikizumab, which is a bispecific to anti IL-1 alpha and importantly, IL-1 beta. We see that overexpression in patients with IBD that have failed other advanced therapies. We see something similar for TREM1, which would be another potential combination. And then we as I mentioned, we also have a longer acting an agent designed to be longer acting TL1A that could also be a very good fit with IL-23 like Skyrizi.

We think these combination studies are a way to accomplish that. But we're going to use that time to and just as we did with Humira, we came up with Skyrizi and Rinvoq as a way to elevate the standard of care And that really launched into a second chapter of the company.

If you look at the first quarter, those were both driven by strong demand. Now we've talked about pricing being slightly negative for those two products on a full year basis. We did see a little bit of favorable price in the quarter and that's just a gating issue. So in the quarter, probably two things. One, Jess organization continues to do a very good job of focusing on co pay utilization and effectively managing that. So we saw a little bit of benefit from co pay utilization. And then in addition, we had anticipated some channel mix changes later in the year, but those actually came to fruition a little bit earlier than we thought. And so those factors, I would say, along with some gating issues combined to being price favorability, but we still anticipate negative pricing headwinds on a full year basis. With respect to Humira, we talked about in the quarter and on the full year that there is a decrease in volume associated with share erosion as well as the compression of the overall molecule. So that volume is going to continue. I think you'll see that volume a little bit more pronounced throughout the year, but there certainly continues to be some price.

And so to the extent that that improves the dynamic on patient affordability that that is truly realized in their pockets, that's favorable. So we are supportive of the efforts there. But it's really all about making sure that we're addressing patient affordability. As it relates to business development, we obviously really like the five key growth areas that we have today. As I mentioned, those will certainly drive very strong growth for at least the next eight years. I think sometimes there's a misconception about neuroscience for AbbVie. It's more than just psychiatry. We have a very strong migraine franchise that's performing exceptionally well. In Parkinson's, we're seeing great results. And we've been in Parkinson's for a long time with Duopa. But as you think about the ramps we're seeing with BioLev, the innovation we've brought for those patients and then Tavapadon, came from Cerevel, we could really start to see our Parkinson's franchise emerge. And so when I think about neuroscience, I would think about it really in four segments. There's psychiatry, it's an important segment. There's migraine, there's Parkinson's and there's all of the neurodegeneration. And we obviously are investing in Alzheimer's. And so you just look at the business development activity since the beginning of last year in neuroscience, extended our discovery collaboration in psychiatry with Gedeon Richter, who discovered Vraylar. We added a novel mechanism for mood disorders with Gilgamesh. We acquired a next generation A beta antibody that's very promising for Alzheimer's from Aliada. And we're also investing in novel approaches for migraine disease. So we are actively investing in neuroscience. We obviously added obesity because we do think of ourselves as being a company that's going be very large in the next decade. So it doesn't hurt to have another source of growth. And we have evaluated various options beyond the five and we chose to move into obesity for a number of reasons. It's obviously an extremely attractive market, has high prevalence and plenty of headroom for growth. It's a market that has ample space for multiple players and new entrants. And I think we're also uniquely positioned with our aesthetics business to access that channel in addition to therapeutics. And importantly, and it's something we always focus on is where are there high areas of unmet need. As we think about our portfolio, that's really our strategy is to drive a remarkable impact for our patients by elevating standard of care. When we look at obesity, there's plenty of opportunity, whether it's reducing GI side effects, improving body composition, more consistent weight loss across patient types, longer lasting weight loss. And so as we evaluate that opportunity, we found the amylin class to be very attractive given it's the most validated non-GLP-1 mechanism for obesity and has very encouraging early data. And we believe the amylin opportunity with Gubra has the potential to deliver a differentiated asset. So we will continue investing in obesity. We'll continue investing in our five key growth areas.

I know you'll say it shouldn't happen, but that doesn't mean that it will potentially happen. But then on obesity, as you noted, your amylin is long acting.

I think you're right. We're very supportive of the First Amendment rights to be able to advertise. And obviously, we work with the FDA on every single claim that we make on television. And if there were to be a change, we would be able to pivot. I mean, we could shift our investment to disease awareness that could help us drive because we have such leading in-play share to continue to basically invest in the right way to consumers. We certainly could move to other channels because it's not really clear if it would just be mass media or etc. So certainly, the whole market would take a step back if that were to happen and our brands would still be very, very competitive in terms of our ability to pivot and toggle were that to happen.

So first, just very quickly, you did touch on the pricing dynamics with Skyrizi and Rinvoq. But did the strong performance include any notable onetime contributions, inventory build or pull forward effects? And then second, similar to Vamil's aesthetics question, but China reciprocal tariffs have been enacted. Is that contemplated in your guide? And is that material to your aesthetics business? And then just I know it's early days, but are you seeing any shifts in demand there?",88.0,38.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.02631578947368421

The one thing that also helped the growth in the quarter was with respect to the retailer destocking. So in the past, we've talked about there's some retail inventory buildup as a form of price speculation in the fourth quarter. I talked about in the fourth quarter call that we didn't see a lot of that. And then that was again confirmed, we did not see there was no unwind like there has been in prior year. So there was a year-over-year benefit from the lack of destocking from the retail buildup in the first quarter. But again, that was fairly modest. When we talk about our overall growth globally, 72% operationally, the demand was really in the 60s. And so you just saw a small portion from that retail destocking. With respect to the China tariff, yes, you're right. There is some impact for aesthetics in those products in those numbers. But again, that impact is fairly modest. We've contemplated that in our guidance. And so I would say overall, the existing tariffs, you're talking about $30 million approximately globally and a decent component of that is with respect to the aesthetics business. And then maybe, I don't know if Jeff would like to comment on, I think you'd ask if there's if we've seen demand changes in China?",253.0,106.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.009433962264150943,0.009433962264150943,0.02830188679245283,0.0,0.0,0.0

And we communicated certainly that it could continue to exceed expectations. So it's quite remarkable. We continue to see strong uptake in Japan, across Europe. And while we're only in the commercial market, which is about 30% of the market in the US, because we're still waiting on the full Medicare reimbursement, the market feedback is exceptional. I mean this is a really amazing product to help patients sleep through the night, control the movement disorders. It's unlike Duopa, it lasts for 24 hours. It's a more simple subcu injection versus surgery that you might get. So it's playing out exactly as we had hoped. And so you're just seeing some strength of that in the quarter. And that's also why we remarked that we're excited to bring Tavapadon, which is also showing some very nice data here and we're getting ready for the file to start to really build out a more meaningful Parkinson's category. And then Elahere, we continue to see nice uptake, very unique product. Obviously, it's got a 30% approval in overall survival. It's well tolerated non-chemo. So the US business continues to perform very well. And we are starting to see the international launches. We've pulled forward significant international launches from the time that we had done the deal with ImmunoGen, and we're going to start to see those international launches ramp here over the next several quarters.

AbbVie delivered another outstanding quarter with results exceeding our expectations. We are making excellent progress advancing our pipeline and adding more depth through strategic transactions that support our long-term growth. Turning to our second quarter performance. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.97, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $15.4 billion, more than $400 million ahead of our expectations. This overachievement includes sales growth of 22% from our ex-HUMIRA platform with continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are now on pace to deliver more than $25 billion in combined sales this year, well above our initial expectations. We also delivered strong double-digit growth from neuroscience, driven by Vraylar, Vyalev and our leading migraine portfolio. Based on our momentum through the first half of the year, we are raising guidance for the second time. We now expect full year revenue of $60.5 billion, an increase of $800 million. We have now raised our revenue guidance by $1.5 billion since the start of the year. We are also raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.21 and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.88 and $12.08. In addition to our strong financial results, we are making great progress with our R&D pipeline across all stages of development. Notable highlights from our late-stage programs include the recent approvals of EMRELIS for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and Rinvoq for GCA. The regulatory submission of TrenibotE, a first-in-class short-acting toxin in aesthetics as well as highly differentiated Phase III results in alopecia areata, a potential tenth indication for Rinvoq in the U.S. We are also focused on augmenting our pipeline with therapies and platform technologies that have the potential to elevate the standard of care for patients. These include promising early-stage programs that have the potential to drive growth for AbbVie in the next decade. We have executed more than 30 business development transactions since the beginning of last year. Our recent activity includes closing the agreement with Gubra for a long-acting amylin analog in the treatment of obesity as well as announcing our planned acquisition of Capstan Therapeutics, giving us an in vivo CAR-T platform that can further strengthen our immunology pipeline. We also in-licensed ISB-2001, a novel trispecific antibody for multiple myeloma, and we announced the collaboration with ADARx to develop next-generation siRNA therapies across multiple disease areas, including immunology, neuroscience and oncology. In summary, I'm very pleased with the performance of our business and the progress we are making against our long-term strategy. AbbVie's outlook is strong, and we are well positioned to deliver on our commitments in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.

I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $7.6 billion. Skyrizi continues to demonstrate impressive growth. Global sales were $4.4 billion, up 61.8% on an operational basis. We continue to capture robust in-play patient share in psoriatic disease. In the U.S., this includes clear leadership in psoriasis across all lines of therapy versus both biologics and oral agents as well as continued strong performance in the PSA derm setting with frontline in-play share leadership more than double the next closest biologic oral therapy. Globally, Skyrizi continues to grow and achieve total psoriatic disease market leadership in numerous major markets around the world. I'm also very pleased with Skyrizi's performance in IBD, where we are on track to double our sales this year. In the U.S., we continue to capture more than 1/3 of new or switching patients in Crohn's disease and nearly 20% of new or switching patients in ulcerative colitis. As we look ahead, we feel very confident in Skyrizi's profile, including compelling efficacy, safety and dosing and our very robust head-to-head program, where we have demonstrated superiority and clear differentiation against multiple novel therapies sets a high bar for comparison. So as we do compare our current dynamic share to total prescription share, it's clear there is still a substantial opportunity for continued total share gain across all of Skyrizi's indications over time, especially in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which are still earlier in their launch trajectory. Turning now to Rinvoq, which is also demonstrating outstanding growth. Global sales were $2 billion, up 41.2% on an operational basis as we continue to see nice momentum across all of Rinvoq's indications. Uptake in IBD continues to be very strong. In the U.S., Rinvoq's in-play patient share across all lines of therapy for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is second only to Skyrizi among branded medicines. So as a portfolio, Rinvoq and Skyrizi together are capturing 1 out of every 2 in-play Crohn's disease patients and 1 out of every 3 in-play UC patients in the U.S., a very strong combined leadership position in gastroenterology for AbbVie. I'd also highlight that we are making excellent progress with Rinvoq's global launch in giant cell arteritis, our sixth indication in rheumatology. Initial prescription trends as well as feedback from rheumatologists has been positive, with access in the U.S. expected to ramp quickly over the rest of the year. Finally, we announced impressive Phase III results in alopecia areata, a chronic autoimmune disease leading to unpredictable hair loss with nearly 2 million diagnosed patients globally. alopecia areata as well as the next wave of diseases, including vitiligo, HS and lupus, would expand Rinvoq's treatment in both dermatology and rheumatology, areas where we already have very strong call points with Rinvoq's core indications. Turning now to HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of more than $1.1 billion, down 58.2% on an operational basis, reflecting biosimilar competition. We anticipate HUMIRA access in the U.S. will continue to decrease throughout the second half of this year as more plans select exclusionary formularies for existing patients. Moving to oncology, which delivered total revenues of nearly $1.7 billion. IMBRUVICA global sales were $754 million, down 9.5%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL, partially offset by higher persistency rates for existing patients. Venclexta global revenues were $691 million, up 8.3% on an operational basis. This reflects strong demand in CLL with combination use of Venclexta plus BTK inhibitors emerging as a preferred fixed duration treatment. We are also seeing nice momentum from ELAHERE and EPKINLY with both delivering double-digit revenue growth. And we are early in the U.S. launch of EMRELIS, our newest ADC for previously treated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. This commercialization will help to establish c-MET expression as a valid biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer and also build AbbVie's presence more broadly in solid tumors, where we have several promising next-generation ADCs in development, including Temab-A, which shares the same c-MET target. Turning now to aesthetics, which delivered global sales of nearly $1.3 billion, down 8% on an operational basis. BOTOX Cosmetic global revenues were $692 million and JUVÉDERM global sales were $260 million, with growth rates for both products down on an operational basis. Consistent with the past few quarters, economic challenges and lower overall consumer sentiment have impacted the aesthetics market, which continues to perform below historical levels. As noted on the first quarter call, we moderated our assumptions for near-term category growth globally, which is tracking largely in line with our expectations. From a competitive perspective, our facial injectable portfolio remains the clear leader with strong market shares globally. Our progress with the Alle loyalty program is going well, and we have robust plans underway to support patient activation. This includes a new BOTOX consumer campaign in the U.S. with ramping second half investment. continued injector training globally and bringing new products to market like TrenibotE, our fast-acting short-duration toxin with commercialization expected next year. So as economic conditions improve from current levels, we remain very well positioned for growth over the long term in the aesthetics category. Moving now to neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, where we continue to demonstrate robust growth. Total revenues were approximately $2.7 billion, up 24% on an operational basis. This exceptional performance is driven by continued double-digit operational growth of Vraylar with global sales of $900 million, up 16.3% BOTOX Therapeutic with global revenues of $928 million, up 14.2% Ubrelvy with global sales of $338 million, up 47.2% and QULIPTA with global revenues of $267 million, up 76.9%. Importantly, we recently announced positive results from the head-to-head TEMPLE study comparing QULIPTA to topiramate for migraine prevention. TEMPLE demonstrated that QULIPTA had fewer treatment discontinuations attributed to adverse events as well as a significant reduction in migraine days versus topiramate. Given the high use of topiramate as a frontline treatment for migraine prevention, we anticipate these strong results will support earlier adoption of QULIPTA. Moving to Parkinson's disease. I'm very pleased with the performance of VYALEV, where the global launch is off to an excellent start. Total sales were $98 million, up 56% on a sequential basis. Feedback from movement disorder specialists has been overwhelmingly positive with uptake across the international markets exceeding our expectations. Looking forward, we believe our emerging Parkinson's disease portfolio with VYALEV, Duodopa and tavapadon forthcoming has the collective potential to be a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the long term. So overall, I'm very pleased with the execution and continued strong performance across our commercial portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal for comments on our R&D highlights.

Starting with immunology, where we continue to make meaningful progress advancing our pipeline with several regulatory and clinical milestones since the last earnings call. FDA approval was granted for Rinvoq in GCA, representing our sixth rheumatology indication. Additionally, top line data from the first Phase III Rinvoq alopecia areata trial were just announced. In the study, Rinvoq met the primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in hair regrowth across both Rinvoq doses compared to placebo. Baseline scalp coverage prior to treatment was approximately 16%. In the Rinvoq 30-milligram group, 54% of patients reached 80% or more scalp hair coverage and 47% reached 90% or more coverage at 24 weeks. A robust effect was also demonstrated with Rinvoq 15 milligrams. These are truly transformative results and compare very favorably to the efficacy shown in pivotal trials for other JAK inhibitors. The placebo-adjusted SALT 20 and 10 scores for Rinvoq 30 milligrams were approximately 20 percentage points above the rates for the highest approved doses of other JAK inhibitors. For the Rinvoq 15-milligram group, rates were approximately 10 points above. We are very pleased with these results, which certainly surpassed our expectations. Results from a second Phase III alopecia areata study are anticipated in the third quarter, followed by regulatory submission starting later this year. The vitiligo program for Rinvoq is also nearing completion with top line results from Phase III studies expected later this year. External innovation has supported expansion of our growing immunology pipeline. We recently announced plans to acquire Capstan. Their novel platform allows for in vivo programming of cells through mRNA delivery using targeted lipid nanoparticles. Capstan's lead asset currently in Phase I generates CD19-specific CD8-positive in vivo CAR T cells. The CAR T cells are designed to achieve rapid and deep B-cell depletion without the need for lymphoablating chemotherapy while also avoiding other challenges associated with conventional ex vivo CAR-Ts. This innovative approach has the potential to become a transformative new treatment modality to reset the immune system and provide deep, durable drug-free remission for patients with autoimmune disease. Capstan's technology is a strong strategic fit for our early immunology efforts, where we have a number of internal assets designed to reset the immune system via depletion of pathogenic cells with the goal of delivering functional cures. We plan to advance several assets that deplete B cells into the clinic, each with a different target or modality. These include 2 anti-CD19 monoclonal antibodies that activate cell-mediated cytotoxicity, one with and the other without a payload, etentamig, our BCMA CD3 bispecific T cell engager and ISB-2001, a BCMA CD38, CD3 trispecific T cell engager that is part of our recently announced agreement with IGI Therapeutics. An interim analysis was recently completed on our monotherapy trial evaluating Lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis. Lutikizumab showed numerically higher efficacy for the primary endpoint of endoscopic improvement compared to HUMIRA, which was the control arm. However, the results were not sufficiently differentiated for us to pursue it as a monotherapy in this population. We believe there is still opportunity to drive incremental efficacy as a combination therapy in Crohn's disease, where Lutikizumab is being evaluated in combination with Skyrizi. Lutikizumab is one of several assets being studied and results from our Crohn's combination platform study will begin to read out next year. Lutikizumab has the potential to drive efficacy across other autoimmune diseases. It has demonstrated strong efficacy in hidradenitis suppurativa, where Phase III is ongoing with data expected in 2027. Additional studies are underway evaluating monotherapy or combination approaches in psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Moving to oncology. EMRELIS received accelerated approval from the FDA as a monotherapy in previously treated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with high c-Met expression. This is an important new treatment option for patients with this challenging disease. At the recent ASCO meeting, we presented encouraging data for several novel ADCs in our oncology pipeline, including preliminary data from a Phase I dose expansion study evaluating Temab-A, our next-generation c-Met ADC in patients with EGFR-mutated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Temab-A demonstrated high and durable responses across c-MET expression levels with an objective response rate of 63% and median duration of response of 9.8 months. Based on these results, we plan to initiate additional studies in both first and second line. Other highlights from the ASCO meeting included encouraging early-stage results for ABBV-706 in high-grade neuroendocrine tumors and results from a registration-enabling Phase II study evaluating PVEK in BPDCN, which will support a regulatory submission later this year. At the ESMO meeting this fall, we have several planned presentations for Temab-A, including results from a Phase II study in combination with bevacizumab in CRC as well as data from a proof-of-concept study in pancreatic cancer. We will also present updated data at the upcoming World Conference of Lung Cancer. from our ABBV-706 dose-ranging proof-of-concept study in small cell lung cancer. In the area of hematologic oncology, we recently announced a license agreement with IGI Therapeutics to develop a novel trispecific T-cell engager for multiple myeloma and autoimmune diseases. This first-in-class T-cell engaging antibody targets BCMA and CD38 on myeloma cells and has the potential to deliver deep and durable responses, ultimately improving outcomes for patients. Despite advancements, the 5-year survival rate in multiple myeloma is still only about 60%. So unmet needs remain high. Quality of life is also important. Patients currently receive triplet and quad therapy, which can be challenging from a safety and convenience standpoint. HCPs and patients will continue to seek next-generation therapies that can provide high efficacy, better safety and less complicated dosing regimens. We are extremely well positioned to address the unmet needs across all patient segments in multiple myeloma with 3 next-generation multi-specific T cell engagers, etentamig, ISB-2001 and SIM0500. These off-the-shelf therapies may be particularly important for community-based sites, where approximately 80% of patients receive care. In the area of neuroscience, we announced positive top line results from the head-to-head Phase III TEMPLE trial comparing QULIPTA and topiramate for migraine prevention. The primary and all secondary endpoints were met in the study, demonstrating that patients treated with QULIPTA had fewer discontinuations due to adverse events and a greater reduction in migraine days compared to patients receiving topiramate. Over the 24-week treatment period, 12% of patients discontinued QULIPTA due to adverse events compared to 30% for topiramate. 64% of patients on QULIPTA achieved at least a 50% reduction in mean monthly migraine days compared to 39% of patients on topiramate. These results add to the body of evidence supporting QULIPTA as a first-line treatment option for episodic and chronic migraine prevention. In the quarter, MAVYRET was approved for the treatment of acute HCV. With this label expansion, caregivers can now treat HCV patients immediately following diagnosis rather than waiting until progression to chronic disease. Earlier treatment, coupled with increased testing brings us closer to achieving the World Health Organization's goal of global HCV elimination by 2030. To summarize, we've made significant progress across all of our therapeutic areas in the first half of the year and continue to expand our pipeline through internal and external innovation. We look forward to additional data readouts and regulatory milestones throughout the remainder of 2025.

Starting with our second quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.97, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.42 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $15.4 billion, reflecting growth of 6.5% on an operational basis, excluding a modestly favorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin was 84.4% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 13.7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 21% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 44.3% of sales, which includes a 5.3% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $678 million. The adjusted tax rate was 16.2%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $11.88 and $12.08. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $60.5 billion, an increase of $800 million. This reflects a relatively neutral impact from foreign exchange on full year sales growth. Our updated revenue forecast includes the following approximate assumptions for several of our key products and therapeutic areas. In Immunology, we now expect Skyrizi global revenues of $17.1 billion, an increase of $600 million, reflecting continued share gains in psoriasis and IBD and U.S. HUMIRA revenues of $3 billion, a decrease of $500 million, reflecting biosimilar competition. In neuroscience, we now expect global sales of $10.5 billion, an increase of $300 million. This includes a $100 million increase for VYALEV, reflecting strong international uptake with the remaining $200 million increase split relatively evenly across Vraylar, BOTOX Therapeutic and the total oral CGRP portfolio. And in oncology, we now expect Imbruvica global revenues of $2.9 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflecting higher persistency rates for existing patients and Venclexta global sales of $2.8 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflecting continued strong demand in CLL. Moving to the P&L for 2025. We continue to forecast full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales. We now expect adjusted R&D expense of approximately $9 million and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $13.5 billion. We also now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 45% of sales, in line with our previous expectations after including the 1.8% unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&D expense incurred through the second quarter. Turning to the third quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $15.5 billion. This reflects an estimated 1% favorable impact from foreign exchange on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.24 and $3.28. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, AbbVie once again delivered outstanding top and bottom line performance with results well ahead of our expectations. I'm pleased with the momentum from our ex-Humira platform, including Skyrizi, Rinvoq and neuroscience, which further supports AbbVie's long-term outlook.

I have a question regarding the impact of STELARA biosimilar on Skyrizi and Rinvoq here, especially Skyrizi. So I mean, one end, it could be -- I mean it could be considered as a negative impact. But as you saw with HUMIRA biosimilar, people decided to not move change to biosimilar, but to a more efficacious drug like Skyrizi and Rinvoq.

And you're right that we did see certainly with the first exclusionary formulary that was CVS last year, we did see movement from Humira not all of it went to the biosimilars. Some went to, as you mentioned, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Now STELARA is still relatively early, and there are more interchangeable biosimilars. So -- and it's -- frankly, it was a much smaller drug because it's really just concentrated in GI. So it's difficult to sort of tease out exactly what movement we're seeing. Certainly, we did see that some physicians as they think about a movement would be more willing to look at the higher-end products. But net-net, I think that fundamentally, the core -- the core momentum around Skyrizi and Rinvoq are simply related to just the outstanding data, the breadth of indications, our connections with physicians in terms of our value proposition.

And as Jeff mentioned, what we're seeing right now is just continued momentum from Skyrizi. I would not attribute that to be an impact from the biosimilar, but I should want to make clear that we did see very nice share uptake following the Sequence head-to-head trial.",109.0,46.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021739130434782608,0.021739130434782608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

And kind of if you could tie in Rinvoq as well, again, annualizing $8 billion, I think that guidance is for over $11 billion in 2027.

So you're right, we're seeing tremendous performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Very pleased with the progress we're making, obviously, continue to raise our expectations for this year. As you know, we occasionally update the long-term guidance, while we've been doing that the last few years around the time of the fourth quarter call. We've done that also previously at the JPMorgan conference. So we do refresh long-term guidance. I'd say we're obviously tracking very well against the last long-term guidance we issued. And we will update that at the appropriate time. But obviously -- and then when you look at Street expectations as well, they have come up, too. And so we're very pleased with the performance, and we'll update that long-term guidance at the appropriate time, but the momentum is clearly there. As it relates to tariffs, I'd say, as it relates to '25, we're fairly insulated from any impact this year given inventory management actions. But look, without policy details, -- we're not going to speculate on the longer-term impact. We do need to see the outcome of the 232 investigation and how tariffs are ultimately phased in. What I can say is that we do not expect our exposure to be outsized relative to peers. And as I mentioned during the first quarter call, we have a broad U.S. network. It includes 11 sites that manufacture API, biologics, toxins and small molecules. As a reminder, again, our largest product, Skyrizi, is made in the U.S. for the domestic market. And longer term, we will add more U.S. manufacturing capacity, which is part of the planned $10 billion in capital investment that we announced during the first quarter call. That again includes adding 4 new sites to our U.S. network that will cover API, peptides drug product and devices. And so we are well positioned. We'll obviously continue to invest in the U.S. I think we're having constructive discussions with the administration on sectoral tariffs. Clearly, the best way to motivate that is through tax incentives as well as a trade agenda that prioritizes innovation.

Just on Skyrizi, obviously, meaningful upside to results this year. And I just would love if you'd lay out what in particular is driving this. I guess, specifically, is it all IBD? Or are you also seeing upside to the derm indications as well? And then second question was just kind of a bigger picture kind of BD question. I know the focus is on strengthening the growth profile 2030 and beyond. But just given the momentum of the core business, it seems as AbbVie could fund significant growth in its pipeline in R&D over the next few years and still have pretty healthy earnings growth. So just should we think about this still being kind of the string of early stage or mid-stage deals?

Clearly, we've spent a lot of time talking about the more recent launches of Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. Rob mentioned the Sequence head-to-head trial, which was quite remarkable in what that drove. But really, it's across the board. I mean, particularly continue to be very, very impressed with our momentum in psoriatic disease. So it's been 7 years since the initial psoriasis approval, and we are still gaining in-play share, really not been observed on a brand this big over that amount of time. And that's across both psoriasis and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, in frontline PSA derm. So it really is strength across the board.

When you look at AbbVie and the diversified growth platform we have today, that's going to provide us with the opportunity to really drive top-tier performance, clear line of sight to growth for at least the next 8 years. So as I think about strategically, the pipeline, external innovation, the investments we're making are really all around what's going to drive growth in the next decade. We have a clear line of sight based on the portfolio we have today to drive that growth over the next 8 years. And so it's really more about how do we set the company up to grow beyond Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And so we've made, I think, a lot of very compelling investments. And you're right, we -- without any significant LOEs this decade, we have the flexibility to invest more in R&D to continue to acquire external innovation. And we're going to -- we will absolutely do that. We have, I think, a lot of very exciting programs coming out of our internal pipeline. We look at the progress we're making, particularly in oncology, you look at the combination approaches in immunology. But our BD strategy will continue to be focused on assets that can really drive growth in the next decade and beyond. And if you just look at the deals we've done, obviously bolstering our pipeline in immunology with novel mechanisms, but also adding important capabilities with oral peptides as well as B-cell depletion approaches. In oncology, we've added some very nice depth in multiple myeloma. We actually have our own program in Etansamig, but we've added 2 trispecific deals, Simcere and IGI to really give us significant depth in multiple myeloma to drive growth for the long term. We've also made a lot of progress in neuroscience across psychiatry, migraine and Alzheimer's. And then the siRNA transaction with AR gives us a very compelling platform that can generate opportunities across really all 3 of these areas: immunology, neuroscience and oncology and then not to mention our entry into obesity with the Uber deal, which we plan to build upon with more BD.

I mean we do have a very strong footprint around the globe. And what we observed, and it's changed a little bit over the last several quarters, we observed that the sort of a cash pay obesity or weight loss market in our aesthetics practices became the second largest sort of revenue driver for them and in terms of patient flow. So you had the toxins was #1, then obesity and weight loss became #2 and then dermal fillers was #3. Now that since moderated, and it's moderated because of the -- basically the loss of some of the compounding dynamics and the way the clinics were thinking about this. So we -- this was an important -- certainly not the only an important reason for the Gubra transaction because we know that, that's just going to be ongoing demand. And as we think of a lot of patients who are going to have already tried to cycle through the GLP-1s, whether it was compounding or the branded over time, they're going to want to continue to think about how do they think about weight loss as part of their aesthetic journey over time. And we think we're very uniquely positioned to be able to deliver that to the aesthetic clinics around the world. So again, pretty important in terms of how we would do that, our ability to distribute directly to think about ways that we would handle the cash pay aspects, aspects of thinking about how AI would work and how that interaction would take place across the emerging portfolio and existing core brands that we have.

The issue we see here is many people will start, but a majority of whom will fall off relatively quickly and then not get the benefits of weight loss. The other considerations are around muscle loss and bone loss. And along those lines of what I just mentioned, if there are other assets that address those similarly to an amylin class and we have an opportunity to combine, that would be something that we'd be very interested in.

So the data was quite impressive that you've seen, the recovery of the hair growth quite striking relative to other JAK inhibitors that we've seen report out and gain approvals. So the way that we thought about Rinvoq and the new indications is really sort of the third wave of how we've developed the product. So we had the big rheumatology indications to start out with, and we built atopic dermatitis and the IBD indications. And now we have this next set of indications, GCA, lupus, et cetera, which are all overlapping with the derm and the rum categories where we have this exceptional strength right now. So as we build that out, it's going to be, we think, quite significant. And we've highlighted that the collection of the next wave of indications would add approximately $2 billion to peak year sales for Rinvoq. Now we're going to have to continue to study this because it's sort of late breaking and understand could we get more momentum coming out of the transformational quality of this data because in the research that we've had with patients with alopecia, clearly, any sort of hair recovery helps out their perception of their disease, their immune disease. But when you look at the potential to get those SALT scores at that level, could we really see more momentum than we've studied the market so far? We'll have to see. But net-net, to your point, it's a very significant strategy for us that will start to play out here towards the end of the decade, starting in '26, '27, '28, and we're really encouraged with the data. In terms of additional color on the aesthetic, we've seen things pretty stable -- the big issue that has come up has been really the decline across some of the major territories in the dermal filler market. So certainly, given their price points, patients are more sensitive to the price points of the fillers versus the toxins versus BOTOX. But at the same time, we've seen that the sentiment around the worry over what happens if I become overfilled -- or is that the look that I want? I want a more subtle natural look. And so that's something that we are basically going to deal with pretty substantially here in the second half with our clinics, with our thought leaders and with our trainers to make sure that the consumers can really understand you can just get exceptional results with dermal fillers. And so we see things fairly stable, but we're going to have to do some work basically to make sure that, that market sort of stabilizes and then grows over time.",464.0,202.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.04455445544554455,0.009900990099009901,0.01485148514851485,0.0,0.0,0.034653465346534656

First, on -- back on aesthetics, nothing you have said is particularly encouraging. In the past, the company has pointed to past periods of uncertainty and pointed to the resilience these brands have had during that period. So the question is, why is this economic uncertainty different than in the past? This one seems to be lingering longer than in past soft periods? Or are there other things that work such as perhaps competition that's also knowying away at these franchises? And then secondly, on the pipeline, so you have an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody that completed a Phase I trial in April. What is the status of this product?

I think, Steve, to your point, I think there is a difference between this and some other areas where we've had some economic uncertainty. It's been sort of more short-term recessionary issues. I think the longer-term impact on the pocket book of the consumers has just been more chronic, and we've seen that across even just recent reports on luxury good items and significant issues. So I do think it's more chronic than we've seen before. Ultimately, I think we'll be able to work through it. We still see high levels of interest in aesthetic procedures, and we do see the target customers complain about issues of their wallet. I also did highlight that I do think something is different in terms of the sentiment around this natural look and worry about being overfilled in terms of the derma fillers. All of these are addressable. And I also think that we have the right portfolio, and we also have the right disruptive innovations that's pretty close, particularly around the toxin space with our short-acting fast on, fast off TrenibotE. So I do think we're set up for taking advantage of the long-term recovery, and we'll look forward to that as we continue to progress the strategy.",220.0,97.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05154639175257732,0.041237113402061855,0.010309278350515464,0.0,0.0,0.010309278350515464

We have a monoclonal antibody 916, which read out as data, I would say, similar to what's already available on market. And that was the around that period, we also acquired the Aliada technology, which is a monoclonal similar to our 916 in that it binds with high potency to pyroglutamated amyloid. And that also has the blood-brain barrier crossing technology via the transferrin receptor, so we can enhance penetration into the CNS. Also, what's emerging with that asset is a relatively long half-life. Taken together, we are focused on being able to deliver that subcutaneously. And what will happen next year is that we'll be able to get into patients with that next-generational asset. Now jumping straight to Phase III and getting an approval based on imaging. It's probably where industry and all of us would like to go to save time. I think we're still going to have to demonstrate a favorable impact on cognition along with that.

So when I look at this business, as you look at the performance, I think it's important to note, as you look at this, is it market growth versus market share and the market share performance has been stable. And so when I look at this longer term, with low penetration rates being a leader in this space and the innovation that we have coming forward, there's tremendous potential here, gives us a lot of confidence that over the long term, this will be -- is a very good business. We've had a prolonged economic headwind. And again, this dynamic we're seeing in various markets around market growth and certain dynamics, as Jeff has mentioned, around dermal fillers in certain geographies. But that said, again, given our position, given our ability to, I think, compete very effectively as demonstrated by the market share performance, and we're very excited about the short-acting toxin and the way it could drive an inflection in terms of market growth and market share as well as the other items in our pipeline around fillers. There's tremendous potential here. And then there was a question asked earlier about the role that aesthetics can play in obesity. And so you think about strategically, we have the opportunity to play in that market as well. And so longer term, we have a great deal of confidence in this aesthetics business.

The major missing piece is the contribution from IV IBD induction scripts. So perhaps can you give us some help on the proportion of sales from Skyrizi in IBD now or percentage of number of scripts getting IBD induction?

From an overall perspective, the first half of the year, we did see some price favorability. Now quickly on the volume side, when you look at that IQVIA data as we've spoken about in the past, there is a disconnect from the induction. And that really, I would call that about a 10-point differential that you need to add to what you're seeing in the data to get to the volume trend. But we still do have favorable price in the quarter and also the first half. And there's really a couple of things going on there. It's really some price gating items that were unique. We also are seeing from some of the information that we've received, the Part D redesign impact will be a little bit more heavily weighted towards the back half of the year. So that was less of a headwind in the first year, but really some pricing gating items. We do expect on an overall basis that pricing to be neutral for Skyrizi.

What are you seeing regarding the competitive dynamics in the IL-23 class, especially with J&J's TREMFYA with their new IBD approvals, if that's impacting at all? Or is there just a ton of headroom in the IBD market to absorb that? And then on neuro, it was very strong in 2Q. Is that mainly volume demand driven across the various products?

We're quite pleased again with the overall performance, the head-to-head trials, our ability to think about the dosing and the convenience and the safety. The profile of Skyrizi is just fantastic across IBD that we've highlighted multiple times. And I think your point is consistent with how we think about how this market will develop over time. And I think I've highlighted it before. There's actually -- the launches of the '23s really Skyrizi first and now TREMFYA are so new, you really have single-digit patient share capture. This is for total patient share. We saw the same dynamic in psoriasis where you look at it, it was that way in 2018, 2019. Now 60% of the entire market of patients is in the IL-23 category. So to your point, there's plenty of headroom when you look at the profile of these agents. And certainly, from a capture rate standpoint, we believe that Skyrizi will do very, very well relative to the peers in the IL-23 category. Having said that, we prudently would allocate a certain amount of share capture from a competitor like TREMFYA. So hopefully, that will help give the perspective. Certainly, the macro perspective is important there. And then in terms of the neuro business, you're right, strong growth rates across the board. Most of that is volume and promotion. If you look at the migraine business, we have the leading business across all 3 segments of that category. So we're #1 in acute with Ubrelvy, #1 in prevention with QULIPTA and for chronic migraine, where you have the injectors for BOTOX Therapeutic there as well. So there's no cannibalization. All of them grow very well. We have super powerful share of voice out there that's helping to drive all of that. And you've heard the comments, of course, on VYALEV and Vraylar as well.

I mean, as Jeff said, the volume is really driving this business. When you think about our 2 largest brands, Vraylar and Botox Therapeutics, those are both double-digit -- you did see a little bit of a price benefit from Vraylar in particular, as we look at the Part D redesign impact. So we have a little bit of price favorability. But Vraylar in particular, double-digit growth in volume for the year, double digit every quarter. And we're really seeing that across the board. On the gross net side, I would say that, especially in the oral CGRP space, Ubrelvy, QULIPTA, we continue to work very closely on the co-pays and making sure that we're get the right gross to net, and we've been very happy with that progress.

And so we're planning sales force expansions on that front. And certainly, Roopal and I both highlighted the study versus topiramate. Now topiramate basically is 40% to 50% of all the generics in the preventative space.

AbbVie's business continues to perform above our expectations. We delivered another excellent quarter, including strong financial results, pipeline advancement across all stages of development and strategic investments to drive sustainable long-term growth. Given our positive momentum, we are raising our 2025 outlook for the third time this year. Starting with our third quarter performance, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.86, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were nearly $15.8 billion, reflecting high single-digit sales growth and beating our expectations by approximately $300 million. I'm especially pleased with the execution of our growth platform, including combined sales growth of more than 40% from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, our leading immunology medicines as well as double-digit revenue growth from neuroscience, our second largest and fastest-growing therapeutic area. With no significant LOE events in the near term, our growth platform provides a clear line of sight to growth into the next decade. This puts AbbVie in a strong position to fully invest for the 2030s and beyond. Since our inception in 2013, we have invested more than $84 billion to research, discover and develop new medicines and solutions for patients. We anticipate $9 billion of adjusted R&D expense in 2025, a substantial increase from the prior year. This supports numerous pipeline opportunities across our core areas: immunology, oncology, neuroscience and aesthetics as well as new sources of growth like obesity. More broadly, I'm very pleased with the breadth and depth of our robust pipeline with approximately 90 programs across all stages of development. We are making excellent progress and expect several important milestones over the next 2 years, including new product approvals for tavapadon and PVEK, expanded indications for Rinvoq, Epkinly, Qulipta and Ubrelvy and pivotal data for lutikizumab, Temab-A and etentamig. These pipeline programs have the potential to drive growth for AbbVie later this decade. We also continue to invest in external innovation, adding novel mechanisms and platform technologies to further augment our pipeline to drive growth in the 2030s and beyond. Our recent deal activity includes announcing the acquisition of Gilgamesh's bretisilocin, expanding our psychiatry pipeline with a next-generation psychedelic currently in Phase II development for MDD. And closing the acquisition of CapstanTherapeutics, further strengthening our immunology pipeline with an in vivo CAR-T platform. Our consistently strong performance as well as the progress we are making to build and advance a robust pipeline fully supports our capital allocation priorities. This includes investing at least $10 billion of capital in the U.S. over the next 10 years. Construction is already underway for a new API manufacturing site in North Chicago as well as expansion of biologics manufacturing and R&D capacity at our existing site in Worcester. We are also committed to delivering a healthy, sustainable dividend that grows every year. Today, we announced a 5.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2026. Since inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by more than 330%. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie. We are demonstrating outstanding execution across our portfolio, and our long-term outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.

I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7.9 billion, up 11.2% on an operational basis. Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to exceed our expectations, once again demonstrating robust growth across a broad set of indications. Skyrizi global sales were $4.7 billion, reflecting operational growth of 46%. Rinvoq global revenues were nearly $2.2 billion, up 34.1% on an operational basis. I'm especially pleased with our portfolio performance in gastroenterology, where these 2 medicines are on pace to nearly double their combined sales in IBD this year. Our uptake in Crohn's disease remains impressive with Skyrizi and Rinvoq together achieving in-play share leadership in a dozen countries. This includes capturing roughly 50% of newer switching Crohn's patients across all lines of therapy in the U.S. We see similar momentum in ulcerative colitis as well with Skyrizi and Rinvoq collectively holding in-play share leadership in more than 10 key markets and capturing nearly 1 out of every 3 newer switching UC patients across all mechanisms in the U.S. IBD continues to be an area of high unmet need with substantial headroom for biologic penetration as well as expanding lines of therapy. Given the compelling efficacy, safety and dosing profiles for both assets, Skyrizi with less frequent dosing favored by patients and clinicians, especially for the maintenance treatment relative to the most effective dose for other IL-23s. And Rinvoq, often preferred for difficult-to-treat IBD cases, having demonstrated the strongest response rates in UC studies as well as very strong efficacy in CD as well. Along with Rinvoq's recently expanded label in IBD, which is a great outcome for patients who will now have access to Rinvoq earlier in the treatment paradigm when anti-TNF treatment is clinically and advisable. So we remain very competitively positioned for continued strong growth across gastroenterology. Moving to the rest of our core immunology indications. Skyrizi continues to perform exceptionally well in psoriasis, gaining share across our key markets. This includes an impressive 50% in-play patient share for biologics in the U.S. Rinvoq is also delivering strong prescription growth in rheumatology. In RA, Rinvoq continues to achieve the leading in-play patient share across lines of therapy. We now have 3 head-to-head studies demonstrating Rinvoq's superiority to other biologics in RA, including recent positive data from our SELECT-SWITCH trial, which clearly supports the clinical benefits of switching to Rinvoq after a first TNF failure. Lastly, we are seeing a very nice ramp in GCA, where Rinvoq now has full formulary coverage. I'm very pleased with the progress and look forward to the commercialization of additional sizable indications like alopecia areata and vitiligo. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $993 million, down 55.7% on an operational basis, reflecting biosimilar competition. We continue to anticipate Humira access in the U.S. will decrease throughout the remainder of this year and into 2026 as more plans select exclusionary contracts for existing patients. This step-up in volume erosion is expected to be partially offset by a price benefit also associated with these contract changes, which is included in our fourth quarter outlook. Moving to oncology, which delivered total revenues of nearly $1.7 billion, relatively flat versus prior year. Momentum from Venclexta as well as newer products, Elahere, Epkinly and EMRELIS helped to offset the expected sales decline from Imbruvica, which continues to be impacted by competitive dynamics in CLL. Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we are making to expand our commercial capabilities in both heme and solid tumors with our existing portfolio. These efforts will ultimately support our emerging oncology pipeline, which includes several promising programs to improve patient outcomes in many difficult-to-treat cancers. Turning now to aesthetics, which delivered global sales of approximately $1.2 billion, down 4.2% on an operational basis. Botox Cosmetic global revenues were $637 million and Juvederm global sales were $253 million, with growth rates for both products down on an operational basis. While our portfolio is performing well from a competitive perspective, we continue to face challenging market conditions in several key markets, which are impacting our results. With overall consumer sentiment remaining quite low, especially in the U.S. as concerns about the economy and inflation weigh on discretionary spending, we now see category growth tracking below our previous assumptions globally. However, this near-term macro pressure does not dampen our excitement for the long-term potential of our leading aesthetics portfolio. We are investing to support patient activation with robust promotion and product innovation. We recently launched new consumer campaigns for BOTOX as well as fillers to further stimulate category growth, which remains highly underpenetrated and where we stand to disproportionately benefit upon market recovery giving our leading product shares. Innovation from our pipeline, including novel toxins like TrenibotE, a fast-acting short-duration toxin as well as several next-generation fillers will also provide growth in the coming years. Moving now to neuroscience, which is demonstrating exceptional performance. Total revenues were more than $2.8 billion, up 19.6% on an operational basis. I'm very pleased with our leading migraine portfolio with Ubrelvy, Qulipta and Botox Therapeutic all delivering robust double-digit growth. Qulipta is now the #1 CGRP treatment for migraine prevention with a total prescription share of approximately 7.5%. Vraylar is also performing well in both bipolar and [ AMDD ] with total sales of $934 million, up 6.7%. Physicians continue to report positive feedback on Vraylar's strong benefit risk profile, including dosing flexibility, low sedation and the ability to address anhedonia and anxiety symptoms often associated with depression. Lastly, in Parkinson's disease, VYALEV's launch trajectory has been very impressive. Total sales were $138 million, up 40% on a sequential basis. The uptake across international markets continues to exceed our expectations with physicians and patient communities highlighting meaningful improvements in on time and off time from the 24-hour delivery and the control of symptoms throughout the morning, day and night. VYALEV is the only Parkinson's treatment that often replaces the need for add-on oral therapies to manage motor fluctuations, reducing the daily pill, pill burden for these patients. We anticipate expanded coverage of VYALEV in the U.S. soon, which we expect will provide further revenue inflection next year. I'm also excited about tavapadon, where we are pursuing approval for use as a monotherapy for early Parkinson's disease as well as an adjunct to optimize oral therapy for more advanced patients. This will be a very complementary offering for both VYALEV and DUOPA. Given the significant commercial opportunity with our emerging Parkinson's portfolio, we are now actively expanding our field sales team to support higher anticipated demand next year. Overall, again, we are demonstrating strong revenue growth and our commercial execution has been outstanding. And with that, I'll turn the call to Roopal for comments on our R&D highlights.

ABBV,2025-10-31,2025-10-31,,2025-10-31,2025-10-31T09:00:00-04:00,0,2025-10-31,prepared,,Roopal Thakkar,"Thank you, Jeff. Starting with immunology, we announced positive top line results from the second Phase III Rinvoq alopecia areata trial, reinforcing the potential for Rinvoq to significantly improve hair regrowth for patients suffering from severe forms of this condition. Data were consistent with the results from the first trial with Rinvoq demonstrating meaningful improvement in hair regrowth across both doses compared to placebo. We remain on track to begin submitting regulatory applications later this year. We also recently announced positive top line results from 2 Phase III Rinvoq vitiligo trials. In both studies, Rinvoq met the co-primary and key secondary endpoints at week 48, demonstrating improvements in both total body and facial vitiligo scoring compared to placebo. We are very pleased with these results, which illustrate Rinvoq's potential to provide significant skin repigmentation to patients suffering from nonsegmental vitiligo. The daily challenges of living with this condition can often lead to depression and anxiety. With no approved systemic treatments, there is very high unmet need for these patients. Once approved, Rinvoq could potentially be the first systemic therapy available for vitiligo. Regulatory submissions are planned for early next year. Positive top line results were also announced from the SELECT-SWITCH trial, which compared Rinvoq to Humira in RA patients who had an inadequate response or intolerance to their first TNF inhibitor. This is the first head-to-head study comparing anti-TNF cycling versus switching to Rinvoq. In the study, Rinvoq demonstrated superiority to Humira for efficacy measures with nearly twice as many patients achieving low disease activity and remission. For RA patients who did not respond well to their first TNF inhibitor, these results clearly show the benefit of switching to Rinvoq rather than cycling to another anti-TNF. In IBD, Rinvoq recently received a label update in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, allowing its use prior to anti-TNFs in patients who have received at least one approved systemic therapy when TNF inhibitors are clinically inadvisable. The treatment paradigm has evolved in IBD with increasing utilization of newer, higher efficacy agents like Skyrizi. There are certain clinical scenarios when an anti-TNF may not be the most appropriate next treatment option for a patient. This label update provides physicians with the flexibility to use Rinvoq prior to anti-TNFs for certain patients after they have tried another approved systemic therapy. Moving to oncology. The regulatory application was submitted to the FDA for PVEK in blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. This rare aggressive blood cancer primarily affects an older population who is at high risk for complications with traditional chemotherapy or precluded from stem cell transplantation. As a new treatment providing durable responses with a manageable safety profile, our novel ADC has the potential to become an important new therapeutic option for these patients. At the recent ESMO meeting, we presented 3 orals for Temab-A, highlighting this novel ADC's potential, both as a monotherapy and in combination across advanced difficult-to-treat solid tumors. In CRC patients who received 2 or more prior lines of therapy and regardless of c-MET expression levels, Temab-A in combination with bevacizumab demonstrated manageable safety and better responses and disease control compared to current standard of care. Treatment with Temab-A at 2.4 milligrams per kilogram plus bevacizumab achieved an objective response rate of 30% and a confirmed disease control rate of 97% compared to rates of 0% and 70%, respectively, for Lonsurf plus bevacizumab. Based on these results, we plan to begin a Phase III study for this combination in late-line all-comers CRC. In a proof-of-concept study in pancreatic cancer, monotherapy Temab-A demonstrated an objective response rate of 24% in the overall population and 40% in patients who received first-line gemcitabine plus, Abraxane. A Phase II study in pancreatic cancer is expected to begin next year. And in an exploratory study in MET amplified solid tumors after progression following standard of care, monotherapy with Temab-A resulted in an objective response rate of 47% and median duration of response of 12.5 months for the 2.4 milligram per kilogram dose. Higher responses were observed in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with a rate of 69% and gastroesophageal cancer with a rate of 71%. A Phase II study in MET amplified solid tumors is expected to begin later this year. We are making significant progress with Temab-A across a broad range of tumors, and there is an increasing body of evidence demonstrating durable efficacy and a manageable safety profile in these difficult-to-treat cancers. We look forward to providing additional updates on Temab-A programs as data mature. In neuroscience, the regulatory application for tavapadon in Parkinson's disease was recently submitted to the FDA. For many patients with Parkinson's, existing oral therapies aren't sufficient to manage symptoms. Our selective D1/D5 receptor partial agonist demonstrated robust efficacy as a monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease and as an adjunct to levodopa-carbidopa oral therapy in patients still experiencing motor fluctuations. Once approved, we believe tavapadon will be an important new treatment option. Results from a Phase II study evaluating BOTOX in upper limb essential tremor were recently presented at the MDS Congress. In the study, BOTOX met the primary and all secondary endpoints, demonstrating significant improvements in all assessment measures compared to placebo. With a global patient population of about 25 million, essential tremor is the most common movement disorder. This progressive neurological condition can substantially hinder patients' physical activities and diminish their quality of life. Current treatment options are limited in terms of both efficacy and tolerability, leaving considerable need for new therapies. Based on these results, we plan to advance a new toxin for upper limb essential tremor. TrenibotE is a novel toxin that has demonstrated different pharmacologic properties preclinically compared to BOTOX, such as less diffusion to neighboring muscles. Phase II studies for TrenibotE in essential tremor and ventral hernia repair will begin next year. To further expand our neuropsychiatry pipeline, we acquired bretisilocin from Gilgamesh. Bretisilocin is a novel (5-HT)2A receptor agonist and 5-HT releaser with a short duration of hallucination that has demonstrated robust efficacy in a Phase II proof-of-concept study in major depressive disorder. Rapid efficacy was achieved after the initial dose with response and remission maintained through day 74 without additional intervention. This novel psychedelic has the potential to provide significant benefit to patients by offering rapid, robust and durable antidepressant effects following a short in-clinic treatment session. Additional Phase II studies in depression are expected to begin next year. To summarize, we continue to make good progress across all stages and therapeutic areas of our pipeline and look forward to many important pipeline milestones in the remainder of this year and into 2026.

Starting with our third quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.86, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $1.50 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense, primarily reflecting upfront charges for the acquisition of Capstan Therapeutics and our license agreement with IGI. Total net revenues were nearly $15.8 billion, reflecting growth of 8.4% on an operational basis, excluding a modestly favorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, our ex-Humira growth platform delivered reported sales growth of more than 20%, once again exceeding our expectations. Adjusted gross margin was 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 14.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 21.6% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 30.9% of sales, which includes a 17% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $667 million. The adjusted tax rate was 24.5%, reflecting the lower deductibility of acquired IPR&D expense this quarter. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $10.61 and $10.65. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the third quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately [ $16.9 billion, ] an increase of $400 million. This updated forecast primarily reflects Skyrizi global sales of $17.3 billion, an increase of $200 million with continued share gains in psoriasis and IBD. Neuroscience global revenues of $10.7 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting continued strength across Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic, VYALEV and the total oral CGRP portfolio. Aesthetics total sales of $4.9 billion, a decrease of $200 million, reflecting greater-than-expected market softness globally, with the remaining $200 million increase reflecting the collective momentum from Rinvoq and several other products across our diverse portfolio. And we also continue to assume a relatively neutral impact from foreign exchange on full year sales growth. Moving to the P&L for full year 2025. We continue to expect adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales, adjusted R&D expense of $9 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of $13.5 billion. We now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 41% of sales, in line with our previous expectations after including the roughly 6% unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&D expense incurred through the third quarter. And we now forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 17.3%, also reflecting the impact of acquired IPR&D. Turning to the fourth quarter. We anticipate net revenues of more than $16.3 billion. This reflects an estimated 1% favorable impact from foreign exchange on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.32 and $3.36. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's robust business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of September was more than $5.6 billion, and we generated approximately $13 billion of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year, which includes nearly $2.2 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments. This free cash flow fully supports strong and growing quarterly dividend, which we are increasing 5.5% to $1.73 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2026. As well as capacity for continued business development, we have executed approximately 30 deals since the beginning of 2024, and we continue to assess external innovation across all of our key growth areas. We also remain on track to achieve a net leverage ratio of 2x by the end of 2026. In closing, AbbVie once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong.

I'm going to have actually Jeff supplement as well. But I think one thing that's important to think about as it relates to whether it's PBM reform, questions we've got on DTC, ultimately, what drives AbbVie's performance is our differentiated medicines, along with our execution track record and strong culture. And that's why we deliver similar strong performance in markets outside the U.S. where PBMs and DTC do not play a role. So now given our ability to execute, we are very good at utilizing the tools that are available to us. If there are changes to the PBM model, we will certainly be able to adapt effectively. I mean I think for us, as we think about it, the key is to continue developing differentiated medicines as that is what delivers real value and can drive growth in any environment.

I mean, if you think about some of these announcements over the years, whether it's rebate pass-through or there's existing models like this that work today. And we think there's a lot of merit to that, like the ability for patients to share and lowering their out-of-pocket cost at the counter is a good approach. There's been a lot of structural barriers to that, of course, over the years. Sometimes it's the clients don't really have the incentive to go in based on how they're using those rebates, maybe to lower premiums. We all know those stories. I think the key point is Rob's point that across my global footprint, we're used to dealing with any type of approach, whether it's a net price market, it's a rebate-driven market or a hybrid market that's net price and rebate like Germany or HTA markets. So we're very, very adaptable to sort of any sort of structure because we rely on the distinctiveness of our brands. And when we position those in the right way, which we always do, we perform exceptionally well from a market share and a competitive perspective. So we'll continue. We don't know a lot of the details, but we talk to Cigna all the time. Our account teams talk. We talk at the executive level. So we'll continue to study it, but we're very confident in terms of if there were to be changes in the PBM model, we would adapt very well.",278.0,120.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.03333333333333333,0.008333333333333333,0.016666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.025

So yes, we are very pleased with Skyrizi's growth overall and in the quarter. I mean, 46% year-over-year is quite strong. So -- and we see that momentum with share gains, it's market growth, and we retain a very, very strong in-play share position in IBD. It's really a leadership position -- what we do see is we know that TREMFYA is going to gain some market share and in-place share. But what's actually happening is the category or the class of IL-23 is expanding incredibly rapidly. And we view this as a positive. We said before, this is not a zero-sum game. We're very confident in our competitive position. I'll give you a little bit of some numbers, more -- some more recent numbers to see how dramatic this is. So just over a year ago, when the IL-23 were entering, the NBRx share for UC, this is ulcerative colitis, which is the smaller of the 2 was around 5%. That was the penetration rate. Now it's approaching in this latest quarter, close to 40%. So this is a dramatic change in the adoption of the IL-23s. Skyrizi continues to grow. TREMFYA will grow. There's -- yes, there are subtle differences, but we're super confident in where this product will go. So Skyrizi is performing very, very well and we'll continue to do so. And don't forget, it's just not a Skyrizi story. AbbVie has uniquely sort of a one-two punch in this market. We've got Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our position with Rinvoq just got significantly stronger for gastroenterologists and patients with that enhanced indication. So what that allows to do is that physicians, if they choose, if someone is not eligible or it's inadvisable clinically for a TNF, you can go right to Rinvoq. So it's a really, really powerful position and setup for AbbVie right now and over time. So that's basically what we're observing in the marketplace.",356.0,135.0,12.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.08888888888888889,0.014814814814814815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07407407407407407

Look, our business continues to perform exceptionally well. We've raised our revenue forecast this year by nearly $2 billion since our initial guidance in February, and that's not just coming from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We're seeing overperformance across the entire neuroscience portfolio and oncology is ahead of our original guidance as well. That momentum should allow us to deliver strong growth next year despite headwinds from continued Humira erosion and Imbruvica IRA pricing. Recall that Imbruvica was negotiated and that pricing will kick in next year. And Humira erosion will continue, albeit not at the same absolute level as we saw in 2025. When I think about just the growth platform, in particular, obviously, a lot of attention is placed on Skyrizi and Rinvoq appropriately. But in neuroscience, when you think about the performance of Vraylar, our migraine franchise, inclusive of Botox Therapeutic, which a little bit over 40% of that business is for chronic migraine. And then VYALEV, we're just seeing tremendous ramps. And we're also starting to now see, as Jeff mentioned, we expect in the inflection, particularly with the U.S. We've seen some nice progress there. But I would say that will be a very nice growth driver for us in 2026. And so we're very pleased with the performance. Obviously, clearly, the momentum is there. We've now beaten and raised it every quarter of '25.

My question is actually around the 2027 guidance you've given for Skyrizi and Rinvoq before you be clearly on track to exceed that. I'm curious your thoughts around updating the Street on sort of your longer-term outlook for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And then the other question is on the aesthetic side.

So as you recall, we updated the 2027 guidance for Skyrizi and Rinvoq during the Q4 call earlier this year. And since then, we have raised the combined guidance for 2025 by over $1.7 billion. So it's reasonable to assume that we will exceed that long-term guidance. And I think that will be very clear when we provide 2026 guidance on the upcoming Q4 call. Now we have provided long-term guidance in the past really to help investors understand what the company will look like on the other side of the Humira LOE event. We said we would rapidly return to robust growth and deliver high single-digit compound revenue growth from '24 to '29. And we gave product specifics to support that high single-digit growth outlook. I mean sitting here today, we have clearly demonstrated the rapid return to growth. Our 2025 sales outlook exceeds our previous peak by almost $3 billion, and that's within 2 years of the LOE event. And the Street now reflects our high single-digit growth outlook for this decade. I'd say there appears to be good recognition of our momentum with Skyrizi and Rinvoq, though they do continue to perform above our own expectations. And there's recognition that our diversified growth platform can drive top-tier performance. That said, there are a few things that remain underappreciated. I think one is our strategy to continue innovating in immunology and drive growth beyond Skyrizi and Rinvoq, both in terms of combination approaches with Skyrizi or Rinvoq as a backbone and through new platforms such as oral peptides and B cell depletion approaches. We also have lutikizumab in our pipeline. We have a TL1A. We have a TREM1 antibody. So I think there's quite a bit of depth here in the immunology pipeline that can set us up to grow beyond Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And I don't think that's always appreciated. We also do not see enough investor focus on our neuroscience franchise. It's increased but it's still not at the level that I think it should be given it's our second largest therapeutic area and the fastest growing in our portfolio. We have very strong positions in psych and migraine and an emerging leadership position in Parkinson's with VYALEV and tavapadon. We also have an opportunity to transform care for essential tremor. The Aliada platform also gives us the potential to advance Alzheimer's treatment. And our Gilgamesh and Gedeon Richter deals give us more depth in mood disorders. So at the same time, we are starting to see more attention on our oncology pipeline, including Temab-A in several solid tumors, etentamig in multiple myeloma, 706 in small cell lung cancer as well as the recent BD transactions for trispecific antibodies from Simcere and IGI. And given our clear runway to growth into the next decade, we are in a very strong position to continue increasing our R&D investment and acquiring more external innovation that can help drive long-term growth. So to me, it's more important that investors appreciate the depth of our pipeline that can drive growth in the next decade versus updating financial guidance again for this decade.",546.0,248.0,7.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.028225806451612902,0.012096774193548387,0.012096774193548387,0.0,0.0,0.016129032258064516

I'll just give you some of the sense you asked about the dynamics in the U.S. with aesthetics. So really, just to start with the market. If you look at the U.S. toxin market, it's really in a flattish position in the U.S. The filler market has been problematic. It's been down double digits. When you look at our share, what we can see is that year-over-year, we are lower than we were last year because of the [indiscernible] reimagined. But sequentially, we're growing. So we sit in the low 60s in terms of BOTOX share, and that's a clear leadership position by a large margin in the U.S. When you look at the HA filler, generally, that's in the mid-40s, call it, 45%, and that's largely been very stable. So that gives you some sense of the dynamics. The big thing is as the leader, we have to invest and we are investing in the market, as I mentioned in my remarks. We have a significant BOTOX consumer campaign that's in the market. We're starting to see some nice pickup there. So we're encouraged. We have an HA filler sentiment campaign to make sure that we're working with all of our clinics to make sure we can revitalize and get that market stabilized and more robust because you really do need HA fillers to really get the aesthetics outcome. So we believe we can rehabilitate that segment. And we also have opened 3 very significant training and sort of practice growth centers around the country to continue to lead that marketplace.

With other psychedelics, they tend to have a very long tail, especially around hallucination. And this one has a very short duration. So when it's in clinic, it will be a short duration. And a lot of clinicians are prepared to do this already. So we're not worried about having that being a barrier for uptake. There is so much depression and unmet need, we think that patients and caregivers would really like more options like this one. The other benefit that we saw is a longer duration after just 1 or 2 doses. And that maybe speaks to this potential concept of rewiring. So we're very excited about that. So the key for us is in depression, looking at different doses and looking at different duration paradigms, and we're going to do that in Phase II and ultimately move into Phase III. There is this regulatory need for a low-dose comparator, and that's because of the potential unblinding. And the Phase II study that we've -- that Gilgamesh has already posted was against a low-dose comparator, and you saw those very large deltas.

So as Rob and I mentioned, we're very, very pleased with VYALEV around the world with sales ramping very, very nicely. And it is levodopa-carbidopa. So it's the gold standard. It's just the ability to get that in the subcu version. Cause is incredible disease stability and recovery. So we do see a lot of distinction versus, let's say, the competitors, and we've dealt with the competitors around the world. It's relatively new in the U.S. So in terms of what we see on the market perspective, the in-play capture right now is roughly 80%, 85% in favor of VYALEV. And that's because of the 24-hour coverage, you have far less supplemental orals. The levels of control are great, particularly when you wake up and you're through the night. The other metric that we look at is, in some cases, we've launched VYALEV after subcu apomorphine has been available in the international countries. And essentially, the shares invert very, very rapidly. So we're quite confident in the both short- and long-term position for a product like VYALEV. It really is an exceptional medication.

Let me start on the VYALEV side briefly, dovetailing on what Jeff just went through. So on the R&D side, we've received very favorable feedback thus far from caregivers and patients. And I would say the word transformative is the common theme. And the benefit of VYALEV is a full 24-hour opportunity for state of control. And that facilitates the ability to sleep and the ability to wake up on ready to go and face the day. The competitor that you mentioned is a 16-hour profile, so may not afford that same 24-hour control. Also, as Jeff had mentioned, VYALEV delivers a meaningful dose of levodopa-carbidopa. So what that means is patients -- many patients no longer require their oral therapy. So that means a monotherapy simplified approach is possible. The competitor is provided as an adjunct. So you won't be able to get off of your oral therapies. Also with VYALEV, when you look at the maintenance phase, dyskinesia rates are very low. And with the competitor you mentioned, they're roughly 15% up to 30%. The other benefit of VYALEV from a competitive standpoint is we see less than a 5% rate of sedation. And with apomorphine, it's around 20%. And also VYALEV, we have limited headaches, and this is in the teens with apomorphine. Also, another benefit of VYALEV is no warnings for orthostatic hypertension or falls that can't be said about the competitor. And also, we have very low rates in no need for treatment for nausea. And with apomorphine initiation, you need an antiemetic and often that need to be taken 3 times a day. So as Jeff stated, I think we're very well positioned from a competitive standpoint with VYALEV for all the reasons I just mentioned. And then I think it's very important that we mentioned tavapadon. I spoke about just it's being submitted. And this will be a very nice complement to VYALEV as a monotherapy and as an adjunct. It's a once-a-day profile that has a long half-life, and it's going to allow patients to optimize their regimen before the need to moving to advanced therapies. And where our clinicians are excited about differentiation from existing oral generics is the efficacy, which approaches levodopa-carbidopa and the safety profile, that could be a key differentiator, and that's what our experts are telling us about. Specifically impulse control disorders, just around 1%. We've seen others reach as high as 30% or 40%. Immediate -- people fall asleep with this one, sedation is less than 5%, dyskinesia around 2% and peripheral edema, which can be quite a nuisance with the generic molecules and very difficult to treat even if you use potent diuretics, we don't see that as a problem, 1% or less with tavapadon. So we think for efficacy, safety, tolerability reasons, it has a chance to differentiate and again, a very nice complement to VYALEV.",494.0,205.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.01951219512195122,0.01951219512195122,0.01951219512195122,0.0,0.004878048780487805,0.0

So you're right, Humira continues to erode and step down this year with our guidance, it's going to step down just over -- in the U.S., just over $4 billion. Certainly, that step down in absolute dollars will diminish and will diminish next year as well, of course, given the math. We will see, certainly, though, significant percentage erosion from this year to next year as well. That will continue to erode as the tail starts to form in '26. So when you look at the business, I mean, the business has a number of strong drivers. You've seen the growth of the business today. I think that one thing that we've spoken about several times is our long-term guidance for high single-digit growth through the decade. That will be from the growth that we have this year, we've talked about that accelerating as we hit that. And we still remain extremely confident in our ability to achieve that high single-digit growth through the decade on the top line. The bottom line will continue to expand. This year, our EPS is roughly in line, a little bit ahead of the earnings growth, but we're going to have operating margin expansion driven by leverage and efficiencies in the SG&A line.

In immunology, our IBD platform will start reading out data next year. This is in combination with Skyrizi, looking at those combos versus monotherapy Skyrizi. Lutikizumab is one of those and the other is our own alpha4beta7-382. So we'll start seeing that data next year. Also in combination with lutikizumab plus [ Arava ] in rheumatoid arthritis, that will be something else to look for. And then maybe turning to oncology for a moment. For Temab-A, we've -- I went through a variety of different positive readouts. Also next year, expect to readout in head and neck cancer and even ovarian cancer, which many of these patients have high c-MET expression, along with etentamig in a variety of different combinations in multiple myeloma. And then our next-gen coming after Elahere, our biparatopic FR alpha antibody 151, we'll start seeing readouts there in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. And then also next year, we're excited about our -- using our bispecific technology that we spoke about in immunology, along with our linker and warhead technology from oncology putting those together, we have a bispecific ADC that binds to PSMA and STEAP for prostate cancer. And that's another one, I would say, to look for next year. And then in neuroscience, we have our follow-on to VRAYLAR-932. We'll start seeing data in bipolar depression, probably moving into '27, looking for generalized anxiety disorder. And then we'll also be able to give an update on emraclidine we're currently conducting a multi-ascending dose trial to see if we can move the dose above 30 milligrams, and that has already initiated, and we'll be able to give an update on where the dose lands. And once it does, we can start moving into Phase II programs there in schizophrenia as an adjunct and potentially as a monotherapy along with psychosis associated with neurodegeneration. And then on the obesity front, the Phase I study will get data in the first half of next year from healthy volunteers looking at different starting doses and different titration schemes. However, these patients will have normal BMI, and we've already seen reasonable weight loss there at 6 weeks. So we'll also have 12-week data. The other thing, Dave, I'll mention is we're starting a Phase Ib program late this year, maybe into January when we get everything started. But that will also look at our 295 Amylin asset, but the difference will be -- different titrations and in patients that have obesity.

GCA, which is the smallest of the next set of indications is performing really well and overall helping great momentum in rheumatology. So then when we look at basically the, let's say, the next big 4, okay? So you have alopecia areata, vitiligo, as you highlighted, HS, as Steve highlighted, and then lupus, we've looked and sized those that, that revenue potential is at least $2 billion at peak. So we continue to work through, given as we look at the data, we watch the market develop like how they will sort of adapt and change over time. I can say that the alopecia data was quite striking. I mean it's quite striking relative to the standard of care, Ig, other JAKs that are out there. So we're going through the sizing issue. We certainly see that there are different segments of vitiligo like the high body surface area is more amenable to, let's say, a JAK inhibitor like Rinvoq, which will be the first systemic.

You're right, the price in the U.K., the list price is similar to the U.S. One of the aspects that we are looking at is how basically because of the most favored nation and other global pricing dynamics, how that may or may not change our approaches around the world. Certainly, we would like to see reforms in many of the European countries, whether they are clawback systems or even the way that the HTAs work because we do think that these medicines should be more highly valued. So exactly how that will ultimately play out, certainly, some of the early discussions with the administration are around basically more stable and equitable pricing around G7 inclusive of Switzerland and Denmark. So all of that strategies are basically in place. Ultimately, how that will play out, we're going to continue to see.

What -- maybe some benefits and then we can talk about our plans. We have an opportunity to optimize that dose. It's also an off-the-shelf therapy. We also see rapid expression and also transient expression. So over time, that could have some safety advantages, especially if you can deplete the pathogenic B cells and then the naive B cell population repopulates and you don't have the CAR on board any longer, and that's the advantage of the mRNA therapy. In the early Phase I, we have observed B cell depletion. And the other benefit is no need for lymphodepletion. So taken together, this could be a very exciting opportunity for patients. So next steps is to continue dosing in the first-in-human studies. And then I would say, next year, once we have a handle on dosing, we'll start looking at patients starting on the rheumatology side of things like RA and lupus. And if it works similar to ex vivo CAR-T, we think patients can have very deep and durable remissions, which could be very, very important and certainly raises the bar and breaks through existing efficacy ceilings. So that's, I would say, on Capstan. On the oral side, the Nimble acquisition, these are macrocyclic molecules, the ones that we're focusing on, the attempt there is to make them as potent as possible and to extend the half-life. I think the current issue we see with certain oral platforms is that the half-life is very limited. We think a benefit would be to extend that half-life. So those are the 2 things that are going on. The lead candidates right now are an oral IL-23 and a TL1A. And when it comes to our IBD platform, with the combination, the higher the efficacy, the better, obviously. But many of these patients that we'll see will be second line and potentially even third line because lines of treatment are continuing to expand. You have many patients that have already received anti-TNFs in IBD, and you see medicines like Skyrizi also starting to penetrate into that front line. And if that's not working, then you have JAK inhibitors like Rinvoq. So we'd be studying a relatively refractory population. So if you can get 10-plus points better on the higher, the better, I think that would be a huge benefit because breaking through where current efficacy stands today has really been the challenge. And I would say some of the best assets we have are currently Rinvoq and Skyrizi.",448.0,195.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.046153846153846156,0.020512820512820513,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564

And then you also have line of therapy expansion. So they are very, very buoyant because there's significant headroom and unmet need. To give you the bookend, when you look at biopenetration, I'm going to give you the U.S. biopenetration rates roughly and the European and Asia are lower generally based on the way those markets are developing. The highest biopenetration rates are in Crohn's disease, which is above 50%. So you still have quite a few patients in a very severe disease that have not been exposed to a biologic. And these are in the moderate to severe segmentation. On the very low end, you have a super dynamic market, which is atopic dermatitis, incredible high unmet need that just basically with the availability of drugs like Dupixent and Rinvoq, that may be in the high single-digit biopenetration for moderate to severe. So new technologies are going to help. Communications are going to help, a line of therapy is going to help.

I think when we look at Skyrizi, first of all, the psoriasis data are very strong. Just to think about some of the numbers that we have, by week 16, if you're looking at clear or almost clear, you're approaching 90%. If you're looking at week 52, PASI 90, that's at 80%. And if you're at PASI 100, that's at 60%. So these are very, very high efficacy. And you also see over time, if you're an early PASI responder, the majority of these folks are going to maintain over the course of the year and beyond. And even if there is treatment withdrawal, and that's one thing I was getting at with why we like Nimble of potential half-life extension is that if you take oral, some people may miss some doses. And if you have a very short half-life, your treatment withdrawal data will sync very quickly. And if you miss many doses, you will lose effect. And with Skyrizi, and actually, this is even in our label, if you stop dosing for 1 year, you still have 60% of patients that are clear or almost clear. Now if you keep dosing, obviously, you'll get to that 80% to 90% range. So I think it's important just to set up where is Skyrizi today, and you have this opportunity to have quarterly dosing. So the patients have a chance to forget that they have psoriasis, and they don't have to worry about when they eat their meals or how long they need to be fasting. The other benefit is Skyrizi has what I would like to say is head-to-toe benefits, and these are all statistically significant readouts. What do I mean by that? That means palmoplantar, that means scalp and genital across the board. The other insight about psoriasis is about 30% or so will have psoriatic arthritis. So they'll have joint disease. And now with Skyrizi, we have 5 years of data where 88 -- approaching 90% of patients do not have x-ray progression. And I would say taking in totality, that gives you -- gives us a benefit to continue to be very competitive, whether you're talking about another injectable or even an oral. And the oral, as Jeff has stated, will have uptake like many of these assets because psoriasis, unlike IBD, is still quite underpenetrated, and it's a growing market.

We were having discussions before the July 31 letter and have had more discussions since. I'd say we are aligned on the need to address global freeloading and have been working closely with the USTR on ways to address that, which ultimately, I think a Section 301 investigation in unfair practices will be important as we partner with the administration to make progress in terms of pricing outside the U.S. We're open to expanding direct-to-patient models where it makes sense beyond what we already have in place with our Synthroid direct program.

We know that our middle-income consumers, particularly for BOTOX and toxins are also on the sidelines. So we monitor sort of their posture relative to sort of seeking particularly new treatment with the toxin, which is the leading indicator for the facial injectable business.

You look at neuroscience, there's novel mechanisms for mood disorders and Alzheimer's that we've licensed in. And we have a very compelling siRNA platform that can generate opportunities across all 3 of those therapeutic areas.
