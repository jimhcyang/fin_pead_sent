Cruz Announces the Filing of a Securities Class Action on Behalf of AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) Investors
LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Law Offices of Frank R. Cruz announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired AbbVie Inc. (“AbbVie” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ABBV) securities between April 30, 2021 and August 31, 2021, inclusive (the “Class Period”). AbbVie investors have until June 6, 2022, to file a lead plaintiff motion. If you are a shareholder who suffered a loss, click here to participate. AbbVie’s Janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitor drug, Rinvoq, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”). In 2020, AbbVie sought regulatory approval to expand the indications for Rinvoq. On June 25, 2021, AbbVie disclosed that the FDA would not complete its review of several of the expanded treatment indications for Rinvoq within the previously-announced timeframe due to its ongoing evaluation of safety concerns associated with other JAK inhibitor drugs. On this news, AbbVie’s common stock fell $1.76, or 1.5%, to close at $112.98 per share on June 25, 2021, thereby injuring investors. Then, on September 1, 2021, the FDA announced that the safety trials for another JAK inhibitor drug, Xeljanz, had established an increased risk of serious adverse events, even with low doses, and determined that new and updated warnings would be required for those drugs as well as for Rinvoq, as it shares “similar mechanisms of action” and “may have similar risks.” The FDA also disclosed that it would further limit approved indications for Rinvoq as a result of safety concerns. On this news, AbbVie’s common stock fell $8.51, or 7%, to close at $112.27 per share on September 1, 2021, thereby injuring investors further. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) safety concerns about Xeljanz extended to Rinvoq and other JAK inhibitors; (2) as a result, it was likely that the FDA would require additional safety warnings for Rinvoq and would delay the approval of additional treatment indications for Rinvoq; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. Follow us for updates on Twitter: twitter.com/FRC_LAW. If you purchased AbbVie securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than June 6, 2022 to ask the Court to appoint you as lead plaintiff. To be a member of the Class you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the Class.

NEW ORLEANS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Former Attorney General of Louisiana, Charles C. Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (“KSF”), announces that KSF continues its investigation into AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV). Throughout the first half of 2021, the Company promoted its drug product, Rinvoq, a Janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”). During this time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced warnings resulting from studies of another JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz, which the Company downplayed as unrelated to Rinvoq. In September 2021, the FDA ordered “new and updated warnings” for Xeljanz, as well as other JAK inhibitors including Rinvoq, “since they share mechanisms of action with Xeljanz.” On December 3, 2021, the Company announced the updated warning for Rinvoq to include “additional information about the risks of malignancy and thrombosis, and the addition of mortality and MACE (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke) risks within the Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions sections.” The Company was subsequently sued in a securities class action lawsuit for failing to disclose material information, violating federal securities laws, which remains ongoing. KSF’s investigation is focusing on whether AbbVie’s officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company’s shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws. If you have information that would assist KSF in its investigation, or have been a long-term holder of AbbVie shares and would like to discuss your legal rights, you may, without obligation or cost to you, call toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or email KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn (lewis.kahn@ksfcounsel.com), or visit https://www.ksfcounsel.com/cases/nyse-abbv/ to learn more.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Genmab A/S (Nasdaq: GMAB) today announced that AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) will submit a conditional marketing authorization application (MAA) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for subcutaneous epcoritamab (DuoBody®-CD3xCD20), an investigational bispecific antibody, for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), in the second half of 2022. Genmab recently announced that the company will submit a biologics license application (BLA) for epcoritamab with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), also in the second half of 2022. The MAA submission is supported by results from the large b-cell lymphoma (LBCL) cohort of the pivotal EPCORE™ NHL-1 open-label, multi-center trial evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of epcoritamab in patients with relapsed, progressive or refractory CD20+ mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), including DLBCL. In April 2022, Genmab and AbbVie announced the topline results from the Phase II expansion part of the EPCORE™ NHL-1 trial. In June 2022, primary results were presented in a late-breaking oral presentation as part of the Presidential Symposium at the 27th Annual Meeting of the European Hematology Association (EHA2022) in Vienna, Austria. “The MAA submission will mark the next step towards potentially obtaining marketing approval in Europe and being able to deliver a new therapeutic option to patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Genmab. “While there are existing treatments for DLBCL patients across Europe, we recognize the significant medical need for alternative therapeutic options for patients unable to tolerate current treatments or whose treatments have failed.” Epcoritamab is being co-developed by Genmab and AbbVie as part of the companies' oncology collaboration. The companies will share commercial responsibilities in the U.S. and Japan, with AbbVie responsible for further global commercialization. The companies are committed to evaluating epcoritamab as a monotherapy, and in combination, across lines of therapy in a range of hematologic malignancies, including an ongoing phase 3, open-label, randomized trial evaluating epcoritamab as a monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL (NCT: 04628494). About Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) DLBCL is a fast-growing type of NHL that affects B-cell lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. DLBCL, the most common type of NHL worldwide, accounts for about 25 percent of diagnosed cases of B-cell NHL worldwide. DLBCL can arise in lymph nodes as well as in organs outside of the lymphatic system. The disease occurs more commonly in the elderly and is slightly more prevalent in men.i,ii About the EPCORE™ NHL-1 Trial EPCORE™ NHL-1 is an open-label, multi-center safety and preliminary efficacy trial of epcoritamab including a phase 1 first-in-human, dose escalation part; a phase 2 expansion part; and an optimization part. The trial was designed to evaluate subcutaneous epcoritamab in patients with relapsed, progressive or refractory CD20+ mature B-NHL, including LBCL and DLBCL. Data from the dose escalation part of the study, which determined the recommended phase 2 dose, were published in The Lancet in 2021. In the phase 2 expansion part, additional patients are treated with epcoritamab to further explore the safety and efficacy of epcoritamab in patients with different types of relapsed/refractory B-NHLs who had limited therapeutic options. The primary endpoint of the phase 2 expansion part was overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by an IRC. Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of response, complete response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, time to response, time to next therapy, and rate of minimal residual disease negativity. About Epcoritamab Epcoritamab is an investigational IgG1-bispecific antibody created using Genmab's proprietary DuoBody technology. Genmab's DuoBody-CD3 technology is designed to direct cytotoxic T cells selectively to elicit an immune response towards target cell types. Epcoritamab is designed to simultaneously bind to CD3 on T cells and CD20 on B-cells and induces T cell mediated killing of CD20+ cells.iii CD20 is expressed on B-cells and a clinically validated therapeutic target in many B-cell malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.iv,v About Genmab Genmab is an international biotechnology company with a core purpose to improve the lives of people with cancer.

NEW ORLEANS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Former Attorney General of Louisiana, Charles C. Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (“KSF”), announces that KSF continues its investigation into AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV). Throughout the first half of 2021, the Company promoted its drug product, Rinvoq, a Janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”). During this time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced warnings resulting from studies of another JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz, which the Company downplayed as unrelated to Rinvoq. In September 2021, the FDA ordered “new and updated warnings” for Xeljanz, as well as other JAK inhibitors including Rinvoq, “since they share mechanisms of action with Xeljanz.” On December 3, 2021, the Company announced the updated warning for Rinvoq to include “additional information about the risks of malignancy and thrombosis, and the addition of mortality and MACE (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke) risks within the Boxed Warnings and Warnings and Precautions sections.” The Company was subsequently sued in a securities class action lawsuit for failing to disclose material information, violating federal securities laws, which remains ongoing. KSF’s investigation is focusing on whether AbbVie’s officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company’s shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws.

CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A nationwide class of consumers sued AbbVie, alleging the pharmaceutical company engaged in a fraudulent scheme to inflate the cost of the highest-grossing drug in the world, Humira, by 470% over the last two decades, according to attorneys at Hagens Berman and Carella Byrne Cecchi Brody Agnello. The lawsuit was filed April 25, 2023, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and accuses AbbVie of engaging in a scheme to artificially inflate the cost of Humira to levels far out of step with manufacturing costs and in violation of consumer protection laws. The suit alleges that AbbVie repeatedly raised the publicly listed price paid by consumers, while offering pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) lower, undisclosed net prices for Humira. PBMs distribute drugs to pharmacies, and then pocket a portion of the difference between publicly listed prices and the private net price they pay for a drug. The larger that spread between prices, the more PBMs profit, and the lawsuit alleges that AbbVie exploited this covert arrangement to charge consumers outrageously high prices for Humira. If you bought Humira either at full price or with co-insurance since 2013, find out your rights. “A Poster Child for Excessive and Anticompetitive Drug Pricing” Humira is approved to treat various autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn’s disease and plaque psoriasis. It is the largest selling prescription drug in the world, according to the complaint. The lawsuit cites a U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform investigation into Humira, which found that AbbVie charges approximately $77,000 for a year’s supply of Humira and has increased prices 27 times since the drug’s introduction, with total price increases amounting to a 470% hike since 2003. The lawsuit states that in 2020 alone, Humira generated $16 billion in U.S. net revenue for AbbVie, and the House investigation also found that senior executive bonuses at AbbVie were directly tied to Humira’s net revenue, allowing them to profit personally from the price hikes. Over the last five years, executives at AbbVie made over $340 million. AbbVie did not initially cooperate with the House investigation into Humira, and only provided requested documents to the Committee under threat of subpoena, according to the complaint. The lawsuit states, “…the industry’s excessive prices and anticompetitive practices are not justified by the need for innovation and have been used to enrich company executives and shareholders; the pricing of Humira is a poster child for this problem.” How AbbVie Games the System According to the lawsuit, AbbVie was able to make record-breaking profits from Humira by exploiting the U.S. healthcare system. The pharmaceutical company has reduced the price of Humira internationally, the complaint states, even as prices have spiraled out of control in the U.S., where the government cannot negotiate directly with drug companies to lower prices. The complaint alleges that AbbVie deliberately widened a secret gap between the list price of Humira—the price that patients and their insurance companies pay for a drug—and the undisclosed net price, which is paid by the PBMs. PBMs retain a percentage of the list price plus some rebates. In exchange, PBMs confer Humira with formulary status, a designation which makes insurance companies more likely to pay full price for a drug. The wider the difference between these two figures, the more the PBMs profit, and this arrangement in no way benefits drug purchasers, or reflects the real cost of manufacturing the prescription. Rather than paying for the medication at competitive net rates that are offered to PBMs, consumers are left to pay the artificially inflated rates, according to the lawsuit. A named plaintiff in the suit, Edward Camargo, started taking Humira at age 19 to treat his psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. By age 26, he was no longer covered by his father’s insurance, and his new insurance refused to pay for Humira due to its high cost. Faced with the prohibitively high price of Humira, Camargo had to quit taking the drug, and he experienced tremendous pain as a result, the lawsuit says. He developed dry scaley skin that cracked and bled. Camargo is now on a different prescription which helps alleviate some symptoms but says he would prefer to take Humira if he could afford it, according to the complaint. “It is unfortunate that executives at AbbVie are profiting hand over fist while people all over the country can’t afford the medication they need to live happy and healthy lives.” Said Berman. The lawsuit brings 38 counts against the pharmaceutical company, including violation of the Illinois and other state consumer protection laws.

SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) 2025 hasn’t been a smooth ride. The economy has seen volatility, the market has seen several ups and downs, and investors are scrambling to look for low-risk options to invest their money. There are concerns about the impact of tariffs, and consumer spending is low. Amidst the uncertainty, the only way to invest is to look for low-volatility investment options that can generate steady income. Exchange-traded funds have emerged as one of the top investment options this year. They allow investors to own a collection of stocks with just one investment and at a low cost. I was a die-hard fan of mutual funds, but the returns weren’t satisfactory, which is why I decided to make a switch to ETFs. With thousands of ETFs to choose from, it can become overwhelming, and the industry is getting more crowded. Here are the top 3 I invested in. SPDR Gold Shares Gold has always been considered a hedge against inflation, and the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) ETF is a top choice amid uncertain markets. Launched by State Street Global Advisors, the ETF is traded on exchanges in Hong Kong, Mexico, Japan, and Singapore. It is a trust that purchases, stores, and sells gold bullion, allowing investors to capitalize on rising gold prices. It has a low expense ratio of 0.40% and is the largest gold ETF in the market. Its NAV has soared over 40% in a year and about 12% in five years. The fund launched in 2004 and has kept pace with the S&amp;P 500 over the years. Gold prices will fluctuate in the short term, but the past year has seen a steady upside. Geopolitical tensions and the expanding money supply have lifted the commodity’s value. GLD is a defensive investment, and it brings stability to my portfolio. It is easier for me to pay the annual management fee as compared to buying and storing gold bullion. This ETF has become a centrepiece of my portfolio. Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF A reliable dividend ETF by Vanguard, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSE: VYM) has a strong history of delivering steady income and capital appreciation. It has an expense ratio of 0.06% and it tracks the performance of FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. VYM has a yield of 2.57% and holds 582 stocks. The sector distribution includes: Financials: 21.50% Industrials: 13.40% Technology: 12.30% Healthcare: 12.10% It holds some of the biggest dividend paying companies in the top 10, including Walmart, AbbVie, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Exxon Mobil. The ETF pays quarterly dividends, and the strong portfolio allows it to remain consistent at it. VYM has generated double-digit annualized market returns with a return of 10.4% in 5 years and 12.4% in the past year. The fund is filled with large-cap stocks that have a stable balance sheet and a record of strong financial performance. Despite market volatility, the fund has remained resilient and outperformed the S&amp;P 500. It offers a safety net and steady dividend income. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) I believe in the future of tech and wanted to make the most of the sector. Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) allows me to do that. It holds the Magnificent Seven and has a yield of 0.58%. The fund is known for its impressive capital appreciation. QQQ tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100 index and has the 100 largest companies listed on the stock exchange. It aims for high growth while providing exposure to the best U.S. non-financial companies. It is a tech-focused ETF with over 50% allocation to tech stocks, followed by 19.66% in consumer staples and 5.80% in healthcare. It is top heavy with the 10 holdings making up 51% of the portfolio and these include the Magnificent Seven like Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Apple. Slightly on the expensive side, QQQ has an NAV of 530.82 and is up 16% in 12 months. The NAV has soared over 100% in the past five years, generating impressive gains for investors. As long as the tech sector continues to expand, QQQ is set to benefit.
