    "text": "Apple Inc. AAPL reportedly continues to explore AirPods with tiny infrared cameras. What Happened: In his latest \"Power On\" newsletter, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman fleetingly mentioned camera-equipped AirPods while reporting about Cupertino's wearables development. While he did not dwell on the use cases of the camera, it clearly indicated that the development is still on the cards. According to previous reports, these tiny infrared cameras are expected to deliver an enhanced spatial audio experience, especially in combination with Vision Pro headset. See Also: Jeff Bezos-Backed Perplexity Revises TikTok Merger Deal, Proposes Giving US Government 50% Stake: Report Reports also indicated that the cameras would allow users to leverage sound sources based on head movements while watching videos with the headset. Moreover, they could enable “in-air gesture control,” allowing users to interact with devices through hand movements. Mass production of these AirPods will reportedly begin by 2026 with a potential release in 2026 or 2027. Apple has yet to confirm any such plan. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: The AirPods lineup is a critical component of Apple's wearables, home, and accessories category. It generated $9.04 billion in revenue during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 which represents a slight decline from $9.32 billion in the same period in 2023. Apple continues to maintain its leadership in the true wireless stereo (TWS) market, holding a 17% market share as of the third quarter of 2024. However, this represents a sharp decline from 48.1% in 2019, according to Statista. Price Action: Apple stock declined 0.39% on Friday, closing at $222.78, and fell an additional 0.27% in after-hours trading, according to Benzinga Pro data.

    "site": "http://feeds.benzinga.com",
    "text": "Vice President JD Vance, who was backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, has voiced his concerns about the influence of big tech companies, asserting that these companies wield “too much power.” What Happened: Speaking on “Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan” on Saturday, Vance was asked about the prominent presence of tech leaders at Donald Trump’s inauguration. This included names like Meta Platforms, Inc.’s META Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com, Inc.’s AMZN Jeff Bezos, Tesla Inc.’s TSLA Elon Musk, Apple Inc.’s AAPL Tim Cook, and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG GOOGL Sundar Pichai. To illustrate his point, the Vice President noted that the tech leaders did not receive preferential seating over his mother or other supporters. “We believe fundamentally that big tech does have too much power.” See Also: Nvidia Stock Slides Overnight On Robinhood As China’s DeepSeek Sparks Doubts Over GPU Spending Frenzy — Chamath Palihapitiya Highlights Report Indicating AI Holy Grail Cracked He stressed the importance of tech companies respecting constitutional rights and halting censorship and cautioned that Trump’s administration would not look kindly on non-compliance. Why It Matters: The tech sector played a crucial role in Trump’s 2024 election victory, with Musk investing significantly in support of Trump and other Republicans. Trump appointed Musk to lead a new agency focused on reducing federal spending. Other tech leaders also engaged with Trump, visiting Mar-a-Lago before the inauguration. Vance has been vocal about his desire to break up large tech companies, particularly Google's parent company Alphabet. Interestingly, the Vice President had a powerful Silicon Valley backer in the share of Thiel who has also funded his 2022 Ohio campaign with $15 million. Image via Shutterstock",

    "text": "MIDDLETOWN, NJ — Here are new details on the sex assault charge against Justin McGhee, the Middletown North girls' basketball coach accused of engaging in a sexual relationship with an underage female student. It was in December that a Middletown Police detective first received a report that McGhee was having an inappropriate relationship with a student, according to an affidavit the Monmouth County Prosecutor released Thursday. That first allegation did not name the student, according to the affidavit. On Jan. 26 that same detective received another report, this time from a Middletown school official, and alleging McGhee had inappropriate contact with a student. The school district received word of the allegations via email, said police. According to the affidavit, after the second allegation was made, Middletown Police discovered a report of a \"suspicious\" incident in another town, where McGhee was found with a teenage girl in a car after midnight. The teen girl, under the age of 18, was enrolled in the Middletown public school system. Middletown Police then interviewed the girls' parents and then the girl herself, who told police she and the teacher had been involved in a relationship that turned sexual, according to the affidavit. Middletown Police also interviewed McGhee at Middletown Police headquarters, who \"confessed to the sexual relationship with the student, specifically stating that the encounters sexual in nature occurred in the basement of his house,\" according to the affidavit. McGhee, who lives in Ocean Township, was arrested Tuesday and taken to the Monmouth County jail. He is charged with second-degree sexual assault and second-degree child endangerment. McGhee is also a gym/health teacher at Middletown North, and an assistant football coach for the Middletown North Lions. The district placed him on paid administrative leave after he was arrested, pending the outcome of the criminal charges against him. The inappropriate relationship between McGhee and the teen began late last year, allege Middletown Police. His Apple iPhone and Apple Watch were also seized by Middletown Police to be searched for evidence. Wednesday's report: Middletown North Basketball Coach Charged With Sex Assault Of Student Patch incorrectly reported in an initial version of this story that Middletown Police did not investigate the first allegation in December. That is incorrect, said the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office. They did investigate. Middletown Police released this statement Thursday night after this article was published: On January 30, 2025, Patch published an article titled “Middletown Police Notified Twice of Sex Allegations Against Teacher,” with a phrase in the first paragraph erroneously reporting that the Middletown Township Police Department failed to investigate the initial report that led to criminal charges being filed in this case. That is demonstrably false. While Patch has since reworded this portion of the article and also published a correction, additional clarification is now necessary. The rush to publish this article before fact checking and final approval by the reporter and or editorial staff proved to be irresponsible journalism. Due to the ongoing nature of this investigation, Middletown Twp. Police cannot comment on case-specific facts and events that led to the arrest of Justin McGhee, 35, of Ocean Twp. However, the initially published portrayal of the investigation in this article was highly speculative and again, inaccurate. Upon receipt of the initial report, police initiated an investigation. However, due to the very limited information provided there was insufficient evidence to indicate that any crime had been committed. Furthermore, at no time did any of the information provided to the police identify the victim, nor did either report indicate that McGhee’s actions were sexual in nature. Ultimately, upon receipt of the secondary report, police were able to go forward with the investigation, which culminated in the arrest of McGhee, less than 24 hours later. Middletown Police Police Chief R. Craig Weber stated, “This agency takes crimes of this nature very seriously and thoroughly investigates each and every tip or allegation of criminal activity to the fullest extent possible. Any report or suggestion to the contrary is patently false. This police department will always take every step necessary to safeguard and protect the community.” Anyone with additional information pertaining to this investigation is urged to contact Detective Ricardo Cruz at (732) 615-2120 or Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office Det. David Sidorakis at (800) 533-7443. Contact Patch reporter Carly Baldwin at Carly.baldwin@patch.com.",

    "text": "Brookside Energy Ltd sits in a strong cash position for the quarter, achieving A$21.1 million in cash receipts from sales, with net operating cash flow surging 667% quarter-on-quarter to A$12.2 million. Record operating cash flow, along with A$3.1 million in additional cash inflows, partially offset the A$19.0 million in capital expenditure related to the FMDP. As a result, the company ended the period with a strong cash balance of A$11.3 million. The strong financial performance demonstrates the company’s strong operational performance. Brookside Energy project locations in the Anadarko Basin. Brookside successfully completed its Field Development Management Plan (FMDP) ahead of schedule and under budget, with the remaining capital expenditure (CAPEX) settled during the quarter. The total FMDP CAPEX amounted to approximately A$36 million net to Brookside, reflecting a ~15% saving against the initial budget. This investment was primarily funded through cash reserves and operational cash flow, demonstrating the company's financial discipline and efficiency in executing large-scale projects. With the FMDP wells now operational, Group Net Production reached a record 226,189 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), with liquids comprising 67%, for the December quarter—representing a 129% increase quarter-on-quarter. This record output enabled the company to meet its fourth-quarter production forecast, with Net Production averaging 2,459 BOE per day. The four FMDP wells delivered combined gross initial production (IP) rates of 4,330 BOE per day over 24 hours (IP24) and 3,761 BOE per day over 30 days (IP30), with liquids yields of around 80%. On a normalised basis, a single well with a 10,000-foot lateral produced around 1,400 BOE per day gross for IP24 and 1,200 BOE per day gross for IP30. These results align with those of the Flames Well, the parent well in the FMDP. Brookside increased its average working interest in FMDP wells to approximately 70%, securing a larger share of production revenue and enhancing profitability. Operated SWISH Play wells recorded gross production of 392,435 BOE during the quarter, bringing cumulative production to 2.5 million BOE as of December 31, 2024. Cumulative production for SWISH operated wells normalised to a notional 10,000-foot lateral and cumulative gross production as at December 31, 2024 for the SWISH operated wells. Production growth remained strong despite the Jewell and Flames wells undergoing expected recovery to pre-shut-in levels following temporary shut-ins during the quarter. These measures were implemented to mitigate potential interference from Continental Resources’ Gapstow full-field development (FFD) near the Jewell well and FMDP operations near the Flames well. SWISH Project well locations. The Continental Resources-operated Gapstow Full Field Development (FFD) started production and sales during the quarter, delivering strong initial rates. Production volumes and associated cash receipts will be recognised in subsequent quarters. Production is expected to contribute around 150BOE/per day (70% liquids) net to Brookside over an initial two years as well as boosting PDP reserves. Production by quarter net to Brookside’s Working Interest and net of royalties. The company advanced preparations for its planned listing of securities via American Depositary Shares (ADSs) on the NYSE American exchange. Brookside also completed its share capital consolidation, with shares resuming normal trading on 25 October 2024. Building on its 2024 operational success, Brookside outlined its 2025 strategy, prioritising inventory growth and targeted drilling. Plans include three new SWISH Play 10,000-foot lateral horizontal wells, with the first well set to spud in Q1 2025. Pre-spud activities, such as pad selection, surface agreements and regulatory approvals, are already underway.

The company submitted its ethics and regulatory data package, supporting expected first patient treatment in Q1 CY2025 The quarter also marked continued transformation within Race’s leadership, with the appointment of Dr Megan Baldwin, founder and chief innovation officer of Opthea, as an independent non-executive director, effective January 1, 2025. Dr Baldwin previously served as CEO and managing director of Opthea for a decade, overseeing the progression of its lead asset from preclinical development to global Phase 3 trials. Race also expanded its scientific team with the appointments of Dr Kirsten Curnow and Dr Sumit Shani. “I wish to warmly welcome Megan, Kirsten and Sumit to Race. The ability to attract such outstanding professionals is a testament to the strength of our team and the exciting potential of our work,” RAC CEO Dr Daniel Tillett said. “Like everyone at Race I am looking forward to us treating the first patient with RC220 soon and translating bisantrene’s potential into meaningful outcomes for cancer patients and our shareholders.” Significant progress was made toward initiating a Phase 1 trial of RC220 in combination with doxorubicin for patients with advanced solid tumours. The company submitted the ethics and regulatory package to Bellberry Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) in early December. In late December, Bellberry HREC requested minor clarifications, which were addressed in mid-January 2025. Pending final ethics and governance approvals, site activation and first patient recruitment are anticipated in Q1 CY2025. Race also announced the discovery of 39 unique FTO protein-binding molecules identified using state-of-the-art NMR fragment screening. The identified compounds are confirmed FTO-binding chemical structures for the development of novel FTO targeting drugs and provide valuable new IP, aiding the development of novel m6A RNA epigenetic pathway drugs. This FTO-targeted drug discovery program was completed in collaboration with the Monash University Fragment Platform (MFP).

    "text": "During the last quarter of 2024 Firebird Metals Ltd was busy across its key projects, making progress on its Chinese LMFP battery strategy and forging partnerships to develop the Oakover manganese project in Western Australia. During the quarter, Firebird’s subsidiary, Hunan Firebird Battery Technology Co., Ltd. (HFBT), received preliminary design approval from the Jinshi High-Tech Industrial Park Committee for its proposed battery-grade high-purity manganese sulphate plant in Jinshi, Hunan, China. In less than 12 months since its incorporation, HFBT has secured all critical permits and remains on schedule and within budget. In a key technological breakthrough, Firebird’s pilot calcining kiln demonstrated energy savings of up to 70% compared to conventional kilns, reducing energy consumption to 80-100 kWh per tonne of feed. This equates to a cost reduction of US$30 per tonne, or 5% of total production costs. Firebird entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Central South University to develop a processing method for Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate (LMFP) as a cathode active material (CAM). This further strengthens its LMFP strategy. Early-stage test work is set to begin at Firebird’s R&D centre in Jinshi, with initial results expected in Q1 2025. Firebird signed an agreement with the Karlka Nyiyaparli Aboriginal Corporation (KNAC) concerning Mining Lease 52/1086. This agreement covers key commercial considerations, including financial benefits upon production, as well as cultural heritage protection and environmental management. Oakover remains central to Firebird’s long-term strategy, providing ore for its battery-grade manganese sulphate plants. Key workstreams for the next 12 months will focus on environmental studies and securing necessary regulatory approvals. Firebird completed the farm-out of an 80% interest in its Direct Shipping Ore (DSO) Manganese Assets in Western Australia’s East Pilbara region to Macro Metals Limited (ASX: M4M). The agreement includes minimum expenditure commitments and drilling requirements, allowing Firebird to focus on its core manganese projects. As of December 31, 2024, Firebird held a cash position of A$3.1 million. The company also received A$889,546 through the Australian Government’s R&D Tax Incentive program, bolstering its financial reserves.

    "text": "Peninsula Energy Ltd expects to begin regulatory inspections and commissioning of the central processing plant (CPP) at the Lance Uranium Project in Wyoming, US, in the June quarter of 2025. The company also expects to begin production of the first dry yellowcake in the same quarter, once elution, precipitation and filtration circuits are sequentially commissioned in advance. Peninsula has previously forecast commissioning at the end of the March quarter, but challenging weather conditions and supply chain issues necessitated the re-schedule to later in the year, which may also affect production guidance for the calendar year. PEN says its board has been frustrated with the delay, working closely with contractors Samuel Engineering, Inc and Samuel EPC, LLC to conclude the project as quickly as possible. The company has been loading uranium onto resin for elution since December last year and will be looking into short term options to store the resin until the commissioning of the CPP is completed. As part of his planned on-boarding, newly appointed managing director George Bauk will be on site in Wyoming from Monday February 3 for an extended period to oversee the ongoing commissioning and ramp-up phase. The board believes it is likely that 2025 calendar year production guidance will need to be revised downward from previous forecasts of 600,000 pounds of uranium. With a cash balance of US$44.9 million at the end of last year, the company is well equipped to negotiate with providers of additional funding to decrease liquidity risk during the important commissioning and ramp-up phase over the course of CY2025.

    "text": "With new CEO James McDonnell in place and FDA clearance for its Investigational New Drug application, 2025 could be a signpost year for Prescient Therapeutics as it continues to develop PTX-100. It was a big December quarter for the company after its IND application for the PTX-100 Phase 2 clinical trial in r/rCTCL was successfully cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), allowing for the study's immediate initiation Significant progress was also made in the clinical development of CellPryme and re-engineering of OmniCAR, with growing collaboration interest from channel and R&D partners. The company had a cash and term deposit balance of $8.4 million at December 31, with an additional $3.7 million R&D Tax Incentive Rebate received on January 10. Prescient received clearance from the FDA for its IND application, allowing the Phase 2 clinical trial of PTX-100 to proceed. PTX-100 is a first-in-class inhibitor targeting the RAS-family pathway, with the trial focusing on relapsed and refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (r/r CTCL). The IND clearance represents a key milestone for the company, enabling the formal initiation of the study. During the reporting period, Prescient dedicated significant resources to preparing the IND application, engaging clinical and industry experts to refine the study design, trial implementation strategy, and responses to FDA inquiries. The company is now moving forward with site selection, assessing clinical locations in Australia, the United States, and Europe, with up to 15 sites expected to be activated. Additionally, Prescient remains interested in exploring PTX-100's potential in Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) and is evaluating strategies to generate further clinical data in this patient population. What is PTX-100? PTX-100 is a first-in-class compound designed to inhibit geranylgeranyl transferase-1 (GGT-1), a key enzyme involved in cancer growth. By blocking GGT-1, PTX-100 disrupts oncogenic Ras pathways, preventing the activation of Rho, Rac, and Ral signalling circuits in cancer cells, ultimately inducing apoptosis. It is believed to be the only GGT-1 inhibitor currently in clinical development. The compound has demonstrated safety and early clinical activity in a previous Phase 1 study and a recent pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) basket study across hematological and solid malignancies. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted PTX-100 Orphan Drug Designation for all T-cell lymphomas and recently approved an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a Phase 2 study focusing on cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Prescient’s CellPryme platform continues to gain momentum in both preclinical and clinical development. During Q4 2024, the company presented data on cell therapy manufacturing and adjuvant enhancements at the CAR-TCR Summit in Boston and the American Society of Hematology conference in San Diego, generating increased interest in potential collaborations. Following these engagements, Prescient has initiated multiple partnerships involving CellPryme-M, working with potential collaborators to explore ways to enhance their cell therapy programs. The company intends to provide investors with updates on the progress of these partnerships as developments allow. Additionally, Prescient is in the early stages of evaluating first-in-human clinical trials for CellPryme-A. If initiated, these trials will investigate CellPryme-A’s potential in combination with CAR-T therapies. Meanwhile, significant progress has been made in OmniCAR development following extensive troubleshooting of technical challenges and the engineering of new, optimised molecular variants. With encouraging results achieved, Prescient will continue development efforts, with further validation work planned. What is CellPryme? CellPryme-M: Prescient’s CellPryme-M is a novel, clinic-ready technology designed to enhance adoptive cell therapy by shifting T cells towards a central memory phenotype. This improves persistence and increases the ability of cells to locate and penetrate tumours. The process is a non-disruptive, 24-hour step within cell manufacturing. Cell therapies requiring enhanced manufacturing productivity or increased in vivo potency and durability are well-suited for CellPryme-M. CellPryme-A: CellPryme-A is an adjuvant therapy administered alongside cellular immunotherapy to counteract the suppressive tumour microenvironment. It significantly reduces regulatory T cells, promotes CAR-T cell expansion in vivo, and enhances tumour penetration. These improvements result in better tumour cell killing and increased host survival. When used in combination with CellPryme-M pre-treated CAR-T cells, these benefits are further amplified. New CEO James McDonnell is a seasoned biopharmaceutical executive with over 25 years of experience in the global pharmaceutical industry, with a strong focus on blood disorders and haematological malignancies, including myeloma, myelodysplasia, and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). His strategic leadership has driven outstanding commercial success, underpinned by his ability to cultivate high-performing team cultures. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL, ETR:APC) reported quarterly earnings that topped Wall Street expectations on Thursday, with record revenue of $124.3 billion, despite a decline in iPhone sales in China. The company posted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.40, surpassing analysts' estimates of $2.35. Revenue rose 4% from the previous year, exceeding the $124.12 billion consensus forecast. However, iPhone sales dropped 11.1% in China during the key December quarter, highlighting concerns that Apple’s artificial intelligence push has yet to spark a new upgrade cycle for its flagship product. While the earnings beat provided some relief to investors, the report showed ongoing challenges in one of Apple's most critical markets. Apple shares were flat to slightly positive in after-hours trading.",

Despite these criticisms, Apple's entrenched product ecosystem and ongoing initiatives are expected to improve gross margins and accelerate sales growth. The Apple Services segment suggests continued compounding of AAPL shareholder value, even with potential future regulatory constraints on its ecosystem.",

    "text": "94 year old Warren Buffett, born during the Great Depression, has a net worth of $147 billion, which has risen to just over $4 billion this year. Most is because of the success of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B). That is the flagship of his wealth, which he created in 1970. A proof of the magnitude of his success is that $10,000 put into Berkshire 30 years ago would be worth $682,000 today. The stock is up 3% this year. Its current market cap is just above $1 trillion Buffett’s investment policy is not complex. He primarily buys public companies with strong brands that he thinks are undervalued. He has been a long term holder of Coda-Cola (NYSE: KO), and, until recently, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). Occasionally, for reasons he rarely discloses, he does not hold for decades. One example is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). He first bought the stock in 2016, and soured on the stock recently. Buffett will sometimes buy public companies and take them private. He bought railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe in 2010. He did the same with insurance company Geico in 1995. When the Geico deal closed, he commented, “It’s the low-cost operator in a field that is very big, and the low-cost operator tends to win over time.” Buffett has also bought some odd ball companies. He bought Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1983 for $60 million. He bought the TV station WPLG in 2014. The station is based in Miami. Buffett favors insurance companies, He owns Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, National Indemnity Company, Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance, which focuses on business and commercial insurance. Describing these investments he said, “It’s so much fun because you get the money at the start, you know, and then you find out whether you’ve done something stupid later on.” What Buffett observers cannot figure out is why Berkshire is holding $325 billion in cash. A Bloomberg reporter wrote that it means he is worried about a large market downturn. Or, maybe he is just looking for something to buy.
