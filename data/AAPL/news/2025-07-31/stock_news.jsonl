First Analyst Quote... 5:26 pm &#8220;Congratulations on a really solid quarter. Definitely it looks like the engine is back to running full speed here.&#8221; The key theme around Cloudflare&#8217;s earnings is whether Wall Street believes a significant reacceleration is happening. Quotes like this are extremely bullish. More from CEO Matthew Prince 5:18 pm &#8220;Our dollar-based net retention was 114% in up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our gross margin was 76.3%, in line with our long-term target range of 75% to 77%. We delivered an operating profit of $72.3 million, representing an operating margin of 14.1% and we generated strong free cash flow of $33.3 million during the quarter, again exceeding expectations. Cloudflare keeps innovating faster than ever and customers are voting with their wallets, you can see that in the momentum from our Q2 results. It&#8217;s not just interest, it&#8217;s real investments that drove record ACV bookings in the quarter.&#8221; Cloudflare&#039;s Earnings Call 5:08 pm &#8220;We had an excellent quarter. We crossed $2 billion in annual run rate revenue, achieving $512.3 million of revenue in the quarter. We started the year detailing our strategy to drive reaccelerating growth. Our Q2 results highlight that this formula is working and mark a key inflection point for the company, with revenue growing 28% year-over-year, up from 26.5% in the first quarter. We now have 3,712 customers paying us more than $100,000 per year, a 22% increase year-over-year. Revenue contribution from these large customers grew at 35% year-over-year, contributing to 71% of revenue during the quarter, up from 67% in the second quarter last year. &#8221; &#8211; Matthew Prince That&#8217;s the key idea &#8211; is Cloudflare at an inflection point? Our bet is that it is. If growth keeps scaling past 30%, even with a sky high valuation, its likely Cloudflare shares will soar in the years ahead. Conference Call Coming Soon 4:50 pm Cloudflare&#8217;s conference call is coming soon. We&#8217;ll post highlights. To receive them: simply leave this blog open and an update will post after we&#8217;ve been able to listen in. Here&#039;s What&#039;s Happening After Hours 4:43 pm Apple: Up 2.2% Amazon: Down 3.1% Cloudflare: Up 5.5% Roku: Up 2% Reddit: Up 20.5% Executive Quotes 4:35 pm &#8220;We kicked off 2025 with confidence, momentum, and strong results. In Q1, we landed the largest contract in Cloudflare’s history, a more than $100 million deal driven by our Workers developer platform, and signed the longest-term SASE contract to date.&#8221; Matthew Prince &#8220;We have the scale, the technology, and the team to capture the massive opportunity ahead of us—as evidenced by the size and the length of the deals we’re closing and the caliber of customers betting on Cloudflare.&#8221; Matthew Prince &#8220;In a constantly changing world, one thing’s for certain: innovation wins. From networking, to security, to AI, Cloudflare is the envy of the industry for innovation, and there&#8217;s no slowing down.&#8221; Matthew Prince Cloudflare Now Up 7% 4:27 pm We&#8217;ll see if commentary on Cloudflare&#8217;s earnings moves the stock more, but for now gains have settled in at around 7%. Beat and Raise 4:25 pm Next quarter Cloudflare posted guidance of $543.5 to $544.5M, that&#8217;s above expectations. More Details... 4:23 pm NET | Cloudflare Q2&#8217;25 Earnings Highlights: Adj. EPS: $0.21 []; UP +5% YoY Revenue: $512.3B []; UP +28% YoY Adj. Gross Margin: 76.3% []; DOWN -270 bps YoY Net Income: -$50.4M []; DOWN -234% YoY Free Cash Flow: $33.3M; DOWN -13% YoY Outlook: Revenue: $543.5 to $544.5M [] Cloudflare expects continued strong demand, driven by larger and longer-term contracts with key customers. The company is focused on innovation and expanding its product offerings to capture more market share. Q2 Segment Performance: Revenue from Core Services: $512.3M []; UP +28% YoY Other Key Q2 Metrics: Adj. Operating Income: $72.3M []; UP +27% YoY Adj. Operating Expenses: $450.9M []; UP +30% YoY Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Available-for-Sale Securities: $3,959.7M Effective Tax Rate: 6.7% (vs. 8.0% YoY) CEO Commentary: Matthew Prince: &#8220;We had an excellent second quarter, exceeding $2 billion in annualized revenue while also reaccelerating revenue growth to 28% year-over-year. We’re innovating faster than ever, and demand remains strong, as our largest customers grow their investments with Cloudflare at the highest levels we’ve seen since 2022. While we’ve continued to sign even bigger and longer deals, some of our most strategic wins have been centered around our work to help invent the new business model for content creators on the AI-driven Internet. Sitting in front of more than 20% of all websites—with more than half of our dynamic traffic flowing through APIs—Cloudflare is uniquely positioned to enable the agentic web of the future. We are firing on all cylinders, with the right technology, strategy, and team to accelerate the next phase of growth for Cloudflare and for the Internet at-large.” Strategic Updates: Cloudflare is focusing on expanding its product offerings and enhancing its technology to better serve its customers and capture new market opportunities. We Have Lift Off 4:18 pm Cloudflare shares are now up 6% The Headline Numbers 4:17 pm Revenue: $512.3M VS $501M Estimate EPS: $0.21 VS $0.18 Estimate Earnings Are Out - Shares up 3.5% upon initial release 4:15 pm Cloudflare earnings just dropped. Initially the stock dropped, and then immediately flipped positive. We&#8217;re going ot post live news and analysis. Here We Go 4:01 pm We&#8217;re watching for Cloudflare&#8217;s earnings &#8211; they should be out any minute. 20 Minutes to the Closing Bell 3:40 pm We&#8217;re just 20 minutes from the closing bell. Most stocks are in the red today with S&amp;P 500 down .2% and the Dow Jones dropping .54%. Yet, stocks closely aligned with the AI trade have held onto gains. Microsoft&#8217;s stunning Azure numbers yesterday have helped Cloudflare shares trade sharply positive. The company is up 3.5% in late trading. As we&#8217;ve noted throughout this blog, without a beat and raise, Cloudflare shares will likely be down tomorrow. Is NET Overheated? 1:37 pm Cloudflare closed at $200.85 on Tuesday — up more than 75% since May 1. That rally reflects bullish sentiment around its AI platform, SASE expansion, and large enterprise wins. But with valuation stretched, the market is now pricing in not just strong Q2 execution, but raised full-year guidance. Anything short of an outlook above $2.1B could lead to a fade — especially with tech volatility picking up. The setup demands strength on both topline and forward commentary. Another “beat and reiterate” might not be enough to get the stock ripping higher. How Cloudflare Stock Performed After Recent Earnings 12:26 pm Cloudflare has steadily delivered modest EPS beats, but stock reactions have varied — with the strongest gains following Q3 2024. Investors are highly tuned to forward guidance and AI-driven revenue opportunities. Quarter EPS Surprise 1-Day Move 7-Day Move 14-Day Move Q1 2025 +4.41% +1.2% +2.8% +4.5% Q4 2024 –2.10% –0.6% –1.3% –0.9% Q3 2024 +6.77% +3.5% +5.2% +6.1% Q2 2024 +1.25% –0.4% +0.9% +1.6% What Wall Street Expects When Cloudflare Reports Today 10:14 am Here&#8217;s Wall Street&#8217;s consensus expectations for Q2 earnings. Revenue: $501.6 million Adjusted EPS: $.18 Gross Margin: 77.8% Free Cash Flow: $29.9 million More importantly, Cloudflare will likely need to raise forward guidance if shares are going to rise tomorrow. In the third quarter, Wall Street expects: Revenue: $538.6 million Adjusted EPS: $.21 And the company could also raise 2025 growth targets. Currently, Cloudflare is projecting sales of $2.090 billion to $2.094 billion. Wall Street expectations are slightly above that range at $2.096 billion. If Cloudflare took revenue guidance for the year beyond $2.1 billion, that could be enough for shares to rise again tomorrow. Cloudflare (NYSE: NET) reports earnings after the bell today. The company&#8217;s shares have raced forward 78% this quarter. Bears will argue that Cloudflare&#8217;s valuation is stretched to the max. Cloudflare is expected to post revenue of $2.1 billion this year, but is now worth more than $70 billion. Bulls point to Cloudflare being an essential company for the growth of agentic AI. With inference needs rising, companies will look to Cloudflare as a solution to limit latency in the age of AI. Count me in on the bull side, I added shares of Cloudflare to the $500,000 AI Portfolio I manage for 24/7 Wall St. back in January.

The company anticipates maintaining its momentum with new customer acquisitions and upselling to existing customers.

Overall, the company did a lot tonight to push the narrative they&#8217;ll be aggressive to catch up in AI and that device sales are rebounding. It&#8217;s a good quarter for Apple that might start turning around what&#8217;s been a disappointing 2025. Tim Cook on AI 5:58 pm TD Cowen Analst: Tim, I was curious about your thoughts on AI for edge devices. There&#8217;s like some people who think that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you think &#8212; do you see a scenario where the LLM become a third part of your iOS or is the SLM the way to go and how to think about evolution of edge devices in a futuristic AI world and is smartphone going to be the choice of device. Just curious your thoughts on it, broadly speaking. Timothy Cook Chief Executive Officer The way that we look at AI is that it&#8217;s 1 of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. And I think it will affect all devices in a significant way what pieces of the chain are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn&#8217;t want to to really talk about today. because that gives away some things on our strategy. But I think it&#8217;s a good question. . Tim Cook on Apple Momentum 5:48 pm Here&#8217;s what Tim Cook had to say about Apple&#8217;s surprising momentum in China last quarter: &#8220;Yes. We did grow in Greater China by 4% during the quarter versus the previous quarter, it was driven by an acceleration by iPhone, although we also had substantial growth on the MAC year-over-year. From a &#8212; as you know, the government has placed certain subsidies that affects some of our products, not all of them, but there are some of them. And I think that had some effect. It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out. that cut in during a portion of the previous quarter. The other things I would say are that the installed base hit a record high in Greater China &#8212; and we set an all-time record for the iPhone installed base. The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter. And according to Boral Panel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top 3 models in Urban China, which is extraordinary. Also, if you look at the other products, Mac, iPad and watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China Mainland were new to the product. So lots of good things there. And the other thing I would point out, which is an interesting point, The MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model in all of China, and the Mac Mini was the top-selling desktop model in all of China. So overall, a positive &#8212; very positive quarter.&#8221; Apple&#039;s CFO Says AI Investments Will Rise 5:47 pm &#8220;I would say, a pretty significant driver as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. So that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we&#8217;ve been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers. The other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where in cases we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. So you are going to see an increase in CapEx. We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities in tooling, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you&#8217;re seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments.&#8221; &#8211; Kevan Parekh, Apple CFO Tariff Implications 5:22 pm On Apple&#8217;s conference call they just said they incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs last quarter.

That’s thanks to mixed earnings, tariff news, and poor jobs growth for July. AMZN, now down about $16 a share, isn’t helping much after its earnings report. Most of the pullback is from President Trump’s latest tariffs, which hit dozens of countries, including crucial partners, with steep tariffs. If other countries respond negatively with increased tariffs, markets could easily drop even more. Stay tuned for more. Morgan Stanley Reiterated Overweight Rating on Apple 9:37 am Morgan Stanley just reiterated its overweight rating on Apple, raising its price target to $240 from $235. The firm noted this was Apple’s strongest quarterly report and guide in more than two years. The firm also reiterated its overweight rating on Amazon. “Retail growth and profit improvements are shining and driving earnings. 2Q AWS growth was better and we detail why we see faster growth ahead. Remain OW, $300 PT,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. Nasdaq Opens Down 292 at the Open 9:31 am With tariffs, mixed earnings, and poor jobs growth, the Nasdaq is down 292 points. Nonfarm payrolls were expected to increase by 100,000 in July. Instead, they increased by just 73,000. The unemployment rate of 4.2% was in line with expectations. Amazon is down $16 at the open. That’s even as the company beat on the top and bottom lines, and offered better-than-expected guidance of between $174 billion and $179.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating $173.2 billion. Apple, up $3 at the open, posted earnings that beat on profit and revenue. iPhone sales grew 13% year over year. And overall revenue jumped 10% — the biggest quarterly jump in revenue growth since late 2023. U.S. Jobs Growth Did Slow to 73,000 8:42 am Nonfarm payrolls were expected to increase by 100,000 in July. Instead, they increased by just 73,000. The unemployment rate of 4.2% was in line with expectations. “June and May totals were revised sharply lower, down by a combined 258,000 from previously announced levels,” added CNBC. “The June total came down from the previously stated 147,000, while the May count fell to just 19,000, revised down by 125,000.” That weakness and the downward revisions could force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates when it meets in September. After a few record-setting days for the tech-heavy Nasdaq, futures are down about 245 points. All after President Trump signed an executive order that modified reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, with updated duties ranging from 10% to 41%. Here are the key points you should know: “Trump set rates including a 35% duty on many goods from Canada, 50% for Brazil, 25% for India, 20% for Taiwan, and 39% for Switzerland, according to a presidential executive order,” according to Reuters. 10% is now the minimum tariff imposed across all imports. Canada: Tariff raised to 35% from 25% 40 Countries now face a 15% tariff. China and Mexico had their deadlines delayed by 90 days. If you want to see the full list of updated tariffs, you can see it here. Shares of Amazon Slip Despite an Earnings Beat Not helping, shares of Amazon are down about $19 in premarket. That’s even as the company beat on the top and bottom lines, and offered better-than-expected guidance of between $174 billion and $179.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating $173.2 billion. Despite that, the stock dropped after Amazon&#8217;s guidance for operating income for its AWS cloud computing unit came in at $15.5 billion to $20.5 billion for the third quarter. Analysts were looking for $19.5 billion. Analysts are sticking by the stock, despite that news. Goldman Sachs still has a buy rating and raised its price target to $240 from $220. JPMorgan reiterated an overweight rating, raising its price target to $265 from $255. Citi has a buy rating and raised its price target to $270 from $265. Apple is Gaining Momentum on an Earnings Beat Just last night, the tech giant posted earnings that beat on profit and revenue. Plus, iPhone sales grew 13% year over year. And overall revenue jumped 10% &#8212; the biggest quarterly jump in revenue growth since late 2023. EPS of $1.57 was better than the estimates of $1.43. Revenue of $94.04 billion was better than the estimates of $89.53 billion. iPhone revenue was $44.58 billion as compared to expectations for $40.22 billion. Mac revenue of $8.05 billion was better than the estimates of $7.26 billion. iPad revenue of $6.58 billion was better than the expectations of $7.24 billion. With AI, the company said that it’s “significantly growing our investments.” U.S. Jobs Growth Slowed to 73,000 Nonfarm payrolls were expected to increase by 100,000 in July. Instead, they increased by just 73,000. The unemployment rate was expected to be 4.2%.

What Wall Street Will Be Looking for In Q2 12:46 pm Earlier we looked at what Airbnb report in the first quarter, let&#8217;s take a look at what Wall Street expects this quarter. Wall Street Q2 Consensus Revenue: $3.029 billion EPS: $.94 Free Cash Flow: $1.24 billion Gross Margin: 82% And looking ahea to Q3, here&#8217;s what Wall Street expects Airbnb to guide to: Expected Q3 Guidance from Airbnb Revenue: $4.05 billion EPS: $2.30 Free Cash Flow: $1.62 billion The big long-term story with Airbnb is that Wall Street is modeling long-term acceleration with EPS rising to $4.48 in 2026, $5.71 in 2027, $7.06 in 2028, and $8.27 in 2029. The stock is in a &#8216;prove it&#8217; mode right now that Airbnb can get back to growth, so guiding revenue above expected Q3 guidance is the metric to watch.

It&#8217;s Airbnb&#8217;s (Nasdaq: ABNB) turn to report earnings after the bell tonight. The company has seen shares treading water, down 1% across the past year while the broader market soars. If you turn back the clock even further, the picture gets uglier with shares down 7% across the past five years. Yet, shares now trade for about 30X this year&#8217;s earnings estimate.

Morgan Stanley Just Ugraded Apple 8:55 am Morgan Stanley just reiterated its overweight rating on Apple, noting that the tech giant is well-positioned after the latest tariff news from President Trump. According to the firm, as quoted by CNBC, “Apple’s commitment to investing an added $100B in the U.S. &#8211; mind you, with zero new major final assembly/production in the U.S. &#8211; means Apple is entirely exempt from Section 232 tariffs. Therefore, for Apple, tariff rates should get no worse, which is a much better-than-feared outcome.” Goldman Sachs Just Hiked Nvidia Price Target Ahead of Earnings 8:29 am Goldman Sachs just raised its price target on NVDA to $200 from $185, with a buy rating. As noted by CNBC, “Analyst James Schneider said that even though investor expectations are high heading into fiscal second-quarter results at the end of August, the chipmaker should have no trouble rising to the occasion.” In premarket, NVDA is now up about $2.45 a share to $181.81. Futures are racing even higher. Just days after tariff news and jobs data sank the markets, the major indices are exploding. At the moment, the Dow is up 250 points. The S&amp;P 500 is up about 41, with the NASDAQ up another 190 points to 23,610. All thanks to President Trump’s new chip tariffs that include broad exemptions. Announced last night, the President said there would be a 100% tariff on imported chips. However, that will not apply to companies building chips in the U.S. All of which positively impacted Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and ETFs such as the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH). Helping even more, Apple is up about 2.6% in premarket after announcing it would invest $100 billion more in U.S. companies and suppliers over the next four years. That’s on top of the $500 billion commitment Apple made earlier this year. “We’re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said, as quoted by CNBC. “But the good news for companies like Apple is if you’re building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge.” With the 2025 NFL Season Weeks Away, Gambling Stocks are Gaining Momentum Ahead of the 2025 NFL season, gambling stocks, like DraftKings (DKNG) are exploding higher. In 2024, the American Gaming Association said Americans were expected to spend about $35 billion on NFL games this year. That’s up from the $26.7 billion wagered a year prior. At the time, as noted by CBS Sports, “The NFL remains king, and more money is wagered on the NFL than any other league. The NFL also attracts six-figure wages (and sometimes seven-figure wagers) on a regular basis throughout the season.” From its August 2024 low of $31.26, DKNG ran to a high of about $45.72. The RoundHill Sports Betting &amp; iGaming ETF (BETZ) ran from an August 2024 low of about $16.30 to a high of $20.50. Shares of Flutter Entertainment (FLUT) ran from an August 2024 low of about $175.60 to a high of $283.45. With regards to DKNG, its stock is up after posting better-than-expected earnings and reiterated its full-year outlook. Its EPS of 38 cents missed by three cents. However, revenue of $1.51 billion, up 37.3% year over year, beat by $80 million. &#8220;We set records for revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, driven by an acceleration in revenue growth to 37% year-over-year,&#8221; said CEO Jason Robins. &#8220;We are pleased to be maintaining our fiscal year 2025 guidance, with revenue expected to be closer to the high end of our range, highlighting the strength of our platform as we prepare for an exciting new state launch.” The post Nasdaq Composite Live: This is Why the Index is Still Exploding Higher appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..", "url": "https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/08/07/nasdaq-composite-live-this-is-why-the-index-still-exploding-higher/", "ticker": "AAPL", "event_date": "2025-07-31", "window_start": "2025-07-24", "window_end": "2025-08-14", "publishedDateET": "2025-08-07T14:39:10-04:00", "date_et": "2025-08-07"}

Why investors asked: Hyperscale cloud companies are increasing capital spending, so the street wants to know if Coherent can keep pace. Management’s answer: Demand outlook is “very strong.” They expect data center and communications to grow again sequentially in the current quarter. Growth drivers are 800-gigabit transceivers rising through 2025–2026, 1.6-terabit transceivers ramping on top of that, the optical circuit switch moving from first revenue toward scale, and continued strength in data-center-interconnect. 2) What is special about the new six-inch indium-phosphide line and U.S. manufacturing? Why investors asked: Capacity and cost determine how much share Coherent can win in next-gen optics; U.S. production can be a strategic advantage amid tariffs and supply risk. Management’s answer: The six-inch line began production in August and should deliver higher volume at lower cost. Coherent emphasizes a broad U.S. footprint (20+ sites, 13 states) as a differentiator for large customers; the Apple laser agreement is cited as proof of that value. Apple revenue should start in 2H26. 3) Which pieces are down sequentially in Q1 guidance, and why? Why investors asked: To reconcile total guidance and identify any soft spots. Management’s answer: Data center and communications should be up sequentially. Industrial is likely flat to down near-term (even excluding the ~$20M Aerospace &amp; Defense step-down) due to macro uncertainty and tariff noise. Long-term, management still expects industrial to grow, aided by recurring service revenue. 4) How healthy is the optical-circuit-switch pipeline, and what is the edge versus mechanical switches? Why investors asked: This is a new product in a potentially large market; investors want adoption proof. Management’s answer: Pipeline is “very healthy.” The switch uses non-mechanical digital liquid-crystal technology (not moving parts) which offers much higher reliability—critical in artificial-intelligence data centers. Capacity is being added to support the ramp. 5) What does the Apple deal really mean for revenue certainty and margins? Why investors asked: Coherent’s Apple exposure fell a few years back; investors want clarity on durability and profitability now. Management’s answer: It is a multi-year expansion for a new generation of lasers used in iPhone and iPad, manufactured in Texas. Revenue begins 2H26. Management expects the arrangement to benefit gross margin and provide solid plant utilization. 6) Why did sequential growth in data center/communications moderate versus some peers? Why investors asked: To assess relative share and trajectory as artificial-intelligence builds accelerate. Management’s answer: Quarter-to-quarter lumpiness is normal (timing of orders, supply, transitions from 400-gigabit to 800-gigabit). Over FY25 the business grew more than 60% and management believes they gained share, with strong demand ahead from 800-gigabit, 1.6-terabit, the optical circuit switch, and data-center-interconnect. 7) Can foreign-exchange headwinds derail margin progress, and can Coherent reach a 40-plus percent gross margin? Why investors asked: Q4 gross margin dipped sequentially on currency; the long-term model targets above 42%. Management’s answer: The Q4 dip was mainly foreign exchange; cost reductions and price optimization were strong. Without the currency hit, Q4 would have exceeded the top end of guidance. Management is confident in the &gt;42% long-term margin target. 8) Any geographic or customer-mix risks inside industrial lasers? Why investors asked: To gauge near-term volatility. Management’s answer: No unusual concentration. The caution is macro-driven, not customer-specific. In FY25, service contracts (recurring) grew faster than product sales, which is a margin tailwind. Near-term cautious; long-term constructive. 9) How strong is demand in data-center-interconnect, and what is driving it—training or inference? Why investors asked: Inter-data-center traffic is exploding as artificial-intelligence clusters spread. Management’s answer: Very strong—especially for coherent 100/400/800-gigabit transceivers. Demand is mostly driven by traffic spanning multiple data centers, not just within one facility. 10) Will Chinese optical makers pressure prices and share as speeds move to 800-gigabit and 1.6-terabit? Why investors asked: Rising Chinese competitors can compress margins and take share. Management’s answer: Coherent believes it gained share in FY25, particularly at higher speeds. The technology road map (800-gigabit now; three laser paths for 1.6-terabit; progress toward 3.2-terabit) and supply-chain resiliency (U.S. manufacturing plus internal indium-phosphide and laser capacity) are their defense. Pricing trends are as expected—no unusual pressure. 11) Will Coherent fully self-supply lasers as the six-inch line ramps? Why investors asked: Internal supply can protect margins and availability. Management’s answer: The company will continue a mix of internal and external sourcing. Over half of transceivers ship with electro-absorption modulated lasers, and over half of those lasers are internally made today. 12) Vietnam facility and silicon-carbide outlook? Why investors asked: To understand global capacity and a previously weak end market. Management’s answer: The Vietnam site supports materials businesses, including silicon carbide. Coherent exited pre-revenue devices/modules and is focusing on wafers and epitaxy. After a weak FY25, demand has stabilized; no FY26 headwind expected. We&#039;re Compiling Our Notes 6:15 pm Coherent&#8217;s call is over and we&#8217;ll post an update shortly with our notes. Simply leave this live blog open and the update should appear automatically. Call Is Almost Done 6:00 pm Coherent&#8217;s call is nearly finished, shares are still down about 17% as of 6 p.m. ET. We&#8217;ll post our notes shortly from the call, but it is worth noting that nothing that was said materially changed the company&#8217;s share price. That&#8217;s different than Cisco, which saw shares rally during the company&#8217;s conference call. Coherent on Their Ability to Withstand Tariffs 5:22 pm Here&#8217;s what Coherent CEO James Anderson had to say about the company&#8217;s ability to withstand tariffs on the company&#8217;s earnings call: Over the past months, you&#8217;ve heard me stress the importance of Coherent&#8217;s dynamic, flexible global manufacturing footprint as a competitive advantage and a hedge against geopolitical risks. Our U.S. footprint is a key part of that strategy. Coherent has a long industry of advanced manufacturing in the United States, leading U.S. manufacturing innovation since our founding more than 50 years ago, beginning with the company&#8217;s first manufacturing site in Saxonburg, Pennsylvania, which remains our company headquarters. Today, our U.S. manufacturing footprint extends across more than a 8 U.S. manufacturing locates in 13 states. Across those U.S. manufacturing locations, we employ thousands of people. These sites lead the industry in technical innovation, manufacturing, and we continue to invest in our U.S. manufacturing footprint. Bull/Bear Debate 4:55 pm We&#8217;ve included Coherent in our $500,000 AI Portfolio at 24/7 Wall St. and are positive long-term on the company. So let&#8217;s look at this quarter from the bull/bear framework. Bullish! Revenue guidance came in light but EPS fro next quarter at the midpoint matched Wall Street&#8217;s expectations. The company is beginning its 1.6T module ramp, which should be a large revenue driver in 2026. Coherent emphasized gross margin expansion during the year, they&#8217;re clearly focusing on their opportunities in the AI space in an outsized way. Bearish! The company had run up 121% since April 21st. If a stock runs that fast and issues disappointing guidance, it&#8217;s going to fall almost 100% of the time. While Coherent&#8217;s networking business is doing great, its laser business continues to post middling results. The materials business is also seeing significant revenue declines. Here&#039;s What&#039;s Next 4:45 pm Coherent&#8217;s conference call starts at 5 p.m., we&#8217;ll listen in and post notes. Shares are currently down 19%. One interesting note is that guidance excludes $20 million for assets being sold off. You wonder if that revenue was included whether the reaction after hours would have been this severe. First Revenue from 1.6T Datacom Transceivers Next Quarter 4:36 pm In their release Coherent highlighted: First Revenue from 1.6T Datacom Transceivers. Commenced revenue shipments of our 1.6T transceiver products, enabling high-performance AI datacenter applications. The growth of 800g and 1.6T modules is part of the bull case for Coherent so its encouraging to see revenue beginning to flow from these products. We&#8217;d expect more commentary on this during the company&#8217;s earnings call. Coherent&#039;s CEO on AI Growth 4:35 pm Jim Anderson, CEO, said, “We delivered a strong fiscal 2025 with revenue growth of 23% and non-GAAP EPS expansion of 191%. We believe we are well positioned to continue to drive strong revenue and profit growth over the long-term given our exposure to key growth drivers such as AI datacenters. We also continue to optimize and focus our portfolio with the recently announced agreement to sell our Aerospace and Defense business. As we enter a new fiscal year, we are excited about the growth opportunities ahead of us.” Detailed Earnings Summary 4:33 pm COHR | Coherent Corp. Q4&#8217;25 Earnings Highlights: Adj.

CEO Commentary: Jim Anderson: &#8220;We delivered a strong fiscal 2025 with revenue growth of 23% and non-GAAP EPS expansion of 191%. We believe we are well positioned to continue to drive strong revenue and profit growth over the long-term given our exposure to key growth drivers such as AI datacenters. We also continue to optimize and focus our portfolio with the recently announced agreement to sell our Aerospace and Defense business. As we enter a new fiscal year, we are excited about the growth opportunities ahead of us.&#8221; CFO Commentary: Sherri Luther: &#8220;In fiscal 2025, in addition to strong revenue growth, we achieved gross margin expansion of 358 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Revenue growth and margin expansion drove improvement in our operating cash flow, which enabled us to repay approximately $437 million of our outstanding debt for the full fiscal year.&#8221; Coherent Now Down About 16% 4:28 pm Coherent shares have bounced slightly off the bottom but are trading down about 16% as of 4:28 p.m. ET. It looks like the company is about to give up a sizable percent of its recent gains. Why Shares Are Dropping 4:17 pm If you own Coherent you&#8217;re probably wondering why shares are dropping. The company beat revenue expectations last quarter ($1.53 billion) and EPS expectations ($1 in adjusted EPS vs. $.92 of expectations). The problem is the revenue guid for next quarter is $1.46 billion to $1.60 billion, at the midpoint that&#8217;s lower than Wall Street expectations of $1.55 billion. When a stock has run up as much as Coherent has, even a &#8216;small&#8217; miss on guidance like this is usually punished severely. Earnings Are Out 4:15 pm Guidance is below expectations and shares are down 15% after hours. Things to Know Before Coherent Reports After the Bell 3:33 pm Coherent will report after the bell today. We expect their earnings should hit newsires at about 4:15 p.m. ET. As a reminder, new updates will post on this live earnings blog automatically.

How Coherent Looked After Recent Earnings 3:00 pm Earnings History After two quarters of strong upside reactions, COHR has developed breakout momentum, particularly when EPS surprise exceeds 20%+. Quarter EPS Surprise 1-Day Move 7-Day Move 14-Day Move Q3 FY2025 +5.81% +7.83% +12.58% +14.73% Q2 FY2025 +41.79% +11.17% +12.48% +10.40% Q1 FY2025 +21.31% –7.17% –8.20% –1.89% Q4 FY2024 +1.67% +4.45% +5.25% +6.21% Coherent (NYSE: COHR) reports Q4 FY2025 earnings after the close today. Last quarter delivered strong upside in AI, telecom, and laser transceivers, but investors are on alert for signs of margin pressure and decelerating industrial demand. Management’s tone on Q1 visibility and full-year guidance will be critical, especially with the stock up 70% over the past year and now trading above the average analyst price target.

Estimates Snapshot Q4 FY2025 Consensus Estimates: Revenue: $1.51 billion EPS (Normalized): $0.92 Full-Year FY2025 Estimates: Revenue: $5.79 billion EPS: $3.50 For comparison, Coherent posted $1.31B in revenue and $0.61 in EPS for Q4 FY2024, implying ~15.1% revenue growth and ~50.8% EPS growth YoY. Key Areas to Watch AI Datacenter Demand and 1.6T Ramp Datacom revenue tied to AI grew 54% YoY in Q3, led by demand for EML, VCSEL, and silicon photonic transceivers. The 1.6T product family is set to begin volume shipments later this year, supported by rising customer interest across hyperscale and optical domains. Indium Phosphide Capacity and Vertical Integration Coherent’s internally manufactured EMLs now power the majority of transceiver revenue. The upcoming 6-inch indium phosphide fab should improve gross margin scalability and accelerate future 3.2T product readiness. Telecom and Coherent Optics Expansion Telecom revenue rose 21% YoY in Q3, driven by ZR/ZR+ coherent modules for datacenter interconnect and metro optical networks. Orders remain strong across global service providers, with bandwidth upgrades continuing into H1 FY2026. Gross Margin Execution in Challenging Mix Q3 gross margin reached 38.5%, aided by cost reductions and pricing gains. However, management flagged potential Q4 pressure from unfavorable product mix and flat revenue. CFO Sherri Luther noted: “We continued to improve pricing and reduce costs across our product portfolio, which contributed to our margin expansion.” Industrial and Display Volatility The company cited ongoing softness in industrial markets despite stable demand for display lasers and semi cap tools. Investors will look for clarity on order trends in tools and OEM components tied to China, EVs, and OLED growth trajectories.The post Live: Why Coherent (COHR) Dropped 17% After Q4 Earnings appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..", "url": "https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/08/13/live-will-coherent-cohr-surge-after-q4-earnings/", "ticker": "AAPL", "event_date": "2025-07-31", "window_start": "2025-07-24", "window_end": "2025-08-14", "publishedDateET": "2025-08-14T12:32:14-04:00", "date_et": "2025-08-14"}
