Launched on January 22, 1993, SPY is the world’s largest ETF with more than $355 billion in assets and the most heavily traded security in the world with an average daily trading volume of $39 billion.* “SPY gave birth to an industry that has democratized investing, giving both investors large and small access to institutional-grade solutions that offer efficient, cost-effective exposures to all corners of the global investment market,” said Rory Tobin, head of State Street Global Advisors’ Global SPDR ETF Business. “Born out of the stock market crash of 1987, SPY has demonstrated its resilience throughout major market events from the burst of the dot-com bubble to the global financial crisis of 2008, and more recently, the extreme pandemic-era volatility.” “SPY disrupted the asset management industry and benefitted investors in ways that exceeded even the most ambitious expectations,” said Sue Thompson head of SPDR Americas Distribution at State Street Global Advisors. “Three decades since SPY’s launch, investors now have access to more than 8,000 ETFs globally, but none come close to offering the liquidity of SPY, which provides transaction cost benefits that can lower total cost of ownership for investors.” “S&P Dow Jones Indices congratulates State Street Global Advisors on this momentous occasion. This 30-year milestone and the tremendous growth of ETFs during this time, reflect the transformational benefits being provided to all end investors,” said Dan Draper, Chief Executive Officer at S&P Dow Jones Indices. A History Steeped in Liquidity & Resiliency Since SPY’s launch, US-listed ETFs have amassed $6.5 trillion in assets.* Toward the end of 2022 SPY was trading three times more than Apple (AAPL) — the largest security in the world by market cap.** That volume, combined with the size of SPY’s assets, performance, liquidity, and resilience, has been vital to investors as they construct asset allocation portfolios and navigate extreme market events. In fact, as the market began to tumble during the onset of COVID-19, SPY became the first ETF to ever trade more than $100 billion in a single day on February 28, 2020.** “Throughout each market turn, SPY’s unparalleled liquidity profile provided investors with the flexibility to buy and sell shares quickly, easily, and cost-efficiently,” Tobin added. ETF Impact Survey shows the positive impact ETFs have on investors today Today, ETFs have become core building blocks for investors making asset allocation decisions. The expansion of ETFs to include different types of funds in a variety of asset classes further added to their appeal. Recent findings from State Street Global Advisors ETF Impact Survey reaffirm the popularity of ETFs as a vehicle that can help investors remain confident in their investing acumen. The survey was designed to understand investor attitudes and perceptions about ETFs, the market and the economy in the US, APAC and EMEA. Overall, the perceived benefits ETFs have brought to investors globally is overwhelmingly positive- whether or not they even own ETFs. More than half agree ETFs are an investor-friendly investment product (58%) and are better diversified than other investment products (54%). Furthermore, investors who do have an existing ETF holding report that ETFs have improved the overall performance of their portfolio (73% globally and 59% in the US alone). And, the majority believe ETFs have made them a better investor (67% globally and 53% in the US). Liquidity Remains Important Amidst Investor Uncertainty on Markets and Economy Globally, nearly seven-in-ten investors believe the volatility in the stock market is going to continue for at least the next 12 months. Six-in-ten investors agree that when there is volatility in the market it is important to have more liquid investments. Regardless of whether they have ETFs in their portfolio, globally, more than half of investors agree ETFs offer more liquidity to respond rapidly to market changes (52%) and can mitigate risk better in volatile markets compared to other investments (51%). More Room for Growth and Innovation Despite the explosive growth of the ETF industry since SPY’s launch, the survey suggests the industry still has a long runway for expansion in the US, as just 40% of investors say they own an ETF in their portfolio, which is considerably lower than stocks (83%), mutual funds (67%) and bonds (53%). When asked if they plan to buy ETFs in the next 12 months, 50% of investors globally indicate they do, compared to 37% in the US.

The IMX is TD Ameritrade’s proprietary, behavior-based index, aggregating Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets. The reading for the four-week period ending January 27, 2023 ranks “low” compared to historic averages. “While there’s still a ways to go before the IMX score reaches the soaring heights it hit in 2020 and 2021, optimism among retail investors is beginning to creep back up as this year begins,” said Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist, TD Ameritrade. “With inflation moderating and volatility projections starting to wane, retail investors are continuing to net sell equities but are also on a whole increasing their market exposure, potentially signaling more appetite for exposure in the months to come.” January started off with a sharp bounce after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly Employment Situation report continued to show an ever-resilient labor market; the unemployment rate stubbornly moved lower to 3.5%, but the report showed an uptick in the participation rate and a slowing pace of wage increases. In the days that followed, the market mostly crept higher until the morning of January 18th when the U.S. Census Bureau’s December Retail Sales data was released, shining light on a disappointing holiday season for retailers. This sent the market into a bit of a tailspin, pushing the S&P 500 down just over 1.5% to its worst finish in the January period. U.S. equities quickly steadied the ship, however, and continued on a “risk-on” course to close out the month, buoyed by optimism from corporate earnings releases from many of the market’s bellwether companies. The S&P 500 (SPX) charted its strongest period of performance since October ’22, finishing up just over 6%. All of this contributed to the CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) touching its lowest level since January 2022 before ending the period at 18.51, possibly indicating an increasing comfort with the uncertainties that have plagued the market for the better part of the last year. U.S. Treasury markets rallied alongside equity markets, leading to a decline in yields, and the U.S. Dollar Index continued its recent slide to finish at its lowest level since May 2022. Crude oil saw steep selling early in January but quickly recovered most of its early-month losses to finish down a modest 1.4% during the period. TD Ameritrade clients were net sellers overall, but they did find individual names to buy during the period, including: Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) Ford Motor Co. (F) Apple Inc. (AAPL) Intel Corp. (INTC) Names sold during the period included: Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Boeing Co. (BA) American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Millennial Buys & Sells TD Ameritrade millennial clients also increased exposure during the January IMX period, but like the overall TD Ameritrade client population, they were net sellers of equities. Both TD Ameritrade millennial clients and the overall TD Ameritrade client population were net buyers of Tesla (TSLA) as the electric vehicle (EV) maker reported earnings and ended its recent run of weakness with a surge of over 44% during the period. This optimism spilled over to another EV maker, Rivian Automotive (RIVN), as both populations were net buyers of the company, seeing opportunity in its early January weakness. TD Ameritrade millennial clients took it one step further and also net bought Lucid Group (LCID) as takeover speculation late in January contributed to a massive run-up of over 88% during the period. Both TD Ameritrade millennial clients and the overall TD Ameritrade client population were net sellers of American Airlines (AAL), seeing an opportunity to sell into strength as the company soared over 30% following an optimistic update to its guidance forecast early in the month and as it beat street estimates with its earnings on January 26th. TD Ameritrade millennial clients also reduced exposure in United Airlines (UAL) as the Chicago-based airliner also jumped nearly 30%, using the strength as an opportunity to sell. Although TD Ameritrade millennial clients were net sellers of equities during the January period, they were net buyers of three of the S&P sectors: Health Care, Real Estate, and Utilities. About the IMX The IMX value is calculated based on a complex proprietary formula. Each month, TD Ameritrade pulls a sample from its client base of funded accounts, which includes all accounts that completed a trade in the past month. The holdings and positions of this statistically significant sample are evaluated to calculate individual scores, and the median of those scores represents the monthly IMX.
