The lawsuit seeks to represent a class of U.S. credit unions and financial institutions that issue payment cards enabled for use in Apple Pay. The class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and accuses Apple of denying rivals access to the technology needed to develop a competing mobile wallet. On iOS devices, Apple has ensured that only its mobile wallet, Apple Pay, can make contactless payments at the point of sale. Having secured a monopoly for Apple Pay in this fashion, Apple charges card issuers who use Apple Pay supracompetitive fees for a service that is available on Android devices for free, according to the lawsuit. If you issue payment cards enabled for use in Apple Pay, find out more about this issue and your rights against Apple. “When you compare the functionality of Apple Pay to mobile wallets available on Android devices – Google Pay, Samsung Pay – you’re essentially holding up a mirror; they are essentially identical,” said Steve Berman, Hagens Berman co-founder and managing partner. “And yet, the same service on Android that card issuers pay absolutely nothing for costs them a collective $1 billion annually through Apple Pay.” “The reason for this is simple,” Berman added. “There is competition on Android devices, with multiple wallets offering contactless payments, whereas Apple has barred all rivals, making Apple Pay the only option.” This is the third time the firm has sued the Big Tech giant for antitrust matters. In 2015, Hagens Berman secured a combined $560 million settlement against Apple and publishing companies regarding price-fixing of e-books after Apple appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, and in 2022, the firm achieved a $100 million settlement on behalf of iOS developers who were harmed by Apple’s stifling App Store policies. “As a firm with a long history of antitrust successes, we’re no stranger to Apple’s monopolistic behavior,” Berman said. “We’re hoping for a hat-trick and we believe the economic evidence our team has amassed against Apple in this case is frankly undeniable. We look forward to fighting for this case.” Apple Pay’s Devil in the Details The lawsuit details Apple Pay’s supracompetitive fee structure compared to other mobile wallet providers across the market, as well as Apple’s tactics to weave Apple Pay into its existing structure of market dominance in the mobile device industry. Across Android devices and supported mobile wallets on that operating system, issuers pay nothing to use the decades-old technology that allows for tap-and-pay functionality via Android platforms. Meanwhile, across all iOS devices, Apple Pay is the only tap-and-pay mobile wallet allowed, thanks to Apple’s exclusionary practices. Via Apple Pay, Apple charges U.S. card issuers 15 basis points on credit and .5 cents on debit for all transactions. “On the surface, Apple Pay’s fees pushed onto card issuers may seem small, but truly the devil is in the details of Apple’s policies, and these fees add up, big time,” Berman said. To illustrate the significance, the suit states, “That Apple has profitably sustained its significant issuer fees, despite other free forms of payment, demonstrates that a hypothetical monopolist can (and has been able to) profitably impose a small but significant non-transitory increase in price (a SSNIP).” Attorneys say that to make matters worse for payment card issuers, Apple also forces these same fees on e-commerce transactions, keeping issuers from disabling Apple Pay’s e-commerce function from its tap-and-pay feature. Apple also prohibits issuers from passing these fees onto consumers which, absent Apple’s policies, they could do to incentivize use of more cost-effective forms of payment. The antitrust violations come two-fold, according to the lawsuit: The lawsuit seeks to reimburse payment card issuers who have been charged Apple Pay’s fees and seeks injunctive relief to put an end to Apple’s policies.

A stone’s throw from Hyde Park, Apple Brompton Road features design inspiration drawn from local flora, along with a new slate of community events and seminars to help customers learn, create, and get the most out of their Apple products. “We are thrilled to open Apple Brompton Road in London, a city teeming with energy, history, and cultural diversity,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail + People. “The store’s focus on creativity gives our incredible team members the perfect space to share their passion and expertise with Londoners and visitors from around the world.” Special Sessions The store opening kicks off with the global launch of “United Visions,” an augmented reality experience honoring the creative works of pioneering London poet and painter William Blake. Created for Getty Museum and brought to life through Apple technology, the purpose-built app showcases the possibilities of creativity by reimagining the seminal artist’s work. Artists and creative technologists Tin Nguyen and Ed Cutting (Tin&Ed) used Apple’s M1 Ultra chip in the development of the experience, which features a poetic soundtrack by Grammy Award-winning record producer Just Blaze. “United Visions” can be viewed by customers in-store and by anyone around the world by downloading the “United Visions” app. Opening weekend festivities will include a panel discussion on the creation of “United Visions” with Nguyen, Cutting, and Just Blaze, as well as a special performance and Spatial Audio listening session by London artist Nina Nesbitt. Apple Fitness+ trainers Cory Wharton-Malcolm, Jamie-Ray Hartshorne, Kim Ngo, and Jonelle Lewis will join Jay Blahnik, Apple’s vice president of Fitness Technologies, for an in-store Q&A followed by a 3-kilometer walk and 5-kilometer run in Hyde Park. The talented Apple Creative Pros will also host live illustration sessions that take inspiration from the local blooms. Following the opening sessions, the store will host its ongoing Brompton Series, which takes place on the last Thursday of every month through October and features: Inspirational and informative talks by thought leaders in the wellness space, including Michael James Wong, Cat Meffan, Lloyd Kempson, and Harry Jameson. Music workshops in connection with Apple Music’s Up Next series breaking down songs by emerging London artists using Spatial Audio; artists include Kali Claire, Olivia Dean, and Rachel Chinouriri. The Store and Team Upon entering Apple Brompton Road, visitors will be greeted by 12 towering Sicilian ficus trees that line the 7-meter floor-to-ceiling windows and entryway. The seating at the base of each planter acts as a social gathering space for visitors, blurring the boundaries between inside and outside, and bringing nature directly into the store. Visitors come through the central arcade, which mirrors the dimensions of the original Brompton Arcade built on the same precise location in 1903. The store’s Forum — where free Today at Apple® sessions provide daily creative inspiration and practical skills — features a first for Apple in the UK: a mirrored ceiling that offers depth-enhancing reflections. Visitors are invited to explore the surrounding display tables and avenues featuring the all-new lineup of iPhone®, Mac®, iPad®, AirPods®, Apple Watch®, and Apple TV®, as well as accessories like HomePod mini® and AirTag™. The 200-person store team helps customers learn about Apple products, and offers advice on monthly financing options and the Apple Trade In program. Collectively speaking more than 45 languages, the team is ready to welcome customers from around the world. And in another first for the UK, a dedicated Apple Pickup area makes it even more convenient for customers to pick up products ordered online. Sustainability Apple Brompton Road’s terrazzo flooring is comprised of a plant-based bio resin, the first of its kind in Apple’s worldwide retail fleet. The vast space — which features a unique curved timber ceiling — offers ample seating where customers can relax and discover new tips and tricks to get the best from their devices. Like all Apple facilities, Apple Brompton Road is powered by 100 percent renewable energy.

We believe they too have been wrongfully subjected to the stifling policies of Apple’s App Store, and we intend to hold Apple to the law.” “Le GESTE and its members are indeed at the forefront of several initiatives and battles for a more balanced and fair functioning of the digital world in France and in Europe. In its nature and magnitude, today’s action shows our determination to seek such changes and redress,” said Bertrand Gié, Le GESTE’s president and head of digital at Le Figaro and Emmanuel Alix, GESTE’s vice president and head of digital at L’Equipe. “Apple’s policies and restrictions pose critical issues to all iOS developers using the App Store. To a global problem, there shall be a global solution. I believe we can build solid bridges to conceive impactful actions, for we shall leave no room for impunity,” said Fayrouze Masmi-Dazi, Le GESTE’s antitrust attorney and an attorney representing the proposed class of iOS developers in association with Steve Berman. If you are a France-based iOS developer, find out more about the lawsuit by contacting Fayrouze Masmi-Dazi at 06 27 96 28 65 or fmasmi-Dazi@outlook.com. Berman also led his firm to win a suit against Apple and various publishing companies in 2016 that settled for a total of $560 million on behalf of e-book purchasers forced to pay artificially high prices due to Apple and the publishing companies’ colluded price-fixing. That suit went to the Supreme Court, where the Court ruled against Apple. The firm also recently filed a $1 billion case against Apple regarding antitrust policies within Apple Pay. Additionally, Hagens Berman took Google to court on behalf of Android app developers using the Google Play Store, achieving a $90 million settlement on behalf of the class. Apple Antitrust Déjà Vu Today’s filed lawsuit against Apple accuses it of the same antitrust overpricing in its App Store functionality and in-app purchase (IAP) services and seeks to represent France-based iOS developers that were subjected to Apple’s high commissions, fees and other policies. The class action’s named plaintiffs include Société du Figaro (developer of the Figaro news app and IAP subscriptions), L’Équipe 24/24 (developer of L’Équipe sports news and streaming app, and IAP subscriptions) and le GESTE, a French association comprised of France-based publishers of online content and services, including iOS developers. Plaintiffs claim they purchased overpriced iOS app-distribution and IAP services. “Apple has behaved as alleged herein in a willful attempt to obtain a monopoly in the global market,” the lawsuit states. “There is no valid business necessity or pro-competitive justification for Apple’s conduct.” The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, bringing the France-based developers’ claims to Apple’s homecourt. It accuses Apple of engaging in anticompetitive practices in mandating only one app store for iOS devices, which set the stage for Apple to abuse its market power. For almost 14 years, Apple has levied a default 30 percent commission on paid app and digital in-app product sales conducted through the App Store and in iOS apps acquired from the App Store, according to the lawsuit. “This suit aims to remedy the harm that Apple has caused to France-resident iOS developers—purchaser-participants in the U.S. domestic market for these services—by way of its violations of U.S. antitrust and California fair-competition law,” the complaint begins. Apple also requires developers to pay it an annual fee if they want their apps and in-app products to be considered by Apple for distribution in the App Store. This is especially damaging to smaller and new developers. Putting all iOS apps into one marketplace also means consumers never see most apps, attorneys say, stifling competition and innovation. According to a legal filing made by Apple last year, there were at that time more than 2 million apps available on the App Store. The lawsuit representing France-based iOS developers seeks to force Apple to end its abusive monopoly and allow competition in the distribution of iOS apps and related products, to get rid of pricing mandates, and to reimburse developers for overcharges made through abuse of its monopoly power. The lawsuit states, “Plaintiffs are not alone in their view of Apple’s anti-competitive behavior. In October 2020 the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust released a report in which the authors concluded, among other things, that Apple is a willful monopolist in its operation of the App Store and by way of its IAP product.” The Preceding Developer Settlement In 2021, the firm secured its $100 million settlement on behalf of U.S. iOS developers, which resulted in the creation of a Small Developer Assistance Fund and important changes to App Store policies and practices. In that settlement, small U.S. iOS developers – those with less than $1 million in App Store proceeds through all associated developer accounts per calendar year from June 4, 2015 to Apr. 26, 2021 – can receive payments ranging from minimums of $250 to $30,000 or more, based on historic participation in the iOS App Store ecosystem. In addition to monetary relief, the settlement brought changes to App Store policies and practices for U.S. iOS developers as they relate to App Store search results, app and in-app product price points, appeals from rejections of apps and transparency. Small U.S. iOS developers also will benefit from a pledge that for at least three years following court approval of the settlement, Apple will not raise the 15% commission rate that applies for those participating in its Small Business Program. Among other benefits of the settlement, Apple will permit all U.S. iOS developers to communicate with their customers outside their apps about purchasing methods other than Apple’s IAP system. Apple also will remove the prohibition against U.S. developers using information obtained within their apps to communicate with their customers outside their apps about the use of purchasing methods other than IAP, subject to consumer consent and opt-out safeguards.
