    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Nasdaq Composite Spirals 4% Lower 3:11 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets have widened their losses after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell addressed tariffs and their impact on the economy. Chairman Powell warned that tariffs could throw a wrench into the central bank&#8217;s efforts to tame inflation and spur economic growth. The Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach to monetary policy in the meantime. The Nasdaq Composite is spiraling 4% lower, weighed down by a 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA) and other Big Tech names on the tariff fallout. All sectors of the economy are lower with the exception of energy, which is up 1% as a group. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand as of late afternoon trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 847.60 (-2.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 713.07 (-4.24%) S&amp;P 500: Down 161.77 (-3%) Gainers in a Sea of Red 12:32 pm by Gerelyn Terzo While the markets are a sea of red, including a 2.1% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, there are some gainers if you dig deep enough. We found a few, including: eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is up 2.5% on the day and is inching closer to its 52-week high of approximately $71 per share. The online auction platform could be gaining from a newly announced partnership with Checkout.com for payments. Bitcoin stock MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is tacking on 1.2% today while the bitcoin price continues to hover below the $85,000 level. On its best day, bitcoin serves as an inflationary hedge from the economy, which stands to benefit MSTR stock. Expand Energy (Nasdaq: EXE) is gaining 1.7% as a rising energy sector lifts those boats. Tariff Fallout 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure as of mid-morning trading, with the three major stock market averages stuck in a rut. While March retails sales rose a higher than expected 1.4%, the markets are obsessed with Nvidia (Nasdaq; NVDA), which warned that it will take a massive $5.5 billion charge for processor exports to China, giving the markets their &#8216;I told you so&#8217; moment. Magnificent Seven stocks are each down in the ballpark of 2% this morning, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), whose market cap has dipped below the $3 trillion threshold. The markets are under pressure out of the gate despite stronger than anticipated economic data. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red, including a 1.7% drop in the Nasdaq Composite, which is being weighed down by Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA). On the flip side, Applied Digital (Nasdaq: APLD) is gaining 5% today, bucking the otherwise downward trend, on the heels of its fiscal Q3 results. Despite missing Wall Street&#8217;s expectations, Applied Digital is benefiting from its roll in data center infrastructure for AI and high-performance computing, two white-hot tech trends. The gold price is rising 2.4% today to $3,319.30 per ounce as investors flock to the inflationary hedge during these times of heightened uncertainty. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) is gaining 4% on the day as a beneficiary of the gold rush. The technology sector is being dragged lower by NVDA stock after the company revealed an upcoming $5.5 billion charge related to chip exports to China, igniting trade war selling once again. Nvidia shares are sinking 5.6% today. Most sectors of the economy are down, including a 2.4% decline for technology, while energy stocks are up by 1%. Each of the Magnificent 7 stocks is lower today. Retail sales grew by 1.4% in March, stronger than the expected 1.2% increase and providing yet another sign of a resilient U.S. consumer. Results excluding auto sales also beat economist projections, coming in at 0.5% vs. estimates of 0.3% even in the face of tariff uncertainty targeting the auto sector. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 165.73 (-0.41%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 292.95 (-1.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 47.89 (-0.90%) Market Movers BofA analysts have reiterated their &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Nvidia stock, but it&#8217;s doing little to lift sentiment in shares today. The Wall Street firm also lowered their price target on NVDA to $160 from $200 per share, blaming tariff uncertainty. Oppenheimer analysts have begun coverage on new stock Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) with an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating attached. Piper Sandler likes Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stock, reiterating its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the EV maker while lowering the price target from $450 to $400 per share.

    "text": "The market climate at the time of this writing can be described in a number of ways, but “boring” is certainly not one of them. Ever since President Donald Trump announced his policy of reciprocal tariffs to level the international trade playing field, the stock and bond markets have both become cyclonic in their volatility. 2,000+ point intraday swings in either direction on the Dow Jones Average and a 50 basis point swing for the 10-year Treasury Bond yield in less than a month have given even veteran investors bouts of nausea. As a result, investors from all levels of experience are looking at their portfolios and considering reassessment of their holdings, at least to better handle the current volatility and to reduce the sleepless nights of worry. Key Points The current turbulence in the stock markets are giving both novice and seasoned investors some cause for reconsidering their portfolio compositions. ETFs like SCHD have aspects like dividend focus, which may make them less volatile than ones like VOO, which exclusively tracks the S&amp;P 500 Index. People who are new to investing can find the gigantic menu of choices overwhelming and intimidating, so knowing one’s own goals and risk tolerance before selecting an investment vehicle is a prudent rule of thumb to follow. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Navigating Through A Huge Menu Of Selections The huge array of available investment selections can be intimidating and overwhelming neophyte investors. A relatively new investor with $3,000 to invest was seeking vehicle suggestions, and posted a question on Reddit. He was considering the following, but was open to any other suggestions: He was considering investing in the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE: SCHD) based on what he’d read from other posts. The poster was looking to contribute $100 per week to take advantage of compounding and dollar cost averaging. Admittedly young and inexperienced, he did understand how investing for the long-term was to his advantage, so he was not seeking quick, short-term gains. He was concerned with putting all of his cookies in a single basket, so was inquiring about opinions on diversifying an allocation into the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO). To his credit, the poster realizes now that the Millennial FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) meme of “VOO and chill” might not be an appropriate direction to take in the current climate. Nevertheless, he acknowledges the long-term track record of the S&amp;P 500 and how it has benefited millions who have contributed to it regularly and let it compound to build wealth. As the poster has already established long term goals, assessing risk tolerance is probably the next factor to identify before finalizing his course of action. Taking a closer look at SCHD and VOO is probably a prudent step to accomplish this step. (All market quote details are as of the time of this writing.) Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF The Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF is an exchange traded fund that is designed to track The Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index.

Its tracking of the S&amp;P 500 index has delivered sizable double digit growth for millions of portfolios over the past several years.

As one might expect, a number of the respondents agreed that some diversification was a good idea, as was the plan to invest a new contribution every week. Some of the the specifics included: Due to his youth, some suggested that it would behoove the poster to focus more on growth, and suggested SCHG (Schwab Large Cap Growth ETF), which has a superior ROI history over SCHD. In either case, reinvesting dividends to leverage compounding over the long haul was advised. Some lauded the dividend consideration, since the extra income could serve as a safety net in the event that the poster’s job were to be in jeopardy in the future. Another respondent agreed with adding VOO, but also including an ETF for international exposure so that in the event of a US economic downturn, there would be non-US holdings that could potentially offset any bearishness from the other holdings.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Go Their Own Way 1:20 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market indices are trading mixed, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 posting fractional gains while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is sharply lower, losing 300 points. UnitedHealth Group stock has been a weight on the Dow and S&amp;P 500 today after its worrying quarterly results and outlook. Honeywell (Nasdaq: HON), which is part of the Nasdaq Composite, is gaining over 2% on the day. The company reports its quarterly results on April 29. The company is in the midst of spinning off a couple of business divisions, and the stock is nearing the $200 per share level. Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) is down 1% after BMO Capital cut its price target on the stock to $200 per share, which still represents upside from current levels of $151 per share. Texas Instruments (Nasdaq: TXN) is gaining 1.5% on the day as the company expands its chip footprint in the auto sector. Market Gains Slip 8:17 am The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are struggling to keep their grip on gains after coming out of the gate higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains pressured with a 1.2% loss on the day. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) stock is a major drag on the Dow, owing to disappointing quarterly results, while CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) remains a bright spot, rising 1.2% on the day. Chip stock Qualcomm (Nasdaq: QCOM) is up nearly 1% this morning on a bullish report out of Citi analysts. Sector performance is largely positive, led by a 2.4% gain in energy stocks but dampened by a tech sector that has just turned south. After yesterday&#8217;s massive technology sell-off, the markets are licking their wounds, with the three major stock market averages giving a mixed showing. Among the gainers is the Nasdaq Composite with a 0.63% advance and the S&amp;P 500 also fractionally higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently erasing over 400 points. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green today, a complete reversal from yesterday&#8217;s leader board. The markets are still processing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell&#8217;s comments from yesterday, which were on the hawkish side of monetary policy. Earnings are capturing some attention away from tariffs with railway CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) gaining 1% on the heels of its Q1 print. CSX faced challenges in the quarter, including a 7% year-over-year decline in revenue, but met consensus expectations amid a backdrop of weaker coal prices and dwindling fuel surcharges. Big Tech is mostly showing green this morning but remains mired in losses over the past five-day stretch, including a 2% drop in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL), 14% decline in Meta (Nasdaq: META) and nearly 9% drop in Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) over the past week or so. UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) is a big drag on the Dow, shaving off 18% of its value today alone on disappointing earnings results. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 446 (-1.09%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 118.75 (+0.65%) S&amp;P 500: Up 22 (+0.41%) Market Movers Qualcomm (Nasdaq; QCOM) is rising today on the heels of a bullish report out of Citi analysts, who reportedly raised estimates on the company and added it to their positive catalyst watchlist thanks to robust demand for its chipsets out of China. QCOM stock has been volatile and is down 11% year-to-date. Citi also likes Generac Holdings (Nasdaq: GNRC), upgrading the stock to &#8220;buy&#8221; with a &#8220;high-risk&#8221; tone from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; BMO has upgraded shares of wood producer (NYSE: TREX) Trex to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8220;market perform,&#8221; calling shares attractive. The stock is up 1.8% today. The post Live Nasdaq Composite: CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) Rises Amid Pivot to Earnings appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

    "text": "For some people who&#8217;ve grown addicted to pursuing wealth and the euphoric feeling that often comes with the chase, it can be really tough to find a similar degree of satisfaction with other things in life. Indeed, obsessing over wealth, investments, net worth, and work can have a pretty amazing side effect: a fatter retirement fund and enough financial freedom to do as one&#8217;s heart desires. That said, it&#8217;s important to remember that money is a tool and not the end goal itself. When it comes to things like the net worth of one&#8217;s nest egg, it&#8217;s all too easy to raise the bar and move the goal posts. For many financial overachievers, the &#8220;money doesn&#8217;t buy happiness&#8221; phrase applies. And while these words are easy to dismiss if you haven&#8217;t yet hit your own financial milestones (it&#8217;s proven that money can buy happiness for those who are under financial stress and anxiety), I do think that after accumulating a certain figure in the bank that the phrase begins to ring true, perhaps like never before. Key Points It&#8217;s not healthy to tie one&#8217;s self-worth to one&#8217;s net worth. To quote the great Steve Wozniak, happiness is more a matter of &#8220;smiles minus frowns.&#8221; Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Feeling &#8220;empty&#8221; with $14 million banked? But how? In this piece, we&#8217;ll look at a specific case involving a Reddit user who &#8220;feels empty&#8221; after hitting every major financial milestone. They&#8217;re wondering how they can achieve &#8220;real&#8221; happiness that doesn&#8217;t involve raising the bar again, only to feel the same sense of emptiness later on. Indeed, tying one&#8217;s worth and happiness to money can be a dangerous game, especially as the winds of recession (or Trump recession) roll in and one&#8217;s nest egg stands to take a hit, either due to rising unemployment, re-heated inflation, or a continuously tanking stock market. In the face of such sudden financial setbacks, one may lose more than just a few figures in the bank account; they may also lose a sense of identity and self-worth. Add endless comparisons with colleagues, bosses, or those on social media into the equation, and it&#8217;s easy to feel like one doesn&#8217;t have enough. Sure, a $14 million net worth is profoundly impressive. But if your colleague brags about having far more than that, it can be easy to feel like you need to keep raising the bar in perpetuity, as one misses out on the invaluable experiences that bring about genuine happiness. At the end of the day, there&#8217;s always a bigger fish. And it&#8217;s better not to play the game of comparisons if one seeks fulfillment rather than emptiness. It&#8217;s time to view money as a tool, not as a measure of one&#8217;s worth. It&#8217;s a wise idea to view money as a means to an end rather than the end goal itself. Money comes in, money goes out. But either way, the Reddit user should seek to rediscover things they value more than money and focus on these areas now that they have achieved — and surpassed — all their financial objectives. As such, it&#8217;s important to know when to draw a line in the sand so one can pursue real happiness rather than the dopamine hit to be had from adding a few more dollars to the pile. For a father of four children who has more than enough a family could ever need ($14 million in net worth), our Reddit user doesn&#8217;t need to look too far to find joy and fulfillment. In most pieces responding to Reddit posts, I encourage contacting a financial advisor or wealth planner. But in this piece, I think some counselling is a must, as the individual looks to sever their sense of meaning and value from how much money is coming in. Despite their exceptional financial accomplishments, they do not have a healthy relationship with money. For such an individual, the happiness equation is less about cash inflows minus cash outflows, and perhaps more about &#8220;smiles minus frowns&#8221; — a far better equation that Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak uses to measure his happiness. The bottom line For anyone who can relate to our Reddit user, perhaps it&#8217;s time to keep tabs on all the things that make you smile. Oftentimes, more money can mean more frowns. As such, it&#8217;s essential to diversify your sources of smiles so that you can avoid the type of rude awakening our Reddit user is experiencing now. They&#8217;re experiencing emptiness when they should be reaching peak joy.

While this wound might be self-inflicted, there is no question that the child is hurting, watching a person they love struggle more and more. It’s hard to be in a position where you want to help but aren’t sure if you should, financially, mentally, or a combination of both, as there are no easy answers sometimes. The Heartbreak Unfortunately, the Redditor mentions in a post in r/personalfinance that the father got scammed out of his 401(k) and savings account, leaving himself with around $30,000 in debt that is looking to be consolidated. The good news is that the dad’s wife makes around $90,000 annually and has a substantial $500,000 bank account. Sadly, things went from bad to worse when the father tried to get back on his feet last week, only to realize that a new job opportunity was also a scam. This is a sad story as the couple pays $3,500 for a three-bedroom apartment, which is only likely to last around six years based on their current spending and savings. The original poster seeks advice and help to steer the father’s ship in the right direction and feels lost trying to do so. It doesn’t help that in the comments, the Redditor highlights that the father is resisting any ideas of downsizing to something more affordable, indicating that they “need” three bedrooms. Worse, his new job required him to spend additional money on a credit card, which his father doesn’t have the money to pay off. Again, this situation keeps going from bad to worse. The Scam We’re a bit light on details, but the father got into a situation on Instagram where he fell into a trap by sending a crypto influencer all of his money to invest. Of course, the investment opportunity wasn’t legit, and poof, the money is gone. This past week, he’s fallen into two more traps, with one job convincing him to buy $14,000 worth of Apple products and send them to Texas. He believes this company will reimburse him, but Chase Bank locked his credit card, and now he can’t even buy the essentials. Unfortunately, we have a father here who doesn’t know where to stop and is looking for the next great opportunity using hopes and dreams instead of their brain. Can He Rebuild? In this situation, when the father asks his children and his own brother for loans and money that he promises to pay back, it’s questionable whether anyone will ever see money again. The bottom line is that to rebuild, the father needs a serious reality check and a wake-up call of just how bad their situation is. It’s pretty clear the father is at rock bottom, but somehow manages to keep sinking even worse. The only hope for rebuilding is to get out of this cycle of scams and find a real job with real benefits and at least some job security. If this means swallowing pride and going to work at a gas station, grocery store, or somewhere else that can get him going on the right path, then so be it. The family needs to have an intervention and put everything on the table so there are no secrets between any family members. It seems like the only way to get back on track is to break everything down as much as possible and see if the father can be reasoned with. Lastly, if he keeps asking for money and someone wants to help, only do so by paying the bills directly. However, if the father refuses to see the error of his ways, he will likely lose his money and his family, including his wife.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Trade Deals 3:06 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly revealed that the U.S. has secured one trade deal, keeping most of the details close to the vest except to say that the White House is awaiting a green light from some unnamed country. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 300 points in response for a 0.84% gain, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are holding similar gains. Narrow Range 12:34 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are managing slight gains across the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average despite the absence of greater details on any global trade deals. Of the S&amp;P 500, Baird investment strategist Ross Mayfield is cited by CNBC as saying, “I think [stocks are] probably trapped in a in a pretty tight range here,&#8221; pointing to a range of 5,100-5,700. “I think we can bounce around there for quite a while in kind of some volatile, choppy trading. Until we get some resolution on the trade front, I don’t think much else matters,&#8221; he added. Consumer Weakness 11:03 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market averages are currently all moving higher despite some weaker than anticipated economic data. The U.S. consumer has long been credited with upholding the economy throughout the one-two punch of inflation and higher interest rates. Now the tariffs could be the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back, as consumer confidence shows signs of waning. The Consumer Confidence Index published by the Conference Board sank to a reading of 86 in April, a drop of nearly 8 points from the prior month and below economist estimates calling for 87.7. A separate index that reflects consumer sentiment over the next six months fell by a steep 12.5 points to a reading of 54.4, its worst level in over a decade. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that March job postings dropped to their lowest level in about six months. Tariffs, Earnings and Tech 10:00 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets continue to trade mixed this morning on tariff deal ambiguity as Q1 earnings results pour in. Stocks are weighing earnings results and a lack of certainty on the tariff deal front while tensions have emerged between Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and the White House over tariff-related costs. Magnificent Seven stocks are mixed, with Amazon and Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) trading in the red while Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) benefits from a Wall Street endorsement. Hims &amp; Hers HEalth (Nasdaq: HIMS) is soaring by 24% today on news of a deal to sell weight loss drug phenom Wegovy on its e-commerce platform. The markets are holding out for more tariff deal progress, digging in their heels and nearly standing still in the meantime. The three major stock market averages are moving fractionally in either direction, with the Nasdaq Composite posting slight declines alongside the S&amp;P 500 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is eking out modest gains. Sectors of the economy are evenly split between red and green, with real estate moving higher and consumer discretionary stocks headed lower. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is getting some unwanted attention after the White House took aim at the tech giant, calling its reported plans to list tariff cost impacts on its site as a &#8220;hostile and political act.&#8221; Big 3 automaker General Motors (NYSE: GM) reported better-than-expected quarterly results while reassessing its full-year outlook, sending the stock lower by 1.5%. GM and the auto sector have targets on their backs at the height of the tariff wars, in response to which the former Dow component has suspended all share buyback programs. The White House has affirmed its plans to provide tariff relief to the auto sector. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 138.11 (+0.36%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 67.15 (-0.40%) S&amp;P 500: Down 10.23 (-0.19%) Earnings &amp; Analyst Calls Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) surpassed Q1 expectations on the top and bottom lines and is keeping its full-year guidance intact amid expectations that it will be able to manage any tariff-related fallout, including rising aluminum costs. Rival company PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) recently lowered its earnings forecast due to the tariff impact. Evercore ISI has reiterated its &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock with a $250 price target, suggesting the company&#8217;s strategies should help it to offset any impact from the tariff frenzy. Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), saying that the China tariff uncertainties notwithstanding, the AI leader&#8217;s strong market relationships give the stock a place in the analyst firm&#8217;s top large cap pick universe. UBS has reiterated its &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) but lowered the price target to $253 from $272, owing to what it described as &#8220;potential demand destruction.&#8221; The post Live Nasdaq Composite: Markets Stand Still on Tariff and Tech Tussle appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

[00:00:41] Lee Jackson: And as you and I both know, that&#8217;s the case with names that he&#8217;s had like Coca-Cola. And somebody American Express that he&#8217;s had for 10, 15, 20 years. And I always thought that was a great quote. My, my favorite holding time is forever. And I think one of the most interesting quotes recently, and he kind of stayed out. [00:01:04] Lee Jackson: He says even though he kind of tends to vote Democrat, he stays outta the political fray for the most part. But he started talking about tariffs, and he was basically getting into the whole point of tariffs are basically attacked and they&#8217;re just attacks on goods. And the quote that I loved when he goes the tooth fairy isn&#8217;t gonna pay that tax. [00:01:29] Lee Jackson: And I&#8217;m like, okay, probably not. But, when you have a guy like that who&#8217;s so widely followed and so widely recognized, as likely the greatest investor of the last 50 or 60 years, he is gonna be a quotable guy. We&#8217;ve constantly written about him. And the interesting thing for our viewers and of course our 24 7 readers, is that even though the markets have come back some from the lows, Berkshire Hathaway has been up all year long. And even when the markets were down at bare lows, 20% lows, it was still up 9% for the year. So, yeah, I think the best holding time is forever for an S&amp;P 500 stock. [00:02:15] Doug McIntyre: Well, one of the reasons I love that quote is. It&#8217;s because he likes stocks with a moats. There&#8217;s, when he goes into one of these stocks, I think the first thing he looks at, other than obviously earnings, is how hard is it for somebody else to get into this business? Right? Do you want try to compete with Coke from scratch? [00:02:38] Doug McIntyre: Impossible, absolutely impossible. American from scratch. A big oil company from scratch. Impossible. He held, he still holds Apple, but I mean, he bought a whole bunch of it. You wanna try to compete with Apple from scratch. He loves these companies where he knows that the chances that somebody can come in and compete with directly with him is very low. [00:03:04] Doug McIntyre: I mean, he&#8217;s in the railroad business. It used to be public now, he just decided he is gonna take the whole thing private. But it&#8217;s the same philosophy. Do you wanna try to compete with, are you gonna build the tracks, buy the engines, hire the answer is no. So my favorite Buffett quote, and I won&#8217;t get this exactly right, is every two years he sends out the managers of all of his companies a letter, and he says, it&#8217;s okay if you lose money. [00:03:33] Doug McIntyre: We can afford to lose money. Obviously I don&#8217;t want you to lose it forever. but we can&#8217;t afford to lose a shred of reputation. He said, I absolutely money that&#8217;s fixable. But the day, and he said, I wanna make sure that a fair but unfriendly reporter can do a story about us on the front of the Wall Street Journal and our reputation will be intact. [00:03:59] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. That&#8217;s another thing Buffett understands is that, and one of the great examples is Johnson and Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), when there was that scare about Advil. Right. Okay. That was a long time ago, but you remember, Burke, who was the CEO then took every single bottle off every single shelf of cattle in the country. [00:04:22] Doug McIntyre: And you talk about reputation protection, and I mean, that&#8217;s one of Buffett&#8217;s philosophies is its reputation. [00:04:31] Lee Jackson: Well, and I think, are you sure you don&#8217;t mean the Tylenol scare? Was it Tylenol or Advil? Tylenol. It was Tylenol, and at first you&#8217;re right about Advil, they did pull that a few years back on concerns over liver toxicity. [00:04:47] Lee Jackson: But the one you remember is when J&amp;J, Tylenol&#8217;s owned now by Kenvue, which was the spinoff in 23 from J&amp;J. But when that all happened, and gosh, that&#8217;s been 30, 40 years ago. Yeah, it was in the eighties, I think. But you&#8217;re right, they took every single bottle of Tylenol and it was all taken off the market because people died. And, yeah, that&#8217;s the way you save your rep. [00:05:16] Lee Jackson: And not that Johnson and Johnson hasn&#8217;t had enough issues with the baby powder and the talcum powder and all that stuff. They&#8217;re fixing to have to, they&#8217;re trying to get that settled out. [00:05:26] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. Anyway, Buffett number one, hold my stocks forever. Number two, reputation, [00:05:34] Lee Jackson: And number three, tariffs are nothing more than a tax, and they&#8217;re not paid for by the tooth fairy. [00:05:40] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. And the tax thing is absolutely right. The post Warren Buffett Sees Right Through Trump&#8217;s Tariffs appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

    "text": "Jensen Huang, who arguably runs the world&#8217;s most successful company, made only $1.5 million last year, according to the Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) proxy (PRE 14A). That is up $1 million from the year before. That pay was so low because most of his compensation comes from stock awards and “nonincentive compensation,” which can vary. In other words, the $1.5 million was all he could count on. It was his first base salary increase in a decade. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Last year, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) Jensen Huang had his first base salary increase in a decade. Low compensation is not usually for CEOs who run the world’s most valuable companies. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Huang has a net worth of $98 billion, which makes him the 17th richest person in the world. Nvidia’s stock is down this year, so that figure has dropped $16 billion since January 1. Nvidia is the third most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $2.7 trillion. The stock has dropped 17% so far this year. Most of Huang’s compensation for the recently reported year came from a stock award of $38 million. The problem with that award is that, if Nvidia’s stock drops, that sum could go down as well. Huang owns 3.5% of the company he founded in 1993. He turned it from a graphic chip company into the largest artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world. Huang’s low compensation is not usually for CEOs who run the world’s most valuable companies. Warren Buffett’s cash compensation last year was only $100,000. Because of his ownership in Berkshire Hathaway, his net worth is $166 billion, which makes him the sixth richest person in the world. From 1997 to 2011 when Steve Jobs retired as Apple’s CEO, his base cash compensation was only $1. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO today, had a base cash salary of $3 million last year. The low base salaries of highly successful CEOs are hard to explain. Do they tell investors that their pay is tied almost completely to performance? Or are they saying that to their employees? Huang and his board did not say. Three Things That Need to Happen for Nvidia to Have Another Banner Year in 2025 The post Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Made Only $1.5 Million Last Year appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Ford in Focus 3:55 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets finished the day the way that it started &#8211; lower -putting an end to a multi-day winning streak. Now the markets are gearing up to process quarterly earnings results from Ford (NYSE: F), whose stock fell 1.2% during regular market hours. Automakers have had a target on their backs for tariffs, and the markets will be looking for greater clarity on any impacts in Ford&#8217;s performance. Here&#8217;s how the major indices finished the day: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 69.52 (-0.17%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 132.40 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 36.79 (-0.66%) America First Economy 12:38 pm by Gerelyn Terzo U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is speaking at the Milken conference today, addressing global investors about President Trump&#8217;s economic agenda. As part of his America First vision, President Trump is looking to make the U.S. economy more appealing to investors amid a strategy involving tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation &#8211; oh my. While the markets await further details on trade talk progress, the three major stock market averages are mixed, including a slight gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain lower. Tariff Uncertainty Remains 11:36 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Dow Jones Industrial Average has turned higher, managing a 7-point gain after starting the session in the red. Meanwhile, technology stocks continue to weigh on the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. According to TD Cowen, tariff-related price hikes are set to rear their heads in May&#8217;s inflation print. Much of the tariff damage will unfold in the summer months as lower-priced inventories dwindle at businesses. The firm says consumers are between a rock and a hard place as tariff-related costs trickle down to them, a situation exacerbated by higher shipping costs. Selling Eases 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure this morning but are off their lowest levels of the session. Netflix (Nasdaq; NFLX) shares are off about 2% on the day after last week&#8217;s rally. ON Semi (Nasdaq: ON) is falling 8% on the day after reporting its Q1 results, while industry peer Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is gaining 2%. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand with the broader market averages: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 53.67 (-0.16%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 97.38 (-0.55%) S&amp;P 500: Down 30.46 (-0.52%) After a week of gains, fear has settled into the markets once again amid a bevy of catalysts. In addition to earnings, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell set to comment on the economy this week, suggesting it could be yet another roller coaster ride for investors. First-quarter earnings season continues to roll on, with names like Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) as well as Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Diamondback Energy (Nasdaq: FANG) on the docket in the coming days. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red out of the gate, including a 1% decline in the Nasdaq Composite. Mag Seven stocks are mixed while the sell-off continues to unfold in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) shares, with a 2% decline today. All sectors of the economy are currently lower, the most severe of which is happening in energy stocks, which are down 2% this morning as the oil price continues its descent. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) has reached the end of an era now that billionaire Warren Buffett announced his retirement after six decades at the helm. With $300 million in cash on the sidelines, BRK-B is losing 6% on the day for a market cap of $1.09 trillion. Greg Abel will succeed Buffett at year-end 2025. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 196.82 (-0.49%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 175.23 (-1.03%) S&amp;P 500: Down 52.04 (-0.88%) Market Movers Footwear company Skechers (NYSE: SKX) is going private, agreeing to a private equity takeover by 3G Capital in a deal that values the company at $63 per share, sending the stock higher by a double-digit percentage today. Jefferies has reiterated its &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), suggesting the valuation has already given the stock the benefit of the doubt in areas like tech innovation and scalability. Mizuho analysts like Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE), upgrading shares to an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating from &#8220;neutral&#8221; on an attractive risk/reward profile. The stock is up 3.5% today.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Pivot to Ford Earnings 4:03 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets failed to turn around, ending the trading session lower across the board and ending a multi-session winning streak. Stocks are awaiting further details on trade deals, which the White House has revealed could come as soon as this week, which would not be soon enough for the markets. Ford (NYSE: F) stock fell just over 1% on the day ahead of the automaker&#8217;s quarterly results after the closing bell today. When fellow automaker General Motors (NYSE: GM) reported its quarterly results last month, the company withdrew its profit guidance due to tariff uncertainty. Here&#8217;s how the major indices finished the trading day: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 69.52 (-0.17%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 132.40 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 36.79 (-0.66%) Economic Uncertainty 12:32 pm by Gerelyn Terzo U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is making the rounds, speaking to global investors today about President Trump&#8217;s economic plan. He pointed to a three-pronged approach, including tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation. Bessent&#8217;s remarks failed to provide any greater clarity on the status of tariff negotiations with key U.S. trade partners, leaving the markets at a standstill. The three major stock market averages remain mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average moving higher while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain lower. Winners and Losers 10:43 am by Gerelyn Terzo Airline stock Delta (NYSE: DAL) is gaining 3% on the day, while United Airlines (Nasdaq: UAL) is tacking on 2.7%. EQT (NYSE: EQT) is advancing by 2.9% on the day on the heels of a dividend announcement. Ralph Lauren (NYSE: RL) is up 2.8%. Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN) is losing 9.6% today on a quarterly revenue miss. Zimmer Biomet (NYSE: ZBH) is also down 9%. In what is proving to be a volatile session on Wall Street, the markets have come off their lows of the session. The markets are coming off the heels of a nine-day winning streak and have come out of the gate with plenty of headlines to process, chief among which has been the announced retirement of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett. Wall Street firm TD Cowen has issued a report suggesting that price increases from tariffs will be reflected in May&#8217;s inflation data. The Federal Reserve gathers this week to determine the near-term outlook on interest rates while the markets will also be paying close attention to the tone in comments from Chairman Jerome Powell. First-quarter earnings continues to unfold as names like Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR), Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Diamondback Energy (Nasdaq: FANG) take the spotlight. Mag Seven stocks are a mixed bag as shares of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) extend their losses with a 2% decline today. Sectors of the economy were originally all lower but industrials and telecom stocks have since made their way into the green. Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) shares are lower after President Trump tossed in fresh tariffs on foreign-made films. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 50.53 (-0.12%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 133.34 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 32.82 (-0.58%) Market Movers Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) is down 6% but maintains a $1.1 trillion market cap as Buffett prepares to pass the reins to his successor Greg Abel at the end of the year. Footwear stock Skechers (NYSE: SKX) has decided to leave the publicly traded markets behind and has accepted a private equity takeover by 3G Capital for $63 per share, sending the stock higher by 25% percentage today. Jefferies maintains a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), suggesting the valuation has already given the stock the benefit of the doubt in areas like tech innovation and scalability. Mizuho analysts are bullish on Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE), lifting shares to an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating from &#8220;neutral&#8221; on an attractive risk/reward profile and sending the stock 3.5% higher today.

Microsoft eventually grew out of stagnation with Cloud, Social Media, Gaming, AI. Potential catalysts for Apple today include AI-fueled growth in Services, foldable iPhones, and new wearable devices. I estimate these catalysts could drive 63% to 79% stock upside if Apple's P/E (28) and PEG (2.88) remain stable, though I acknowledge these rely on very bullish assumptions.",

    "text": "Dividend stock investing offers a reliable path to passive income and long-term wealth creation, making it a cornerstone for many portfolios. By owning shares in companies that pay regular dividends, investors gain consistent cash flow, often from stable, high-quality firms like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Dividends provide a hedge against market volatility, as payouts persist even during downturns, and reinvesting them can compound returns significantly over time. Moreover, dividend-paying stocks historically outperform non-dividend peers, with lower volatility. 24/7 Wall St. Insights: Dividend stock investing has proven a reliable path for investors to gather immense wealth over time. Dividend ETFs bolster those results by investing in hundreds of dividend-paying stocks, offering instant diversification and minimizing single-stock risk. Sit back and let dividends do the heavy lifting for a simple, steady path to serious wealth creation over time. Grab a free copy of “2 Legendary High-Yield Dividend Stocks“ now. Dividend-paying exchange-traded funds (ETFs) enhance these benefits by pooling dozens or hundreds of such stocks, offering instant diversification, reduced single-stock risk, and low expense ratios. In 2025’s uncertain market, marked by tariffs and persistent inflation, dividend ETFs provide resilience and income stability. Pursuing this strategy ensures steady returns and growth, making it ideal for both novice and seasoned investors seeking financial security. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Any discussion of dividend ETFs must begin with Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). It is a top-tier dividend ETF, tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index with around 100 high-quality stocks like Lockheed-Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), each boasting more than 10 years of dividend growth. The ETF&#8217;s 3.7% yield and ultra-low 0.06% expense ratio make it cost-effective while limiting sector exposure to no more than 25% ensures diversification. SCHD’s 11.4% annualized return over a decade reflects its balance of income and growth. Because SCHD focuses on financially sound companies, the dividend ETF mitigates risks, offering investors stability. For those seeking high yield and reliability, SCHD stock is a must-own ETF for lifelong passive income. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSE:VYM) tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, holding 589 stocks like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), with no stock exceeding 4% of the portfolio. VYM&#8217;s 2.7% yield and 0.06% expense ratio deliver strong value, while its 13.3% five-year annualized return highlights its consistency. VYM also offers broad diversification across sectors like energy and financials, reducing volatility, making it ideal for conservative investors. With tariff&#8217;s top-of-mind for investors these days, the ETF&#8217;s U.S.-focused holdings provide resilience against global disruptions. Its proven track record and low costs makes VYM a foundational ETF for steady dividend income and long-term wealth building. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEARCA:VIG) targets companies with over 10 years of dividend increases, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and holds 338 stocks in its portfolio. The ETF&#8217;s 1.8% yield is lower, but its focus on dividend growth drives an 11.2% annualized return over the past decade. VIG&#8217;s 0.05% expense ratio is also among the lowest, maximizing investor returns. The Vanguard dividend ETF’s tech- and consumer-heavy portfolio suits investors prioritizing capital appreciation alongside income. And for investors looking for exposure to stable, growing firms, VIG cushions against economic uncertainty. It&#8217;s another ETF sporting a blend of growth and income, making it a versatile choice for investors seeking a balance of dividends and upside potential. iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO) The iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:DGRO) tracks the Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index, holding over 400 stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), and emphasizes its consistent dividend growth. DGRO sports a 2.3% yield and 0.08% expense ratio, offering a balanced income stream and a 16.4% annualized return over five years. The ETF&#8217;s diversified sector exposure, including financials and healthcare, minimizes risk. In today&#8217;s volatile market, the ETF&#8217;s focus on resilient, dividend-growing companies counters the extreme swings the market is experiencing. DGRO’s low cost and steady performance make it an excellent choice for investors seeking dependable income with moderate growth in a challenging economic landscape. ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL) The last dividend ETF to consider is ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NYSEARCA:NOBL), which tracks the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. It holds over 60 stocks, each with over 25 years of dividend increases, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and C.H. Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW). With a 2.5% yield and 0.35% expense ratio, it reflects NOBL&#8217;s premium quality, which has generated 14.5% annualized returns over the last five years. The ETF&#8217;s equal-weighted approach also reduces concentration risk, while its focus on elite dividend payers ensures stability. NOBL’s defensive holdings, with a long history of thriving amid uncertainty, offer investors reliable payouts. For those prioritizing quality and consistency, NOBL’s proven resilience makes it a stellar long-term holding for passive income.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Buy the Rumor 1:41 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America has issued a report advising investors to buy the trade deal anticipation but sell the news. BofA Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett wrote, &#8220;Oversold equities have correctly front-run Q2 trade deals/lower tariffs. We expect ‘buy the expectation, sell the fact,’ stocks fade into the trade deals.&#8221; The White House is expected to meet with China officials on potentially reaching a trade agreement over the weekend. Stocks remain lower out of caution. Markets Hold Back 12:09 pm by Gerelyn Terzo China&#8217;s government officials have come out swinging against the White House, saying they strongly opposes what they described as &#8220;U.S. abuse&#8221; of reciprocal tariffs. Earlier today, President Trump revealed that he was willing to reduce tariffs on China imports to 80% from a triple-digit percentage level. Washington, D.C. and Beijing officials are set to come to the negotiating table this weekend. Stocks are lower on the trade deal uncertainty. Markets Reverse Course 10:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market has reversed course, leaving all three of the major stock market averages in the red after coming out of the gate higher on China trade deal hopes. Traders and investors appear to be playing it cautiously until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. Market declines are modest, including a 0.07% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. At this rate, stocks are likely to continue meandering between positive and negative ground for now. Weekly Performance 9:44 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a fractional gain today and has advanced a more impressive 7.9% over the past month. Year-to-date, the tech-heavy index is still lower by 6%. Over the past five trading sessions, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) has gained 5% while Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has lost 7.4%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are looking to end the week on a positive note after getting some good news on the trade war. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from a triple-digit percentage to 80%, saying that level seems appropriate as the White House gears up for talks with Beijing. Stocks appear to be cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning. While China has been the wildcard, the Trump administration suggested that multiple agreements are being reached with U.S. trade partners, injecting further optimism into these markets. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are lifting the Nasdaq Composite higher, including a 1% gain in Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and 2.5% jump in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also getting a pop from Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock on a strong Dreamliners jet order from the British Airways parent company. BA stock is up 1.4%. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 114.55 (+0.26%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 102.00 (+0.57%) S&amp;P 500: Up 24.36 (+0.41%) Market Movers Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) might be a volatile play, but that is what it takes to trade as one of the leading tech stocks. As of yesterday, Palantir has muscled its way into the top 10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, boasting a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. By way of comparison, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers at a lesser $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is down 1% today on profit taking. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is soaring 22.8% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue ballooned by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%. Lyft (Nasdaq: LYFT) stock is rising today after lifting its Q2 forecast and initiating a $750 million share buyback program. Most Wall Street analysts have a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock. Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) is taking a breather after announcing a blockbuster deal to acquire options trading platform Deribit in a $2.9 billion deal, thrusting it into the crypto derivatives realm.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended The Magnificent 7 Could See Even More Upside 11:38 am While today’s 1,000-point Dow rally has been impressive, similar days may be ahead. When the U.S. and China meet again in the next few weeks, they’ll work out a bigger agreement on trade. While nothing has been set in stone with that just yet, markets are still celebrating today’s trade breakthrough. Here’s where that currently stands. Under the 90-day pause, both countries lowered tariffs by 115 percentage points to 10%. The 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remains in place, so most Chinese goods face a 30% rate in total, down from 145% previously, as noted by CNBC. The Magnificent 7 Are Just Starting to Rally Back 10:50 am As of May, the Magnificent 7 lost about $6 trillion in value since their peak in late 2024. Also, at its trough, the Roundhill BIG Tech ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS) – which tracks the Magnificent 7 plummeted from about $56 to a low of $39. However, thanks to the latest U.S.-China news, the ETF is quickly rebounding higher. Making the Mag 7 even more attractive, analysts believe they can easily beat the S&amp;P 500 in earnings this year. Plus, with valuations off their 2024 peaks, investors are coming back to the table to feast. The U.S. and China have finally agreed to a temporary – but significant easing of tariffs. In fact, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. tariffs on China will drop 115 percentage points to 30%. China’s levies on U.S. imports will drop to 10%. More information on specifics can be found in the Joint Statement on U.S. China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva at WhiteHouse.gov. As a result of the agreement, the Dow Jones is up about 1,050 points. The NASDAQ is up 663, as the S&amp;P 500 adds 156 points. Even better, it’s boosting the Magnificent 7 stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is up 5.6%, or $11.25. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up 1%, or by $4.80. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) is up about 3%, or by $4.71. com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is up 7.4% or by $14.55. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up 4%, or by $4.80. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) I up 6.5%, or by $38.73. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is up 7%, or by $21.23.

    "text": "According to The Wall Street Journal, the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone will probably become more expensive. Apparently, the company will not discuss the effects of tariffs. Instead, some iPhone prices will rise as Apple adds features. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: The iPhone reportedly will become more expensive as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) adds new features. But will users be willing to pay more for it? Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The paper reports, “New iPhones set to be released in the fall include some design and format changes, including an ultrathin design.” Samsung has just released an ultrathin phone called the S25 Edge. Samsung management hopes the product will chip away at Apple’s market share. Apple management cannot hide that tariffs are a financial problem. In March, Apple raced to get more iPhone inventory to the United States to avoid tariffs that would start in April. CEO Tim Cook also said Apple would move most of its manufacturing to India. However, he cannot solve the problem of more expensive models that the company still makes in China. Apple says that tariff costs will hit it with $900 million in expenses in the current quarter. Apple’s dilemma is whether customers will pay more for iPhones. The iPhone 16 Pro Max retails for $1,199, but it is trying to keep customers with the much less expensive iPhone 16e, which retails for $599. Apple has two hurdles, one of which is old. iPhone upgrades have been modest when the company has released the most frequent models, which it does once a year. The camera is better, and the chips are faster. Many customers cannot tell the difference or do not care. Apple’s second problem is more recent. Its AI product is considered weak compared to other large tech companies. It has delayed the release of its Siri AI upgrade until next year. At the same time, the competition continues to release more advanced products. New York Times’s Kevin Roose recently wrote, “Apple is not meeting the moment in AI.” In the meantime, users can easily download every major AI app onto an iPhone. If Apple wants to raise iPhone prices, it will need more than a better camera. Why Is No One Talking About Apple’s Long-Term Artificial Intelligence Plans?

    "text": "A perfect storm of the greatest financial opportunities of our lifetimes may be before us, with unprecedented amounts of foreign capital, 18 trade deals in the final stages of negotiation, and upcoming tax cuts. Nearly $3 trillion of investment commitments in AI have been announced, which span a period of years. Oracle, NVIDIA, and Apple are major players, along with the UAE, Open AI, and Softbank.Risk is present from China producing less expensive or more powerful chips, or imposing trade restrictions that could greatly impact our tech companies. However, the US is striving to be the dominant world leader of AI, for which It does not take a genius to consider long term holds for Oracle, NVIDIA, and Apple. In the last 5 weeks NVIDIA has risen 23.6%, up from a low of 94, to 116. However, that is well under their 2025 highpoint of 149. Similarly, the 2025 high of Oracle was 186, but currently is 150, while Apple has dropped 61 points since the day after Christmas, and is now 198, down 23.5%. Although we may see some significant volatility with trade negotiations in the short term, for the coming years, I would expect the large domestic investments made by these key tech companies to produce excellent returns. Also, Taiwan Semiconductors is investing $100 billion for producing their chips here, and that stock is down over 21% in the last 2 ½ months. Likely this would also be a very good hold.What do AI data centers need? Electricity! By 2030, AI data centers are estimated to require 9% of total electricity usage in the United States, with overall demand for electricity projected to increase by 16%. AI data centers are planned for Texas, Louisiana, Ohio, North Carolina, and other areas, for which one might look at providers of electricity in those states. Oncor, that is owned by Sempra, is a major servicer of Texas. The parent company is one of the largest utility holding companies in the US, with current pricing of $75 per share, which is down from $87 in early January, and is paying a dividend of 3.4%. American Electric Power (AEP) is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, for which that stock is up almost 14% this year, and paying a current dividend yield of 3.54%. AEP exceeded analyst expectations of earnings per share by 8.1%, while Ohio is experiencing growth with favorable tax legislation. Several AI data centers are planned for south Florida, while Florida has experienced tremendous population growth, gaining nearly 2 million more residents since 2019. When speaking of electricity to power Florida, one might consider investments in Nexterra, that owns Florida Power and Light, the largest utility in the state, and has a dividend yield of 3.22%. I also am an advocate for Duke Energy, which is held by numerous pension funds. Duke is one of the three great universities of Research Triangle Park, along with the University of North Carolina and North Carolina State. This area of the country has one of the highest concentrations of PhD’s, for which Apple and others are investing in data centers in North Carolina. Duke Energy is up about 12% in 2025, which is excellent for a bit over 4 months, and has a dividend yield of 3.47%.An additional component for not only the construction of AI data centers, but for the expansion of many industries that will benefit from the huge investments being made in the US, is&#8230; infrastructure! This leads one to ETFs for materials. One might take a look at XLB, Vanguard Materials (VAW), and Invesco (PYZ).What is driving both foreign and domestic investment in the US, is the likely legislation of tax cuts, combined with no tariffs for producing goods in the United States. This is a one-two punch for an economic stimulus, along with 18 trade deals being in the stages of final negotiation, which hopefully will dramatically increase US production and exports.This is the first in a series of articles to capitalize on the trillions of dollars of investment commitments that have been announced in recent weeks, along with a multitude of trade deals and tax cut legislation that should be forthcoming. The phrase that comes to mind is that the best time is… NOW!I encourage the reader to do their own research, and to consult with a competent investment advisor.
