In 2021, these renewable projects avoided 13.9 million metric tons of carbon emissions. The projects online today will support greenhouse gas reductions equivalent to removing 3 million cars from the road for one year. Apple is constantly working with its global supply chain to accelerate and support its transition to clean energy. As of today, 213 of the company’s major manufacturing partners have pledged to power all Apple production with renewable electricity across 25 countries. The dozens of new commitments announced today will accelerate progress toward Apple’s 2030 goal to become carbon neutral across its entire supply chain. Apple has been carbon neutral for its global operations since 2020. “We are proud that so many of our manufacturing partners have joined our urgent work to address the climate crisis by generating more renewable energy around the world,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Clean energy is good for business and good for the planet. By sharing what we learned in our own transition to renewables, we are helping point the way to a greener future.” Supplier Commitments and Global Energy Projects In addition to clean energy commitments made by 213 manufacturing partners, Apple is investing directly in renewable projects around the world, including nearly 500 megawatts of solar and other renewable projects in China and Japan to cover a portion of upstream emissions. To support businesses in their transition to clean power, Apple shares data and offers training materials with market-specific information. These resources have helped spur new clean energy solutions across the globe. In Europe, 11 new suppliers have made clean energy commitments over the last year, including Infineon, Viscom AG, and Lumileds, bringing the total to 25 European companies. They are deploying a range of clean energy solutions, including Infineon utilizing on-site solar in Germany and Austria, and DSM Engineering Materials supporting a wind project in the Netherlands. Apple has already supported two Danish renewable energy projects, including a large solar park near Thisted and wind farm near Esbjerg, both of which power Apple’s data center in the country. The company is also looking at new steps to address customer product use across the region. In the US, Apple is investing directly in the 2,300-acre IP Radian Solar project in Brown County, Texas. The project will generate 300 megawatts of electricity once construction is completed later this year. Apple made this investment to help address the electricity customers use to charge their Apple devices, which represents 22 percent of the company’s gross carbon footprint. Apple’s suppliers with US operations also continue to commit to clean energy, with notable new commitments from DuPont, headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware; and Micron Technology, Inc., headquartered in Boise, Idaho, announced today. Already, Apple suppliers Solvay and Corning are helping to support some of the largest solar farms in North Carolina and South Carolina as part of their commitment to Apple. In China, 23 new suppliers have joined the program in the last year. Nearly all of Apple’s top suppliers headquartered in China have committed to using clean energy for Apple production, with many building on-site solar, while supporting the country’s transition to renewable power. This includes new commitments from suppliers such as Ruicycle, which will be using clean energy in its closed-loop recycling processes for Apple. In 2018, Apple took an innovative approach to accelerate renewable progress in China with the launch of the China Clean Energy Fund. Through this first-of-its-kind investment fund, Apple and its suppliers have invested together in 465 megawatts of clean energy. In Japan, new options for clean power are emerging for businesses, as power purchase agreements have become more available. While corporate energy buyers were previously limited to rooftop solar and unbundled certificate options, collaborative advocacy has further opened up the market. Twenty new suppliers have committed to clean energy in Japan in the last year, including Kioxia Corporation and Sharp Corporation. Nitto Denko and many of Apple’s other suppliers have invested in on-site solar, and Keiwa is covering its Apple load with power from a wind project located outside of Tokyo. In South Korea, LG Display Co. Ltd. and Samsung SDI have committed to clean energy for all Apple production. This addition to the program builds on significant progress over the last year, with a total 13 suppliers committing to bring clean energy online. In markets where suppliers face particular challenges to accessing cost-effective clean energy, Apple works with partners to break down barriers through innovation and policy engagement. Community Impact of Clean Power As Apple continues to accelerate progress toward carbon neutrality across its entire global supply chain, the company is also focused on supporting the communities most impacted by climate change. Through its Power for Impact program, Apple provides under-resourced local communities around the world with access to renewable energy while supporting economic growth and social impact. Currently, solar projects in Colombia, the Philippines, and South Africa are providing affordable and reliable electricity to communities facing significant energy challenges. Apple continues to expand the program to other parts of the world, including Israel, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam. These projects bring jobs and lead to energy savings that can be reinvested into local communities. Apple retains the environmental attributes of each project, and communities use energy savings to support economic growth, education, health, and other social initiatives.

Self Service Repair is available in the US and will expand to additional countries — beginning in Europe — later this year. The new online store offers more than 200 individual parts and tools, enabling customers who are experienced with the complexities of repairing electronic devices to complete repairs on the iPhone® 12 and iPhone 13 lineups and iPhone SE (3rd generation), such as the display, battery, and camera. Later this year the program will also include manuals, parts, and tools to perform repairs on Mac® computers with Apple silicon. To start the Self Service Repair process, a customer will first review the repair manual for the product they want to repair by visiting support.apple.com/self-service-repair. Then, they can visit the Apple Self Service Repair Store and order the necessary parts and tools. Every genuine Apple part is designed and engineered for each product, and goes through extensive testing to ensure the highest quality, safety, and reliability. The parts are the same ones — at the same price — as those available to Apple’s network of authorized repair providers. For certain repairs, customers will receive a credit when returning a replaced part for recycling. The Apple tools available to customers on the Self Service Repair Store are the same as used by Apple’s repair network. They are custom designed to help provide the best repairs for Apple products, and are engineered to withstand the rigors of high-volume, professional repair operations where safety and reliability are the utmost priority. The high-quality tools offered through Self Service Repair include torque drivers, repair trays, display and battery presses, and more. Apple will offer tool rental kits for $49, so that customers who do not want to purchase tools for a single repair still have access to these professional repair tools. The weeklong rental kits will ship to customers for free. Self Service Repair is part of Apple’s efforts to further expand access to repairs. For the vast majority of customers who do not have experience repairing electronic devices, visiting a professional repair provider with certified technicians who use genuine Apple parts is the safest and most reliable way to get a repair. Over the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training, including more than 3,000 Independent Repair Providers. A global network of more than 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers supports more than 100,000 active technicians. As a result, in the US, eight out of 10 Apple customers are located within 20 minutes of an authorized service provider. Also today, Apple published a paper, “Expanding Access to Safe, Reliable, and Secure Service and Repair,” which details Apple’s approach to designing long-lasting products and increasing access to repairs. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple’s five software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.

The Company posted a March quarter revenue record of $97.3 billion, up 9 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.52. “This quarter’s record results are a testament to Apple’s relentless focus on innovation and our ability to create the best products and services in the world,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We are delighted to see the strong customer response to our new products, as well as the progress we’re making to become carbon neutral across our supply chain and our products by 2030. We are committed, as ever, to being a force for good in the world — both in what we create and what we leave behind.” “We are very pleased with our record business results for the March quarter, as we set an all-time revenue record for Services and March quarter revenue records for iPhone, Mac, and Wearables, Home and Accessories. Continued strong customer demand for our products helped us achieve an all-time high for our installed base of active devices,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Our strong operating performance generated over $28 billion in operating cash flow, and allowed us to return nearly $27 billion to our shareholders during the quarter.” Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of the Company’s common stock, an increase of 5 percent. The dividend is payable on May 12, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 9, 2022. The board of directors has also authorized an increase of $90 billion to the existing share repurchase program.
