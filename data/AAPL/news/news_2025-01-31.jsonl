It was a big December quarter for the company after its IND application for the PTX-100 Phase 2 clinical trial in r/rCTCL was successfully cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), allowing for the study's immediate initiation Significant progress was also made in the clinical development of CellPryme and re-engineering of OmniCAR, with growing collaboration interest from channel and R&D partners. The company had a cash and term deposit balance of $8.4 million at December 31, with an additional $3.7 million R&D Tax Incentive Rebate received on January 10. Prescient received clearance from the FDA for its IND application, allowing the Phase 2 clinical trial of PTX-100 to proceed. PTX-100 is a first-in-class inhibitor targeting the RAS-family pathway, with the trial focusing on relapsed and refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (r/r CTCL). The IND clearance represents a key milestone for the company, enabling the formal initiation of the study. During the reporting period, Prescient dedicated significant resources to preparing the IND application, engaging clinical and industry experts to refine the study design, trial implementation strategy, and responses to FDA inquiries. The company is now moving forward with site selection, assessing clinical locations in Australia, the United States, and Europe, with up to 15 sites expected to be activated. Additionally, Prescient remains interested in exploring PTX-100's potential in Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) and is evaluating strategies to generate further clinical data in this patient population. What is PTX-100? PTX-100 is a first-in-class compound designed to inhibit geranylgeranyl transferase-1 (GGT-1), a key enzyme involved in cancer growth. By blocking GGT-1, PTX-100 disrupts oncogenic Ras pathways, preventing the activation of Rho, Rac, and Ral signalling circuits in cancer cells, ultimately inducing apoptosis. It is believed to be the only GGT-1 inhibitor currently in clinical development. The compound has demonstrated safety and early clinical activity in a previous Phase 1 study and a recent pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) basket study across hematological and solid malignancies. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted PTX-100 Orphan Drug Designation for all T-cell lymphomas and recently approved an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a Phase 2 study focusing on cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Prescient’s CellPryme platform continues to gain momentum in both preclinical and clinical development. During Q4 2024, the company presented data on cell therapy manufacturing and adjuvant enhancements at the CAR-TCR Summit in Boston and the American Society of Hematology conference in San Diego, generating increased interest in potential collaborations. Following these engagements, Prescient has initiated multiple partnerships involving CellPryme-M, working with potential collaborators to explore ways to enhance their cell therapy programs. The company intends to provide investors with updates on the progress of these partnerships as developments allow. Additionally, Prescient is in the early stages of evaluating first-in-human clinical trials for CellPryme-A. If initiated, these trials will investigate CellPryme-A’s potential in combination with CAR-T therapies. Meanwhile, significant progress has been made in OmniCAR development following extensive troubleshooting of technical challenges and the engineering of new, optimised molecular variants. With encouraging results achieved, Prescient will continue development efforts, with further validation work planned. What is CellPryme? CellPryme-M: Prescient’s CellPryme-M is a novel, clinic-ready technology designed to enhance adoptive cell therapy by shifting T cells towards a central memory phenotype. This improves persistence and increases the ability of cells to locate and penetrate tumours. The process is a non-disruptive, 24-hour step within cell manufacturing. Cell therapies requiring enhanced manufacturing productivity or increased in vivo potency and durability are well-suited for CellPryme-M. CellPryme-A: CellPryme-A is an adjuvant therapy administered alongside cellular immunotherapy to counteract the suppressive tumour microenvironment. It significantly reduces regulatory T cells, promotes CAR-T cell expansion in vivo, and enhances tumour penetration. These improvements result in better tumour cell killing and increased host survival. When used in combination with CellPryme-M pre-treated CAR-T cells, these benefits are further amplified. New CEO James McDonnell is a seasoned biopharmaceutical executive with over 25 years of experience in the global pharmaceutical industry, with a strong focus on blood disorders and haematological malignancies, including myeloma, myelodysplasia, and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). His strategic leadership has driven outstanding commercial success, underpinned by his ability to cultivate high-performing team cultures.

During the quarter, Firebird’s subsidiary, Hunan Firebird Battery Technology Co., Ltd. (HFBT), received preliminary design approval from the Jinshi High-Tech Industrial Park Committee for its proposed battery-grade high-purity manganese sulphate plant in Jinshi, Hunan, China. In less than 12 months since its incorporation, HFBT has secured all critical permits and remains on schedule and within budget. In a key technological breakthrough, Firebird’s pilot calcining kiln demonstrated energy savings of up to 70% compared to conventional kilns, reducing energy consumption to 80-100 kWh per tonne of feed. This equates to a cost reduction of US$30 per tonne, or 5% of total production costs. Firebird entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Central South University to develop a processing method for Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate (LMFP) as a cathode active material (CAM). This further strengthens its LMFP strategy. Early-stage test work is set to begin at Firebird’s R&D centre in Jinshi, with initial results expected in Q1 2025. Firebird signed an agreement with the Karlka Nyiyaparli Aboriginal Corporation (KNAC) concerning Mining Lease 52/1086. This agreement covers key commercial considerations, including financial benefits upon production, as well as cultural heritage protection and environmental management. Oakover remains central to Firebird’s long-term strategy, providing ore for its battery-grade manganese sulphate plants. Key workstreams for the next 12 months will focus on environmental studies and securing necessary regulatory approvals. Firebird completed the farm-out of an 80% interest in its Direct Shipping Ore (DSO) Manganese Assets in Western Australia’s East Pilbara region to Macro Metals Limited (ASX: M4M). The agreement includes minimum expenditure commitments and drilling requirements, allowing Firebird to focus on its core manganese projects.

Record operating cash flow, along with A$3.1 million in additional cash inflows, partially offset the A$19.0 million in capital expenditure related to the FMDP. As a result, the company ended the period with a strong cash balance of A$11.3 million. The strong financial performance demonstrates the company’s strong operational performance. Brookside Energy project locations in the Anadarko Basin. Brookside successfully completed its Field Development Management Plan (FMDP) ahead of schedule and under budget, with the remaining capital expenditure (CAPEX) settled during the quarter. The total FMDP CAPEX amounted to approximately A$36 million net to Brookside, reflecting a ~15% saving against the initial budget. This investment was primarily funded through cash reserves and operational cash flow, demonstrating the company's financial discipline and efficiency in executing large-scale projects. With the FMDP wells now operational, Group Net Production reached a record 226,189 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), with liquids comprising 67%, for the December quarter—representing a 129% increase quarter-on-quarter. This record output enabled the company to meet its fourth-quarter production forecast, with Net Production averaging 2,459 BOE per day. The four FMDP wells delivered combined gross initial production (IP) rates of 4,330 BOE per day over 24 hours (IP24) and 3,761 BOE per day over 30 days (IP30), with liquids yields of around 80%. On a normalised basis, a single well with a 10,000-foot lateral produced around 1,400 BOE per day gross for IP24 and 1,200 BOE per day gross for IP30. These results align with those of the Flames Well, the parent well in the FMDP. Brookside increased its average working interest in FMDP wells to approximately 70%, securing a larger share of production revenue and enhancing profitability. Operated SWISH Play wells recorded gross production of 392,435 BOE during the quarter, bringing cumulative production to 2.5 million BOE as of December 31, 2024. Cumulative production for SWISH operated wells normalised to a notional 10,000-foot lateral and cumulative gross production as at December 31, 2024 for the SWISH operated wells. Production growth remained strong despite the Jewell and Flames wells undergoing expected recovery to pre-shut-in levels following temporary shut-ins during the quarter. These measures were implemented to mitigate potential interference from Continental Resources’ Gapstow full-field development (FFD) near the Jewell well and FMDP operations near the Flames well.
