CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today unveiled Time to Walk™, an inspiring new audio walking experience on Apple Watch® for Fitness+ subscribers, created to encourage users to walk more often and reap the benefits from one of the healthiest activities. Each original Time to Walk episode invites users to immerse themselves in a walk alongside influential and interesting people as they share thoughtful and meaningful stories, photos, and music. Time to Walk can be enjoyed anytime and anywhere with Apple Watch and AirPods® or other Bluetooth headphones. “Walking is the most popular physical activity in the world, and one of the healthiest things we can do for our bodies. A walk can often be more than just exercise: It can help clear the mind, solve a problem, or welcome a new perspective,” said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s senior director of Fitness Technologies. “Even throughout this challenging period of time, one activity that has remained available to many is walking. With Time to Walk, we’re bringing weekly original content to Apple Watch in Fitness+ that includes some of the most diverse, fascinating, and celebrated guests offering inspiration and entertainment to help our users keep moving through the power of walking.” Each Time to Walk episode is shaped by the guest’s personal, life-shaping moments and includes lessons learned, meaningful memories, thoughts on purpose and gratitude, moments of levity, and other thought-provoking topics, recorded while walking outside or in locations that are meaningful to them. The narrative comes to life through photos that appear on Apple Watch, perfectly timed to amplify a corresponding moment the guest shares. Following the guest’s stories, the experience extends with the guest introducing a short playlist of songs that has given them motivation and inspiration, so the listener can continue their walk to a soundtrack intimately connected to each guest. Time to Walk launches today with four episodes from the following guests: Country music star Dolly Parton has won nine GRAMMYs and is also a celebrated actor, businessperson, and humanitarian. Dolly reflects on her career, family, and growing up in rural Tennessee. “I’ve loved walking ever since I was a little girl in the Smoky Mountains,” Parton says. “I think it’s so important to be able to get out and walk if we can during this time. I do my best thinking when I walk. And while many of us feel confined during this time, I’m hopeful that people will take a walk down memory lane with me and we can all feel a little more freedom taking the time to walk together.” NBA player Draymond Green won three basketball championships with the Golden State Warriors, helping to change how the game is played. He reflects on the virtues of failure and tuning out criticism. “There’s nothing better than a walk in nature, getting lost in my thoughts, and taking a deep breath of fresh air,” Green says. “Take all the stresses of your day and let them blow away with the wind. I hope sharing my stories with those who go on a walk with me will give them the same drive to chase their dreams that I had in chasing mine.” Musician Shawn Mendes went viral on social media at 15, had his first platinum album by 19, and has toured the world. He shares how a slower pace has helped him personally and creatively. “Taking a walk is a great way to clear your mind,” Mendes says. “It’s the most simple thing you can do to calm the body and soul, reflect, and slow down. I hope people get to feel the same sense of calm I do while walking and can bring that to their own experiences.” Emmy Award winner Uzo Aduba found stardom on the series, “Orange Is the New Black,” but only after many rejections. She talks about lifelong relationships and keeping the faith. “I love walking either by myself or with my dog,” Aduba says. “It’s a time to connect and have the conversations with myself that can often get overlooked throughout the day, and bring peace of mind. The experience of walking and telling my stories gave me that familiar feeling that walking brings, answering questions that need to be answered, and addressing topics that need to be addressed. I’m so excited to share that with those who take the time to walk with me.” New episodes will appear in the Workout app on Apple Watch from a different guest each Monday through the end of April.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced Dan Riccio will transition to a new role focusing on a new project and reporting to CEO Tim Cook, building on more than two decades of innovation, service, and leadership at Apple. John Ternus will now lead Apple’s Hardware Engineering organization as a member of the executive team. “Every innovation Dan has helped Apple bring to life has made us a better and more innovative company, and we’re thrilled that he’ll continue to be part of the team,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “John’s deep expertise and wide breadth of experience make him a bold and visionary leader of our Hardware Engineering teams. I want to congratulate them both on these exciting new steps, and I’m looking forward to many more innovations they’ll help bring to the world.” Riccio has been a leader in designing, developing, and engineering almost all of Apple’s products. From the first generation iMac to the more recent 5G iPhone® lineup, M1-based Macs®, and AirPods Max™, Riccio built the Hardware Engineering teams and scaled Apple’s ability to innovate across multiple new product lines with the highest quality. After joining Apple in 1998 as a leader on the Product Design team, Riccio became vice president of iPad® Hardware Engineering in 2010, and in 2012 he joined the executive team as the leader of Hardware Engineering. Riccio will continue to play an instrumental role in shaping the future of Apple’s products in his new position as a vice president of engineering. “Working at Apple has been the opportunity of a lifetime, spent making the world’s best products with the most talented people you could imagine,” said Riccio. “After 23 years of leading our Product Design or Hardware Engineering teams — culminating with our biggest and most ambitious product year ever — it’s the right time for a change. Next up, I’m looking forward to doing what I love most — focusing all my time and energy at Apple on creating something new and wonderful that I couldn’t be more excited about.” Ternus takes on the role of senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. Ternus joined Apple’s Product Design team in 2001 and has been a vice president of Hardware Engineering since 2013. Throughout his nearly 20 years at Apple, Ternus has overseen hardware engineering work on a variety of groundbreaking products, including the first generation AirPods®, and every generation of iPad. Most recently, Ternus led the hardware team responsible for the incredible iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, and he has been a key leader in the ongoing transition of the Mac to Apple silicon. Ternus graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple’s five software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2021 first quarter ended December 26, 2020. The Company posted all-time record revenue of $111.4 billion, up 21 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.68, up 35 percent. International sales accounted for 64 percent of the quarter’s revenue. “This quarter for Apple wouldn’t have been possible without the tireless and innovative work of every Apple team member worldwide,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re gratified by the enthusiastic customer response to the unmatched line of cutting-edge products that we delivered across a historic holiday season. We are also focused on how we can help the communities we’re a part of build back strongly and equitably, through efforts like our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative as well as our multi-year commitment to invest $350 billion throughout the United States.” “Our December quarter business performance was fueled by double-digit growth in each product category, which drove all-time revenue records in each of our geographic segments and an all-time high for our installed base of active devices,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “These results helped us generate record operating cash flow of $38.8 billion. We also returned over $30 billion to shareholders during the quarter as we maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.” Apple’s Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on February 11, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 8, 2021. Apple will provide live streaming of its Q1 2021 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT on January 27, 2021 at apple.com/investor/earnings-call/.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2021 first quarter ended December 26, 2020. The Company posted all-time record revenue of $111.4 billion, up 21 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.68, up 35 percent. International sales accounted for 64 percent of the quarter’s revenue. “This quarter for Apple wouldn’t have been possible without the tireless and innovative work of every Apple team member worldwide,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re gratified by the enthusiastic customer response to the unmatched line of cutting-edge products that we delivered across a historic holiday season. We are also focused on how we can help the communities we’re a part of build back strongly and equitably, through efforts like our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative as well as our multi-year commitment to invest $350 billion throughout the United States.” “Our December quarter business performance was fueled by double-digit growth in each product category, which drove all-time revenue records in each of our geographic segments and an all-time high for our installed base of active devices,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “These results helped us generate record operating cash flow of $38.8 billion. We also returned over $30 billion to shareholders during the quarter as we maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.” Apple’s Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on February 11, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 8, 2021.

When Apple announced its first-quarter earnings last week, it was easy to get distracted by all of the big numbers. The company had record top- and bottom-line numbers, reporting $111.4 billion in revenue and $28.76 billion in profit. It certainly appears it's managed to thrive during the pandemic. That's partially due to the surge in sales of the iPhone 12, which brought an updated design and added 5G wireless, something Apple had been later to adopt than most of its competitors. The Mac also did well alongside the overall resurgence of the laptop computer market, which this year saw its first increase in sales in a decade."

Creating a brand in the auto industry isn't complicated. First, you build a car. Then, you sell the car. Then you build and sell some more cars. If you're lucky, the car is the Model T and a hundred years later, you're the Ford Motor Company. There really isn't that much to think about here. Tesla, the first successful new American automaker to come along since Walter Chrysler had a twinkle in his eye in 1925, is a shining example of how you do it. The risks are obviously immense. But the rewards are, too. Tesla is now the most valuable automaker in the world, worth more than the globe's top nine car companies, combined."

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced an acceleration of its US investments, with plans to make new contributions of more than $430 billion and add 20,000 new jobs across the country over the next five years. Over the past three years, Apple’s contributions in the US have significantly outpaced the company’s original five-year goal of $350 billion set in 2018. Apple is now raising its level of commitment by 20 percent over the next five years, supporting American innovation and driving economic benefits in every state. This includes tens of billions of dollars for next-generation silicon development and 5G innovation across nine US states. “At this moment of recovery and rebuilding, Apple is doubling down on our commitment to US innovation and manufacturing with a generational investment reaching communities across all 50 states,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re creating jobs in cutting-edge fields — from 5G to silicon engineering to artificial intelligence — investing in the next generation of innovative new businesses, and in all our work, building toward a greener and more equitable future.” Today, Apple supports more than 2.7 million jobs across the country through direct employment, spending with US suppliers and manufacturers, and developer jobs in the thriving iOS app economy. Apple is the largest taxpayer in the US and has paid almost $45 billion in domestic corporate income taxes over the past five years alone. Apple’s $430 billion in contributions to the US economy include direct spend with American suppliers, data center investments, capital expenditures in the US, and other domestic spend — including dozens of Apple TV+℠ productions across 20 states, creating thousands of jobs and supporting the creative industry. Establishing a New North Carolina Campus As part of its investments and expansion, Apple plans to invest over $1 billion in North Carolina and will begin construction on a new campus and engineering hub in the Research Triangle area. The investment will create at least 3,000 new jobs in machine learning, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and other cutting-edge fields. Apple will also establish a $100 million fund to support schools and community initiatives in the greater Raleigh-Durham area and across the state, and will be contributing over $110 million in infrastructure spending to the 80 North Carolina counties with the greatest need — funds that will go toward broadband, roads and bridges, and public schools. When up and running, Apple’s investments are expected to generate over $1.5 billion in economic benefits annually for North Carolina. Expanding Apple’s US Operations Apple is on track to meet its 2018 goal of creating 20,000 new jobs in the US by 2023. With today’s new commitment, Apple is setting a target of creating 20,000 additional jobs in states across the country over the next five years. California: Apple continues to expand its teams across the state and now expects to grow its San Diego team to more than 5,000 employees by 2026 — a 500 percent increase from its 2018 goal. The company will also grow its teams in Culver City to more than 3,000 employees by 2026, expanding its state-of-the-art campus with additional space for these employees and more. Colorado: Apple is growing its engineering team in Boulder, and expects to have close to 700 employees at its offices in the region by 2026. Massachusetts: In 2018, Apple announced it would add hundreds of new jobs in the Boston metro area. With around 200 team members already working in the region, Apple plans to add several hundred new jobs by 2026. Texas: Construction for Apple’s $1 billion Austin campus is underway, with employees expected to start moving into the new space next year. Washington: Apple’s LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) Platinum office space in Seattle’s South Lake Union neighborhood recently opened for the company’s 1,000 local employees, with plans to add at least another 1,000 team members. Iowa: The design process is underway for Apple’s new data center, which is expected to create over 500 construction and operations jobs in Waukee. Apple is supporting community infrastructure programs, including the creation of Triumph Park, a 66-acre recreation area. Apple has also surpassed its 2018 hiring commitments in Miami, New York, Pittsburgh, and Portland, Oregon. As Apple grows its teams and operations in the US, the company is committed to doing so in an environmentally responsible manner with a focus on renewable energy and green innovation. To date, nearly 60 of Apple’s US sites are LEED certified. Apple is carbon neutral for all of its operations in the US and around the world, and last year committed to be 100 percent carbon neutral for its entire supply chain and products by 2030. Creating American Jobs with Manufacturers and Suppliers Nationwide Apple’s $430 billion US investments include working with more than 9,000 suppliers and companies large and small in all 50 states, supporting American job creation across dozens of sectors, including silicon engineering, 5G, and manufacturing. To foster innovation and growth in the sector, Apple launched its $5 billion Advanced Manufacturing Fund in 2017. Awards from the fund have led to breakthrough innovations in laser technology, sustainable material development, 5G infrastructure, and other cutting-edge fields. Indiana: A new $100 million Advanced Manufacturing Fund investment to open a state-of-the-art facility and distribution center in Clayton, which will be operated by XPO Logistics, will accelerate delivery timelines and personalization. The award is expected to create around 500 jobs at the facility. Kentucky: Corning was the first recipient of an award from Apple’s Advanced Manufacturing Fund, and has received $450 million to support research and development into state-of-the-art glass processes, equipment, and materials. These awards led to the creation of Ceramic Shield™, a new material that is tougher than any smartphone glass. Apple’s investment has helped support more than 1,000 jobs across Corning’s US operations in Kentucky and other facilities. Texas: Apple began working with II-VI in Sherman, Texas, in 2017 as part of the company’s Advanced Manufacturing Fund. The laser technology that II-VI manufactures in Texas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Illinois are integral components that help power Face ID®, along with Memoji™, Animoji®, and more. California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, and Washington: Apple is spending tens of billions of dollars across these nine states in silicon engineering and 5G technology — two pivotal fields shaping the future of next-generation consumer electronics. With the launch of the 5G-enabled iPhone® 12 lineup and the new iPad Pro®, Apple has helped expand and expedite 5G adoption across the country, driving innovation and significant job growth among companies that support 5G innovation and infrastructure. The company also recently expanded its New Silicon Initiative — designed to prepare students for careers in hardware engineering and silicon chip design — to engineering programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities across the country. Apple is also making industry-leading investments in new clean energy projects and green technology in the US and around the world. Just last month, Apple announced a massive new US energy storage project in California’s Monterey County — joining other energy storage projects the company has invested in, including its microgrid at Apple Park. Apple continues to be a clean energy leader through its $4.7 billion Green Bond spend, with recent investments in solar and wind projects in Nevada, Illinois, and Virginia — bringing clean energy and high-paying jobs to local communities across the country. Apple also continues to support jobs in the innovative iOS app economy, which facilitated $138 billion of commerce in 2019 in the US alone. More than 85 percent of those proceeds go straight to third-party developers. Today, the App Store® supports more than 2.1 million US jobs across all 50 states.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2021 second quarter ended March 27, 2021. The Company posted a March quarter record revenue of $89.6 billion, up 54 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.40. International sales accounted for 67 percent of the quarter’s revenue. “This quarter reflects both the enduring ways our products have helped our users meet this moment in their own lives, as well as the optimism consumers seem to feel about better days ahead for all of us,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Apple is in a period of sweeping innovation across our product lineup, and we’re keeping focus on how we can help our teams and the communities where we work emerge from this pandemic into a better world. That certainly begins with products like the all-new iMac and iPad Pro, but it extends to efforts like the 8 gigawatts of new clean energy we’ll help bring onto the grid and our $430 billion investment in the United States over the next 5 years.” “We are proud of our March quarter performance, which included revenue records in each of our geographic segments and strong double-digit growth in each of our product categories, driving our installed base of active devices to an all-time high,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “These results allowed us to generate operating cash flow of $24 billion and return nearly $23 billion to shareholders during the quarter. We are confident in our future and continue to make significant investments to support our long-term plans and enrich our customers’ lives.” Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of the Company’s common stock, an increase of 7 percent. The dividend is payable on May 13, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 10, 2021. The board of directors has also authorized an increase of $90 billion to the existing share repurchase program.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced a new $410 million award from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund for II-VI, a leading manufacturer of optical technology. Today's award builds on an initial $390 million awarded from Apple’s Advanced Manufacturing Fund in 2017. The expansion of the company’s long-standing relationship will create additional capacity and accelerate delivery of future components for iPhone®, with 700 jobs in Sherman, Texas; Warren, New Jersey; Easton, Pennsylvania; and Champaign, Illinois. II-VI manufactures vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) that help power Face ID®, Memoji™, Animoji®, and Portrait mode selfies. Apple also works with II-VI to manufacture lasers used in the LiDAR Scanner — technology that helps deliver faster, more realistic augmented reality experiences and improves autofocus in low-light scenes in photos and videos. Apple began working with II-VI in Sherman, Texas, in 2017 as part of the company’s Advanced Manufacturing Fund, which helped transform a long-shuttered, 700,000-square-foot building into a high-tech manufacturing facility and created hundreds of local jobs. Through close collaboration with Apple engineering and operations teams, the company has rapidly increased production in the past year to enable record shipments from the Sherman facility. “We established Apple’s Advanced Manufacturing Fund to support American businesses creating next-generation technology and the jobs of tomorrow,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “II-VI shares our commitment to push the boundaries of innovation and we’re proud to be extending our work together across the country.” “The partnership between Apple and II-VI sets the stage for a new wave of breakthrough technologies that we believe will enable a wide range of applications that will benefit our world for decades to come,” said Dr. Vincent Mattera Jr., II-VI’s CEO. “We are incredibly grateful for Apple’s support which has allowed us to expand our manufacturing capacity and scale our operations across the US.” II-VI is a part of Apple’s Clean Energy Program, which was designed to advance the use of renewable energy across the company’s supply chain, and is already using 100 percent renewable energy across all of its Apple manufacturing in the US. Apple’s expanded partnership with II-VI is part of the company’s plans to invest $430 billion and add 20,000 new jobs across the US over the next five years. Apple’s contributions include working with more than 9,000 suppliers across the country who are supporting American job creation across dozens of sectors, including silicon engineering, 5G, and manufacturing. To support world-class innovation and high-skilled manufacturing jobs across the US, Apple established its Advanced Manufacturing Fund in 2017. The $5 billion fund has supported a number of projects to date, including $450 million in awards to Corning Incorporated in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, which led to the creation of Ceramic Shield™, a new material that’s tougher than any other smartphone glass. Apple supports 2.7 million jobs across all 50 states through direct employment, spending with US suppliers and manufacturers, and the iOS app economy.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced GarageBand® for iOS and iPadOS®, the most popular music creation app in the world, now helps people unlock even more of their musical creativity with all-new Sound Packs from some of today’s top artists and producers. For the first time, users can learn the art of remixing right within the app with two all-new Remix Sessions offering step-by-step video instruction and featuring hit songs from Grammy Award-winning artists Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga. Musicians can also now create songs with seven new Producer Packs full of beats, loops, and instruments created just for GarageBand by some of the world’s top producers, including Boys Noize, Mark Lettieri, Oak Felder, Soulection, Take A Daytrip, Tom Misch, and TRAKGIRL. An additional Producer Pack provides a special companion experience to the new Apple Original docuseries “Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,” premiering Friday, July 30, on Apple TV+℠, enabling viewers to experiment with sounds inspired by the music featured in the show. “GarageBand continues to be a catalyst for music creation — making it easy for novices to get started and for seasoned pros to develop their ideas on the go,” said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. “For this update, we’ve collaborated with an incredible group of artists and producers to give musicians an amazing collection of new sounds to play with, and we hope even more people will be inspired to tap into their creativity and start making music in GarageBand.” Art of the Remix with Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga Anyone can now develop their remix skills in GarageBand with two new in-app Remix Sessions featuring Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga. Each session includes inspirational videos from each artist telling the stories behind their hit songs “Break My Heart” (Dua Lipa) and “Free Woman” (Lady Gaga), as well as step-by-step remix instructions led by an Apple Retail Creative Pro using a GarageBand Live Loops version of each song. During these sessions, anyone can interact with these hits just as an artist would in the studio, hearing isolated vocals, beats, and individual instruments that provide the foundational elements of a song. With touch instruments and thousands of Apple Loops available in GarageBand, users can let their creativity run wild, taking their remix in any direction from Hip Hop to EDM, or any combination of sounds they dream up. Fun and easy for any level, these Remix Sessions expand on Apple’s popular Today at Apple® educational sessions that take place in Apple Store® locations around the world. Previous Today at Apple in-store Music Labs have featured top artists including Alicia Keys, Billie Eilish, Khalid, Madonna, Pu Shu, and Taylor Swift. Dua Lipa, artist: “It’s amazing to see Apple bringing my music to life in GarageBand, so now anyone can experience how I made ‘Break My Heart’ no matter where they are. Music has the power to bring people together, and this is doing that in such an exciting way. I personally can’t wait for people to have a lot of fun experimenting and coming up with different versions of my song.” Lady Gaga, artist: “GarageBand is my idea bank and where I start my songwriting, so I’m excited to make my song ‘Free Woman’ available as a Remix Session. I want musicians and music lovers to be able to see how a song is produced and be able to hear all the individual parts, and then put their own creative color on it, doing whatever they want in GarageBand.” Creative Inspiration from Today’s Biggest Hitmakers Musicians can now create their own songs with help from some of today’s biggest music producers, using seven new downloadable Producer Packs created for GarageBand by Boys Noize, Mark Lettieri, Oak Felder, Soulection, Take A Daytrip, Tom Misch, and TRAKGIRL. Each Producer Pack is bursting with hundreds of royalty-free loops, beats, instruments, drum kits, synth patches, and samples that embody the sound and vibe of each producer. And in-app videos feature each producer offering words of encouragement to beginners, as well as insights into their creative process. Oak Felder, producer (Ariana Grande, Demi Lovato, John Legend): “Whenever someone asks me how to start producing and making beats, I tell them to grab their iPhone and open up GarageBand. It removes all the technical obstacles and makes it easy to turn a simple musical idea into something great. I still use GarageBand to sketch out ideas, so it’s especially cool to be able to deliver my own selection of royalty-free sounds to help someone else write their own hit song.” David Biral and Denzel Baptiste, Take A Daytrip, producers (Lil Nas X, Kid Cudi, Travis Scott): “We both got our start using GarageBand, met to form Take A Daytrip, and added Logic Pro to our production tools. Our new Producer Pack is a personal collection of signature sounds created from our favorite synths and gear so that we could always have access to them whenever we’re away from our studio. Our goal is always to make technology more accessible for the next generation of producers and artists. Making our own sounds for GarageBand is a perfect way to pay forward the inspiration we got from previous generations of creators.” TRAKGIRL, producer (Andra Day, Jhené Aiko, Vic Mensa): “It’s been an important mission of mine to help young women break into music making, and GarageBand is a powerful creative tool that everyone has access to. I hope my Producer Pack will inspire people globally to embrace their creativity and show that anyone can follow their dreams and get involved in music production.” Companion Experience for “Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson” In the new Apple Original docuseries “Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,” Oscar- and Grammy Award-winning producer-artist Mark Ronson explores the intersection of technology and musical innovation. With the exclusive “Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson” Producer Pack in GarageBand, users can extend the viewing experience by getting hands-on time with GarageBand versions of the music technology featured in every episode, from sampling to drum machines, synths to reverb, and vocal effects to distortion. Mark Ronson, artist and producer (Adele, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga): “Our new series, ‘Watch the Sound With Mark Ronson,’ explores and celebrates the intersection of music and technology, and it is exciting to have GarageBand bring the beats and sounds from the show to anyone who is inspired to create their own songs. This Producer Pack delivers the creativity and excitement of the show in a way I never imagined and couldn’t be more excited about.” Availability All-new Remix Sessions and Producer Packs are available today as a free download from the Sound Library in GarageBand 2.3.11, the latest version of the app, for iOS and iPadOS.

ISTANBUL--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced Apple Bağdat Caddesi will open on Friday, October 22. Located in the heart of Istanbul, Apple Bağdat Caddesi will serve as Apple’s third retail location in Turkey. This two-level destination blends local materials with the latest store design to create an open and fluid space for customers to explore Apple’s products and services, or participate in free Today at Apple® sessions. “With the opening of Apple Bağdat Caddesi, we’re thrilled to build upon the deep and long-standing relationships we have with our customers in Turkey,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail + People. “We can’t wait to welcome the local community to our newest store in Istanbul and bring them the best of Apple.” To celebrate the opening, Apple will debut Perspektif Istanbul, a six-week Today at Apple program that pays homage to the city and its creatives. Hosted by 20 local artists, the series brings creativity, culture, and technology together into an experience that examines topics and values important to the local community in Istanbul. Attendees will get a chance to join in-person and virtual sessions that include learning about traditional miniature drawing with illustrator Murat Palta, photographing the unseen with Magnum Photos photographer Sabiha Çimen, or creating a moving portrait with visual artist Sinan Tuncay. The store will also host an exclusive augmented reality (AR) exhibition developed by creative technologists Tin Nguyen and Ed Cutting, and Turkish sound artist Oğuz Öner. The experience transforms the store with an immersive digital installation and includes many other artists participating in Perspektif Istanbul. Using the latest iPad Pro® and iPhone 13 Pro® with LiDAR, visitors will be able to see ceramic vessels inspired by Ebru — the traditional art of paper marbling — in AR on their screens, and hear unique spatial sound elements. Apple Bağdat Caddesi brings forward familiar design elements from Apple Store® locations around the world and Apple Park in Cupertino, California, while integrating locally sourced Aksaray Yaylak granite and Turkish travertine. Housed under a floating carbon fiber roof, the retail location creates an urban oasis in the heart of the city, complete with a large, tree-filled garden. Once inside, visitors will find the video wall and Forum, home to Today at Apple sessions. The upper level is flanked by avenues, where customers can explore Apple’s latest products and services. The entire space overlooks the exterior of the store through a 32-foot glass curtain, blurring the boundaries between inside and outside. The interior is bathed in natural light through two large skylights that open to allow ventilation. For 30 years, Apple has been a part of the Turkish community, and Apple Bağdat Caddesi’s team members look forward to deepening Apple’s relationship with local customers throughout Turkey. The diverse, 130-person team collectively speaks 14 languages and will welcome its first visitors on Friday, October 22, at 10 a.m. local time. Because the health and well-being of customers and team members is Apple’s top priority, the store will implement comprehensive health measures. Additionally, visits to Apple Bağdat Caddesi on opening day will be by appointment only. Customers can choose from available times at apple.com/tr/retail/bagdatcaddesi. Capacity will be limited, so guests may experience wait times before entering the store. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple’s five software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced it has more than doubled the number of suppliers committed to using 100 percent clean energy over the last year, accelerating progress toward its ambitious 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across its supply chain and products. In total, 175 Apple suppliers will transition to using renewable energy, and the company and its suppliers will bring online more than 9 gigawatts of clean power around the world. These actions will avoid over 18 million metric tons of CO2e annually — the equivalent of taking over 4 million cars off the road each year. The company added 10 new projects for its first-of-a-kind Power for Impact™ initiative to bring clean energy solutions to communities around the world. These projects are designed to provide renewable power to under-resourced communities while supporting economic growth and social impact. “Every company should be a part of the fight against climate change, and together with our suppliers and local communities, we’re demonstrating all of the opportunity and equity green innovation can bring,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re acting with urgency, and we’re acting together. But time is not a renewable resource, and we must act quickly to invest in a greener and more equitable future.” While Apple is already carbon neutral across its global operations, by 2030, every Apple device sold will have a net-zero climate impact. Since announcing this goal last year, the company has not only dramatically increased the number of its suppliers transitioning to renewable energy, but also expanded the amount of recycled material in its products and established new projects focused on environmental justice. In total, Apple has reduced its carbon emissions by 40 percent over the past five years. “For too long, the communities most impacted by climate change haven’t had a seat at the table. That has to change, and we’re committed to being part of that change,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “The new projects we’re sharing will help communities by developing new local renewable projects, creating a healthier and more equitable world while advancing the fight against climate change.” Supplier Momentum In the US, 19 suppliers in Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program, including Solvay, are scaling their use of renewable energy across their Apple operations, often going beyond their business with Apple. In Europe, 19 suppliers are now part of the program, including STMicroelectronics, which has started nine additional projects to deliver renewable energy for its broader operations since joining Apple’s program. In China, 50 suppliers are now part of the program, with many maximizing their use of on-site solutions. In India, Japan, and South Korea, 31 suppliers have joined, including SK Hynix, one of the first Korean suppliers to participate. Apple is also creating new pathways for the use of recycled materials while maintaining its high standards for sourcing, collaborating with suppliers to move toward a circular economy that eliminates the need for carbon-intensive mining and conserves resources. This includes recycled sources of gold, cobalt, aluminum, and rare earth elements, among other materials that are now part of Apple products. These advancements, along with suppliers transitioning to renewable energy, are reducing the environmental impact of the company’s products. Recent milestones include an 11 percent reduction in the carbon footprint of iPhone® 13 Pro and an eight percent reduction for the 16-inch MacBook Pro®, compared to previous generations. Supporting Communities Apple is also announcing support for 10 new renewable projects around the world through its Power for Impact program: In the United States, Apple will work with the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority, formed by six Sioux tribes to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources by financing, developing, constructing, and operating power generation and transmission facilities for the wholesale market. This project is on track to create a large-scale wind power development in the Midwest, and follows the organization’s participation in Apple’s Impact Accelerator, part of the company’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative. In South Africa, Apple is bringing renewable energy to over 3,500 households that previously lacked access. The company will also help reduce electricity costs for the Pioneer School for the Visually Impaired by funding rooftop solar installations. And in Nigeria, Apple will support the development of a solar power system to serve a primary healthcare center in the state of Ondo, as well as 200 households in the surrounding region. In the Philippines, Apple will help fund an educational institution that provides scholarships to high-achieving, under-resourced students by offsetting electricity expenses through a new rooftop solar installation. In Thailand, Apple is participating in an effort to increase renewable energy production and battery storage to ensure reliable access to electricity, and replacing the use of polluting diesel fuel for a remote fishing village that relies on refrigerators to maintain the quality of its fish products. Apple’s work to support a program in Vietnam will provide solar electricity for 20 schools around the country, and help teach thousands of children about sustainable development and STEM. In Colombia, Apple is helping to bring online a rooftop solar power system at the Santa Ana Hospital Infantil, and the money saved on energy bills will allow the hospital to purchase more equipment and medications. A rooftop solar installation at Ciudad Don Bosco, a nonprofit that provides educational and social services for under-resourced youth, will help the group advance its sustainable development goals. In Israel, Apple is supporting the Nitzana Educational Eco-Village for at-risk youth with solar installations to help lower electricity costs and generate a new source of revenue for the organization. Apple will continue to focus on communities most impacted by climate change as it pursues its environmental goals.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2021 fourth quarter ended September 25, 2021. The Company posted a September quarter revenue record of $83.4 billion, up 29 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.24. “This year we launched our most powerful products ever, from M1-powered Macs to an iPhone 13 lineup that is setting a new standard for performance and empowering our customers to create and connect in new ways,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We are infusing our values into everything we make — moving closer to our 2030 goal of being carbon neutral up and down our supply chain and across the lifecycle of our products, and ever advancing our mission to build a more equitable future.” “Our record September quarter results capped off a remarkable fiscal year of strong double-digit growth, during which we set new revenue records in all of our geographic segments and product categories in spite of continued uncertainty in the macro environment,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “The combination of our record sales performance, unmatched customer loyalty, and strength of our ecosystem drove our active installed base of devices to a new all-time high. During the September quarter, we returned over $24 billion to our shareholders, as we continue to make progress toward our goal of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.” Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on November 11, 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 8, 2021.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced Alex Gorsky, chairman and CEO of Johnson & Johnson, has been elected to Apple’s board of directors. Gorsky will bring decades of experience in corporate leadership and health technologies, and a long track record of leading innovative and diverse teams around the world. During Gorsky’s tenure as CEO and chairman, Johnson & Johnson has become the world’s largest healthcare company and one of the foremost innovators in research and development for emerging health technologies. “Alex has long been a visionary in healthcare, applying his tremendous insight, experience, and passion for technology to the cause of improving lives and building healthier communities,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re excited to welcome him to Apple’s board of directors, and I know that all of us will benefit from his leadership and expertise.” “As a thoughtful and passionate leader, Alex has helped bring cutting-edge technologies to some of healthcare’s most urgent and complex challenges,” said Arthur Levinson, Apple’s chairman. “His voice and vision will help Apple continue to make a positive impact on people’s lives through the power of technology.” “I’ve long shared Apple’s belief that technology has the potential to improve lives and create healthier communities,” said Alex Gorsky. “It’s an honor to join Apple’s board of directors, and to be part of a values-led company that’s constantly innovating to both enable and enhance the way we live.” Gorsky began his tenure at Johnson & Johnson in 1988, accumulating a broad range of experience in sales, management, and marketing before becoming CEO in 2012. Gorsky has made innovation and technology key priorities, with groundbreaking investments that have helped shape the future of the pharmaceutical, medical device, and consumer health sectors. An experienced leader in healthcare and business, Gorsky directs a global team of more than 130,000 at Johnson & Johnson. He is also a member of the Business Roundtable’s board of directors and the chairman of its Corporate Governance committee. Gorsky serves on the boards of IBM, Travis Manion Foundation, and The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. As a former captain in the US Army, Gorsky has been a vocal advocate for improving mental health services for veterans and their families. He has also been a trailblazer for diversity and inclusion — helping Johnson & Johnson become a nationally recognized leader, and expanding parental paid leave and mentorship programs for employees across the company. Gorsky holds a Bachelor of Science from the US Military Academy at West Point, New York, and spent six years in the US Army, finishing his military career with the rank of captain. Gorsky also earned a Master of Business Administration from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1996.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced Apple Business Essentials, an all-new service that brings together device management, 24/7 Apple Support, and iCloud® storage into flexible subscription plans for small businesses with up to 500 employees. The company also unveiled a new Apple Business Essentials app that enables employees to install apps for work and request support. Apple Business Essentials saves precious time for small businesses as they grow. Available today in beta, the service supports small businesses through the total device management life cycle — from device setup to employee onboarding and device upgrades — while providing strong security, prioritized support, and secure data storage and backup. “Small businesses are at the core of our economy, and we’re proud that Apple products play a role in helping these companies grow,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Enterprise and Education Marketing. “Apple Business Essentials is designed to help streamline every step of employee device management within a small business — from setup, onboarding, and upgrading, to accessing fast service and prioritized support, all while keeping data backed up and secure, so companies can focus on running their business.” Simple Setup and Onboarding with Collections Apple Business Essentials is a complete solution that makes employee onboarding simple, allowing a small business to easily configure, deploy, and manage Apple products from anywhere. Within Apple Business Essentials, Collections enable IT personnel to configure settings and apps for individual users, groups, or devices. When employees sign in to their corporate or personally owned device with their work credentials, Collections automatically push settings such as VPN configurations and Wi-Fi passwords. In addition, Collections will install the new Apple Business Essentials app on each employee’s home screen, where they can download corporate apps assigned to them, such as Cisco Webex or Microsoft Word. Strong Security with FileVault, Activation Lock, and User Enrollment With Apple Business Essentials, it’s simple to maintain strong security across the organization. IT managers can enforce critical security settings such as FileVault® for full-disk encryption on Mac®, and Activation Lock to protect devices that may be lost or stolen — and Apple Business Essentials ensures these aren’t turned off by mistake. When employees use a personal device at work, User Enrollment creates cryptographic separation for work data, to ensure employee data remains private while company data remains secure. Secure Storage and Backup with iCloud In addition to streamlined setup and onboarding, Apple Business Essentials provides a dedicated iCloud account for work, providing simple and secure storage, backup, and collaboration on files and documents. Business data in iCloud is automatically stored and backed up, making it easy to move between devices or upgrade to a new device. Comprehensive Support and Repairs with AppleCare+ for Business Essentials Businesses have the option to add fast and reliable service for employee devices with prioritized Apple Support. When a business adds AppleCare+℠ for Business Essentials to its plan, they get 24/7 access to phone support, training for both IT administrators and employees, and up to two device repairs per plan each year. Employees can initiate repairs directly from the new Apple Business Essentials app, and an Apple-trained technician can come onsite in as little as four hours to get their devices back up and running. Flexible Subscription A set of three simple Apple Business Essentials plans enable businesses to cover every employee and device in their organization. Plans can be customized to support each user with up to three devices and up to 2TB of secure storage in iCloud, starting at $2.99 per month, with optional AppleCare+ for Apple Business Essentials.1 Availability Apple Business Essentials is available as a free beta starting today in the US. The service will be fully available in the spring of 2022. To sign up for the beta, visit apple.com/business/essentials. 1 AppleCare+ for Business Essentials is not available during the free beta period; pricing to be announced.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced plans to introduce Tap to Pay on iPhone®. The new capability will empower millions of merchants across the US, from small businesses to large retailers, to use their iPhone to seamlessly and securely accept Apple Pay®, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets through a simple tap to their iPhone — no additional hardware or payment terminals needed. Tap to Pay on iPhone will be available for payment platforms and app developers to integrate into their iOS apps and offer as a payment option to their business customers. Stripe will be the first payment platform to offer Tap to Pay on iPhone to their business customers, including the Shopify Point of Sale app this spring. Additional payment platforms and apps will follow later this year. “As more consumers are tapping to pay with digital wallets and credit cards, Tap to Pay on iPhone will provide businesses with a secure, private, and easy way to accept contactless payments and unlock new checkout experiences using the power, security and convenience of iPhone,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. “In collaboration with payment platforms, app developers, and payment networks, we’re making it easier than ever for businesses of all sizes — from solopreneurs to large retailers— to seamlessly accept contactless payments and continue to grow their business.” Once Tap to Pay on iPhone becomes available, merchants will be able to unlock contactless payment acceptance through a supporting iOS app on an iPhone XS or later device. At checkout, the merchant will simply prompt the customer to hold their iPhone or Apple Watch® to pay with Apple Pay, their contactless credit or debit card, or other digital wallet near the merchant’s iPhone, and the payment will be securely completed using NFC technology. No additional hardware is needed to accept contactless payments through Tap to Pay on iPhone, so businesses can accept payments from wherever they do business. Apple Pay is already accepted at more than 90 percent of US retailers, and with this new capability, virtually every business, big or small, will be able to allow their customers to Tap to Pay on iPhone at checkout. Tap to Pay on iPhone will also roll out to Apple Store® locations in the US later this year. Privacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of Apple’s payment features. With Tap to Pay on iPhone, customers’ payment data is protected by the same technology that makes Apple Pay private and secure. All transactions made using Tap to Pay on iPhone are encrypted and processed using the Secure Element, and as with Apple Pay, Apple doesn’t know what is being purchased or who is buying it. Apple will work closely with leading payment platforms and app developers across the payments and commerce industry to offer Tap to Pay on iPhone to millions of merchants in the US. Tap to Pay on iPhone complements and enhances the robust suite of payment and commerce tools that payment platforms and app developers provide to their merchant customers to help them run and grow their businesses. Tap to Pay on iPhone will work with credit and debit cards from leading payment networks, including American Express, Discover, Mastercard, and Visa. “Whether you’re a salesperson at an internet-first retailer or an individual entrepreneur, you can soon accept contactless payments on a device that’s already in your pocket: your iPhone,” said Billy Alvarado, Stripe’s chief business officer. “With Tap to Pay on iPhone, millions of businesses using Stripe can enhance their in-person commerce experience by offering their customers a fast and secure checkout.” Tap to Pay on iPhone will be available to participating payment platforms and their app developer partners to leverage in their software developer kits (SDKs) in an upcoming iOS software beta.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced Self Service Repair is now available, providing repair manuals and genuine Apple parts and tools through the Apple Self Service Repair Store. Self Service Repair is available in the US and will expand to additional countries — beginning in Europe — later this year. The new online store offers more than 200 individual parts and tools, enabling customers who are experienced with the complexities of repairing electronic devices to complete repairs on the iPhone® 12 and iPhone 13 lineups and iPhone SE (3rd generation), such as the display, battery, and camera. Later this year the program will also include manuals, parts, and tools to perform repairs on Mac® computers with Apple silicon. To start the Self Service Repair process, a customer will first review the repair manual for the product they want to repair by visiting support.apple.com/self-service-repair. Then, they can visit the Apple Self Service Repair Store and order the necessary parts and tools. Every genuine Apple part is designed and engineered for each product, and goes through extensive testing to ensure the highest quality, safety, and reliability. The parts are the same ones — at the same price — as those available to Apple’s network of authorized repair providers. For certain repairs, customers will receive a credit when returning a replaced part for recycling. The Apple tools available to customers on the Self Service Repair Store are the same as used by Apple’s repair network. They are custom designed to help provide the best repairs for Apple products, and are engineered to withstand the rigors of high-volume, professional repair operations where safety and reliability are the utmost priority. The high-quality tools offered through Self Service Repair include torque drivers, repair trays, display and battery presses, and more. Apple will offer tool rental kits for $49, so that customers who do not want to purchase tools for a single repair still have access to these professional repair tools. The weeklong rental kits will ship to customers for free. Self Service Repair is part of Apple’s efforts to further expand access to repairs. For the vast majority of customers who do not have experience repairing electronic devices, visiting a professional repair provider with certified technicians who use genuine Apple parts is the safest and most reliable way to get a repair. Over the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training, including more than 3,000 Independent Repair Providers. A global network of more than 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers supports more than 100,000 active technicians. As a result, in the US, eight out of 10 Apple customers are located within 20 minutes of an authorized service provider. Also today, Apple published a paper, “Expanding Access to Safe, Reliable, and Secure Service and Repair,” which details Apple’s approach to designing long-lasting products and increasing access to repairs. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Apple’s five software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud. Apple’s more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it.

Continued strong customer demand for our products helped us achieve an all-time high for our installed base of active devices,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “Our strong operating performance generated over $28 billion in operating cash flow, and allowed us to return nearly $27 billion to our shareholders during the quarter.” Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of the Company’s common stock, an increase of 5 percent. The dividend is payable on May 12, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 9, 2022.

LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today previewed Apple Brompton Road, its newest store in London, located in the city’s bustling Knightsbridge neighborhood. A stone’s throw from Hyde Park, Apple Brompton Road features design inspiration drawn from local flora, along with a new slate of community events and seminars to help customers learn, create, and get the most out of their Apple products. “We are thrilled to open Apple Brompton Road in London, a city teeming with energy, history, and cultural diversity,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail + People. “The store’s focus on creativity gives our incredible team members the perfect space to share their passion and expertise with Londoners and visitors from around the world.” Special Sessions The store opening kicks off with the global launch of “United Visions,” an augmented reality experience honoring the creative works of pioneering London poet and painter William Blake. Created for Getty Museum and brought to life through Apple technology, the purpose-built app showcases the possibilities of creativity by reimagining the seminal artist’s work. Artists and creative technologists Tin Nguyen and Ed Cutting (Tin&Ed) used Apple’s M1 Ultra chip in the development of the experience, which features a poetic soundtrack by Grammy Award-winning record producer Just Blaze. “United Visions” can be viewed by customers in-store and by anyone around the world by downloading the “United Visions” app. Opening weekend festivities will include a panel discussion on the creation of “United Visions” with Nguyen, Cutting, and Just Blaze, as well as a special performance and Spatial Audio listening session by London artist Nina Nesbitt. Apple Fitness+ trainers Cory Wharton-Malcolm, Jamie-Ray Hartshorne, Kim Ngo, and Jonelle Lewis will join Jay Blahnik, Apple’s vice president of Fitness Technologies, for an in-store Q&A followed by a 3-kilometer walk and 5-kilometer run in Hyde Park. The talented Apple Creative Pros will also host live illustration sessions that take inspiration from the local blooms. Following the opening sessions, the store will host its ongoing Brompton Series, which takes place on the last Thursday of every month through October and features: Inspirational and informative talks by thought leaders in the wellness space, including Michael James Wong, Cat Meffan, Lloyd Kempson, and Harry Jameson. Music workshops in connection with Apple Music’s Up Next series breaking down songs by emerging London artists using Spatial Audio; artists include Kali Claire, Olivia Dean, and Rachel Chinouriri. The Store and Team Upon entering Apple Brompton Road, visitors will be greeted by 12 towering Sicilian ficus trees that line the 7-meter floor-to-ceiling windows and entryway. The seating at the base of each planter acts as a social gathering space for visitors, blurring the boundaries between inside and outside, and bringing nature directly into the store. Visitors come through the central arcade, which mirrors the dimensions of the original Brompton Arcade built on the same precise location in 1903. The store’s Forum — where free Today at Apple® sessions provide daily creative inspiration and practical skills — features a first for Apple in the UK: a mirrored ceiling that offers depth-enhancing reflections. Visitors are invited to explore the surrounding display tables and avenues featuring the all-new lineup of iPhone®, Mac®, iPad®, AirPods®, Apple Watch®, and Apple TV®, as well as accessories like HomePod mini® and AirTag™. The 200-person store team helps customers learn about Apple products, and offers advice on monthly financing options and the Apple Trade In program. Collectively speaking more than 45 languages, the team is ready to welcome customers from around the world. And in another first for the UK, a dedicated Apple Pickup area makes it even more convenient for customers to pick up products ordered online. Sustainability Apple Brompton Road’s terrazzo flooring is comprised of a plant-based bio resin, the first of its kind in Apple’s worldwide retail fleet. The vast space — which features a unique curved timber ceiling — offers ample seating where customers can relax and discover new tips and tricks to get the best from their devices. Like all Apple facilities, Apple Brompton Road is powered by 100 percent renewable energy. Apple in the UK For nearly 40 years, Apple has been operating in the UK, where it has more than 6,000 team members. Across the country, Apple supports over 450,000 jobs through the thriving iOS app economy, work with suppliers, and direct employment.

SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The same law firm that recently secured a $100 million settlement against Apple regarding its anticompetitive App Store policies is now representing France-based iOS developers for the same issues in a new antitrust lawsuit filed today in California federal court by Hagens Berman in association with Paris-based antitrust lawyer Fayrouze Masmi-Dazi. “We’re fresh off the heels of our hard-won settlement with Apple and ready to get back in the ring,” said Steve Berman, managing partner of Hagens Berman and an attorney representing the proposed class of iOS developers. “Our firm is happy to see iOS developers from other countries seeking the same justice we were able to achieve for U.S. developers. We believe they too have been wrongfully subjected to the stifling policies of Apple’s App Store, and we intend to hold Apple to the law.” “Le GESTE and its members are indeed at the forefront of several initiatives and battles for a more balanced and fair functioning of the digital world in France and in Europe. In its nature and magnitude, today’s action shows our determination to seek such changes and redress,” said Bertrand Gié, Le GESTE’s president and head of digital at Le Figaro and Emmanuel Alix, GESTE’s vice president and head of digital at L’Equipe. “Apple’s policies and restrictions pose critical issues to all iOS developers using the App Store. To a global problem, there shall be a global solution. I believe we can build solid bridges to conceive impactful actions, for we shall leave no room for impunity,” said Fayrouze Masmi-Dazi, Le GESTE’s antitrust attorney and an attorney representing the proposed class of iOS developers in association with Steve Berman. If you are a France-based iOS developer, find out more about the lawsuit by contacting Fayrouze Masmi-Dazi at 06 27 96 28 65 or fmasmi-Dazi@outlook.com. Berman also led his firm to win a suit against Apple and various publishing companies in 2016 that settled for a total of $560 million on behalf of e-book purchasers forced to pay artificially high prices due to Apple and the publishing companies’ colluded price-fixing. That suit went to the Supreme Court, where the Court ruled against Apple. The firm also recently filed a $1 billion case against Apple regarding antitrust policies within Apple Pay. Additionally, Hagens Berman took Google to court on behalf of Android app developers using the Google Play Store, achieving a $90 million settlement on behalf of the class. Apple Antitrust Déjà Vu Today’s filed lawsuit against Apple accuses it of the same antitrust overpricing in its App Store functionality and in-app purchase (IAP) services and seeks to represent France-based iOS developers that were subjected to Apple’s high commissions, fees and other policies. The class action’s named plaintiffs include Société du Figaro (developer of the Figaro news app and IAP subscriptions), L’Équipe 24/24 (developer of L’Équipe sports news and streaming app, and IAP subscriptions) and le GESTE, a French association comprised of France-based publishers of online content and services, including iOS developers. Plaintiffs claim they purchased overpriced iOS app-distribution and IAP services. “Apple has behaved as alleged herein in a willful attempt to obtain a monopoly in the global market,” the lawsuit states. “There is no valid business necessity or pro-competitive justification for Apple’s conduct.” The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, bringing the France-based developers’ claims to Apple’s homecourt. It accuses Apple of engaging in anticompetitive practices in mandating only one app store for iOS devices, which set the stage for Apple to abuse its market power. For almost 14 years, Apple has levied a default 30 percent commission on paid app and digital in-app product sales conducted through the App Store and in iOS apps acquired from the App Store, according to the lawsuit. “This suit aims to remedy the harm that Apple has caused to France-resident iOS developers—purchaser-participants in the U.S. domestic market for these services—by way of its violations of U.S. antitrust and California fair-competition law,” the complaint begins. Apple also requires developers to pay it an annual fee if they want their apps and in-app products to be considered by Apple for distribution in the App Store. This is especially damaging to smaller and new developers. Putting all iOS apps into one marketplace also means consumers never see most apps, attorneys say, stifling competition and innovation. According to a legal filing made by Apple last year, there were at that time more than 2 million apps available on the App Store. The lawsuit representing France-based iOS developers seeks to force Apple to end its abusive monopoly and allow competition in the distribution of iOS apps and related products, to get rid of pricing mandates, and to reimburse developers for overcharges made through abuse of its monopoly power. The lawsuit states, “Plaintiffs are not alone in their view of Apple’s anti-competitive behavior. In October 2020 the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust released a report in which the authors concluded, among other things, that Apple is a willful monopolist in its operation of the App Store and by way of its IAP product.” The Preceding Developer Settlement In 2021, the firm secured its $100 million settlement on behalf of U.S. iOS developers, which resulted in the creation of a Small Developer Assistance Fund and important changes to App Store policies and practices. In that settlement, small U.S. iOS developers – those with less than $1 million in App Store proceeds through all associated developer accounts per calendar year from June 4, 2015 to Apr. 26, 2021 – can receive payments ranging from minimums of $250 to $30,000 or more, based on historic participation in the iOS App Store ecosystem. In addition to monetary relief, the settlement brought changes to App Store policies and practices for U.S. iOS developers as they relate to App Store search results, app and in-app product price points, appeals from rejections of apps and transparency. Small U.S. iOS developers also will benefit from a pledge that for at least three years following court approval of the settlement, Apple will not raise the 15% commission rate that applies for those participating in its Small Business Program. Among other benefits of the settlement, Apple will permit all U.S. iOS developers to communicate with their customers outside their apps about purchasing methods other than Apple’s IAP system. Apple also will remove the prohibition against U.S. developers using information obtained within their apps to communicate with their customers outside their apps about the use of purchasing methods other than IAP, subject to consumer consent and opt-out safeguards.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2022 fourth quarter ended September 24, 2022. The Company posted a September quarter record revenue of $90.1 billion, up 8 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.29, up 4 percent year over year. Annual revenue was $394.3 billion, up 8 percent year over year, and annual earnings per diluted share were $6.11, up 9 percent year over year. “This quarter’s results reflect Apple’s commitment to our customers, to the pursuit of innovation, and to leaving the world better than we found it,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, we are leading with our values in every action we take and every decision we make. We are deeply committed to protecting the environment, to securing user privacy, to strengthening accessibility, and to creating products and services that can unlock humanity’s full creative potential.” “Our record September quarter results continue to demonstrate our ability to execute effectively in spite of a challenging and volatile macroeconomic backdrop,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “We continued to invest in our long-term growth plans, generated over $24 billion in operating cash flow, and returned over $29 billion to our shareholders during the quarter. The strength of our ecosystem, unmatched customer loyalty, and record sales spurred our active installed base of devices to a new all-time high. This quarter capped another record-breaking year for Apple, with revenue growing over $28 billion and operating cash flow up $18 billion versus last year.” Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on November 10, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 7, 2022.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2022 fourth quarter ended September 24, 2022. The Company posted a September quarter record revenue of $90.1 billion, up 8 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.29, up 4 percent year over year. Annual revenue was $394.3 billion, up 8 percent year over year, and annual earnings per diluted share were $6.11, up 9 percent year over year. “This quarter’s results reflect Apple’s commitment to our customers, to the pursuit of innovation, and to leaving the world better than we found it,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, we are leading with our values in every action we take and every decision we make. We are deeply committed to protecting the environment, to securing user privacy, to strengthening accessibility, and to creating products and services that can unlock humanity’s full creative potential.” “Our record September quarter results continue to demonstrate our ability to execute effectively in spite of a challenging and volatile macroeconomic backdrop,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “We continued to invest in our long-term growth plans, generated over $24 billion in operating cash flow, and returned over $29 billion to our shareholders during the quarter. The strength of our ecosystem, unmatched customer loyalty, and record sales spurred our active installed base of devices to a new all-time high. This quarter capped another record-breaking year for Apple, with revenue growing over $28 billion and operating cash flow up $18 billion versus last year.” Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on November 10, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 7, 2022.

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--State Street Global Advisors, the asset management business of State Street Corporation (NYSE: STT), marked the 30th anniversary of the first ever US-listed exchange traded fund (ETF) this month, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Launched on January 22, 1993, SPY is the world’s largest ETF with more than $355 billion in assets and the most heavily traded security in the world with an average daily trading volume of $39 billion.* “SPY gave birth to an industry that has democratized investing, giving both investors large and small access to institutional-grade solutions that offer efficient, cost-effective exposures to all corners of the global investment market,” said Rory Tobin, head of State Street Global Advisors’ Global SPDR ETF Business. “Born out of the stock market crash of 1987, SPY has demonstrated its resilience throughout major market events from the burst of the dot-com bubble to the global financial crisis of 2008, and more recently, the extreme pandemic-era volatility.” “SPY disrupted the asset management industry and benefitted investors in ways that exceeded even the most ambitious expectations,” said Sue Thompson head of SPDR Americas Distribution at State Street Global Advisors. “Three decades since SPY’s launch, investors now have access to more than 8,000 ETFs globally, but none come close to offering the liquidity of SPY, which provides transaction cost benefits that can lower total cost of ownership for investors.” “S&P Dow Jones Indices congratulates State Street Global Advisors on this momentous occasion. This 30-year milestone and the tremendous growth of ETFs during this time, reflect the transformational benefits being provided to all end investors,” said Dan Draper, Chief Executive Officer at S&P Dow Jones Indices. A History Steeped in Liquidity & Resiliency Since SPY’s launch, US-listed ETFs have amassed $6.5 trillion in assets.* Toward the end of 2022 SPY was trading three times more than Apple (AAPL) — the largest security in the world by market cap.** That volume, combined with the size of SPY’s assets, performance, liquidity, and resilience, has been vital to investors as they construct asset allocation portfolios and navigate extreme market events. In fact, as the market began to tumble during the onset of COVID-19, SPY became the first ETF to ever trade more than $100 billion in a single day on February 28, 2020.** “Throughout each market turn, SPY’s unparalleled liquidity profile provided investors with the flexibility to buy and sell shares quickly, easily, and cost-efficiently,” Tobin added. ETF Impact Survey shows the positive impact ETFs have on investors today Today, ETFs have become core building blocks for investors making asset allocation decisions. The expansion of ETFs to include different types of funds in a variety of asset classes further added to their appeal. Recent findings from State Street Global Advisors ETF Impact Survey reaffirm the popularity of ETFs as a vehicle that can help investors remain confident in their investing acumen. The survey was designed to understand investor attitudes and perceptions about ETFs, the market and the economy in the US, APAC and EMEA. Overall, the perceived benefits ETFs have brought to investors globally is overwhelmingly positive- whether or not they even own ETFs. More than half agree ETFs are an investor-friendly investment product (58%) and are better diversified than other investment products (54%). Furthermore, investors who do have an existing ETF holding report that ETFs have improved the overall performance of their portfolio (73% globally and 59% in the US alone). And, the majority believe ETFs have made them a better investor (67% globally and 53% in the US). Liquidity Remains Important Amidst Investor Uncertainty on Markets and Economy Globally, nearly seven-in-ten investors believe the volatility in the stock market is going to continue for at least the next 12 months. Six-in-ten investors agree that when there is volatility in the market it is important to have more liquid investments. Regardless of whether they have ETFs in their portfolio, globally, more than half of investors agree ETFs offer more liquidity to respond rapidly to market changes (52%) and can mitigate risk better in volatile markets compared to other investments (51%). More Room for Growth and Innovation Despite the explosive growth of the ETF industry since SPY’s launch, the survey suggests the industry still has a long runway for expansion in the US, as just 40% of investors say they own an ETF in their portfolio, which is considerably lower than stocks (83%), mutual funds (67%) and bonds (53%). When asked if they plan to buy ETFs in the next 12 months, 50% of investors globally indicate they do, compared to 37% in the US.

OMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Investor Movement Index® (IMX℠) increased to 4.31 in January, up from its score of 4.17 in December. The IMX is TD Ameritrade’s proprietary, behavior-based index, aggregating Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets. The reading for the four-week period ending January 27, 2023 ranks “low” compared to historic averages. “While there’s still a ways to go before the IMX score reaches the soaring heights it hit in 2020 and 2021, optimism among retail investors is beginning to creep back up as this year begins,” said Shawn Cruz, head trading strategist, TD Ameritrade. “With inflation moderating and volatility projections starting to wane, retail investors are continuing to net sell equities but are also on a whole increasing their market exposure, potentially signaling more appetite for exposure in the months to come.” January started off with a sharp bounce after the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly Employment Situation report continued to show an ever-resilient labor market; the unemployment rate stubbornly moved lower to 3.5%, but the report showed an uptick in the participation rate and a slowing pace of wage increases. In the days that followed, the market mostly crept higher until the morning of January 18th when the U.S. Census Bureau’s December Retail Sales data was released, shining light on a disappointing holiday season for retailers. This sent the market into a bit of a tailspin, pushing the S&P 500 down just over 1.5% to its worst finish in the January period. U.S. equities quickly steadied the ship, however, and continued on a “risk-on” course to close out the month, buoyed by optimism from corporate earnings releases from many of the market’s bellwether companies. The S&P 500 (SPX) charted its strongest period of performance since October ’22, finishing up just over 6%. All of this contributed to the CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) touching its lowest level since January 2022 before ending the period at 18.51, possibly indicating an increasing comfort with the uncertainties that have plagued the market for the better part of the last year. U.S. Treasury markets rallied alongside equity markets, leading to a decline in yields, and the U.S. Dollar Index continued its recent slide to finish at its lowest level since May 2022. Crude oil saw steep selling early in January but quickly recovered most of its early-month losses to finish down a modest 1.4% during the period. TD Ameritrade clients were net sellers overall, but they did find individual names to buy during the period, including: Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) Ford Motor Co. (F) Apple Inc. (AAPL) Intel Corp. (INTC) Names sold during the period included: Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Boeing Co. (BA) American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Millennial Buys & Sells TD Ameritrade millennial clients also increased exposure during the January IMX period, but like the overall TD Ameritrade client population, they were net sellers of equities. Both TD Ameritrade millennial clients and the overall TD Ameritrade client population were net buyers of Tesla (TSLA) as the electric vehicle (EV) maker reported earnings and ended its recent run of weakness with a surge of over 44% during the period. This optimism spilled over to another EV maker, Rivian Automotive (RIVN), as both populations were net buyers of the company, seeing opportunity in its early January weakness. TD Ameritrade millennial clients took it one step further and also net bought Lucid Group (LCID) as takeover speculation late in January contributed to a massive run-up of over 88% during the period. Both TD Ameritrade millennial clients and the overall TD Ameritrade client population were net sellers of American Airlines (AAL), seeing an opportunity to sell into strength as the company soared over 30% following an optimistic update to its guidance forecast early in the month and as it beat street estimates with its earnings on January 26th. TD Ameritrade millennial clients also reduced exposure in United Airlines (UAL) as the Chicago-based airliner also jumped nearly 30%, using the strength as an opportunity to sell. Although TD Ameritrade millennial clients were net sellers of equities during the January period, they were net buyers of three of the S&P sectors: Health Care, Real Estate, and Utilities. About the IMX The IMX value is calculated based on a complex proprietary formula. Each month, TD Ameritrade pulls a sample from its client base of funded accounts, which includes all accounts that completed a trade in the past month. The holdings and positions of this statistically significant sample are evaluated to calculate individual scores, and the median of those scores represents the monthly IMX.

CUPERTINO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apple® today previewed software features for cognitive, vision, hearing, and mobility accessibility, along with innovative tools for individuals who are nonspeaking or at risk of losing their ability to speak. These updates draw on advances in hardware and software, include on-device machine learning to ensure user privacy, and expand on Apple’s long-standing commitment to making products for everyone. Apple works in deep collaboration with community groups representing a broad spectrum of users with disabilities to develop accessibility features that make a real impact on people’s lives. Coming later this year, users with cognitive disabilities can use iPhone® and iPad® with greater ease and independence with Assistive Access; nonspeaking individuals can type to speak during calls and conversations with Live Speech; and those at risk of losing their ability to speak can use Personal Voice to create a synthesized voice that sounds like them for connecting with family and friends. For users who are blind or have low vision, Detection Mode in Magnifier offers Point and Speak, which identifies text users point toward and reads it out loud to help them interact with physical objects such as household appliances. “At Apple, we’ve always believed that the best technology is technology built for everyone,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Today, we’re excited to share incredible new features that build on our long history of making technology accessible, so that everyone has the opportunity to create, communicate, and do what they love.” “Accessibility is part of everything we do at Apple,” said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives. “These groundbreaking features were designed with feedback from members of disability communities every step of the way, to support a diverse set of users and help people connect in new ways.” Assistive Access Supports Users with Cognitive Disabilities Assistive Access uses innovations in design to distill apps and experiences to their essential features in order to lighten cognitive load. The feature reflects feedback from people with cognitive disabilities and their trusted supporters — focusing on the activities they enjoy — and that are foundational to iPhone and iPad: connecting with loved ones, capturing and enjoying photos, and listening to music. Assistive Access includes a customized experience for Phone and FaceTime®, which have been combined into a single Calls app, as well as Messages, Camera, Photos, and Music. The feature offers a distinct interface with high contrast buttons and large text labels, as well as tools to help trusted supporters tailor the experience for the individual they support. For example, for users who prefer communicating visually, Messages includes an emoji-only keyboard and the option to record a video message to share with loved ones. Users and trusted supporters can also choose between a more visual, grid-based layout for their Home Screen and apps, or a row-based layout for users who prefer text. “The intellectual and developmental disability community is bursting with creativity, but technology often poses physical, visual, or knowledge barriers for these individuals,” said Katy Schmid, senior director of National Program Initiatives at The Arc of the United States. “To have a feature that provides a cognitively accessible experience on iPhone or iPad — that means more open doors to education, employment, safety, and autonomy. It means broadening worlds and expanding potential.” Live Speech and Personal Voice Advance Speech Accessibility With Live Speech on iPhone, iPad, and Mac®, users can type what they want to say to have it be spoken out loud during phone and FaceTime calls as well as in-person conversations. Users can also save commonly used phrases to chime in quickly during lively conversation with family, friends, and colleagues. Live Speech has been designed to support millions of people globally who are unable to speak or who have lost their speech over time. For users at risk of losing their ability to speak — such as those with a recent diagnosis of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or other conditions that can progressively impact speaking ability — Personal Voice is a simple and secure way to create a voice that sounds like them. Users can create a Personal Voice by reading along with a randomized set of text prompts to record 15 minutes of audio on iPhone or iPad. This speech accessibility feature uses on-device machine learning to keep users’ information private and secure, and integrates seamlessly with Live Speech so users can speak with their Personal Voice when connecting with loved ones.1 “At the end of the day, the most important thing is being able to communicate with friends and family,” said Philip Green, board member and ALS advocate at the Team Gleason nonprofit, who has experienced significant changes to his voice since receiving his ALS diagnosis in 2018. “If you can tell them you love them, in a voice that sounds like you, it makes all the difference in the world — and being able to create your synthetic voice on your iPhone in just 15 minutes is extraordinary.” Detection Mode in Magnifier Introduces Point and Speak for Users Who Are Blind or Have Low Vision Point and Speak in Magnifier makes it easier for users with vision disabilities to interact with physical objects that have several text labels. For example, while using a household appliance — such as a microwave — Point and Speak combines input from the Camera app, the LiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine learning to announce the text on each button as users move their finger across the keypad.2 Point and Speak is built into the Magnifier app on iPhone and iPad, works great with VoiceOver, and can be used with other Magnifier features such as People Detection, Door Detection, and Image Descriptions to help users navigate their physical environment. Additional Features Deaf or hard-of-hearing users can pair Made for iPhone hearing devices directly to Mac and customize them for their hearing comfort.3 Voice Control adds phonetic suggestions for text editing so users who type with their voice can choose the right word out of several that might sound alike, like “do,” “due,” and “dew.”4 Additionally, with Voice Control Guide, users can learn tips and tricks about using voice commands as an alternative to touch and typing across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Users with physical and motor disabilities who use Switch Control can turn any switch into a virtual game controller to play their favorite games on iPhone and iPad. For users with low vision, Text Size is now easier to adjust across Mac apps such as Finder, Messages, Mail, Calendar, and Notes. Users who are sensitive to rapid animations can automatically pause images with moving elements, such as GIFs, in Messages and Safari®. For VoiceOver users, Siri® voices sound natural and expressive even at high rates of speech feedback; users can also customize the rate at which Siri speaks to them, with options ranging from 0.8x to 2x. Celebrating Global Accessibility Awareness Day Around the World To celebrate Global Accessibility Awareness Day, this week Apple is introducing new features, curated collections, and more: SignTime will launch in Germany, Italy, Spain, and South Korea on May 18 to connect Apple Store® and Apple Support customers with on-demand sign language interpreters. The service is already available for customers in the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Australia, and Japan.5 Select Apple Store locations around the world are offering informative sessions throughout the week to help customers discover accessibility features, and Apple Carnegie Library will feature a Today at Apple® session with sign language performer and interpreter Justina Miles. And with group reservations — available year-round — Apple Store locations are a place where community groups can learn about accessibility features together. Shortcuts adds Remember This, which helps users with cognitive disabilities create a visual diary in Notes for easy reference and reflection. This week, Apple Podcasts® will offer a collection of shows about the impact of accessible technology; the Apple TV® app is featuring movies and series curated by notable storytellers from the disability community; Apple Books® will spotlight Being Heumann: An Unrepentant Memoir of a Disability Rights Activist, the memoir by disability rights pioneer Judith Heumann; and Apple Music® will feature cross-genre American Sign Language (ASL) music videos. This week in Apple Fitness+℠, trainer Jamie-Ray Hartshorne incorporates ASL while highlighting features available to users that are part of an ongoing effort to make fitness more accessible to all. Features include Audio Hints, which provide additional short descriptive verbal cues to support users who are blind or low vision, and Time to Walk and Time to Run episodes become “Time to Walk or Push” and “Time to Run or Push” for wheelchair users. Additionally, Fitness+ trainers incorporate ASL into every workout and meditation, all videos include closed captioning in six languages, and trainers demonstrate modifications in workouts so users at different levels can join in. The App Store® will spotlight three disability community leaders — Aloysius Gan, Jordyn Zimmerman, and Bradley Heaven — each of whom will share their experiences as nonspeaking individuals and the transformative effects of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) apps in their lives. 1 Personal Voice can be created using iPhone, iPad, and Mac with Apple silicon, and will be available in English. 2 Point and Speak will be available on iPhone and iPad devices with the LiDAR Scanner in English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Cantonese, Korean, Japanese, and Ukrainian. 3 Users will be able to pair Made for iPhone hearing devices with select Mac devices with M1 chip, and all Mac devices with M2 chip. 4 Voice Control phonetic suggestions will be available in English, Spanish, French, and German. 5 SignTime sessions are available in the U.S. and Canada using American Sign Language (ASL), in the U.K. using British Sign Language (BSL), in France using French Sign Language (LSF), in Japan using Japanese Sign Language (JSL), and in Australia using Australian Sign Language (Auslan).

In this monthly series, we highlight five CEFs with solid track records that pay high distributions and offer “excess” discounts.

The explosive demand for semiconductors and microchips has grabbed news headlines and led the market higher over the past few years. As the drive towards integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into our everyday lives progresses, there are a handful of mega-cap companies that are capable of meeting that demand. And as much NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) may get the lion’s share of attention, it is companies like Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) that will also be playing a central role in supply. The San Jose, Calif.-based company, which was founded in 1961, has been a major player in the tech space for decades. But its business sectors focusing on semiconductors and infrastructure software products have been major catalysts in its market cap pushing toward $1 trillion market capitalization — good for a top 15 among all publicly traded companies. Despite shares of Broadcom gaining over 696.01% in the past five years and 53.23% in 2024, 24/7 Wall Street has performed an analysis that suggests there is still a big-time upside for Broadcom before the end of the decade. Here is where prospective investors and current shareholders might expect the stock to be over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: Broadcom’s history of stellar earnings and strong revenue generation suggests the ability of the company to remain one of the most appealing semiconductor and software stocks. With the burgeoning AI trend and a recent stock split, Broadcom is increasingly appealing and more accessible to investors. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Broadcom’s Recent Stock Success Broadcom’s incredible growth has been reflected in the price of its shares, which have surged since 2014 to the tune of a 3,170% gain. This culminated on July 15, 2024, when the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split that made its shares more accessible to all investors by driving the stock’s price down to $167 at the time. Beyond its role in AI and semiconductors, Broadcom is also a major supplier for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), providing the Magnificent Seven mainstay with critical wireless connectivity components and other hardware. According to the company, Broadcom expects 20% growth in wireless revenue just in the final quarter of 2024. Between its semiconductor, software and smartphone business segments, the stock has experienced sizable growth in the recent past: INSERT TABLE HERE Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $10.06 $4.244 $1.343 2015 $14.63 $6.897 $2.613 2016 $18.19 $13.269 $4.672 2017 $25.69 $17.656 $7.255 2018 $25.36 $20.805 $9.391 2019 $31.65 $22.548 $9.452 2020 $43.79 $23.858 $9.993 2021 $66.48 $27.403 $12.578 2022 $55.24 $33.169 $16.526 2023 $111.63 $35.798 $18.378 *Post-split adjusted basis , **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, Broadcom’s revenue grew by more than 743% while its net income increased by over 1,268%. Despite a slight contraction in share price in 2022 during an extended bull market that had an outsized impact on the tech sector, on a post-split adjusted basis, shares of Broadcom have climbed 1,009.64% from 2014 through 2023. As the Silicon Valley mainstay looks towards the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to positively impact Broadcom’s growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of Broadcom’s Stock Performance 1. Exceptional Track Record of Earnings and Revenue Beats: Going back to the first quarter of 2015, Broadcom has beaten earnings in every single quarter except one. That is one earnings miss over the course of 39 quarters. Expectations are that the company will continue to beat on earnings and revenue, with a forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $1.39 for the last quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the company posted an impressive 17.65% year-over-year EPS gain, which year-over-year total revenue grew from $8.88 billion in July 2023 to $13.07 billion in July 2024 — an increase of 47.18%. 2. Filling the Gap NVIDIA Cannot Satisfy: For investors concerned about NVIDIA’s possible overvaluation or the company’s inability to single-handedly satisfy the explosive AI-driven semiconductor demand, Broadcom is an alternative that at current prices could be considered a bargain. In September, Barchart.com reported that the “stock looks deeply undervalued … based on its strong revenue, free cash flow, FCF margin, management guidance and analysts’ price targets.” Specifically, that free cash flow has grown markedly between FY 2019 to FY 2023, from $9.27 billion to $17.63 billion good for an increase of over 90%. As demand for semiconductors and microchips continues to grow, Broadcom has an abundance of cash ready to be deployed in order to match that growth. 3. Institutional Ownership: Broadcom is beloved by institutional investors, of which there are 3,382. Of the company’s 4.671 billion shares outstanding, a staggering 3.537 billion of them are held by institutional investors, according to Nasdaq.com. That accounts for 75.74% of the company’s entire stock. The top three largest holders are Vanguard Group with 448 million shares followed by BlackRock at 342 million and Capital World Investors with 224 million shares. Together, those three positions account for $175.432 million in share value. And in the past year, 1,760 institutional investors increased their positions. Broadcom (AVGO) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for Broadcom is $195, representing a potential upside of 9.15% over the next 12 months. Of all the analysts covering Broadcom, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.43 ‘Buy’ rating on a scale from 1 (‘Strong Buy’) to 5 (‘Strong Sell’). By the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street‘s forecast for AVGO shares is $204.27, representing an 14.33% potential upside based on an EPS of $6.19 and a PE ratio of 33. Broadcom (AVGO) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue* EPS 2025 $60.492 $6.19 2026 $67.906 $7.29 2027 $75.850 $8.82 2028 $85.222 $11.94 2029 $84.920 $14.93 2030 $86.618 $18.66 *Revenue and net income in $billions How Broadcom’s Next Five Years Could Play Out At the end of 2025, we forecast Broadcom’s stock to be trading for $204.27 based on revenue of $60.492 billion, a net income of $34.224 billion, and an EPS of $6.19. The following year, we estimate earnings per share of $7.29 on over $67 billion in revenue. Starting in 2027 through 2029, we expect a 13% growth in revenue and a 40% jump in earnings per share, bringing Broadcom’s price target from $238.14 in 2027 to $373.13 in 2029. Broadcom’s Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates Broadcom’s stock will trade at $429.09, representing a 140.17% increase from its current price, based on revenue of $86.618 billion and an EPS of $18.66.

In the high-tech universe, there is a single common road that top-flight companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and many others must travel to get their chips made, no matter where they hail from. That road inevitably leads to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM), the largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. When a company like Nvidia designs a new chip, it takes it to Taiwan Semiconductor to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. Taiwan Semiconductor is the top choice for Nvidia, AMD, and many other chip designers, thanks to its precision, quality control, and innovative technical capabilities. At the time of this writing, Taiwan Semiconductor commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries. The explosion of growth in the artificial intelligence and data center arenas have led to a commensurate demand acceleration for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) chips and a panoply of similar ones for those fields. By focusing on precision foundry work, Taiwan Semiconductor has become the premier “go-to” player, for chip designers, even among those competing in various sectors. Headwinds and Challenges Taiwan Semiconductor’s biggest threat is from a mainland China invasion of Taiwan, rather than from any market competitors. Despite its crucial place in the semiconductor supply chain, Taiwan Semiconductor is based in Taiwan. Due to claims by The People’s Republic of China’s leadership that Taiwan is a part of China proper, the nation is in a state of perpetual invasion alert. Any overt military action on Taiwanese soil could result in a domino-effect of chip shortages if Taiwan Semiconductor is forced to halt production. Taiwan Semiconductor announced a rise in prices for its 3-nanometer and 5-nm process products by up to 8%. However, Samsung is focusing on its 2-nm process to meet future technologies’ high-performance, low-power, and high-bandwidth requirements, and rival Intel has a 1.4-nm ultra-fine process slated to be unveiled in 2027. The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical. While AI investment soars, Taiwan Semiconductor has few rivals of significance. During slow periods, semiconductor companies have often been glutted with excess inventory. It remains to be seen how TSM will handle a slowdown after ramping up production to such a high level. Nevertheless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. Although most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near term prognostications irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some farther looking insights based on Taiwan Semiconductor’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article: Taiwan Semiconductor has control of roughly 62% of the global chip market. For Taiwan, its semiconductor dominance is a good thing, from a national security perspective. Geopolitical observers frequently refer to Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as a “silicon shield” by serving as an incentive for the international community to keep Taiwan out of Beijing’s control. Taiwan Semiconductor’s focus on fabrication precision and its R&amp;D emphasis on miniaturization and efficiency are the main drivers for its huge market share from Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and other chip designers. Aware of its vulnerability to geopolitical destabilization from China, Taiwan Semiconductor has strategically diversified some geographical manufacturing with new US factories in Arizona and Washington, one in Dresden, Germany, and JVs with Sony and Denso in Japan. Apple is hugely dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor, and has been since 2014. Apple announced a deal in 2023 to buy 100% of the output of the most advanced chips from Taiwan Semiconductor in Taiwan (and from its AZ plant in 2024). This move guaranteed that none of Apple’s competitors could acquire similar chips for more than a year.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. 5 to 10 Year Review Apple Computer procures nearly 100% of its CPUs and other chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. 2014 was the year that the TSM-Apple cooperation began in earnest, with Apple’s A8 and A8X SoCss. Such has the cooperation expanded that Apple has gone to TSM for nearly 100% of its chip requirements by 2024. Opposing patent infringement lawsuits with GlobalFoundries in 2019 eventually settled with a cross-licensing agreement, which ends in 2029. 2020 saw Taiwan Semiconductor prudently decide to diversify its manufacturing by opening up new plants in Phoenix, AZ, and Dresden, Germany. In July 2020, TSM signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan’s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world’s largest corporate green energy order ever made. 2021 saw TSM form joint ventures with Sony and Denso in Japan.

Taiwan Semiconductor expects its 2024 capital expenditure budget to hit $32 billion. 70% to 80% of the budget will be allocated to advanced process technologies, 20% will be directed to specialty technologies, and 10% will be spent on advanced packaging, testing, and mass-making. The Company’s revenue growth should continue to accelerate due to its leading-edge N3 manufacturing node. Taiwan Semiconductor plans to commence its 2-nm process in 2025. Strong demand for chips used in artificial intelligence and cloud storage data center applications from Nvidia, AMD, and others shows no sign of curtailing. Thanks to its uniquely advanced manufacturing capabilities, Taiwan Semiconductor can easily scale for demand acceleration, and holds close to a near monopoly on large GPU chip contracts from major semiconductor designers for AI and data center use, even among competing designers. Total spending on AI chip content and related systems is forecast to reach $193.3 billion in 2027, according to estimates from IDC. That’s up from $117.5 billion this year, translating into an 18% compound annual growth rate over the next three years. Taiwan Semiconductor has national interest and support from the Taiwanese government in maintaining its wide competitive advantage, as the tech industry’s dependence on TSM-made chips incentivizes the international community to keep a China invasion in check. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating for Taiwan Semiconductor from over a dozen Wall Street analysts is “buy”(11 buy, 4 outperform,1 hold). The average price target in 12 months is $210.79, which is roughly 12.66% above the current price. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for Taiwan Semiconductors’ price is $183.92, which is -1.70% below the current price. While Taiwan Semiconductor will start its 2-nm process in 2025, Samsung has a vested interest in developing its own niche advantage and support from the Korean government in that space. As a result, we don’t anticipate as big a 2025 surge from 2-nm as other analysts might. Taiwan Semiconductor’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook Since Taiwan Semiconductor consumes as much as 5% of Taiwan’s entire energy output, its Ørsted wind farm energy production should manifest tangible cost savings benefits. Therefore, we project 2026’s stock price to hit $186.00, a modest .74% year-over-year gain. While its 2-nm process will likely compete favorably at the start against Samsung, the TSM competitive advantage in other avenues of chip manufacturing will ultimately prove to be overwhelming. The anticipated surge of data center spending on chips should fuel larger contracts. Collaborations with research institutions and tech giants in developing next-generation AI chips could open new revenue streams and strengthen its position as an innovation leader in the industry. Our projection for 2027 is $206.80. 2028 should begin to see the rewards from the 2024 R&amp;D surge of $32 billion in advanced process technologies. New products from TSM investments in quantum computing research are expected to bear fruit by 2028, potentially revolutionizing certain computing applications. The company’s focus on developing ultra-low power consumption chips for IoT and edge computing devices could position it as a key player in the growing market for energy-efficient technologies. The 2028 24/7 Wall Street price target is $213.90. 2029 will mark the expiration of Taiwan Semiconductor’s GlobalFoundries cross-licensing agreement, which should double up the revenues from that stream. Further developments in chips for quantum computing, healthcare and other applications can open up more direct government contract opportunities. US and German TSM factories should be operating at full capacity by 2029. We anticipate a price jump to $245.99. Taiwan Semiconductor Stock in 2030 TSM’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips that can mimic many human brain functions. By 2030, Taiwan Semiconductor’s work in quantum computing should pave the way for neuromorphic computing chips at the forefront of AI applications. These would mimic human brain functions more closely than ever before. The company’s involvement in space exploration projects and renewable energy initiatives may also diversify its revenue streams and enhance its global technological influence. We expect a $254.59 stock price, representing a 36.07% gain over today’s stock price.

Rumors Persist About Next-Gen Features,"Apple AirPods With Cameras? Rumors Persist About Next-Gen Features
Apple Inc. AAPL reportedly continues to explore AirPods with tiny infrared cameras. What Happened: In his latest ""Power On"" newsletter, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman fleetingly mentioned camera-equipped AirPods while reporting about Cupertino's wearables development. While he did not dwell on the use cases of the camera, it clearly indicated that the development is still on the cards. According to previous reports, these tiny infrared cameras are expected to deliver an enhanced spatial audio experience, especially in combination with Vision Pro headset. See Also: Jeff Bezos-Backed Perplexity Revises TikTok Merger Deal, Proposes Giving US Government 50% Stake: Report Reports also indicated that the cameras would allow users to leverage sound sources based on head movements while watching videos with the headset. Moreover, they could enable “in-air gesture control,” allowing users to interact with devices through hand movements. Mass production of these AirPods will reportedly begin by 2026 with a potential release in 2026 or 2027. Apple has yet to confirm any such plan. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Why It Matters: The AirPods lineup is a critical component of Apple's wearables, home, and accessories category. It generated $9.04 billion in revenue during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 which represents a slight decline from $9.32 billion in the same period in 2023.

Vice President JD Vance, who was backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, has voiced his concerns about the influence of big tech companies, asserting that these companies wield “too much power.” What Happened: Speaking on “Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan” on Saturday, Vance was asked about the prominent presence of tech leaders at Donald Trump’s inauguration. This included names like Meta Platforms, Inc.’s META Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon.com, Inc.’s AMZN Jeff Bezos, Tesla Inc.’s TSLA Elon Musk, Apple Inc.’s AAPL Tim Cook, and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG GOOGL Sundar Pichai. To illustrate his point, the Vice President noted that the tech leaders did not receive preferential seating over his mother or other supporters. “We believe fundamentally that big tech does have too much power.” See Also: Nvidia Stock Slides Overnight On Robinhood As China’s DeepSeek Sparks Doubts Over GPU Spending Frenzy — Chamath Palihapitiya Highlights Report Indicating AI Holy Grail Cracked He stressed the importance of tech companies respecting constitutional rights and halting censorship and cautioned that Trump’s administration would not look kindly on non-compliance. Why It Matters: The tech sector played a crucial role in Trump’s 2024 election victory, with Musk investing significantly in support of Trump and other Republicans. Trump appointed Musk to lead a new agency focused on reducing federal spending. Other tech leaders also engaged with Trump, visiting Mar-a-Lago before the inauguration. Vance has been vocal about his desire to break up large tech companies, particularly Google's parent company Alphabet. Interestingly, the Vice President had a powerful Silicon Valley backer in the share of Thiel who has also funded his 2022 Ohio campaign with $15 million. Image via Shutterstock"

Apple delivered better-than-expected Q1 2025 results, but iPhone revenue growth turned negative, ending the AI supercycle narrative. Despite strong free cash flow and shareholder returns, Apple's premium valuation is unjustified, given its stagnant growth and lack of a clear needle-mover product. Amid currency headwinds, Apple's leadership provided mixed forward guidance - low to mid-single-digit revenue growth - for Q2 FY2025, reinforcing my dim view of Apple's growth trajectory."

Apple reported record revenue and EPS for fiscal Q1-2025, which beat estimates. Still, the results weren't groundbreaking relative to the stock's rich valuation, leading me to maintain a 'Hold' rating. Despite a 0.8% decline in iPhone sales, Services revenue grew 14%, contributing more to overall profitability with higher gross margins. AAPL's valuation at a P/E ratio of ~39x is high, leaving limited room for significant gains and suggesting potential for valuation contraction."

MIDDLETOWN, NJ — Here are new details on the sex assault charge against Justin McGhee, the Middletown North girls' basketball coach accused of engaging in a sexual relationship with an underage female student. It was in December that a Middletown Police detective first received a report that McGhee was having an inappropriate relationship with a student, according to an affidavit the Monmouth County Prosecutor released Thursday. That first allegation did not name the student, according to the affidavit. On Jan. 26 that same detective received another report, this time from a Middletown school official, and alleging McGhee had inappropriate contact with a student. The school district received word of the allegations via email, said police. According to the affidavit, after the second allegation was made, Middletown Police discovered a report of a ""suspicious"" incident in another town, where McGhee was found with a teenage girl in a car after midnight. The teen girl, under the age of 18, was enrolled in the Middletown public school system. Middletown Police then interviewed the girls' parents and then the girl herself, who told police she and the teacher had been involved in a relationship that turned sexual, according to the affidavit. Middletown Police also interviewed McGhee at Middletown Police headquarters, who ""confessed to the sexual relationship with the student, specifically stating that the encounters sexual in nature occurred in the basement of his house,"" according to the affidavit. McGhee, who lives in Ocean Township, was arrested Tuesday and taken to the Monmouth County jail. He is charged with second-degree sexual assault and second-degree child endangerment. McGhee is also a gym/health teacher at Middletown North, and an assistant football coach for the Middletown North Lions. The district placed him on paid administrative leave after he was arrested, pending the outcome of the criminal charges against him. The inappropriate relationship between McGhee and the teen began late last year, allege Middletown Police. His Apple iPhone and Apple Watch were also seized by Middletown Police to be searched for evidence. Wednesday's report: Middletown North Basketball Coach Charged With Sex Assault Of Student Patch incorrectly reported in an initial version of this story that Middletown Police did not investigate the first allegation in December. That is incorrect, said the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office. They did investigate. Middletown Police released this statement Thursday night after this article was published: On January 30, 2025, Patch published an article titled “Middletown Police Notified Twice of Sex Allegations Against Teacher,” with a phrase in the first paragraph erroneously reporting that the Middletown Township Police Department failed to investigate the initial report that led to criminal charges being filed in this case. That is demonstrably false. While Patch has since reworded this portion of the article and also published a correction, additional clarification is now necessary. The rush to publish this article before fact checking and final approval by the reporter and or editorial staff proved to be irresponsible journalism. Due to the ongoing nature of this investigation, Middletown Twp. Police cannot comment on case-specific facts and events that led to the arrest of Justin McGhee, 35, of Ocean Twp. However, the initially published portrayal of the investigation in this article was highly speculative and again, inaccurate. Upon receipt of the initial report, police initiated an investigation. However, due to the very limited information provided there was insufficient evidence to indicate that any crime had been committed. Furthermore, at no time did any of the information provided to the police identify the victim, nor did either report indicate that McGhee’s actions were sexual in nature. Ultimately, upon receipt of the secondary report, police were able to go forward with the investigation, which culminated in the arrest of McGhee, less than 24 hours later. Middletown Police Police Chief R. Craig Weber stated, “This agency takes crimes of this nature very seriously and thoroughly investigates each and every tip or allegation of criminal activity to the fullest extent possible. Any report or suggestion to the contrary is patently false. This police department will always take every step necessary to safeguard and protect the community.” Anyone with additional information pertaining to this investigation is urged to contact Detective Ricardo Cruz at (732) 615-2120 or Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office Det. David Sidorakis at (800) 533-7443. Contact Patch reporter Carly Baldwin at Carly.baldwin@patch.com."

Brookside Energy Ltd sits in a strong cash position for the quarter, achieving A$21.1 million in cash receipts from sales, with net operating cash flow surging 667% quarter-on-quarter to A$12.2 million. Record operating cash flow, along with A$3.1 million in additional cash inflows, partially offset the A$19.0 million in capital expenditure related to the FMDP.

The total FMDP CAPEX amounted to approximately A$36 million net to Brookside, reflecting a ~15% saving against the initial budget. This investment was primarily funded through cash reserves and operational cash flow, demonstrating the company's financial discipline and efficiency in executing large-scale projects. With the FMDP wells now operational, Group Net Production reached a record 226,189 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), with liquids comprising 67%, for the December quarter—representing a 129% increase quarter-on-quarter.

On a normalised basis, a single well with a 10,000-foot lateral produced around 1,400 BOE per day gross for IP24 and 1,200 BOE per day gross for IP30. These results align with those of the Flames Well, the parent well in the FMDP. Brookside increased its average working interest in FMDP wells to approximately 70%, securing a larger share of production revenue and enhancing profitability. Operated SWISH Play wells recorded gross production of 392,435 BOE during the quarter, bringing cumulative production to 2.5 million BOE as of December 31, 2024.

During the quarter, Firebird’s subsidiary, Hunan Firebird Battery Technology Co., Ltd.

In less than 12 months since its incorporation, HFBT has secured all critical permits and remains on schedule and within budget. In a key technological breakthrough, Firebird’s pilot calcining kiln demonstrated energy savings of up to 70% compared to conventional kilns, reducing energy consumption to 80-100 kWh per tonne of feed. This equates to a cost reduction of US$30 per tonne, or 5% of total production costs. Firebird entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Central South University to develop a processing method for Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate (LMFP) as a cathode active material (CAM). This further strengthens its LMFP strategy. Early-stage test work is set to begin at Firebird’s R&D centre in Jinshi, with initial results expected in Q1 2025. Firebird signed an agreement with the Karlka Nyiyaparli Aboriginal Corporation (KNAC) concerning Mining Lease 52/1086. This agreement covers key commercial considerations, including financial benefits upon production, as well as cultural heritage protection and environmental management. Oakover remains central to Firebird’s long-term strategy, providing ore for its battery-grade manganese sulphate plants. Key workstreams for the next 12 months will focus on environmental studies and securing necessary regulatory approvals. Firebird completed the farm-out of an 80% interest in its Direct Shipping Ore (DSO) Manganese Assets in Western Australia’s East Pilbara region to Macro Metals Limited (ASX: M4M). The agreement includes minimum expenditure commitments and drilling requirements, allowing Firebird to focus on its core manganese projects. As of December 31, 2024, Firebird held a cash position of A$3.1 million. The company also received A$889,546 through the Australian Government’s R&D Tax Incentive program, bolstering its financial reserves. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL, ETR:APC) reported quarterly earnings that topped Wall Street expectations on Thursday, with record revenue of $124.3 billion, despite a decline in iPhone sales in China. The company posted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.40, surpassing analysts' estimates of $2.35. Revenue rose 4% from the previous year, exceeding the $124.12 billion consensus forecast. However, iPhone sales dropped 11.1% in China during the key December quarter, highlighting concerns that Apple’s artificial intelligence push has yet to spark a new upgrade cycle for its flagship product. While the earnings beat provided some relief to investors, the report showed ongoing challenges in one of Apple's most critical markets. Apple shares were flat to slightly positive in after-hours trading."

Peninsula Energy Ltd expects to begin regulatory inspections and commissioning of the central processing plant (CPP) at the Lance Uranium Project in Wyoming, US, in the June quarter of 2025. The company also expects to begin production of the first dry yellowcake in the same quarter, once elution, precipitation and filtration circuits are sequentially commissioned in advance. Peninsula has previously forecast commissioning at the end of the March quarter, but challenging weather conditions and supply chain issues necessitated the re-schedule to later in the year, which may also affect production guidance for the calendar year. PEN says its board has been frustrated with the delay, working closely with contractors Samuel Engineering, Inc and Samuel EPC, LLC to conclude the project as quickly as possible. The company has been loading uranium onto resin for elution since December last year and will be looking into short term options to store the resin until the commissioning of the CPP is completed. As part of his planned on-boarding, newly appointed managing director George Bauk will be on site in Wyoming from Monday February 3 for an extended period to oversee the ongoing commissioning and ramp-up phase. The board believes it is likely that 2025 calendar year production guidance will need to be revised downward from previous forecasts of 600,000 pounds of uranium. With a cash balance of US$44.9 million at the end of last year, the company is well equipped to negotiate with providers of additional funding to decrease liquidity risk during the important commissioning and ramp-up phase over the course of CY2025.

Apple's China revenues fell 11% YoY. But contrary to what you may think; it does not spell weak demand in that region. In fact, China demand is stronger than expected. Product and iPhone sales have been stagnant for the past 3 years. The iPhone 16 Series launch missed estimates in the holiday season. But with a huge and still-growing installed base of products, AAPL is enjoying steady and robust double-digit growth in service revenues at double the gross margins vs. the product business."

With new CEO James McDonnell in place and FDA clearance for its Investigational New Drug application, 2025 could be a signpost year for Prescient Therapeutics as it continues to develop PTX-100. It was a big December quarter for the company after its IND application for the PTX-100 Phase 2 clinical trial in r/rCTCL was successfully cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), allowing for the study's immediate initiation Significant progress was also made in the clinical development of CellPryme and re-engineering of OmniCAR, with growing collaboration interest from channel and R&D partners. The company had a cash and term deposit balance of $8.4 million at December 31, with an additional $3.7 million R&D Tax Incentive Rebate received on January 10. Prescient received clearance from the FDA for its IND application, allowing the Phase 2 clinical trial of PTX-100 to proceed. PTX-100 is a first-in-class inhibitor targeting the RAS-family pathway, with the trial focusing on relapsed and refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (r/r CTCL). The IND clearance represents a key milestone for the company, enabling the formal initiation of the study. During the reporting period, Prescient dedicated significant resources to preparing the IND application, engaging clinical and industry experts to refine the study design, trial implementation strategy, and responses to FDA inquiries. The company is now moving forward with site selection, assessing clinical locations in Australia, the United States, and Europe, with up to 15 sites expected to be activated. Additionally, Prescient remains interested in exploring PTX-100's potential in Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) and is evaluating strategies to generate further clinical data in this patient population. What is PTX-100? PTX-100 is a first-in-class compound designed to inhibit geranylgeranyl transferase-1 (GGT-1), a key enzyme involved in cancer growth. By blocking GGT-1, PTX-100 disrupts oncogenic Ras pathways, preventing the activation of Rho, Rac, and Ral signalling circuits in cancer cells, ultimately inducing apoptosis. It is believed to be the only GGT-1 inhibitor currently in clinical development. The compound has demonstrated safety and early clinical activity in a previous Phase 1 study and a recent pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) basket study across hematological and solid malignancies. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted PTX-100 Orphan Drug Designation for all T-cell lymphomas and recently approved an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a Phase 2 study focusing on cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Prescient’s CellPryme platform continues to gain momentum in both preclinical and clinical development. During Q4 2024, the company presented data on cell therapy manufacturing and adjuvant enhancements at the CAR-TCR Summit in Boston and the American Society of Hematology conference in San Diego, generating increased interest in potential collaborations. Following these engagements, Prescient has initiated multiple partnerships involving CellPryme-M, working with potential collaborators to explore ways to enhance their cell therapy programs. The company intends to provide investors with updates on the progress of these partnerships as developments allow. Additionally, Prescient is in the early stages of evaluating first-in-human clinical trials for CellPryme-A. If initiated, these trials will investigate CellPryme-A’s potential in combination with CAR-T therapies. Meanwhile, significant progress has been made in OmniCAR development following extensive troubleshooting of technical challenges and the engineering of new, optimised molecular variants. With encouraging results achieved, Prescient will continue development efforts, with further validation work planned. What is CellPryme? CellPryme-M: Prescient’s CellPryme-M is a novel, clinic-ready technology designed to enhance adoptive cell therapy by shifting T cells towards a central memory phenotype. This improves persistence and increases the ability of cells to locate and penetrate tumours. The process is a non-disruptive, 24-hour step within cell manufacturing. Cell therapies requiring enhanced manufacturing productivity or increased in vivo potency and durability are well-suited for CellPryme-M. CellPryme-A: CellPryme-A is an adjuvant therapy administered alongside cellular immunotherapy to counteract the suppressive tumour microenvironment. It significantly reduces regulatory T cells, promotes CAR-T cell expansion in vivo, and enhances tumour penetration. These improvements result in better tumour cell killing and increased host survival. When used in combination with CellPryme-M pre-treated CAR-T cells, these benefits are further amplified. New CEO James McDonnell is a seasoned biopharmaceutical executive with over 25 years of experience in the global pharmaceutical industry, with a strong focus on blood disorders and haematological malignancies, including myeloma, myelodysplasia, and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). His strategic leadership has driven outstanding commercial success, underpinned by his ability to cultivate high-performing team cultures.

I maintain a hold rating on Apple due to its high valuation and limited near-term growth prospects despite solid recent earnings. Apple's iPhone revenue struggles in China and wearables show softness, but potential improvements in AI and the upcoming iPhone 17 could boost growth. Technically, Apple's stock is solid, with strong support at $220, but the upside may be capped at $300 without substantial growth catalysts."

94 year old Warren Buffett, born during the Great Depression, has a net worth of $147 billion, which has risen to just over $4 billion this year. Most is because of the success of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B). That is the flagship of his wealth, which he created in 1970. A proof of the magnitude of his success is that $10,000 put into Berkshire 30 years ago would be worth $682,000 today. The stock is up 3% this year. Its current market cap is just above $1 trillion Buffett’s investment policy is not complex. He primarily buys public companies with strong brands that he thinks are undervalued. He has been a long term holder of Coda-Cola (NYSE: KO), and, until recently, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). Occasionally, for reasons he rarely discloses, he does not hold for decades. One example is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). He first bought the stock in 2016, and soured on the stock recently. Buffett will sometimes buy public companies and take them private. He bought railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe in 2010. He did the same with insurance company Geico in 1995. When the Geico deal closed, he commented, “It’s the low-cost operator in a field that is very big, and the low-cost operator tends to win over time.” Buffett has also bought some odd ball companies. He bought Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1983 for $60 million. He bought the TV station WPLG in 2014. The station is based in Miami. Buffett favors insurance companies, He owns Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, National Indemnity Company, Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance, which focuses on business and commercial insurance. Describing these investments he said, “It’s so much fun because you get the money at the start, you know, and then you find out whether you’ve done something stupid later on.” What Buffett observers cannot figure out is why Berkshire is holding $325 billion in cash. A Bloomberg reporter wrote that it means he is worried about a large market downturn. Or, maybe he is just looking for something to buy.

For income investors, closed-end funds remain an attractive investment class that covers various asset classes and promises high distributions and reasonable total returns. Closed-end funds, or CEFs, are generally characterized by higher volatility and deeper drawdowns than the broader market. For these reasons, they are not suited for everyone. In this monthly series, we highlight five CEFs with solid track records that pay high distributions and offer ""excess"" discounts. We try to separate the wheat from the chaff using our filtering process to select just five CEFs every month from around 500closed-end funds."

While the love of family goes both ways, as parents will do anything to ensure their children are not hurt, the reverse is equally true. There is no question that any child watching their parent struggle will feel compelled to do everything they can to help out someone who has done everything for them. Key Points This is a very unfortunate situation where a child is watching their father get repeatedly scammed. The hope is that the father can be reasoned with before he gets pulled into any more traps. There is only so many times family should lend him money before cutting him off entirely. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) In the case of one Redditor, there is an awful feeling watching as their father got scammed out of his entire 401(k) and savings and is now drowning in debt. While this wound might be self-inflicted, there is no question that the child is hurting, watching a person they love struggle more and more. It’s hard to be in a position where you want to help but aren’t sure if you should, financially, mentally, or a combination of both, as there are no easy answers sometimes. The Heartbreak Unfortunately, the Redditor mentions in a post in r/personalfinance that the father got scammed out of his 401(k) and savings account, leaving himself with around $30,000 in debt that is looking to be consolidated. The good news is that the dad’s wife makes around $90,000 annually and has a substantial $500,000 bank account. Sadly, things went from bad to worse when the father tried to get back on his feet last week, only to realize that a new job opportunity was also a scam. This is a sad story as the couple pays $3,500 for a three-bedroom apartment, which is only likely to last around six years based on their current spending and savings. The original poster seeks advice and help to steer the father’s ship in the right direction and feels lost trying to do so. It doesn’t help that in the comments, the Redditor highlights that the father is resisting any ideas of downsizing to something more affordable, indicating that they “need” three bedrooms. Worse, his new job required him to spend additional money on a credit card, which his father doesn’t have the money to pay off. Again, this situation keeps going from bad to worse. The Scam We’re a bit light on details, but the father got into a situation on Instagram where he fell into a trap by sending a crypto influencer all of his money to invest. Of course, the investment opportunity wasn’t legit, and poof, the money is gone. This past week, he’s fallen into two more traps, with one job convincing him to buy $14,000 worth of Apple products and send them to Texas. He believes this company will reimburse him, but Chase Bank locked his credit card, and now he can’t even buy the essentials. Unfortunately, we have a father here who doesn’t know where to stop and is looking for the next great opportunity using hopes and dreams instead of their brain. Can He Rebuild? In this situation, when the father asks his children and his own brother for loans and money that he promises to pay back, it’s questionable whether anyone will ever see money again. The bottom line is that to rebuild, the father needs a serious reality check and a wake-up call of just how bad their situation is. It’s pretty clear the father is at rock bottom, but somehow manages to keep sinking even worse. The only hope for rebuilding is to get out of this cycle of scams and find a real job with real benefits and at least some job security. If this means swallowing pride and going to work at a gas station, grocery store, or somewhere else that can get him going on the right path, then so be it. The family needs to have an intervention and put everything on the table so there are no secrets between any family members. It seems like the only way to get back on track is to break everything down as much as possible and see if the father can be reasoned with. Lastly, if he keeps asking for money and someone wants to help, only do so by paying the bills directly. However, if the father refuses to see the error of his ways, he will likely lose his money and his family, including his wife.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Trade Deals 3:06 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly revealed that the U.S. has secured one trade deal, keeping most of the details close to the vest except to say that the White House is awaiting a green light from some unnamed country. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 300 points in response for a 0.84% gain, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are holding similar gains. Narrow Range 12:34 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are managing slight gains across the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average despite the absence of greater details on any global trade deals. Of the S&amp;P 500, Baird investment strategist Ross Mayfield is cited by CNBC as saying, “I think [stocks are] probably trapped in a in a pretty tight range here,&#8221; pointing to a range of 5,100-5,700. “I think we can bounce around there for quite a while in kind of some volatile, choppy trading. Until we get some resolution on the trade front, I don’t think much else matters,&#8221; he added. Consumer Weakness 11:03 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market averages are currently all moving higher despite some weaker than anticipated economic data. The U.S. consumer has long been credited with upholding the economy throughout the one-two punch of inflation and higher interest rates. Now the tariffs could be the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back, as consumer confidence shows signs of waning. The Consumer Confidence Index published by the Conference Board sank to a reading of 86 in April, a drop of nearly 8 points from the prior month and below economist estimates calling for 87.7. A separate index that reflects consumer sentiment over the next six months fell by a steep 12.5 points to a reading of 54.4, its worst level in over a decade. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that March job postings dropped to their lowest level in about six months. Tariffs, Earnings and Tech 10:00 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets continue to trade mixed this morning on tariff deal ambiguity as Q1 earnings results pour in. Stocks are weighing earnings results and a lack of certainty on the tariff deal front while tensions have emerged between Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and the White House over tariff-related costs. Magnificent Seven stocks are mixed, with Amazon and Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) trading in the red while Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) benefits from a Wall Street endorsement. Hims &amp; Hers HEalth (Nasdaq: HIMS) is soaring by 24% today on news of a deal to sell weight loss drug phenom Wegovy on its e-commerce platform. The markets are holding out for more tariff deal progress, digging in their heels and nearly standing still in the meantime. The three major stock market averages are moving fractionally in either direction, with the Nasdaq Composite posting slight declines alongside the S&amp;P 500 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is eking out modest gains. Sectors of the economy are evenly split between red and green, with real estate moving higher and consumer discretionary stocks headed lower. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is getting some unwanted attention after the White House took aim at the tech giant, calling its reported plans to list tariff cost impacts on its site as a &#8220;hostile and political act.&#8221; Big 3 automaker General Motors (NYSE: GM) reported better-than-expected quarterly results while reassessing its full-year outlook, sending the stock lower by 1.5%. GM and the auto sector have targets on their backs at the height of the tariff wars, in response to which the former Dow component has suspended all share buyback programs. The White House has affirmed its plans to provide tariff relief to the auto sector. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 138.11 (+0.36%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 67.15 (-0.40%) S&amp;P 500: Down 10.23 (-0.19%) Earnings &amp; Analyst Calls Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) surpassed Q1 expectations on the top and bottom lines and is keeping its full-year guidance intact amid expectations that it will be able to manage any tariff-related fallout, including rising aluminum costs. Rival company PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) recently lowered its earnings forecast due to the tariff impact. Evercore ISI has reiterated its &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock with a $250 price target, suggesting the company&#8217;s strategies should help it to offset any impact from the tariff frenzy. Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), saying that the China tariff uncertainties notwithstanding, the AI leader&#8217;s strong market relationships give the stock a place in the analyst firm&#8217;s top large cap pick universe. UBS has reiterated its &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) but lowered the price target to $253 from $272, owing to what it described as &#8220;potential demand destruction.&#8221; The post Live Nasdaq Composite: Markets Stand Still on Tariff and Tech Tussle appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

[00:00:10] Doug McIntyre: And, Charlie Munger was on there giving dishing out advice. Warren Buffett&#8217;s partner, who&#8217;s I think been probably dead a year. but everybody in the industry has a favorite Charlie Munger quote or Warren Buffett quote. what are some of the Buffett quotes that you love? [00:00:29] Lee Jackson: Well, one of the favorite, and we often, include this when we write on Buffett, is his favorite holding time for an S&amp;P 500 stock is forever. [00:00:41] Lee Jackson: And as you and I both know, that&#8217;s the case with names that he&#8217;s had like Coca-Cola. And somebody American Express that he&#8217;s had for 10, 15, 20 years. And I always thought that was a great quote. My, my favorite holding time is forever. And I think one of the most interesting quotes recently, and he kind of stayed out. [00:01:04] Lee Jackson: He says even though he kind of tends to vote Democrat, he stays outta the political fray for the most part. But he started talking about tariffs, and he was basically getting into the whole point of tariffs are basically attacked and they&#8217;re just attacks on goods. And the quote that I loved when he goes the tooth fairy isn&#8217;t gonna pay that tax. [00:01:29] Lee Jackson: And I&#8217;m like, okay, probably not. But, when you have a guy like that who&#8217;s so widely followed and so widely recognized, as likely the greatest investor of the last 50 or 60 years, he is gonna be a quotable guy. We&#8217;ve constantly written about him. And the interesting thing for our viewers and of course our 24 7 readers, is that even though the markets have come back some from the lows, Berkshire Hathaway has been up all year long. And even when the markets were down at bare lows, 20% lows, it was still up 9% for the year. So, yeah, I think the best holding time is forever for an S&amp;P 500 stock. [00:02:15] Doug McIntyre: Well, one of the reasons I love that quote is. It&#8217;s because he likes stocks with a moats. There&#8217;s, when he goes into one of these stocks, I think the first thing he looks at, other than obviously earnings, is how hard is it for somebody else to get into this business? Right? Do you want try to compete with Coke from scratch? [00:02:38] Doug McIntyre: Impossible, absolutely impossible. American from scratch. A big oil company from scratch. Impossible. He held, he still holds Apple, but I mean, he bought a whole bunch of it. You wanna try to compete with Apple from scratch. He loves these companies where he knows that the chances that somebody can come in and compete with directly with him is very low. [00:03:04] Doug McIntyre: I mean, he&#8217;s in the railroad business. It used to be public now, he just decided he is gonna take the whole thing private. But it&#8217;s the same philosophy. Do you wanna try to compete with, are you gonna build the tracks, buy the engines, hire the answer is no. So my favorite Buffett quote, and I won&#8217;t get this exactly right, is every two years he sends out the managers of all of his companies a letter, and he says, it&#8217;s okay if you lose money. [00:03:33] Doug McIntyre: We can afford to lose money. Obviously I don&#8217;t want you to lose it forever. but we can&#8217;t afford to lose a shred of reputation. He said, I absolutely money that&#8217;s fixable. But the day, and he said, I wanna make sure that a fair but unfriendly reporter can do a story about us on the front of the Wall Street Journal and our reputation will be intact. [00:03:59] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. That&#8217;s another thing Buffett understands is that, and one of the great examples is Johnson and Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), when there was that scare about Advil. Right. Okay. That was a long time ago, but you remember, Burke, who was the CEO then took every single bottle off every single shelf of cattle in the country. [00:04:22] Doug McIntyre: And you talk about reputation protection, and I mean, that&#8217;s one of Buffett&#8217;s philosophies is its reputation. [00:04:31] Lee Jackson: Well, and I think, are you sure you don&#8217;t mean the Tylenol scare? Was it Tylenol or Advil? Tylenol. It was Tylenol, and at first you&#8217;re right about Advil, they did pull that a few years back on concerns over liver toxicity. [00:04:47] Lee Jackson: But the one you remember is when J&amp;J, Tylenol&#8217;s owned now by Kenvue, which was the spinoff in 23 from J&amp;J. But when that all happened, and gosh, that&#8217;s been 30, 40 years ago. Yeah, it was in the eighties, I think. But you&#8217;re right, they took every single bottle of Tylenol and it was all taken off the market because people died. And, yeah, that&#8217;s the way you save your rep. [00:05:16] Lee Jackson: And not that Johnson and Johnson hasn&#8217;t had enough issues with the baby powder and the talcum powder and all that stuff. They&#8217;re fixing to have to, they&#8217;re trying to get that settled out. [00:05:26] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. Anyway, Buffett number one, hold my stocks forever. Number two, reputation, [00:05:34] Lee Jackson: And number three, tariffs are nothing more than a tax, and they&#8217;re not paid for by the tooth fairy. [00:05:40] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. And the tax thing is absolutely right. The post Warren Buffett Sees Right Through Trump&#8217;s Tariffs appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Jensen Huang, who arguably runs the world&#8217;s most successful company, made only $1.5 million last year, according to the Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) proxy (PRE 14A). That is up $1 million from the year before. That pay was so low because most of his compensation comes from stock awards and “nonincentive compensation,” which can vary. In other words, the $1.5 million was all he could count on. It was his first base salary increase in a decade. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Last year, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) Jensen Huang had his first base salary increase in a decade. Low compensation is not usually for CEOs who run the world’s most valuable companies. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Huang has a net worth of $98 billion, which makes him the 17th richest person in the world. Nvidia’s stock is down this year, so that figure has dropped $16 billion since January 1. Nvidia is the third most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $2.7 trillion. The stock has dropped 17% so far this year. Most of Huang’s compensation for the recently reported year came from a stock award of $38 million. The problem with that award is that, if Nvidia’s stock drops, that sum could go down as well. Huang owns 3.5% of the company he founded in 1993. He turned it from a graphic chip company into the largest artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world. Huang’s low compensation is not usually for CEOs who run the world’s most valuable companies. Warren Buffett’s cash compensation last year was only $100,000. Because of his ownership in Berkshire Hathaway, his net worth is $166 billion, which makes him the sixth richest person in the world. From 1997 to 2011 when Steve Jobs retired as Apple’s CEO, his base cash compensation was only $1. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO today, had a base cash salary of $3 million last year. The low base salaries of highly successful CEOs are hard to explain. Do they tell investors that their pay is tied almost completely to performance? Or are they saying that to their employees? Huang and his board did not say.

Apple announced a new $100B stock buyback authorization which was less than last year. However, it ensures a steady pace of stock buybacks throughout the year. Apple's gross margins are growing and the high-margin Services  segment now represents 28% of consolidated revenue."

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Ford in Focus 3:55 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets finished the day the way that it started &#8211; lower -putting an end to a multi-day winning streak. Now the markets are gearing up to process quarterly earnings results from Ford (NYSE: F), whose stock fell 1.2% during regular market hours. Automakers have had a target on their backs for tariffs, and the markets will be looking for greater clarity on any impacts in Ford&#8217;s performance. Here&#8217;s how the major indices finished the day: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 69.52 (-0.17%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 132.40 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 36.79 (-0.66%) America First Economy 12:38 pm by Gerelyn Terzo U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is speaking at the Milken conference today, addressing global investors about President Trump&#8217;s economic agenda. As part of his America First vision, President Trump is looking to make the U.S. economy more appealing to investors amid a strategy involving tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation &#8211; oh my. While the markets await further details on trade talk progress, the three major stock market averages are mixed, including a slight gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain lower. Tariff Uncertainty Remains 11:36 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Dow Jones Industrial Average has turned higher, managing a 7-point gain after starting the session in the red. Meanwhile, technology stocks continue to weigh on the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. According to TD Cowen, tariff-related price hikes are set to rear their heads in May&#8217;s inflation print. Much of the tariff damage will unfold in the summer months as lower-priced inventories dwindle at businesses. The firm says consumers are between a rock and a hard place as tariff-related costs trickle down to them, a situation exacerbated by higher shipping costs. Selling Eases 10:04 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets remain under pressure this morning but are off their lowest levels of the session. Netflix (Nasdaq; NFLX) shares are off about 2% on the day after last week&#8217;s rally. ON Semi (Nasdaq: ON) is falling 8% on the day after reporting its Q1 results, while industry peer Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD) is gaining 2%. Here&#8217;s a look at where things stand with the broader market averages: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 53.67 (-0.16%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 97.38 (-0.55%) S&amp;P 500: Down 30.46 (-0.52%) After a week of gains, fear has settled into the markets once again amid a bevy of catalysts. In addition to earnings, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell set to comment on the economy this week, suggesting it could be yet another roller coaster ride for investors. First-quarter earnings season continues to roll on, with names like Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) as well as Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Diamondback Energy (Nasdaq: FANG) on the docket in the coming days. All three of the major stock market averages are trading in the red out of the gate, including a 1% decline in the Nasdaq Composite. Mag Seven stocks are mixed while the sell-off continues to unfold in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) shares, with a 2% decline today. All sectors of the economy are currently lower, the most severe of which is happening in energy stocks, which are down 2% this morning as the oil price continues its descent. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) has reached the end of an era now that billionaire Warren Buffett announced his retirement after six decades at the helm. With $300 million in cash on the sidelines, BRK-B is losing 6% on the day for a market cap of $1.09 trillion. Greg Abel will succeed Buffett at year-end 2025. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 196.82 (-0.49%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 175.23 (-1.03%) S&amp;P 500: Down 52.04 (-0.88%) Market Movers Footwear company Skechers (NYSE: SKX) is going private, agreeing to a private equity takeover by 3G Capital in a deal that values the company at $63 per share, sending the stock higher by a double-digit percentage today. Jefferies has reiterated its &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), suggesting the valuation has already given the stock the benefit of the doubt in areas like tech innovation and scalability. Mizuho analysts like Bloom Energy (NYSE: BE), upgrading shares to an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating from &#8220;neutral&#8221; on an attractive risk/reward profile. The stock is up 3.5% today.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Pivot to Ford Earnings 4:03 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets failed to turn around, ending the trading session lower across the board and ending a multi-session winning streak. Stocks are awaiting further details on trade deals, which the White House has revealed could come as soon as this week, which would not be soon enough for the markets. Ford (NYSE: F) stock fell just over 1% on the day ahead of the automaker&#8217;s quarterly results after the closing bell today. When fellow automaker General Motors (NYSE: GM) reported its quarterly results last month, the company withdrew its profit guidance due to tariff uncertainty. Here&#8217;s how the major indices finished the trading day: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 69.52 (-0.17%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 132.40 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 36.79 (-0.66%) Economic Uncertainty 12:32 pm by Gerelyn Terzo U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is making the rounds, speaking to global investors today about President Trump&#8217;s economic plan. He pointed to a three-pronged approach, including tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation. Bessent&#8217;s remarks failed to provide any greater clarity on the status of tariff negotiations with key U.S. trade partners, leaving the markets at a standstill. The three major stock market averages remain mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average moving higher while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite remain lower. Winners and Losers 10:43 am by Gerelyn Terzo Airline stock Delta (NYSE: DAL) is gaining 3% on the day, while United Airlines (Nasdaq: UAL) is tacking on 2.7%. EQT (NYSE: EQT) is advancing by 2.9% on the day on the heels of a dividend announcement. Ralph Lauren (NYSE: RL) is up 2.8%. Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN) is losing 9.6% today on a quarterly revenue miss. Zimmer Biomet (NYSE: ZBH) is also down 9%. In what is proving to be a volatile session on Wall Street, the markets have come off their lows of the session. The markets are coming off the heels of a nine-day winning streak and have come out of the gate with plenty of headlines to process, chief among which has been the announced retirement of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett. Wall Street firm TD Cowen has issued a report suggesting that price increases from tariffs will be reflected in May&#8217;s inflation data. The Federal Reserve gathers this week to determine the near-term outlook on interest rates while the markets will also be paying close attention to the tone in comments from Chairman Jerome Powell. First-quarter earnings continues to unfold as names like Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR), Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and Diamondback Energy (Nasdaq: FANG) take the spotlight. Mag Seven stocks are a mixed bag as shares of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) extend their losses with a 2% decline today. Sectors of the economy were originally all lower but industrials and telecom stocks have since made their way into the green. Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) shares are lower after President Trump tossed in fresh tariffs on foreign-made films. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 50.53 (-0.12%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 133.34 (-0.74%) S&amp;P 500: Down 32.82 (-0.58%) Market Movers Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) is down 6% but maintains a $1.1 trillion market cap as Buffett prepares to pass the reins to his successor Greg Abel at the end of the year. Footwear stock Skechers (NYSE: SKX) has decided to leave the publicly traded markets behind and has accepted a private equity takeover by 3G Capital for $63 per share, sending the stock higher by 25% percentage today. Jefferies maintains a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA), suggesting the valuation has already given the stock the benefit of the doubt in areas like tech innovation and scalability.

Dividend stock investing offers a reliable path to passive income and long-term wealth creation, making it a cornerstone for many portfolios. By owning shares in companies that pay regular dividends, investors gain consistent cash flow, often from stable, high-quality firms like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Dividends provide a hedge against market volatility, as payouts persist even during downturns, and reinvesting them can compound returns significantly over time. Moreover, dividend-paying stocks historically outperform non-dividend peers, with lower volatility. 24/7 Wall St. Insights: Dividend stock investing has proven a reliable path for investors to gather immense wealth over time. Dividend ETFs bolster those results by investing in hundreds of dividend-paying stocks, offering instant diversification and minimizing single-stock risk. Sit back and let dividends do the heavy lifting for a simple, steady path to serious wealth creation over time. Grab a free copy of “2 Legendary High-Yield Dividend Stocks“ now.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended The Magnificent 7 Could See Even More Upside 11:38 am While today’s 1,000-point Dow rally has been impressive, similar days may be ahead. When the U.S. and China meet again in the next few weeks, they’ll work out a bigger agreement on trade. While nothing has been set in stone with that just yet, markets are still celebrating today’s trade breakthrough. Here’s where that currently stands. Under the 90-day pause, both countries lowered tariffs by 115 percentage points to 10%. The 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remains in place, so most Chinese goods face a 30% rate in total, down from 145% previously, as noted by CNBC. The Magnificent 7 Are Just Starting to Rally Back 10:50 am As of May, the Magnificent 7 lost about $6 trillion in value since their peak in late 2024. Also, at its trough, the Roundhill BIG Tech ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS) – which tracks the Magnificent 7 plummeted from about $56 to a low of $39. However, thanks to the latest U.S.-China news, the ETF is quickly rebounding higher. Making the Mag 7 even more attractive, analysts believe they can easily beat the S&amp;P 500 in earnings this year. Plus, with valuations off their 2024 peaks, investors are coming back to the table to feast. The U.S. and China have finally agreed to a temporary – but significant easing of tariffs. In fact, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. tariffs on China will drop 115 percentage points to 30%. China’s levies on U.S. imports will drop to 10%. More information on specifics can be found in the Joint Statement on U.S. China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva at WhiteHouse.gov. As a result of the agreement, the Dow Jones is up about 1,050 points. The NASDAQ is up 663, as the S&amp;P 500 adds 156 points. Even better, it’s boosting the Magnificent 7 stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is up 5.6%, or $11.25. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up 1%, or by $4.80. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) is up about 3%, or by $4.71. com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is up 7.4% or by $14.55. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up 4%, or by $4.80. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) I up 6.5%, or by $38.73. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is up 7%, or by $21.23.

(sponsored) The paper reports, “New iPhones set to be released in the fall include some design and format changes, including an ultrathin design.” Samsung has just released an ultrathin phone called the S25 Edge. Samsung management hopes the product will chip away at Apple’s market share. Apple management cannot hide that tariffs are a financial problem. In March, Apple raced to get more iPhone inventory to the United States to avoid tariffs that would start in April. CEO Tim Cook also said Apple would move most of its manufacturing to India. However, he cannot solve the problem of more expensive models that the company still makes in China. Apple says that tariff costs will hit it with $900 million in expenses in the current quarter. Apple’s dilemma is whether customers will pay more for iPhones. The iPhone 16 Pro Max retails for $1,199, but it is trying to keep customers with the much less expensive iPhone 16e, which retails for $599. Apple has two hurdles, one of which is old. iPhone upgrades have been modest when the company has released the most frequent models, which it does once a year. The camera is better, and the chips are faster. Many customers cannot tell the difference or do not care. Apple’s second problem is more recent. Its AI product is considered weak compared to other large tech companies. It has delayed the release of its Siri AI upgrade until next year. At the same time, the competition continues to release more advanced products. New York Times’s Kevin Roose recently wrote, “Apple is not meeting the moment in AI.” In the meantime, users can easily download every major AI app onto an iPhone. If Apple wants to raise iPhone prices, it will need more than a better camera. Why Is No One Talking About Apple’s Long-Term Artificial Intelligence Plans?

A perfect storm of the greatest financial opportunities of our lifetimes may be before us, with unprecedented amounts of foreign capital, 18 trade deals in the final stages of negotiation, and upcoming tax cuts. Nearly $3 trillion of investment commitments in AI have been announced, which span a period of years. Oracle, NVIDIA, and Apple are major players, along with the UAE, Open AI, and Softbank.Risk is present from China producing less expensive or more powerful chips, or imposing trade restrictions that could greatly impact our tech companies. However, the US is striving to be the dominant world leader of AI, for which It does not take a genius to consider long term holds for Oracle, NVIDIA, and Apple. In the last 5 weeks NVIDIA has risen 23.6%, up from a low of 94, to 116. However, that is well under their 2025 highpoint of 149. Similarly, the 2025 high of Oracle was 186, but currently is 150, while Apple has dropped 61 points since the day after Christmas, and is now 198, down 23.5%. Although we may see some significant volatility with trade negotiations in the short term, for the coming years, I would expect the large domestic investments made by these key tech companies to produce excellent returns. Also, Taiwan Semiconductors is investing $100 billion for producing their chips here, and that stock is down over 21% in the last 2 ½ months. Likely this would also be a very good hold.What do AI data centers need? Electricity! By 2030, AI data centers are estimated to require 9% of total electricity usage in the United States, with overall demand for electricity projected to increase by 16%. AI data centers are planned for Texas, Louisiana, Ohio, North Carolina, and other areas, for which one might look at providers of electricity in those states. Oncor, that is owned by Sempra, is a major servicer of Texas. The parent company is one of the largest utility holding companies in the US, with current pricing of $75 per share, which is down from $87 in early January, and is paying a dividend of 3.4%. American Electric Power (AEP) is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, for which that stock is up almost 14% this year, and paying a current dividend yield of 3.54%. AEP exceeded analyst expectations of earnings per share by 8.1%, while Ohio is experiencing growth with favorable tax legislation. Several AI data centers are planned for south Florida, while Florida has experienced tremendous population growth, gaining nearly 2 million more residents since 2019. When speaking of electricity to power Florida, one might consider investments in Nexterra, that owns Florida Power and Light, the largest utility in the state, and has a dividend yield of 3.22%. I also am an advocate for Duke Energy, which is held by numerous pension funds. Duke is one of the three great universities of Research Triangle Park, along with the University of North Carolina and North Carolina State. This area of the country has one of the highest concentrations of PhD’s, for which Apple and others are investing in data centers in North Carolina. Duke Energy is up about 12% in 2025, which is excellent for a bit over 4 months, and has a dividend yield of 3.47%.An additional component for not only the construction of AI data centers, but for the expansion of many industries that will benefit from the huge investments being made in the US, is&#8230; infrastructure! This leads one to ETFs for materials. One might take a look at XLB, Vanguard Materials (VAW), and Invesco (PYZ).What is driving both foreign and domestic investment in the US, is the likely legislation of tax cuts, combined with no tariffs for producing goods in the United States. This is a one-two punch for an economic stimulus, along with 18 trade deals being in the stages of final negotiation, which hopefully will dramatically increase US production and exports.This is the first in a series of articles to capitalize on the trillions of dollars of investment commitments that have been announced in recent weeks, along with a multitude of trade deals and tax cut legislation that should be forthcoming. The phrase that comes to mind is that the best time is… NOW!I encourage the reader to do their own research, and to consult with a competent investment advisor.

The central bank is widely expected to leave interest rates as is. However, investors will be looking for an indication of a potential rate cut by September. Defense Stocks are Rallying on the US-EU Trade Deal Defense stocks are also gaining momentum after the US-EU trade deal. As part of that deal, President Trump said the EU would be “purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment,” as quoted by CNBC.

Nasdaq could easily see higher highs 9:13 am With excitement over a trade deal with the US-EU, and hopefully with China, the Nasdaq could see higher highs. Helping, we&#8217;ll soon see major earnings from some of the top Magnificent 7 stocks, and hopeful hints of a potential interest rate cut by September&#8217;s Fed meeting. Stay tuned for more. Nasdaq futures are up about 108 points to 23,599 at the moment. If it can open at that level, that’ll put the tech-heavy index at new all-time highs. According to CNBC, “The moves come after the broad market index and the Nasdaq hit new all-time and closing highs during Monday’s trading session, just barely seeing gains. It was the 15th record close for the broad market index in 2025.” Fueling momentum, tech giants like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) soared by about $7.19 a share yesterday.

Friday will also be an important day, with the release of non-farm payroll numbers.

Analysts at Oppenheimer just reiterated a Perform rating on Apple ahead of earnings, noting, “We take a neutral view into AAPL’s F3Q25 earnings. We expect investors to focus on the revenue outlook for F4Q25 after normalizing the potential FX tailwind, Services revenue growth, and the sales trend in Greater China.” Citi analysts reiterated a buy rating on Coinbase, with a price target of $505 from $270. The firm noted the company has seen several catalysts recently. That includes the GENIUS Act, the House passage of the CLARITY Act, and its addition to the S&amp;P 500 index. Bank of America also reiterated a buy rating on Roblox, with a price target of $133. The firm sees an “extended runway for mid-20% growth as users worldwide adopt Roblox’s Metaverse, in a virtuous cycle that will draw developers, brands, and merchants to the platform,” as also quoted by CNBC.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended 80% of Major AI Companies are Cloudflare Customers 5:52 pm That&#8217;s something CEO Matthew Prince just noted on today&#8217;s conference call. First Analyst Quote... 5:26 pm &#8220;Congratulations on a really solid quarter. Definitely it looks like the engine is back to running full speed here.&#8221; The key theme around Cloudflare&#8217;s earnings is whether Wall Street believes a significant reacceleration is happening. Quotes like this are extremely bullish. More from CEO Matthew Prince 5:18 pm &#8220;Our dollar-based net retention was 114% in up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our gross margin was 76.3%, in line with our long-term target range of 75% to 77%. We delivered an operating profit of $72.3 million, representing an operating margin of 14.1% and we generated strong free cash flow of $33.3 million during the quarter, again exceeding expectations. Cloudflare keeps innovating faster than ever and customers are voting with their wallets, you can see that in the momentum from our Q2 results. It&#8217;s not just interest, it&#8217;s real investments that drove record ACV bookings in the quarter.&#8221; Cloudflare&#039;s Earnings Call 5:08 pm &#8220;We had an excellent quarter. We crossed $2 billion in annual run rate revenue, achieving $512.3 million of revenue in the quarter. We started the year detailing our strategy to drive reaccelerating growth. Our Q2 results highlight that this formula is working and mark a key inflection point for the company, with revenue growing 28% year-over-year, up from 26.5% in the first quarter. We now have 3,712 customers paying us more than $100,000 per year, a 22% increase year-over-year. Revenue contribution from these large customers grew at 35% year-over-year, contributing to 71% of revenue during the quarter, up from 67% in the second quarter last year. &#8221; &#8211; Matthew Prince That&#8217;s the key idea &#8211; is Cloudflare at an inflection point? Our bet is that it is. If growth keeps scaling past 30%, even with a sky high valuation, its likely Cloudflare shares will soar in the years ahead. Conference Call Coming Soon 4:50 pm Cloudflare&#8217;s conference call is coming soon. We&#8217;ll post highlights. To receive them: simply leave this blog open and an update will post after we&#8217;ve been able to listen in. Here&#039;s What&#039;s Happening After Hours 4:43 pm Apple: Up 2.2% Amazon: Down 3.1% Cloudflare: Up 5.5% Roku: Up 2% Reddit: Up 20.5% Executive Quotes 4:35 pm &#8220;We kicked off 2025 with confidence, momentum, and strong results. In Q1, we landed the largest contract in Cloudflare’s history, a more than $100 million deal driven by our Workers developer platform, and signed the longest-term SASE contract to date.&#8221; Matthew Prince &#8220;We have the scale, the technology, and the team to capture the massive opportunity ahead of us—as evidenced by the size and the length of the deals we’re closing and the caliber of customers betting on Cloudflare.&#8221; Matthew Prince &#8220;In a constantly changing world, one thing’s for certain: innovation wins. From networking, to security, to AI, Cloudflare is the envy of the industry for innovation, and there&#8217;s no slowing down.&#8221; Matthew Prince Cloudflare Now Up 7% 4:27 pm We&#8217;ll see if commentary on Cloudflare&#8217;s earnings moves the stock more, but for now gains have settled in at around 7%. Beat and Raise 4:25 pm Next quarter Cloudflare posted guidance of $543.5 to $544.5M, that&#8217;s above expectations. More Details... 4:23 pm NET | Cloudflare Q2&#8217;25 Earnings Highlights: Adj. EPS: $0.21 []; UP +5% YoY Revenue: $512.3B []; UP +28% YoY Adj. Gross Margin: 76.3% []; DOWN -270 bps YoY Net Income: -$50.4M []; DOWN -234% YoY Free Cash Flow: $33.3M; DOWN -13% YoY Outlook: Revenue: $543.5 to $544.5M [] Cloudflare expects continued strong demand, driven by larger and longer-term contracts with key customers. The company is focused on innovation and expanding its product offerings to capture more market share. Q2 Segment Performance: Revenue from Core Services: $512.3M []; UP +28% YoY Other Key Q2 Metrics: Adj. Operating Income: $72.3M []; UP +27% YoY Adj. Operating Expenses: $450.9M []; UP +30% YoY Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Available-for-Sale Securities: $3,959.7M Effective Tax Rate: 6.7% (vs. 8.0% YoY) CEO Commentary: Matthew Prince: &#8220;We had an excellent second quarter, exceeding $2 billion in annualized revenue while also reaccelerating revenue growth to 28% year-over-year. We’re innovating faster than ever, and demand remains strong, as our largest customers grow their investments with Cloudflare at the highest levels we’ve seen since 2022. While we’ve continued to sign even bigger and longer deals, some of our most strategic wins have been centered around our work to help invent the new business model for content creators on the AI-driven Internet. Sitting in front of more than 20% of all websites—with more than half of our dynamic traffic flowing through APIs—Cloudflare is uniquely positioned to enable the agentic web of the future. We are firing on all cylinders, with the right technology, strategy, and team to accelerate the next phase of growth for Cloudflare and for the Internet at-large.” Strategic Updates: Cloudflare is focusing on expanding its product offerings and enhancing its technology to better serve its customers and capture new market opportunities. We Have Lift Off 4:18 pm Cloudflare shares are now up 6% The Headline Numbers 4:17 pm Revenue: $512.3M VS $501M Estimate EPS: $0.21 VS $0.18 Estimate Earnings Are Out - Shares up 3.5% upon initial release 4:15 pm Cloudflare earnings just dropped. Initially the stock dropped, and then immediately flipped positive. We&#8217;re going ot post live news and analysis. Here We Go 4:01 pm We&#8217;re watching for Cloudflare&#8217;s earnings &#8211; they should be out any minute. 20 Minutes to the Closing Bell 3:40 pm We&#8217;re just 20 minutes from the closing bell. Most stocks are in the red today with S&amp;P 500 down .2% and the Dow Jones dropping .54%. Yet, stocks closely aligned with the AI trade have held onto gains. Microsoft&#8217;s stunning Azure numbers yesterday have helped Cloudflare shares trade sharply positive. The company is up 3.5% in late trading. As we&#8217;ve noted throughout this blog, without a beat and raise, Cloudflare shares will likely be down tomorrow. Is NET Overheated? 1:37 pm Cloudflare closed at $200.85 on Tuesday — up more than 75% since May 1. That rally reflects bullish sentiment around its AI platform, SASE expansion, and large enterprise wins. But with valuation stretched, the market is now pricing in not just strong Q2 execution, but raised full-year guidance. Anything short of an outlook above $2.1B could lead to a fade — especially with tech volatility picking up. The setup demands strength on both topline and forward commentary. Another “beat and reiterate” might not be enough to get the stock ripping higher. How Cloudflare Stock Performed After Recent Earnings 12:26 pm Cloudflare has steadily delivered modest EPS beats, but stock reactions have varied — with the strongest gains following Q3 2024. Investors are highly tuned to forward guidance and AI-driven revenue opportunities. Quarter EPS Surprise 1-Day Move 7-Day Move 14-Day Move Q1 2025 +4.41% +1.2% +2.8% +4.5% Q4 2024 –2.10% –0.6% –1.3% –0.9% Q3 2024 +6.77% +3.5% +5.2% +6.1% Q2 2024 +1.25% –0.4% +0.9% +1.6% What Wall Street Expects When Cloudflare Reports Today 10:14 am Here&#8217;s Wall Street&#8217;s consensus expectations for Q2 earnings. Revenue: $501.6 million Adjusted EPS: $.18 Gross Margin: 77.8% Free Cash Flow: $29.9 million More importantly, Cloudflare will likely need to raise forward guidance if shares are going to rise tomorrow. In the third quarter, Wall Street expects: Revenue: $538.6 million Adjusted EPS: $.21 And the company could also raise 2025 growth targets. Currently, Cloudflare is projecting sales of $2.090 billion to $2.094 billion. Wall Street expectations are slightly above that range at $2.096 billion. If Cloudflare took revenue guidance for the year beyond $2.1 billion, that could be enough for shares to rise again tomorrow. Cloudflare (NYSE: NET) reports earnings after the bell today. The company&#8217;s shares have raced forward 78% this quarter. Bears will argue that Cloudflare&#8217;s valuation is stretched to the max. Cloudflare is expected to post revenue of $2.1 billion this year, but is now worth more than $70 billion. Bulls point to Cloudflare being an essential company for the growth of agentic AI. With inference needs rising, companies will look to Cloudflare as a solution to limit latency in the age of AI. Count me in on the bull side, I added shares of Cloudflare to the $500,000 AI Portfolio I manage for 24/7 Wall St. back in January. I&#8217;ll be updating this live blog with news and analysis the moment Cloudflare&#8217;s earnings go live. All you have to do is simply leave this page open and updates will automatically appear.

Shares jumped the next day and are up 61%. Let&#8217;s take a look back at what the company reported: NET | Cloudflare Q1&#8217;25 Earnings Highlights: Adj.

The company anticipates maintaining its momentum with new customer acquisitions and upselling to existing customers.

Alphabet (GOOG) is my top Mag-7 pick, with strong earnings, attractive valuation, and aggressive AI capex supporting continued upside into year-end. Meta Platforms (META) also looks undervalued after robust revenue/EPS beats and technical breakout; I view dips as buying opportunities unless key support fails. Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) show relative weakness—cloud growth disappoints for AMZN, while MSFT looks vulnerable to pullbacks near highs; I'm cautious or sidelined with MSFT."

Apple's 4-year, $500 billion US investment plan would require a 10x increase in annual CapEx and could risk buybacks and dividends, and turn FCF negative. Apple has already started putting this plan into action, recently opening a Manufacturing Academy in Detroit and committing $500 million to MP Materials. Most iPhones are now imported tariff-free from India, and the products from Vietnam are subject to a 20% tariff, which I believe is baked into the $1.1B headwind this quarter."

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Conference Call Is Over 6:10 pm Apple&#8217;s conference call has ended and shares are up 3%. Overall, the company did a lot tonight to push the narrative they&#8217;ll be aggressive to catch up in AI and that device sales are rebounding. It&#8217;s a good quarter for Apple that might start turning around what&#8217;s been a disappointing 2025. Tim Cook on AI 5:58 pm TD Cowen Analst: Tim, I was curious about your thoughts on AI for edge devices. There&#8217;s like some people who think that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you think &#8212; do you see a scenario where the LLM become a third part of your iOS or is the SLM the way to go and how to think about evolution of edge devices in a futuristic AI world and is smartphone going to be the choice of device. Just curious your thoughts on it, broadly speaking. Timothy Cook Chief Executive Officer The way that we look at AI is that it&#8217;s 1 of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. And I think it will affect all devices in a significant way what pieces of the chain are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn&#8217;t want to to really talk about today. because that gives away some things on our strategy. But I think it&#8217;s a good question. . Tim Cook on Apple Momentum 5:48 pm Here&#8217;s what Tim Cook had to say about Apple&#8217;s surprising momentum in China last quarter: &#8220;Yes. We did grow in Greater China by 4% during the quarter versus the previous quarter, it was driven by an acceleration by iPhone, although we also had substantial growth on the MAC year-over-year. From a &#8212; as you know, the government has placed certain subsidies that affects some of our products, not all of them, but there are some of them. And I think that had some effect. It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out. that cut in during a portion of the previous quarter. The other things I would say are that the installed base hit a record high in Greater China &#8212; and we set an all-time record for the iPhone installed base. The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter. And according to Boral Panel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top 3 models in Urban China, which is extraordinary. Also, if you look at the other products, Mac, iPad and watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China Mainland were new to the product. So lots of good things there. And the other thing I would point out, which is an interesting point, The MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model in all of China, and the Mac Mini was the top-selling desktop model in all of China. So overall, a positive &#8212; very positive quarter.&#8221; Apple&#039;s CFO Says AI Investments Will Rise 5:47 pm &#8220;I would say, a pretty significant driver as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. So that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we&#8217;ve been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers. The other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where in cases we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. So you are going to see an increase in CapEx. We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities in tooling, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you&#8217;re seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments.&#8221; &#8211; Kevan Parekh, Apple CFO Tariff Implications 5:22 pm On Apple&#8217;s conference call they just said they incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs last quarter.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Nasdaq Crumbles as Crucial Trade Partners Get Hit with Tariffs 10:10 am Now down about 500 points, the Nasdaq is down to 20,632. That’s thanks to mixed earnings, tariff news, and poor jobs growth for July. AMZN, now down about $16 a share, isn’t helping much after its earnings report. Most of the pullback is from President Trump’s latest tariffs, which hit dozens of countries, including crucial partners, with steep tariffs. If other countries respond negatively with increased tariffs, markets could easily drop even more. Stay tuned for more. Morgan Stanley Reiterated Overweight Rating on Apple 9:37 am Morgan Stanley just reiterated its overweight rating on Apple, raising its price target to $240 from $235. The firm noted this was Apple’s strongest quarterly report and guide in more than two years. The firm also reiterated its overweight rating on Amazon. “Retail growth and profit improvements are shining and driving earnings. 2Q AWS growth was better and we detail why we see faster growth ahead. Remain OW, $300 PT,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. Nasdaq Opens Down 292 at the Open 9:31 am With tariffs, mixed earnings, and poor jobs growth, the Nasdaq is down 292 points. Nonfarm payrolls were expected to increase by 100,000 in July. Instead, they increased by just 73,000. The unemployment rate of 4.2% was in line with expectations. Amazon is down $16 at the open. That’s even as the company beat on the top and bottom lines, and offered better-than-expected guidance of between $174 billion and $179.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating $173.2 billion. Apple, up $3 at the open, posted earnings that beat on profit and revenue. iPhone sales grew 13% year over year. And overall revenue jumped 10% — the biggest quarterly jump in revenue growth since late 2023. U.S. Jobs Growth Did Slow to 73,000 8:42 am Nonfarm payrolls were expected to increase by 100,000 in July. Instead, they increased by just 73,000. The unemployment rate of 4.2% was in line with expectations. “June and May totals were revised sharply lower, down by a combined 258,000 from previously announced levels,” added CNBC. “The June total came down from the previously stated 147,000, while the May count fell to just 19,000, revised down by 125,000.” That weakness and the downward revisions could force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates when it meets in September. After a few record-setting days for the tech-heavy Nasdaq, futures are down about 245 points. All after President Trump signed an executive order that modified reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, with updated duties ranging from 10% to 41%. Here are the key points you should know: “Trump set rates including a 35% duty on many goods from Canada, 50% for Brazil, 25% for India, 20% for Taiwan, and 39% for Switzerland, according to a presidential executive order,” according to Reuters. 10% is now the minimum tariff imposed across all imports. Canada: Tariff raised to 35% from 25% 40 Countries now face a 15% tariff. China and Mexico had their deadlines delayed by 90 days. If you want to see the full list of updated tariffs, you can see it here. Shares of Amazon Slip Despite an Earnings Beat Not helping, shares of Amazon are down about $19 in premarket. That’s even as the company beat on the top and bottom lines, and offered better-than-expected guidance of between $174 billion and $179.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating $173.2 billion. Despite that, the stock dropped after Amazon&#8217;s guidance for operating income for its AWS cloud computing unit came in at $15.5 billion to $20.5 billion for the third quarter. Analysts were looking for $19.5 billion. Analysts are sticking by the stock, despite that news. Goldman Sachs still has a buy rating and raised its price target to $240 from $220. JPMorgan reiterated an overweight rating, raising its price target to $265 from $255. Citi has a buy rating and raised its price target to $270 from $265. Apple is Gaining Momentum on an Earnings Beat Just last night, the tech giant posted earnings that beat on profit and revenue. Plus, iPhone sales grew 13% year over year. And overall revenue jumped 10% &#8212; the biggest quarterly jump in revenue growth since late 2023. EPS of $1.57 was better than the estimates of $1.43. Revenue of $94.04 billion was better than the estimates of $89.53 billion. iPhone revenue was $44.58 billion as compared to expectations for $40.22 billion.

What Wall Street Will Be Looking for In Q2 12:46 pm Earlier we looked at what Airbnb report in the first quarter, let&#8217;s take a look at what Wall Street expects this quarter.

The stock is in a &#8216;prove it&#8217; mode right now that Airbnb can get back to growth, so guiding revenue above expected Q3 guidance is the metric to watch.

It&#8217;s Airbnb&#8217;s (Nasdaq: ABNB) turn to report earnings after the bell tonight. The company has seen shares treading water, down 1% across the past year while the broader market soars. If you turn back the clock even further, the picture gets uglier with shares down 7% across the past five years. Yet, shares now trade for about 30X this year&#8217;s earnings estimate. So if Airbnb shows positive business acceleration it could be liftoff for shares of the company.

Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Morgan Stanley Just Ugraded Apple 8:55 am Morgan Stanley just reiterated its overweight rating on Apple, noting that the tech giant is well-positioned after the latest tariff news from President Trump. According to the firm, as quoted by CNBC, “Apple’s commitment to investing an added $100B in the U.S. &#8211; mind you, with zero new major final assembly/production in the U.S. &#8211; means Apple is entirely exempt from Section 232 tariffs. Therefore, for Apple, tariff rates should get no worse, which is a much better-than-feared outcome.” Goldman Sachs Just Hiked Nvidia Price Target Ahead of Earnings 8:29 am Goldman Sachs just raised its price target on NVDA to $200 from $185, with a buy rating. As noted by CNBC, “Analyst James Schneider said that even though investor expectations are high heading into fiscal second-quarter results at the end of August, the chipmaker should have no trouble rising to the occasion.” In premarket, NVDA is now up about $2.45 a share to $181.81. Futures are racing even higher. Just days after tariff news and jobs data sank the markets, the major indices are exploding. At the moment, the Dow is up 250 points. The S&amp;P 500 is up about 41, with the NASDAQ up another 190 points to 23,610. All thanks to President Trump’s new chip tariffs that include broad exemptions. Announced last night, the President said there would be a 100% tariff on imported chips. However, that will not apply to companies building chips in the U.S. All of which positively impacted Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and ETFs such as the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH). Helping even more, Apple is up about 2.6% in premarket after announcing it would invest $100 billion more in U.S. companies and suppliers over the next four years. That’s on top of the $500 billion commitment Apple made earlier this year. “We’re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said, as quoted by CNBC. “But the good news for companies like Apple is if you’re building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge.” With the 2025 NFL Season Weeks Away, Gambling Stocks are Gaining Momentum Ahead of the 2025 NFL season, gambling stocks, like DraftKings (DKNG) are exploding higher. In 2024, the American Gaming Association said Americans were expected to spend about $35 billion on NFL games this year. That’s up from the $26.7 billion wagered a year prior. At the time, as noted by CBS Sports, “The NFL remains king, and more money is wagered on the NFL than any other league. The NFL also attracts six-figure wages (and sometimes seven-figure wagers) on a regular basis throughout the season.” From its August 2024 low of $31.26, DKNG ran to a high of about $45.72. The RoundHill Sports Betting &amp; iGaming ETF (BETZ) ran from an August 2024 low of about $16.30 to a high of $20.50. Shares of Flutter Entertainment (FLUT) ran from an August 2024 low of about $175.60 to a high of $283.45. With regards to DKNG, its stock is up after posting better-than-expected earnings and reiterated its full-year outlook. Its EPS of 38 cents missed by three cents. However, revenue of $1.51 billion, up 37.3% year over year, beat by $80 million. &#8220;We set records for revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, driven by an acceleration in revenue growth to 37% year-over-year,&#8221; said CEO Jason Robins. &#8220;We are pleased to be maintaining our fiscal year 2025 guidance, with revenue expected to be closer to the high end of our range, highlighting the strength of our platform as we prepare for an exciting new state launch.” The post Nasdaq Composite Live: This is Why the Index is Still Exploding Higher appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Most stocks fail to create real wealth. Just 4% drives half the market's gains. I focus on finding winners, not dodging losers. Time is better spent hunting greatness. Even strong companies can struggle in tough industries. A high-yield or trusted brand doesn't guarantee returns if trends shift against them. Some stocks look tempting but lack growth or face structural risks. I'd rather own businesses with clear momentum than hope for a turnaround."

Apple is aligning its business for geopolitical rebalancing with an added $100 billion investment over four years to support American re-shoring. The Company has sufficient operating cash flow to fund these investments, but buybacks could come under pressure if increased expenses constrain cash flow growth. Rationally, Apple only has a 10% annual return prospect over the next three-to-five years. Sentiment-related valuation support and financial engineering are the most likely bull-case catalysts."

CALIFORNIA — The number one reason people are drawn to the Golden State is for the lifestyle, experts say. When it comes to figuring out the best counties to call home, Patch consulted experts in real estate, travel, and entertainment to help find the ideal spot to hang your hat, no matter if you are single, raising your family, or planning out your golden years. While many reports focus on the best California cities to live in, as locals know, one town tends to flow into the next. Therefore, Patch broadened our view to explore the best counties to call home, based upon home availability, proximity to shopping, restaurants, wineries, and nightlife. In these areas, you can find homes from the upper $500,000 range to the lower $2 million range. Sorted alphabetically by county, here are the places where real estate agents say deals can still be found and career opportunities exist. Take a virtual stroll through these virtual neighborhoods in these counties: 1. Los Angeles County: When it comes to life in Los Angeles County, there are several locales that could be ideal for the lifestyle you are looking for. Here, one neighborhood blends into another and whether you enjoy the city, the country or the beach, there truly is a place for everyone. Redondo Beach According to Travel + Leisure, Redondo Beach is an ideal locale to call home. It's close to the Getty Center, Hollywood, aquariums, and of course, the beach. The breezy weather makes it ideal for those who wish to live where the stars walk on the ground. Redondo Beach, according to Real Estate Broker Jamie Waryck, of the JW Group, told Travel + Leisure, is a"" beach town that knows how to blend small-town charm with big-time culture."" This small town will bustle in the summer and fall months, and likely be foggy much of the spring. Life in Redondo Beach gets an A+. According to Niche, Redondo Beach was recently voted among the #3 Best Suburbs to call home in California. There are beach concerts, boutiques, pedestrian-friendly restaurants, and quality seafood, Waryck says. Niche also approves of life in Redondo, though it is pricey. The median home value in this area is $1.2 million, with monthly rents averaging $2,562. 2. Riverside County: The landscape of Riverside County extends from balmy wine country in the southwest to the deserts of the eastern Coachella Valley. Both were given nods by Travel + Leisure for the beauty, affordability, and lifestyle offered here. —La Quinta: Close to Indio, concerts and festivals, Indio is ideal for those seeking outdoor life in the winter and poolside living during the summer. Love to travel? The Palm Springs International Airport is close by, making it a breeze for desert dwellers to fly away from the 100+ degree heat of summer. La Quinta has a median home value of $612,800 according to Niche, with a median rent of $1,741. —Temecula: Just north of San Diego County along the I-15 corridor lies the award-winning wine country of Temecula. This city is blooming with shops, restaurants, wineries and hotels, including the famed Pechanga Resort Casino. In Temecula, there is always something to do for residents of all ages. Niche has given Temecula a B+ rating for schools, diversity, and nightlife, while housing remains hit or miss. “Temecula is a beautifully designed community with a lovely rural feeling,” realtor Nancy Hughes told Travel + Leisure. “The Kaiser Development Master Plan had a goal of creating large areas of very low density, which is why we have several communities with larger acreages.” The median home value hovers around $640,400 with a median rent of $2,297. 3.

From urban and upscale living to serene settings to family-centric neighborhoods and master-planned communities, house hunters have options for a fraction of the cost of neighboring markets. And it's all within commuting distance from the Bay Area and Silicon Valley."" —Lodi This little Central Valley town is situated in San Joaquin County. It's home to about 67,000 people. The town, a suburb of Stockton, is full of small-town charm, according to realtor Ryan Sherman of Sherman & Associates Real Estate Co.

Nicknamed ""SLO County,"" this is a place where agriculture reigns, with grapes at the top of that food chain. Here, you can explore the historic San Simeon, Hearst Castle, or visit beaches, national wildlife refuges, and vineyards. —Paso Robles Paso Robles is about 200 miles from Los Angeles and another 200 miles from San Francisco. It's packed with restaurants, vineyards and scenic landscapes. Real estate expert Mark McConnell and Liz Lee of Heart to Heart real estate shared their thoughts on what makes Paso Robles a great place to call home, telling Travel + Leisure: ""One can choose from a downtown bungalow, a sprawling estate home or rolling hills or vineyards.""

What's more, the Mediterranean climate is top-notch. Realtor Shirley Frantz, of Keller Williams Luxury Silicon Valley, told Travel + Leisure that the community rallies in the year-long sunshine. ""It's a community that goes to the farmers market on Murphy Avenue, watches their kids play sports on the same fields that they did growing up, and spends time getting to know one another."" Here, there are coffee shops, restaurants, parks and great schools. Niche ranks Sunnyvale as the #11 best city to raise a family in America, according to a recent survey. It gets an A+ for public schools, good for families, diversity, nightlife, with crime and safety and housing coming in last on the report card. About 150,000 people call Sunnyvale home. Buying a home here will cost about $1.8 million, and the median rent is $3,065 per month. About 56% of Sunnyvale residents are in the rental market. A few final notes about life in California: California may have the third-highest home prices in the nation, according to recent reports on Niche and Travel + Leisure magazine, but rentals remain on average about $3,000 per month across the board. It isn't cheap to live here, but there are benefits to making a life in the Golden State, experts say. One of the biggies for retirees is that California State social security benefits are untaxed, and as for vacations? Residents who choose to staycation instead can save upwards of $7,250 per person per year on a trip in the United States, and over $9,900 on an international trip, according to the Motley Fool. So where would you live in California?"

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Every Wall Street Question, Summarized 6:21 pm Here&#8217;s a summary of every question Wall Street asked and management&#8217;s response: 1) Can the data-center business keep growing fast next year? Why investors asked: Hyperscale cloud companies are increasing capital spending, so the street wants to know if Coherent can keep pace. Management’s answer: Demand outlook is “very strong.” They expect data center and communications to grow again sequentially in the current quarter. Growth drivers are 800-gigabit transceivers rising through 2025–2026, 1.6-terabit transceivers ramping on top of that, the optical circuit switch moving from first revenue toward scale, and continued strength in data-center-interconnect. 2) What is special about the new six-inch indium-phosphide line and U.S. manufacturing? Why investors asked: Capacity and cost determine how much share Coherent can win in next-gen optics; U.S. production can be a strategic advantage amid tariffs and supply risk. Management’s answer: The six-inch line began production in August and should deliver higher volume at lower cost. Coherent emphasizes a broad U.S. footprint (20+ sites, 13 states) as a differentiator for large customers; the Apple laser agreement is cited as proof of that value. Apple revenue should start in 2H26. 3) Which pieces are down sequentially in Q1 guidance, and why? Why investors asked: To reconcile total guidance and identify any soft spots. Management’s answer: Data center and communications should be up sequentially. Industrial is likely flat to down near-term (even excluding the ~$20M Aerospace &amp; Defense step-down) due to macro uncertainty and tariff noise. Long-term, management still expects industrial to grow, aided by recurring service revenue. 4) How healthy is the optical-circuit-switch pipeline, and what is the edge versus mechanical switches? Why investors asked: This is a new product in a potentially large market; investors want adoption proof. Management’s answer: Pipeline is “very healthy.” The switch uses non-mechanical digital liquid-crystal technology (not moving parts) which offers much higher reliability—critical in artificial-intelligence data centers. Capacity is being added to support the ramp. 5) What does the Apple deal really mean for revenue certainty and margins? Why investors asked: Coherent’s Apple exposure fell a few years back; investors want clarity on durability and profitability now. Management’s answer: It is a multi-year expansion for a new generation of lasers used in iPhone and iPad, manufactured in Texas. Revenue begins 2H26. Management expects the arrangement to benefit gross margin and provide solid plant utilization. 6) Why did sequential growth in data center/communications moderate versus some peers? Why investors asked: To assess relative share and trajectory as artificial-intelligence builds accelerate. Management’s answer: Quarter-to-quarter lumpiness is normal (timing of orders, supply, transitions from 400-gigabit to 800-gigabit). Over FY25 the business grew more than 60% and management believes they gained share, with strong demand ahead from 800-gigabit, 1.6-terabit, the optical circuit switch, and data-center-interconnect. 7) Can foreign-exchange headwinds derail margin progress, and can Coherent reach a 40-plus percent gross margin? Why investors asked: Q4 gross margin dipped sequentially on currency; the long-term model targets above 42%. Management’s answer: The Q4 dip was mainly foreign exchange; cost reductions and price optimization were strong. Without the currency hit, Q4 would have exceeded the top end of guidance. Management is confident in the &gt;42% long-term margin target. 8) Any geographic or customer-mix risks inside industrial lasers? Why investors asked: To gauge near-term volatility. Management’s answer: No unusual concentration. The caution is macro-driven, not customer-specific. In FY25, service contracts (recurring) grew faster than product sales, which is a margin tailwind. Near-term cautious; long-term constructive. 9) How strong is demand in data-center-interconnect, and what is driving it—training or inference? Why investors asked: Inter-data-center traffic is exploding as artificial-intelligence clusters spread. Management’s answer: Very strong—especially for coherent 100/400/800-gigabit transceivers. Demand is mostly driven by traffic spanning multiple data centers, not just within one facility. 10) Will Chinese optical makers pressure prices and share as speeds move to 800-gigabit and 1.6-terabit? Why investors asked: Rising Chinese competitors can compress margins and take share. Management’s answer: Coherent believes it gained share in FY25, particularly at higher speeds. The technology road map (800-gigabit now; three laser paths for 1.6-terabit; progress toward 3.2-terabit) and supply-chain resiliency (U.S. manufacturing plus internal indium-phosphide and laser capacity) are their defense. Pricing trends are as expected—no unusual pressure. 11) Will Coherent fully self-supply lasers as the six-inch line ramps? Why investors asked: Internal supply can protect margins and availability. Management’s answer: The company will continue a mix of internal and external sourcing. Over half of transceivers ship with electro-absorption modulated lasers, and over half of those lasers are internally made today. 12) Vietnam facility and silicon-carbide outlook? Why investors asked: To understand global capacity and a previously weak end market. Management’s answer: The Vietnam site supports materials businesses, including silicon carbide. Coherent exited pre-revenue devices/modules and is focusing on wafers and epitaxy. After a weak FY25, demand has stabilized; no FY26 headwind expected. We&#039;re Compiling Our Notes 6:15 pm Coherent&#8217;s call is over and we&#8217;ll post an update shortly with our notes. Simply leave this live blog open and the update should appear automatically. Call Is Almost Done 6:00 pm Coherent&#8217;s call is nearly finished, shares are still down about 17% as of 6 p.m. ET. We&#8217;ll post our notes shortly from the call, but it is worth noting that nothing that was said materially changed the company&#8217;s share price. That&#8217;s different than Cisco, which saw shares rally during the company&#8217;s conference call. Coherent on Their Ability to Withstand Tariffs 5:22 pm Here&#8217;s what Coherent CEO James Anderson had to say about the company&#8217;s ability to withstand tariffs on the company&#8217;s earnings call: Over the past months, you&#8217;ve heard me stress the importance of Coherent&#8217;s dynamic, flexible global manufacturing footprint as a competitive advantage and a hedge against geopolitical risks. Our U.S. footprint is a key part of that strategy. Coherent has a long industry of advanced manufacturing in the United States, leading U.S. manufacturing innovation since our founding more than 50 years ago, beginning with the company&#8217;s first manufacturing site in Saxonburg, Pennsylvania, which remains our company headquarters. Today, our U.S. manufacturing footprint extends across more than a 8 U.S. manufacturing locates in 13 states. Across those U.S. manufacturing locations, we employ thousands of people. These sites lead the industry in technical innovation, manufacturing, and we continue to invest in our U.S. manufacturing footprint. Bull/Bear Debate 4:55 pm We&#8217;ve included Coherent in our $500,000 AI Portfolio at 24/7 Wall St. and are positive long-term on the company. So let&#8217;s look at this quarter from the bull/bear framework. Bullish! Revenue guidance came in light but EPS fro next quarter at the midpoint matched Wall Street&#8217;s expectations. The company is beginning its 1.6T module ramp, which should be a large revenue driver in 2026. Coherent emphasized gross margin expansion during the year, they&#8217;re clearly focusing on their opportunities in the AI space in an outsized way. Bearish! The company had run up 121% since April 21st. If a stock runs that fast and issues disappointing guidance, it&#8217;s going to fall almost 100% of the time. While Coherent&#8217;s networking business is doing great, its laser business continues to post middling results. The materials business is also seeing significant revenue declines. Here&#039;s What&#039;s Next 4:45 pm Coherent&#8217;s conference call starts at 5 p.m., we&#8217;ll listen in and post notes. Shares are currently down 19%. One interesting note is that guidance excludes $20 million for assets being sold off. You wonder if that revenue was included whether the reaction after hours would have been this severe. First Revenue from 1.6T Datacom Transceivers Next Quarter 4:36 pm In their release Coherent highlighted: First Revenue from 1.6T Datacom Transceivers. Commenced revenue shipments of our 1.6T transceiver products, enabling high-performance AI datacenter applications. The growth of 800g and 1.6T modules is part of the bull case for Coherent so its encouraging to see revenue beginning to flow from these products. We&#8217;d expect more commentary on this during the company&#8217;s earnings call. Coherent&#039;s CEO on AI Growth 4:35 pm Jim Anderson, CEO, said, “We delivered a strong fiscal 2025 with revenue growth of 23% and non-GAAP EPS expansion of 191%. We believe we are well positioned to continue to drive strong revenue and profit growth over the long-term given our exposure to key growth drivers such as AI datacenters. We also continue to optimize and focus our portfolio with the recently announced agreement to sell our Aerospace and Defense business. As we enter a new fiscal year, we are excited about the growth opportunities ahead of us.” Detailed Earnings Summary 4:33 pm COHR | Coherent Corp. Q4&#8217;25 Earnings Highlights: Adj.

CEO Commentary: Jim Anderson: &#8220;We delivered a strong fiscal 2025 with revenue growth of 23% and non-GAAP EPS expansion of 191%. We believe we are well positioned to continue to drive strong revenue and profit growth over the long-term given our exposure to key growth drivers such as AI datacenters. We also continue to optimize and focus our portfolio with the recently announced agreement to sell our Aerospace and Defense business. As we enter a new fiscal year, we are excited about the growth opportunities ahead of us.&#8221; CFO Commentary: Sherri Luther: &#8220;In fiscal 2025, in addition to strong revenue growth, we achieved gross margin expansion of 358 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Revenue growth and margin expansion drove improvement in our operating cash flow, which enabled us to repay approximately $437 million of our outstanding debt for the full fiscal year.&#8221; Coherent Now Down About 16% 4:28 pm Coherent shares have bounced slightly off the bottom but are trading down about 16% as of 4:28 p.m. ET. It looks like the company is about to give up a sizable percent of its recent gains. Why Shares Are Dropping 4:17 pm If you own Coherent you&#8217;re probably wondering why shares are dropping. The company beat revenue expectations last quarter ($1.53 billion) and EPS expectations ($1 in adjusted EPS vs. $.92 of expectations). The problem is the revenue guid for next quarter is $1.46 billion to $1.60 billion, at the midpoint that&#8217;s lower than Wall Street expectations of $1.55 billion. When a stock has run up as much as Coherent has, even a &#8216;small&#8217; miss on guidance like this is usually punished severely. Earnings Are Out 4:15 pm Guidance is below expectations and shares are down 15% after hours. Things to Know Before Coherent Reports After the Bell 3:33 pm Coherent will report after the bell today. We expect their earnings should hit newsires at about 4:15 p.m. ET. As a reminder, new updates will post on this live earnings blog automatically.

How Coherent Looked After Recent Earnings 3:00 pm Earnings History After two quarters of strong upside reactions, COHR has developed breakout momentum, particularly when EPS surprise exceeds 20%+. Quarter EPS Surprise 1-Day Move 7-Day Move 14-Day Move Q3 FY2025 +5.81% +7.83% +12.58% +14.73% Q2 FY2025 +41.79% +11.17% +12.48% +10.40% Q1 FY2025 +21.31% –7.17% –8.20% –1.89% Q4 FY2024 +1.67% +4.45% +5.25% +6.21% Coherent (NYSE: COHR) reports Q4 FY2025 earnings after the close today. Last quarter delivered strong upside in AI, telecom, and laser transceivers, but investors are on alert for signs of margin pressure and decelerating industrial demand. Management’s tone on Q1 visibility and full-year guidance will be critical, especially with the stock up 70% over the past year and now trading above the average analyst price target. We’ll be updating this live blog with news and analysis right after Coherent&#8217;s earnings hit the newswires. To receive updates, all you have to do is leave this page open, and updates will post automatically. Estimates Snapshot Q4 FY2025 Consensus Estimates: Revenue: $1.51 billion EPS (Normalized): $0.92 Full-Year FY2025 Estimates: Revenue: $5.79 billion EPS: $3.50 For comparison, Coherent posted $1.31B in revenue and $0.61 in EPS for Q4 FY2024, implying ~15.1% revenue growth and ~50.8% EPS growth YoY. Key Areas to Watch AI Datacenter Demand and 1.6T Ramp Datacom revenue tied to AI grew 54% YoY in Q3, led by demand for EML, VCSEL, and silicon photonic transceivers. The 1.6T product family is set to begin volume shipments later this year, supported by rising customer interest across hyperscale and optical domains. Indium Phosphide Capacity and Vertical Integration Coherent’s internally manufactured EMLs now power the majority of transceiver revenue. The upcoming 6-inch indium phosphide fab should improve gross margin scalability and accelerate future 3.2T product readiness. Telecom and Coherent Optics Expansion Telecom revenue rose 21% YoY in Q3, driven by ZR/ZR+ coherent modules for datacenter interconnect and metro optical networks. Orders remain strong across global service providers, with bandwidth upgrades continuing into H1 FY2026. Gross Margin Execution in Challenging Mix Q3 gross margin reached 38.5%, aided by cost reductions and pricing gains. However, management flagged potential Q4 pressure from unfavorable product mix and flat revenue. CFO Sherri Luther noted: “We continued to improve pricing and reduce costs across our product portfolio, which contributed to our margin expansion.” Industrial and Display Volatility The company cited ongoing softness in industrial markets despite stable demand for display lasers and semi cap tools. Investors will look for clarity on order trends in tools and OEM components tied to China, EVs, and OLED growth trajectories.The post Live: Why Coherent (COHR) Dropped 17% After Q4 Earnings appeared first on 24/7 Wall St.."

Key risk remains Apple's modem in-sourcing. The CFO flagged lower Apple contribution, with FQ4 guide $10.3B–$11.1B (QCT $9.0B–$9.6B). I'd watch QCT closely."

AAPL trades at a premium 33x forward EPS, higher than peers like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, despite slower projected long-term growth."
