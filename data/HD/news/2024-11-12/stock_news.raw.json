    "text": "The Home Depot reported strong Q3 2024 results, with adjusted earnings per share and sales exceeding expectations. However, the 6.6% sales growth shouldn't be overinterpreted. Company-wide comparable sales declined by 1.3%, a significant improvement against the backdrop of a continued challenging environment and inflationary pressures on consumers. Operating profitability weakened as expected, but there are signs of stabilization. FCF for the first nine months was comparatively weak, but this is largely due to a difficult comparison.",
