    "text": "Markets are down slightly, taking a breather from a winning streak on hopes for a rate cut in September. At the moment, the Nasdaq is down about 45 points. The Dow is down about 19, with the S&amp;P 500 down about eight points. The Federal Reserve will remain in focus this week, as central bank members meet in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for their annual symposium. Investors will be listening for any clues about the future path of interest rates. As noted by Yahoo Finance, “Ahead of Powell&#8217;s speech — likely to be his last as Fed chair — markets are placing the probability the Fed will cut rates by at least 0.25% next month at around 85%. Clues from Powell about the speed and depth of the cycle the Fed is about to embark on will be the week&#8217;s biggest market-moving event.” Aside from the central bank, investors are waiting on earnings from Home Depot, Lowe’s, Target, and Walmart. All are under the microscope, with concerns about the strength of the U.S. consumer mounting. Helping, analysts at Evercore ISI just added Target to its tactical outperform list, noting that Target earnings could be better than expected. “So, in our view, a relief rally could result, especially if trends into 2H show any BTS (back to school) improvement, with potential mgmt change and stimulus proving hope into 2026. In recent days, much has been made of the Target / Ulta partnership ending, yet we believe Target is hunting for new partners and/or opportunities to scale, for example, with Warby Parker,” as quoted by CNBC. Stock Upgrades: RBC Capital Just Upgraded Sunrun RBC Capital analysts just upgraded Sunrun to an outperform rating with a price target of $16 from $12. As a catalyst, the firm pointed to guidance from the Treasury Department on how renewable projects might qualify for tax credits. “While the act terminates investment and production tax credits for solar and wind projects after 2027, projects that start construction within 12 months of the passage of the act can still claim credits beyond this deadline,” according to CNBC. Bank of America reiterated a buy rating on Apple, noting, “Services has been, and we expect will continue to be, the leading driver of y/y gross profit dollar growth. Reiterate Buy on stable cash flows, earnings resiliency, and strong capital return program.” Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating on Nvidia, giving it a $206 price target. The firm noted, “While the near-term bar is higher now, the 12-month picture across demand, supply, and competitive outlook all continue to be very favorable.” The post Nasdaq Composite Live: All Eyes are on Jackson Hole Symposium appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

    "text": "Intel (INTC -3.54%) jumped almost 6% ahead of the market opening thanks to Softbank announcing a $2 billion investment in the chipmaker, with news of the Trump administration considering taking a 10% stake also contributing to recent gains. Rule Breakers recommendation Palo Alto (PANW -0.36%) rose over 5% in pre-market trading following outperformance on both quarterly revenue and earnings, thanks to momentum in Next Generation Security and growing AI product integration. Home Depot (HD -1.16%) reported ahead of the opening bell, with comparable store sales rising less than expected, disappointing investors who had looked for signs of growth following flat store sales from last quarter. The stock fell around 1.4% in response. Vanguard is planning to launch several active stock-picking ETFs, including ones focused on dividend and growth stocks, as it tries to capture growing demand for proactive investment management. Roblox (RBLX 2.36%), Palantir (PLTR -1.76%), and Celsius (CELH 6.65%) have each more than doubled so far in 2025, gaining 107%, 130%, and 132% respectively.

Intel Jumps 6% on SoftBank Investment News 8:35 am Shares of Intel are up about 6%, or $1.43, in premarket on news of a $2 billion investment from SoftBank. “It’s a vote of support for Intel, which hasn’t been able to take advantage of the artificial intelligence boom in advanced semiconductors and has spent heavily to stand up a manufacturing business that’s yet to secure a significant customer,” according to CNBC. Palo Alto Networks is up 6%, or by $11.37, after beating earnings. For its most recent quarter, the company’s EPS of 95 cents beat by six cents. Revenue of $2.54 billion, up 15.5% year over year, beat by $40 million. Guidance was also impressive, with the company calling for EPS of between 88 cents and 90 cents, which would be above estimates for 86 cents. Revenue is forecast to range from $2.45 billion to $2.47 billion. At the moment, Nasdaq futures are down about 37 points, as nervous markets wait to hear from Fed boss Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Symposium later this week. In fact, markets are waiting for clues as to what could happen at the central bank’s remaining policy meetings for the year. “We expect the Federal Reserve to use Jackson Hole as an opportunity to prepare the markets and signal towards a 25-basis point cut in September and a potentially accommodating stance through year-end,” said Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer at Treasury Partners, as quoted by CNBC. “Since this will be Powell’s last Jackson Hole conference as Fed Chair, he’ll likely reinforce the need for Fed independence from the Executive Branch.” According to CME’s FedWatch, there’s an 83% chance of a quarter-point cut in September. Earnings: Palo Alto Networks Jumped 6%, or $11.26 on a Beat Shares of Palo Alto Networks are up 6%, or $11.26, after beating Wall Street earnings estimates. For its most recent quarter, the company’s EPS of 95 cents beat by six cents. Revenue of $2.54 billion, up 15.5% year over year, beat by $40 million. Guidance was also impressive, with the company calling for EPS of between 88 cents and 90 cents, which would be above estimates for 86 cents. Revenue is forecast to range from $2.45 billion to $2.47 billion. “For the full year, Palo Alto expects to earn between $3.75 and $3.85 per share on an adjusted basis, with the $3.80 midpoint above the $3.69 per share estimate. Sales are forecast to be between $10.48B and $10.53B, above the $10.44B estimate,” says Seeking Alpha. Earnings: Home Depot Missed Earnings, But Maintained Full-Year Forecast Home Depot’s EPS of $4.68 missed estimates by a penny. Revenue of $45.28 billion was in-line. Comparable sales of 1% missed estimates of 1.4%. &#8220;Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations. The momentum that began in the back half of last year continued throughout the first half as customers engaged more broadly in smaller home improvement projects,&#8221; stated CEO Ted Decker. &#8220;Our teams are executing at a high level, and we continue to grow market share.” Home Depot also reiterated that it expects full-year total sales to grow by 2.8% and comparable sales to jump about 1%. With that, the HD stock is up about $4.60 a share in premarket. The post Nasdaq Composite Live: Markets Waiting on Powell’s Jackson Hole Speech appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",
