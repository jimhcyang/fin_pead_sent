The stock closed at $82.49 to end last week, and with the company’s upcoming earnings report set to provide some big-time volatility ahead, with very divergent views on the company beginning to build in the market. With a current consensus price target that’s 37% below current levels, it’s clear that most Wall Street analysts aren’t overly bullish about where this big data and AI stock could be headed from here. And given the recent headwinds the market is going to be pricing into all stocks (and in particular those who have run the furthest the fastest during this recent cycle, such as Palantir), next week could be a choppy one for investors in a range of stocks including Palantir. Let’s dive into what’s likely to drive Palantir this coming week, and what investors may want to think about heading into this earnings report (set to be released after market close). Key Points About This Article: Palantir is among the most high-octane growth stocks that has benefited investors willing to move out in the risk curve. Here’s why this is a stock that could have big downside risk in the days to come, and what investors may want to do moving forward. If you’re looking for some stocks with huge potential, make sure to grab a free copy of our brand-new “The Next NVIDIA” report. It features a software stock we’re confident has 10X potential. Is Palantir’s Surge to an All-Time High Overdone? Volatile stock chart There are certainly plenty of reasons why Palantir has been such a notable performer over the past year, surging nearly 400% over this time frame. With a surge of more than 300% last year alone, fueled by consecutive quarters of revenue growth and sky-high demand (seen in its strong results), sky-high demand for AI stocks (and companies utilizing AI to grow their top and bottom lines at an accelerated rate) has continued. Indeed, Palantir hit a record $84.8 stock price following with protracted tech sector rally. But despite its 412% one-year surge, analysts broadly consider the big data giant overvalued. The company boasts 81.1% gross margins and 24.5% revenue growth, driven by strong investor confidence in its data analytics and strategic partnerships. But if growth slows, there’s a decent likelihood the company’s multiple of 75-times sales is, shall we say, overdone. Factor in tariff concerns and a surging U.S. dollar (with worries that bond yields will follow suit), and investors have reason to throttle back exposure to the highest-growth companies in the market and look for safer Bets. Analysts at Morgan Stanley are among those who have downgraded Palantir over valuation concerns, while Wedbush raised its price target to $90 (the outfit is known for being outright bullish in all market backdrops), so we’ll see who’s right. I do think there are a number of reasons why investors may want to take a more cautious approach to companies like Palantir right now. With that said, let’s dive into what analysts are looking for with this company’s upcoming earnings report. What to Expect on February 3 An investor looking stressed out reading a report Palantir will release Q4 2024 earnings on after market close on February 3. Currently, analysts project the company will bring in $0.11 in EPS (up 37.5% year-over-year), and $778.89 million in revenue, a 28% increase. Strong AI and data analytics demand, along with its Nasdaq 100 inclusion, continue to drive outsized growth expectations. Of course, if growth doesn’t materliaze as the market expects (and/or this company doesn’t beat to an outsized degree), I think analysts could be correct in their outwardly bearish view of this stock. Palantir’s growth depends on securing high-value government contracts, particularly in defense, where rising geopolitical tensions are driving AI demand. Expanding these contracts could stabilize revenue and reinforce its market position amid increasing competition, but it’s unclear exactly what progress has been made not here fronts. Moreover, its five-year AI partnership with BP highlights enterprise adoption, while collaborations with Anduril, SpaceX, and OpenAI strengthen its Pentagon contract prospects. These strategic moves have drawn investor attention, supporting Palantir’s market valuation and long-term expansion. Palantir’s commercial growth is accelerating as enterprises adopt AI solutions, with converting pilot programs into full-scale deals key to sustaining momentum. Expanding margins could further strengthen its stock performance as analysts track customer acquisition and contract growth, but again, we’ll have to see how the numbers come in. Where Is Palantir Headed From Here? A man shrugging his shoulders Palantir has become a key player in AI and data analytics, drawing investor interest for its role in emerging technologies like quantum computing and AI-driven big data. Its government and enterprise partnerships strengthen its market position, while rising cybersecurity demand boosts its growth potential. As data privacy concerns grow, Palantir’s innovations could enhance its value and stock performance. The company’s role in smart cities and autonomous systems could drive future valuation growth as urban technology advances. Its platforms, Foundry and Gotham, leverage AI and machine learning for predictive analytics, enabling users to process vast datasets efficiently. With scalable, interoperable solutions across sectors and ongoing quantum computing research, Palantir is positioned to transform data processing and enhance decision-making. The company’s upcoming earnings report will be pivotal for investors looking to gauge where this stock is headed from here. Personally, I think the current macro backdrop is one that’s overtly bearish, suggesting investors may want to be more cautious with this name than in the past. It’s a stock that could certainly have big downside following its upcoming earnings report, so buyer beware.

Results from the survey covering about 234 square kilometres and consisting of 4,756 line-kilometres demonstrate significant geological complexity across the entire 27-kilometre strike length. Encouragingly, several second-order and third-order faults were revealed throughout the project area. Large geological structures at Hermitage align with previous high-grade prospecting samples that included 7.31 g/t gold, 193 g/t silver and 2,044 ppm stibnite (antimony). AuMEGA’s managing director and CEO Sam Pazuki said: “Our Hermitage Gold-Antimony Project is a highly prospective opportunity on a massive land package along the second largest known gold structure in Newfoundland. “It is geologically akin to the geology of some of the largest gold deposits globally including Bendigo and Fosterville in Victoria, Australia, Golden Mile in Kalgoorlie, Australia and Windfall in Quebec, Canada. “The exploration activities at Hermitage to date have been limited, however despite this, the results are highly encouraging with multi-gram outcropping gold samples collected (up to 7.31 g/t) to go along with silver (up to 193 g/t) and antimony (up to 2,044 ppm). “The latest results from the high-resolution airborne magnetic survey highlight several major structures throughout the project area. Of particular note is the structural complexity near the centre of the property where we have the highest-grade gold sample collected to date.” The geophysical survey was completed before the end of 2024 by SHA Geophysics with data acquired at 50-metre line spacing with a sensor height of 30 metres. Results from the Hermitage high-resolution airborne magnetic survey. Imagery from the airborne geophysical survey has revealed major structural boundaries and broad-scale deformation features further confirming Hermitage as a high-priority greenfields target for the company. The project area is structurally unique within the geological framework of the province trending, northwest-southeast along the Hermitage flexure compared with most other structures oriented in the exact opposite direction. Geophysics demonstrate that the Hermitage structural domain is favourable to host large dilation zones permitting mineralising fluids in a favourable geological host, as demonstrated along this same provincial suture zone northeast at Newfound Gold’s Queensway Project. Anomalous to high-grade gold-antimony-silver mineralisation has been identified in quartz and quartz-carbonate veins hosted in a mix of sediments and volcanics across 27 kilometres of the project. AuMEGA had previously prospected the central area of Hermitage along stream beds as there is limited outcrop and these where most of the high-grade samples have been collected. This work yielded numerous gold values with peak samples grading up to 7.31 g/t gold, 2,044 ppm stibnite and 193 g/t silver. The company has identified key areas as primary targets for follow-up diamond drilling and additional prospecting with the stream beds also appearing to be highlighted in the magnetic geophysical response as northeast-southwest trending faults to the overall stratigraphy. Many highlights encountered in this area display multiple phases of deformation and veining events. Given the limited exposure and early success with minimal field time, the prospectivity of additional mineralisation hiding under cover is very encouraging. AuMEGA is undertaking a comprehensive review of the geophysical data received, coupled with previous results. This will form the basis of geological mapping and prospecting in the near future as the company works toward an inaugural diamond drill program in the second half of 2025. The amount of drilling will be based on results and can be scaled up or down and will also be weather dependent given additional logistical support required for the project. “We will continue to proceed with comprehensive analysis and interpretation of the new geophysics data and couple that with the previous results to determine specific areas of interest, including specific targets that we plan on drilling in 2025,” Pazuki said. “This inaugural drill program is expected for later in the year and will comprise of up to 3,000 metres of drilling.” Meantime, the company’s upcoming winter drill program in Canada is progressing well. Conditions have been generally favourable despite a rainfall event for two days in the middle of January which delayed site development and equipment mobilisation. Winter camps are being constructed and these are expected to be operational by the end of the first week of February. Drilling is expected to begin in the near term and AuMEGA expects to drill between 10,000 and 12,000 metres in the current quarter at Bunker Hill.

The Company is determined to unlock the resource potential of its 100% owned flagship ER315 asset, in South Africa’s Free State Province. With world-class helium concentrations ranging between 5-9% and significant discovered natural gas resources, D3 Energy is positioned to address growing global helium demand while securing South Africa’s energy security and supporting energy transition efforts. “We believe our asset is becoming a globally significant helium project at a time where supply is struggling and will struggle to meet both current and predicted demand,” D3E Managing Director and CEO, David Casey said. He added, the Company is also, “emerging as a key provider of natural gas in South Africa, addressing energy delivery challenges, supporting the country’s sustainable energy transition and creating value for shareholders.” As a critical resource that plays a vital role in various high-tech industries and cutting-edge applications, the price of helium is set to soar in coming years with an existing supply shortage expected to continue. Helium prices are already at record highs levels, having gained 18% per annum over the past five years — a trend that is predicted to continue to increase. Looking ahead, demand is predicted to remain high and to continue to grow. A finite resource, helium underpins diverse industries due to its unique thermal conductivity, inertness and cryogenic properties. There is no way of manufacturing helium artificially and most of the world’s reserves have been derived as a byproduct of the extraction of natural hydrocarbon gas. One of its most significant uses is in the manufacturing of semiconductors. It is also essential for the cooling of nuclear reactors and in the context of the global energy transition, helium-cooled reactors are emerging as a key technology for safe and efficient nuclear power generation. Helium, irreplaceable in certain applications, is experiencing demand growth of 5-6% annually — double the projected supply growth. Global helium demand is expected to rise from 6-billion-cubic-feet (BCF) to just over 8-BCF by 2030. According to independent market intelligence group IDTechEx, global helium demand is expected to nearly double by 2035. Helium supply is anticipated to grow in response to increasing demand; however, geopolitical risks pose challenges to stability, with significant production concentrated in Qatar and Russia. New medium and long-term helium supply is primarily derived as a by-product of planned oil and gas mega-projects, which are high cost, frequently delayed and can be subject to geopolitical influences. Consequently, the helium market is expected to remain tight for an extended period, with lower than anticipated global output and potential supply deferments — particularly if the large projects in Qatar and Russia are delayed. The opportunity in helium is clear, but the market fundamentals of D3E’s other production product, methane, also remain robust. South Africa continues to experience significant energy shortages and the country appreciates the importance of natural gas to solve its current issues, and to play a part in the energy transition. The country currently imports gas via pipeline from the Pande and Temane fields in Mozambique with significant and growing shortfalls announced from 2024. D3 Energy is ideally placed to not only meet this shortfall but to help South Africa transition more broadly to a more balanced, cleaner and lower emissions energy market. D3 Energy has delineated a significant Contingent and Prospective Resource for both helium and natural gas at the ER315 project, which spans four permit areas totalling 442,750 acres and is adjacent to existing producer Renergen. The Company notes that converting just an initial percentage of its sizeable 2C contingent helium resource into reserves would translate into “enormous value”. D3E began production testing at ER315 in mid 2024 — successfully flowing gas at legacy gold exploration borehole, RBD03, that was drilled within the area of ER315 back in 1983. D3E then delivered further positive results from other boreholes across the project. Initial results confirmed world-class helium concentrations averaging around 5%, with individual boreholes reporting helium grades and as high as 9%. Recent production testing demonstrated material gas flows, including 191 Mscfd from newly drilled borehole RBD10 and 147 Mscfd from RBD03. Currently nine boreholes are flowing gas within ER315, with three wells at measurable rates. Notably, the Bloemskraal boreholes have potentially been flowing gas at these rates since the early to mid 1980s, demonstrating the durability of the reservoir system and the potential for sustained production These results are central to the Company’s Production Right (PR) application, which is critical to advancing ER315 into development. D3 Energy’s strategic partnership with NOVO Energy, a South African gas retailer and major shareholder, supports the pathway to commercialisation. NOVO, an integrated energy and technology company, specialises in the procurement and development of methane-rich gas sources, gas infrastructure development (CNG/LNG/pipelines) and tailored customer solutions, including industrial applications, NGV fuel, power generation and feedstock supply. D3 and NOVO are progressing discussions toward initial offtake agreements to further solidify the project’s commercial framework. Through a methodical and technical exploration approach, D3 Energy has consistently delivered strong drilling and production testing results, providing investors with exposure to two critical commodities: helium, a key input in high-tech industries and natural gas, vital for South Africa’s energy security and transition efforts. The Company describes ER315 as a globally significant helium project, addressing the growing global helium supply-demand gap while becoming an important provider of natural gas in South Africa. These efforts contribute to resolving energy deliverability challenges and supporting the country’s sustainable energy transition.
