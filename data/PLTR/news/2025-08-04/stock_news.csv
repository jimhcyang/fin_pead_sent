Since its October 2022 IPO, PLTR has surged an eye-catching 1,952.39%. In early August, it was reported that the U.S. Army is consolidating 75 contracts into a single 10-year arrangement with Palantir valued at $10 billion. When the company reported earnings on Aug. 4, it announced that revenues saw year-over-year growth of 48% and topped $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever, while U.S. government revenues rose 53% from the year-ago period to $426 million. Palantir beat on earnings with 16 cents per share versus Wall Street&#8217;s expectations of 14 cents per share. The company also upped its full-year guidance, forecasting revenues between $4.142 billion and $4.150 billion, up from its previous forecast of $3.89 billion to $3.90 billion. While the stock&#8217;s forward P/E ratio of 256.50 can be concerning, Palantir&#8217;s federal contracts and aerospace ties are expected to continue fueling growth. While earnings are rear-facing, the emerging trends seen in the company&#8217;s Q1 results can serve as a foundation for further rewards for shareholders. In the first quarter, Palantir saw year-over-year revenue growth of 39%. U.S. commercial business surpassed a $1 billion run rate, good for 71% year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, its U.S. government revenue grew 45% year-over-year. In July, Mizuho upgraded Palantir to &#8220;Neutral&#8221; from &#8220;Underperform&#8221; with a price target of $135, up from $116. The firm views the company&#8217;s recent execution and momentum as &#8220;stunning,&#8221; including material upward estimate revisions across Palantir&#8217;s commercial and government segments, which Mizuho admits to &#8220;very much&#8221; underestimating. Palantir has a &#8220;legitimate chance&#8221; to accelerate revenue growth for a fifth consecutive quarter when reporting Q2 results in early August, Mizhuo told investors in a research note. However, PLTR&#8217;s market multiple implies it could take an investor nearly half a century to recover their initial investment, assuming earnings remained constant. But the assumption from the company — and from Wall Street analysts — is that earnings will continue to grow. EPS in Q1 2024, for example, stood at 8 cents, while EPS in Q1 2025 rose to 13 cents, good for an increase of 62.5%. So while there is concern about its valuation, what can investors expect from Palantir over the next year? 24/7 Wall St. did some analysis, so let’s take a look at. 24/7 Wall St. Insights: Palantir&#8217;s government line of business accounts for more than half of its revenue, with existing contracts between the AI firm and the U.S. Department of Defense, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Agriculture, the FBI, the CDC, the U.S. Army and the UK&#8217;s Ministry of Defence, to name a handful. The company&#8217;s explosive commercial revenue growth shows that it is capable of sustainably scaling without being overly reliant upon federal contracts. It also provides services to numerous industries, including energy, data protection, health and life sciences, insurance, hospital operations, retail, semiconductors, telecommunications and utilities, among others.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Palantir? The AI environment is ripe for growth, though, of which Palantir should play a major part. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to reach $1.811 trillion by the end of the decade, good for a 35.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2025 and 2030. The global market size of AI in 2024 was $279.2 billion, meaning at that forecasted CAGR, by the end of 2025, the market should expand to $379.4 billion. Companies like Palantir that focus on broad AI applications in diverse industries should see the lion&#8217;s share of that growth. Not only has the company seen sizable growth, it forecasts sustainable momentum that will help continue that pattern over the course of the next year. High-profile contracts, like the recently signed Army and ICE deals, as well as NATO’s adoption of its AI-enabled military system, highlight its critical role in national security. President Trump&#8217;s emphasis on defense and government efficiency, exemplified by the Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk, positions Palantir as a go-to AI software provider, boosting investor confidence amid tariff-related market challenges. Additionally, the company&#8217;s commercial segment has skyrocketed. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, empowers enterprises in healthcare, finance, and manufacturing to harness AI for data analytics. Palantir’s focus on operational efficiency has improved profitability. Its software-as-a-service model, with high-margin recurring revenue, supports scalability across government and commercial clients. The company’s ability to deploy AIP rapidly, as shown by a 69% increase in customer count to 593, enhances revenue predictability. This profitability, coupled with $3.9 billion in cash reserves, fuels R&amp;D and market expansion, reinforcing investor optimism. Palantir (PLTR) as a Stock Since its IPO, Palantir has seen uncommon and exponential share appreciation. An enormous part of that growth came between February 2023 and February 2025, during which time the stock reached its then-all-time-high on Feb. 18. Since its year-to-date low on Jan. 13, PLTR has gained more than 169%. Most Wall Street analysts are cautious about the stock, though. The 20 analysts covering PLTR assign it a consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating, with five analysts giving it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, 13 giving it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and two giving it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. However, price targets for the AI darling represent a vast spread of opinions, with the high-end price target at $182.00, the median price target at $150.60 and the low-end price target at $40.00. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $45.00 -76.16% Median $154.56 -18.14% High $196.00 3.80% Palantir Technologies 2025 Outlook Palantir has made several important announcements over the past few months, including its $10 billion Army deal and a $30 million contract with ICE to develop a system to help with deportations, as well as a partnership with TWG Global and xAI to bring AI to the financial services industry. That news has driven the stock higher in the short term. But as the broad market&#8217;s outlook remains clouded, so too does Palantir&#8217;s. That is reflected in Wall Street&#8217;s consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Palantir calls for a minimum 68% jump in commercial revenue to $1.178 billion, with CEO Alex Karp saying, &#8220;We are delivering the operating system for the modern enterprise in the era of AI.&#8221; While Palantir does face competition from both large AI Big Data forms, as well as smaller, fast-growing AI data analytics shops, the company can be seen as having an entrenched position within government and large enterprises. 24/7 Wall St.&#8217;s 12-month price target for Palantir Technologies is similarly bearish at $107, which represents potential downside of 43.33% from today&#8217;s stock price. Those figures are based on Palantir having developed the premier AI software, but the decreasing cost of AI and expansion of large language models to lower barriers to entrance in decision-making software. We see projected revenue growth rates moderating over time climb from $3.9 billion in 2025 to $11.9 billion in 2030, alongside normalized EPS growth of $0.58 in 2025 to $1.44 in 2030.

The company has been beating and raising with stellar figures every quarter, and the growth outlook is only getting better, with former bears turning into bulls. Investors on Wall Street are increasingly valuing it on free cash flow (FCF), because this is where Palantir&#8217;s actual value lies. Valuing it on future earnings gets you an absurd forward price-to-earnings ratio of 288 times. If you value it on cash flow, things look much better. FCF came in at $569 million with a margin of 57%. At this pace, we could be looking at $2.5 billion for all of 2025. That means you pay a 175 times forward FCF premium. This is slightly less absurd, but still something the market is willing to pay for a company that keeps landing contract after contract. So, should you go ahead and buy PLTR stock? I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s not a bad idea at all to have exposure to the hottest stock on the market. But should you put all your eggs into one basket? I don&#8217;t think so. This PLTR rally has not yet been tested by a bona fide bear market. If a 2022-esque downturn hits, no one knows how painful the downside may be. Thus, I&#8217;d hold other similar AI stocks alongside Palantir. Here are three that may surge soon. Key Points These AI stocks derive most of their revenue from the government and have a great track record. All of them are profitable, and these companies can capture more contracts. These stocks give you exposure to the government’s AI spending with less risk compared to PLTR. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

It has seen solid growth recently, and that growth has only accelerated after DOGE-related fears cooled off. These fears were replaced with optimism, as the Trump administration made a U-turn on defense spending. The 2026 proposed defense budget includes an increase of $156.2 billion. CACI competes directly with Palantir for many contracts, and both firms support U.S. military and government operations. The scope here is broader, and CACI goes beyond software. It posted solid Q2 earnings that beat analyst estimates. Revenue grew 13% year-over-year to $2.3 billion and beat analyst estimates of $2.29 billion. Adjusted EPS of $8.4 trounced analyst expectations of $6.58. The backlog also grew to $31 billion. I see the stock returning to its trajectory of consistency. It trades at just 18 times forward earnings and can pull off double-digit growth due to the increase in defense-related budgets. Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) is an IT consulting firm that sells its services to U.S. government agencies. It specializes in AI, cybersecurity, and tech-related fields and is a partner of Palantir. This company has a long history and has been active in the space sector, too. Booz Allen helped with the Hubble Space Telescope&#8217;s design and the Apollo 11 mission. Much like CACI, BAH stock declined significantly starting in November due to fears of the government cutting back on spending. BAH stock started stabilizing in June, and I see major upside potential ahead. You get a 1.97% dividend yield on top of the upside. Booz Allen is well-positioned to capture tailwinds from the growing federal AI and space budget. Q1 fiscal 2026 saw backlog of $38 billion. Revenue declined for the quarter, but management sees up to 4% full-year revenue growth. The consensus price target sees 20% upside in the next 12 months, but I believe it is poised to move towards the highest price target of $190 as government AI spending increases. Parsons Corporation (PSN) Parsons Corporation (NYSE:PSN) fell significantly earlier this year, much like the two other stocks on this list. It has already rebounded 40% from its trough, and I see more gains to come as 2025 comes to a close in the next four months. This company sells to U.S. government agencies like the Department of Defense and NASA. Parsons offers everything from data analytics to construction management and has been spearheading AI integration. The focus here is more on physical engineering and infrastructure. It posted a 5% revenue decline to $1.6 billion in Q2. However, this was mainly due to a confidential contract, and excluding it, revenue grew 13%. I believe Parsons should be back on track for the coming months, as the company raised its full-year 2025 guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and operating cash flow. Its Q2 backlog grew $111 million from the year-ago quarter to $8.9 billion. 70% of that backlog is already funded. Just this week, it got a $30 million multi-year contract from the Army.The post Forget Palantir: These 3 Undervalued AI Stocks Are Set to Surge appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/08/14/forget-palantir-these-3-undervalued-ai-stocks-are-set-to-surge/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/forget-palantir-these-3-undervalued-ai-stocks-are-set-20250814.jpg
