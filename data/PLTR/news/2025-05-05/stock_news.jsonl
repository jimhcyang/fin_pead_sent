Palantir stock sentiment before earnings drop 2:19 pm by Joel South Investor sentiment ahead of Palantir’s Q1 report appears cautiously optimistic but notably more tempered than in prior quarters. Capital IQ estimates show that while the mean EPS and revenue expectations remain solid, the spread in price targets — from $18 to $125 — reflects a growing divide over Palantir&#8217;s valuation. The average price target sits at $87.05, indicating that while bullishness persists, skepticism has grown louder. Recent commentary from analysts shows signs of recalibration. While Wedbush reaffirmed its bullish stance, calling Palantir an &#8220;AI pure-play poised to capitalize on enterprise modernization,&#8221; firms like JMP and Barclays have slightly lowered targets, citing valuation headwinds and elevated expectations already priced into the stock. Notably, no major downgrades occurred, but multiple firms noted that Palantir must deliver on margin expansion and commercial revenue conversion to sustain current levels. During the Q4 2024 earnings call, CFO David Glazer reaffirmed a strategy of &#8220;profitable growth,&#8221; which was met positively by long-term holders. The company&#8217;s guidance — specifically its continued expectation of GAAP profitability and strong free cash flow — may insulate sentiment in case of a modest revenue miss. This section will continue tracking updated research notes and model revisions post-call, especially from institutions like Morgan Stanley, ARK Invest, and BofA. Palantir International outlook 2:10 pm Palantir’s global footprint has quietly expanded in parallel with its U.S. commercial surge. Over the past year, international revenue has accounted for an increasingly important share of overall growth, particularly through its strategic focus on European defense alliances, health systems, and infrastructure partnerships. During the Q4 2024 earnings call, COO Shyam Sankar pointed to meaningful traction across NATO-aligned nations, including expansions in the U.K., Germany, and Eastern Europe tied to defense intelligence operations. One of the company’s most prominent wins was a renewal and expansion of its contract with the U.K. National Health Service (NHS), where Palantir’s Foundry platform has been used to manage data across COVID-era and post-pandemic workflows. Additionally, Palantir’s role in logistics, border protection, and humanitarian data coordination has been spotlighted in joint European Commission engagements. International commercial efforts have also been buoyed by AIP pilot programs with major industrial and automotive manufacturers in France and South Korea. Sankar noted that non-U.S. clients increasingly seek vertically integrated AI solutions with real-time operational applications, a shift away from traditional analytics tools. The company emphasized its scalable go-to-market motion in international markets, leveraging pre-built solutions and deployment accelerators. As of Q1, Palantir has field operations and strategic deals in more than 30 countries. Today’s earnings and call commentary could provide additional detail on expansion velocity outside the U.S. and how geopolitical complexity — from Ukraine to APAC supply chains — is shaping the company’s international product strategy. Looking at Palantir&#039;s past quarters 1:57 pm by Joel South Palantir’s Q1 2025 performance will arrive against a backdrop of consistent revenue growth and continued profitability momentum throughout fiscal 2024. Here&#8217;s how the company has performed over the previous four quarters: Quarter Revenue Adjusted EPS GAAP EPS Commercial YoY Growth Gov’t YoY Growth Q4 2024 $608.4M $0.08 $0.04 +32% +11% Q3 2024 $558.2M $0.07 $0.03 +33% +12% Q2 2024 $533.3M $0.05 $0.01 +35% +15% Q1 2024 $525.2M $0.05 $0.04 +26% +20% The Street expects Q1 2025 revenue of $862.13M, a jump that reflects the reclassification of segment reporting following Palantir’s late-2024 accounting update — now bundling U.S. and international commercial performance separately from government. The sharp increase also underscores the momentum of Palantir&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which has reportedly seen deployment across more than 450 enterprises. Margins have steadily improved throughout FY24, with operating income expanding quarter over quarter and free cash flow rising above $700M for the year. Notably, Palantir achieved GAAP profitability in each quarter of 2024 — a milestone that CEO Alex Karp described as a “new era” for the company during the Q4 call. What’s at stake today is whether this trajectory holds — particularly for U.S. commercial, which grew 70% YoY in FY24. Any signs of deceleration in deal volume, seat expansion, or margin degradation could reset expectations, especially given the company’s elevated valuation. Analysts and investors will closely track how Q1 stacks up not just against expectations, but against the arc of 2024’s quarterly performance. A clear inflection or plateau in commercial metrics could dictate how the market responds. Wall Street buzz on Palantir 1:23 pm by Joel South Morgan Stanley: “AI buzz is priced in — execution now must deliver. Margin discipline and real-world conversion metrics will separate hype from delivery.” Wedbush: “We see upside risk to both margins and topline this quarter. AIP continues to gain ground across critical industries.” BofA: “We remain cautiously optimistic. Expect elevated scrutiny on commercial churn, international traction, and government backlog.” Palantir a consensus &quot;hold&quot; 12:50 pm by Joel South Of the 25 analysts currently covering Palantir, the consensus recommendation is a &#8220;hold&#8221;. After soaring just under 400% over the past year, analysts are concerned the stock is a bit expensive. Palantir earnings: What to watch for by business unit 11:29 am by Joel South Palantir’s dual business model — enterprise AI and government solutions — remains its key narrative lever. U.S. commercial revenue now makes up over 30% of total revenue, a rapid shift from prior years when government contracts dominated. In recent quarters, the company’s growth has been particularly driven by adoption of AIP across non-traditional verticals. Healthcare systems, logistics operators, and industrial conglomerates are among the newer cohort of users. Palantir’s Foundry platform is also being embedded into long-term digital transformation initiatives, which bodes well for retention. That said, government revenue still accounts for a substantial portion of the business — roughly 60% — and investors are looking for signs of new contract wins or renewals tied to NATO partners or Department of Defense expansion. Management has signaled a strong pipeline, but details remain thin ahead of the call. This quarter may provide the first clean read on how sustainable AIP monetization really is — and whether the growth is broad-based or driven by one-off pilots. Analysts will want clarity on pricing tiers, seat expansion, and margins tied to newer customer cohorts. Wall Streets expectations for Palantir&#039;s earnings 10:19 am by Joel South Wall Street is forecasting Q1 revenue of $862.13 million, marking nearly 20% growth year-over-year, with adjusted EPS pegged at $0.13. EBITDA is expected to come in at $374.49 million, according to consensus data from Capital IQ. The Street&#8217;s numbers reflect expectations that Palantir’s commercial momentum — particularly in the U.S. — will continue to drive incremental upside. That view is anchored in strong pilot-to-deployment conversion metrics and increased enterprise AIP usage. Notably, the range of revenue estimates is fairly tight ($858M–$862M), implying high conviction in management&#8217;s guidance. The tighter spread also raises the bar for any potential “beat,” making guidance language and commentary on AIP usage critical to sustaining momentum post-release. EPS estimates suggest investors expect Palantir to maintain operating leverage even while scaling up customer deployments. Analysts will likely scrutinize margin trends in both the government and commercial businesses, looking for signals that cost discipline remains intact despite growth. Palantir on a tear heading into earnings 9:48 am by Joel South Palantir enters earnings day trading near 52-week highs, riding a wave of enthusiasm around artificial intelligence adoption in enterprise and defense. The stock is up over 300% year-over-year, one of the best performers among large-cap software names. Fueling the momentum is the perceived commercial success of AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform), which Palantir claims is gaining traction across a growing set of U.S. and international customers. CEO Alex Karp has repeatedly stated that demand for AI is not just hype — it’s an operational transformation. In his shareholder letter, he noted, “We are not chasing the AI opportunity. We created it.” He has emphasized that AIP is now being embedded within the workflows of healthcare, automotive, energy, and manufacturing clients, offering both tactical tools and long-term intelligence infrastructure. Despite strong enthusiasm, the stock&#8217;s valuation remains a key discussion point. Palantir trades at over 15x forward revenue, above peers like Snowflake and Datadog. Bulls point to its margin profile, government backlog, and long-term AI tailwinds. Bears argue that commercial revenue needs to consistently outperform to justify its premium. With GAAP profitability intact and FCF margins improving, today’s numbers will provide further clarity on whether this AI rally is built on fundamentals. Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) will report its Q1 2025 financial results today, after the market closes. Analysts expect revenue of $862.13 million and earnings per share of $0.13, according to Capital IQ. Palantir enters the day as one of the market’s most-watched enterprise AI names. From a company long known for classified government contracts and opaque deployments, it has transformed into a central figure in the commercialization of artificial intelligence — with a fast-growing U.S. commercial business and an enterprise AI platform, AIP, that management calls the most successful product in the company’s history. Founder and CEO Alex Karp has framed 2024 as a turning point for AI monetization, calling Palantir “10 years ahead” of others. In Q4, the company reached 2.2 million subscribers, while reporting GAAP profitability for a sixth consecutive quarter. The business model, long viewed as niche and government-centric, is now being redefined through AIP pilots across 45 Fortune 500 companies. Palantir’s financial story has caught up with its narrative. FY24 revenue reached $2.87 billion, with U.S. commercial growing 70% year-over-year. The company also posted strong operating leverage and free cash flow while keeping headcount flat — a signal of scale without bloat. CFO David Glazer has emphasized margin discipline even amid heavy enterprise demand. Today’s Q1 results will test whether Palantir can sustain that dual-engine momentum — with government revenue holding steady and commercial continuing to scale. AIP usage, commercial conversion rates, and potential commentary on NATO-related partnerships will be focal points. Investors will also be listening for any revisions to full-year guidance or updates on new product lines.

S&amp;P 500 This Week 10:15 am by Gerelyn Terzo Despite today&#8217;s gains, the S&amp;P 500 remains modestly lower for the week, with a 0.06% decline as of Friday morning. There&#8217;s still time for the index to push even higher, especially if the White House announces further tariff agreements with international trade partners. CNBC reported that the broader market index remains mired below a key resistance level, making it difficult for it to break out higher. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Tariffs are having a live by the sword, die by the sword effect, and today that is translating to gains. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from over 100% to 80%, saying that level seems reasonable as Washington, D.C. gears up for negotiations with Beijing. Stocks are rightfully cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning but keeping it modest. The SPX ETF is gaining 0.25% as of morning trading. China could be the first of many tariff deals in the works with U.S. trade partners, according to the White House, further lifting market sentiment. Most sectors of the economy are moving higher, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are participating in the gains, with Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) rising 1% while Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is adding 6.8%. TSLA stock is on its way to reclaiming a $1 trillion market cap. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is being lifted in part by Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock on a desirable Dreamliners jet order from the British Airways parent company. BA stock is up 1.4%. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 82.49 (+0.20%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 114.14 (+0.63%) S&amp;P 500: Up 22.51 (+0.40%) Market Movers Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) might be a volatile play, but it&#8217;s also one of the leading tech stocks. As of Thursday, Palantir was added to the top-10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, with a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. Comparatively, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers below that level at $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is taking it on the chin today, down fractionally. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is skyrocketing by over 20% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue soared by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%. Lyft (Nasdaq: LYFT) stock is climbing 20.3% higher today after lifting its Q2 forecast and initiating a $750 million share buyback program. Most Wall Street analysts have a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock. Expedia Group (Nasdaq: EXPE) is down 7.3% on the day on a Wall Street downgrade to &#8220;underweight&#8221; by Piper Sandler analysts.

Recently, it has traded down only 7% for the year. It has only been a quarter of a century since the last market wipeout. The Nasdaq dropped 75% from March 2000 to October 2002. Most of the reason was the .com companies had raised too much money as their losses mounted, and the value of their business models was viewed as unsustainable. Key Points The Market Could Drop 50% Trillions Of Dollars Would Disappear Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The most notable part of the market crash was that it destroyed company stocks with strong business models that are today&#8217;s market titans, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). When the market imploded, Microsoft’s market cap dropped 65%. If the market dropped 75% today, the Nasdaq would collapse from 17,100 to 4,475, and its market value would collapse by $23 trillion, hammering the wealth of many Americans. It is worth noting that the 2000 to 2022 Nasdaq market collapse was not accompanied by a significant recession. GDP fell only .3% in that period, and unemployment rose to 5.5%. That is hardly a recession at all. One of the first signs of a new, sharp market drop is that stocks in the AI craze have started to crater. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), considered the No. 2 AI chip maker, traded at $227 in March last year. A few weeks ago, it dropped to $88 and has since recovered to $102. Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) reached $125 in February last year. It dropped to $74 early last month, a 40% drop. It recently moved up to $117. What is critical about Palantir and AMD is that they are remarkably healthy companies with growing revenue and what appear to be successful models, unlike the .com companies of 2000 and 2002. Nevertheless, their shares collapsed. If there is a massive market sell-off, it would happen for one of two reasons. The first is that the huge bet on AI falters. It could. Companies could get “out over their skis.” Meta (NASDAQ: META) says it will invest $50 billion to $75 billion in AI this year. Microsoft has pegged its investment at $80 billion for the same period. AI is supposed to change the world. Many public companies with prospects driven by AI investments are supposed to have tremendous revenue growth unless they don’t. The other threat to the market is hyperinflation. Inflation rose to 14% in 1979. If there is a similar problem this year, it will be because of tariffs, which could be as high as 100% on Chinese goods. The inflationary problem would ripple across the US economy in months. Sixty percent of US adults own stocks. That statistic says everything.
