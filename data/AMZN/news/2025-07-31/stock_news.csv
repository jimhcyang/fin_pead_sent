Here’s the Smartest Way to Turn It Into Monthly Passive Income","Key Points The SPHD and DIVO ETFs are ideal vehicles for volatility mitigation and reliable income. Furthermore, you can enhance your monthly income potential with single-stock ETFs. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) If you&#8217;re fortunate enough to inherit $400,000, it may be tempting to spend that money on cars and vacations. However, the smart-money move is to invest the funds wisely and plan for your financial future. One approach is to invest that $400,000 in exchange traded funds (ETFs) that provide passive income every month. That way, you can reinvest the cash distributions and take advantage of the compounding effect. So now, it&#8217;s time to reveal four funds that unlock monthly income opportunities so you can turn your inheritance into a cash-producing machine. SPHD: A Reliable Pick for Low Volatility $400,000 is a whole lot of money to inherit and invest. Therefore, your first priority shouldn&#8217;t be maximizing your monthly dividends. Instead, it should be mitigating your risk so you don&#8217;t lose all of that money. When safety and reliability are your top priorities, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA:SPHD) is a solid pick. This fund has 52 stocks in its holdings, all carefully selected from the S&amp;P 500 large-cap stock index. The SPHD ETF specifically chooses stocks &#8220;that historically have provided high dividend yields and low volatility.&#8221; Examples include Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Realty Income Corp. (NYSE:O), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Altria Group (NYSE:MO). These companies are known for providing consistent dividend payments, and their stocks typically aren&#8217;t volatile. Furthermore, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF features a 12-month distribution rate (i.e., a forward annual dividend yield) of 3.44%. Plus, the SPHD ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. With all of that in mind, you could take $150,000 of your inherited $400,000, put it into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF, and sleep soundly at night. Stay in the Safe Lane With DIVO With $400,000 to invest, you&#8217;ll have a large account and there&#8217;s no need to drive in the fast lane. Instead, you can stay in the &#8220;safe lane&#8221; but still get a passive income stream with the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO). Much like the SPHD ETF, the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF seeks to reduce share-price volatility while providing exposure to high-quality dividend-paying companies. Moreover, like the other funds mentioned today, DIVO puts cash distributions into your account on a monthly basis. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF has 24 stocks in its holdings, and you&#8217;ll see plenty of large-cap sector leaders in there. Among the top holdings in the DIVO ETF are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Visa (NYSE:V), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Again, we&#8217;re choosing safety first and then aiming for good yield. Since the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF invests in great companies and features an impressive 4.73% annual distribution rate, it checks all the right boxes. Thus, it would make sense to allocate $150,000 of a $400,000 inheritance toward the DIVO ETF. Accelerate Your Yield With Single-Stock ETFs It&#8217;s wise to dedicate $300,000 of your $400,000 inheritance toward diversified low-volatility funds like SPHD and DIVO. If you do that, then you can invest the remaining $100,000 in ETFs with greater risk but also higher yields. To that end, YieldMax offers a wide variety of ETFs that each focus on a single stock instead of a diversified basket of stocks. Typically, these YieldMax ETFs derive monthly income from U.S. Treasury bonds and sophisticated options-trading strategies. One way to reduce the risk is to stick to YieldMax ETFs that focus on established large-cap companies. For example, the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:APLY) indirectly derives income from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. Currently, the APLY ETF advertises an annual distribution rate of 26.99%. This fund shouldn&#8217;t be excessively risky as Apple is a reliable blue-chip business with staying power. So, you could invest $25,000 of your $400,000 inheritance in the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF. A reasonable plan would be to pick four single-stock ETFs with a focus on high-confidence companies. Then, you could allocate $25,000 toward each of the four funds you picked. A Mixed-Risk Approach APLY is just one example of many monthly-paying single-stock ETFs you can choose from. Here&#8217;s a summary of other funds in this category, and while you explore them, you might think about picking your four favorites: The YieldMax AMZN Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMZY); based on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock; 47.82% annual distribution rate The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY); based on NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock; 74.99% annual distribution rate The YieldMax GOOGL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:GOOY); based on the stock of Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL); 32.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax MSFT Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSFO); based on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock; 34.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax JPM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:JPMO); based on JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock; 39% annual distribution rate The YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMDY); based on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock; 68.07% annual distribution rate The YieldMax DIS Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:DISO); based on Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock; 38.55% annual distribution rate The YieldMax XOM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:XOMO); based on Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock; 38.04% annual distribution rate Just to provide an idea of what your overall plan might look like, you could invest $150,000 in SPHD, $150,000 in DIVO, and $25,000 each in APLY, MSFO, DISO, and XOMO. All in all, you can mix low-risk ETFs with a handful of higher-risk ETFs to turn your inherited $400,000 into a fairly reliable monthly income-producing machine.The post Inherited $400,000?

In July, Piper Sandler raised the firm&#8217;s price target for MSFT to $600 from $475 while keeping its &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating. The firm highlighted Microsoft&#8217;s bullish spending backdrop for AI infrastructure. Specifically, Piper Sandler noted that Azure spending intentions surpassed 80% for the first time, retaining the top role as the cloud and AI infrastructure platform of choice. On June 5, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 33% in FY25 Q3, driven by AI services. When the company last reported earnings, it announced that total revenue rose 13% to $70.1 billion and it generated earnings of $3.46 per share, beating estimates of $3.22 per share. Despite a $800 million charge last quarter from its investment in General Motors&#8216; (NYSE:GM) Cruise robotaxi initiative that the automaker subsequently shutdown, Microsoft’s focus on AI and cloud resilience continues to fuel optimism. However, its decision earlier in May fire 6,000 employees — or 3% of its workforce — signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth. Key Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms. Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines. If you’re looking for an AI stock early in the AI growth cycle, grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. It has a software stock that could ride dominance in AI to returns of 10x or more. Why Invest in Microsoft Microsoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S. Its Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon&#8216;s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. When Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20. Microsoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect Q4 capex to remain elevated at $16 billion to $17 billion to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth. Tariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&amp;D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year. Beyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft&#8217;s AI and cloud momentum. Microsoft As a Stock Earlier in June, Citi raised its price target for MSFT to $605 from $540 while maintaining its &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. The firm also added an &#8220;upside 90-day catalyst watch&#8221; on the shares. Citi says Microsoft remains its top pick in software given the company&#8217;s &#8220;relative defensiveness in a choppy macro environment,&#8221; AI product cycle and &#8220;reinforced conviction&#8221; that Street estimates on Azure may be too low for fiscal 2026. The firm believes the share catalyst will be fiscal Q4 earnings when fiscal 2026 guidance is announced and beyond as both Microsoft and OpenAI AI revenue continue to ramp. Citi says Azure has &#8220;hit an inflection&#8221; based on its exit rate math and token usage. In late June, Wedbush raised its price target on Microsoft to $600 from $515, maintaining its &#8220;Outperform&#8221; rating. The firm is &#8220;incrementally bullish&#8221; on Microsoft following recent AI customer checks in the field. Wedbush says a &#8220;massive adoption wave of Copilot and Azure monetization now on the doorstep&#8221; for the company. Similarly, Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target on Microsoft to $530 from $482, maintaining its &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating on the shares after the firm updated its capex-implied AI revenue analysis and its OpenAI model detailing the contribution to Azure. Broadly, Wall Street analysts&#8217; remain bullish, with 32 of 35 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, three assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and zero assigning it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Wall Street&#8217;s price targets cover a significant range, spanning $475 per share on the low end to $605 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $528.35, which represents 4.93% potential upside from today&#8217;s share price. Institutional ownership currently stands at 73.03%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $475 -6.31% Median $535.87 5.69% High $605 19.32% Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s 33% Azure growth and 20% cloud revenue increase in Q3 position it for AI market gains. However, $20 billion quarterly capex and tariff risks require caution. Its $80 billion cash reserve and Oracle partnership offer stability, making MSFT stock a buy for growth investors, even as valuation concerns linger. 24/7 Wall St.’s price target for Microsoft is $495.00, implying downside potential of 2.36% from the stock&#8217;s current price. This cautious target reflects Azure’s strength and Q4 revenue guidance of $73.7 billion, balanced against the need for higher capex spending and potential supply chain disruptions, positioning it at a realistic estimate of its leading presence in the space.The post Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/17/microsoft-nasdaq-msft-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-where-will-it-be-in-1-year/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/microsoft-nasdaq-msft-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-where-20250717.jpg

(NASDAQ:AMZN) gained 0.57% over the past five trading sessions, bringing the e-commerce and cloud storage solutions stock&#8217;s year-to-date gain to 3.24%. Over the past year, it is up 24.54%. On July 8, it was reported that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sold nearly three million shares worth $665.8 million over two days in July as part of a plan announced earlier in 2025 that will see Bezos unload up to 25 million shares through May 2026. In June and July the stock saw a series of adjusted price targets from analysts. Cantor Fitzgerald raised its price target on AMZN to $260 from $240 while maintaining an &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating. Truist raised its price target on AMZN to $250 from $226 while maintaining a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. Bank of America raised the its price target on AMZN to $248 from $230 while maintaining its &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. Piper Sandler raised its price target on AMZN to $250 from $212 while maintaining an &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating. Amazon announced in July that it has deployed its 1 millionth robot while also deploying its new AI foundation model to power its robotic fleet. Its first twelfth generation automated fulfillment center launched in late-2024 and the robots are primarily focused on delivery station efficiencies. The robotics cycle is &#8220;early,&#8221; according to Bank of America&#8217;s analyst, who expects Amazon to leverage robots to reduce labor dependency, increase order accuracy and improve warehouse efficiency, driving material cost savings. In its first-quarter earnings call, Amazon reported that Q1 revenue growth and an operating income increase. Amazon Ads generated $13.9 billion in revenue alone, representing a 19% year-over-year increase, while AWS grew by 17% year-over-year to an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. Still, the stock remains down nearly 15% from its all-time high on Feb. 4, with its one-year gain now standing at 15.87%. The company plans to announce Q2 financials on Thursday, Aug. 1. Still, while there can be little doubt about its current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Amazon? In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,188%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Since hitting its all-time high on Feb. 4, the stock has lost nearly 6%. Note that Wall Street analysts&#8217; median price target of $251.44 is above Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year. Of the 45 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Loop Capital and Wells Fargo recently reiterated buy-equivalent ratings, and with 65.25% of shares held by institutional investors — including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 2,976 position increases versus 2,361 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $195.00 -14.22% Median $250.95 11.83% High $305.00 34.15% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumer spending has rebounded in the wake of Trump&#8217;s tariff threats and subsequent pauses, which could help GDP in Q2 after it contracted GDP in Q1, raising the risks of a possible recession in 2025. Over the past three months, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed the third best, posting a gain of 19.83%, trailing only technology (35.27%) and industrials (20.88%). While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.

Media companies like Disney (NYSE: DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery appear structurally disadvantaged in streaming, while Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) use video content primarily to support unrelated core businesses like Prime and hardware. Investors who hold Alphabet could benefit significantly if YouTube is spun off, with a valuation comparable to Netflix’s $500+ billion market cap. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

[00:00:10] Lee Jackson: If that could be true. [00:00:12] Douglas: There was a story today in the New York Times that said there are only two VOD companies in the world, Netflix and YouTube. There&#8217;s, they said no one else matters. You know, so if you&#8217;re Amazon Prime video, if you&#8217;re Disney, they said, forget it. There&#8217;s a, this is a two horse race. Now at this point, if you take people looking at paid video online, [00:00:39] Lee Jackson: Right. [00:00:40] Douglas: has more people doing that Netflix, and to me it tells you three things. [00:00:48] Douglas: The first one is, is it sort of makes Netflix a buy. It sort of makes it a sell. It&#8217;s being mentioned as in the same breath as YouTube is the leader. if YouTube is gaining that much market share, then even Netflix has to, you know, management has to be worried about it. [00:01:08] Douglas: but the other thing is, is that if you look at all the other companies, like if it&#8217;s Disney, if it&#8217;s Warner, what the this story is saying is those people have now fallen so far behind that they can&#8217;t ever catch up. And as they will be permanently way, way behind. [00:01:32] Lee Jackson: Well, I think you&#8217;re right. And it, and it&#8217;s interesting because we&#8217;ve talked in previous videos about, you know, the breakup of Google may be coming. How valuable would YouTube be in that equation? I mean, the, the thing that&#8217;s so great about YouTube and, and I swear to God, everybody watching this will nod their head and go, yes, there&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t learn how to fix, take apart, do, or whatever, without saying. [00:02:01] Lee Jackson: I don&#8217;t know how to do this. I&#8217;m gonna get on YouTube and see how to do this and, and that Netflix doesn&#8217;t offer Amazon Prime and, and other video, they don&#8217;t offer that. So I think you&#8217;re right. They dominate an area that is such a wide moat that I don&#8217;t know if anybody can compete with that. [00:02:19] Douglas: here, here&#8217;s something interesting. So. I want you to think about this for a second. Netflix market cap is $537 billion. All right? If you look at Alphabet&#8217;s value, total valuation, I&#8217;m gonna guess that&#8217;s about half. Maybe, [00:02:41] Douglas: know, I mean, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s meaningful. If I&#8217;m doing a sum of the parts valuation [00:02:53] Douglas: very valuable. But if you just give it the valuation that you&#8217;re giving Netflix, you&#8217;re giving it a 500 or $600 billion valuation, which means means in a alphabet breakup, you may do really well. Just holding onto that. [00:03:18] Lee Jackson: they all did great when they broke up big, big companies. So, I mean, the, the, the story of GE (NYSE: GE) is just phenomenal. All the breakups, and then they were booted. You know, one of, one of the original members of the Dow Jones Industrial average was booted. [00:03:38] Douglas: kicked it out. Well, there&#8217;s another part to this, which is think important for investors. If this analysis is true, Disney is never going to make any real money on their streaming business. [00:04:05] Douglas: you&#8217;re never gonna be a really, really big player. I mean, you&#8217;re never, ever gonna be, look, I don&#8217;t care what people say, Amazon Prime video is there because they want to keep people glued to prime. [00:04:21] Douglas: Prime&#8217;s a huge money maker for Amazon. [00:04:50] Douglas: once you turn to all the other people. Who are media companies trying to, you know, stream media assets and that&#8217;s crummy. The only other guys I can think of who do it for an insane reason is Apple. Apple spends hundreds and hundreds. I mean, I don&#8217;t even wanna think what they spend, but it&#8217;s a way to make people glued to the device. [00:05:51] Douglas: so if you, if you believe, what I think is becoming the conventional wisdom, two things you wanna own, if you believe in streaming, are Netflix. [00:06:02] Douglas: own Alphabet because in the breakup you get, [00:06:06] Lee Jackson: You&#8217;ll get your share of the YouTube chunk. Yeah. Alright, so, we&#8217;re still, we&#8217;re pretty much a fan of Google at these, at these levels, aren&#8217;t we? [00:06:18] Douglas: I&#8217;m a fan of that. We are now listing many, many more reasons that we&#8217;re Alphabet fans, so The post Google&#8217;s Best Business Isn&#8217;t What You Think appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/22/googles-best-business-isnt-what-you-think/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/googles-best-business-isnt-what-you-think-20250723.jpg

The sector is too competitive for any company to have a reputation that is less than stellar. Among 13 streaming services, Disney+ ranked 11th, and ESPN+, which Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) also owns, finished last. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: The Disney+ streaming service unexpectedly received a low rating in the new American Customer Satisfaction Index. ESPN+ tumbled even more. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The industry overall had a rating of 78 on a system that is based on consumer ratings, where services are evaluated on a scale of 0 to 100. The industry’s overall rating dropped by 1% from 2024 to 2025. Disney+ received a rating of 75, a decline of 3%. ESPN+ had the largest fall among all services, down 8% to 69. Ratings were based on several factors from a survey that was in the field for 15 months, concluding in June 2025. The ACSI Entertainment Study 2025, which includes streaming services, is based on 24,879 completed surveys. Among the factors used in the streaming ratings were the quality of mobile apps, the reliability of the mobile app, ease of billing, website satisfaction, quality of original programming, number of movies available, number of TV shows available, availability of past TV shows, call center satisfaction, and range of sports programming, among others. Industry leader Netflix had a rating of 79, the same as last year. The other giant in the field, Amazon Prime Video, had a rating of 82, down 4%. YouTube Premium, which is emerging as a possible industry leader, had a rating of 80, unchanged from the previous year. Disney+ has had a mediocre performance since its introduction in November 2019. It lost billions of dollars over several years and began to make a profit in the most recent year. In its most recent earnings release, Disney reported that Disney+ had 126 million subscribers. Revenue for Disney+ and Hulu remained modest. In the most recent quarter, Disney+ reported revenue of $6.12 billion and an operating profit of only $336 million. By comparison, Netflix reported $11.1 billion in revenue and $3.8 billion in operating income for its most recent quarter. In a market where Disney is positioned in the second tier—below Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube—customer satisfaction is crucial.

Smaller allocations into SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV will help you build a low-fee passive income foundation. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) How far can $25,000 get you? If you have a well-considered plan in place, you can actually turn your small account into a passive income factory. This can be done with a carefully selected group of high-yield, low-fee exchange traded funds (ETFs). With just $25,000, you can build a super-low-cost portfolio that consistently pays you cash dividends/distributions. Plus, you can de-risk your portfolio through multi-sector diversification and investment in famous large-cap companies. So, let&#8217;s start right now with a smart-money plan to extract sizable cash payouts from a small but growing account. Start With RSPA for Extra Diversification Out of a $25,000 account, you can confidently put $10,000 into just one ETF. That&#8217;s because the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF (NYSEARCA:RSPA) checks all of the right boxes for a small-sized high-growth portfolio. To populate a small-sized portfolio, I would want to use funds that invest in successful, blue-chip business. I would also insist that the ETFs should be diversified and need to have annual operating expenses below 0.5%. With a focus on companies in the prestigious S&amp;P 500 index, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF has 525 stocks in its holdings. Suffice it to say, then, that the RSPA ETF is widely diversified. When you examine the fund&#8217;s holdings list, you&#8217;ll find established large-cap leaders across multiple economic sectors. Some examples are Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED). An interesting feature of the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF is that each of the holdings has a small, roughly equal weighing to the other stocks in the fund. That way, you won&#8217;t over-invest in any single stock. In addition, the RSPA ETF is low-cost as it only deducts annualized operating fees of 0.29%. And for all of you yield hunters out there, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF currently features a 12-month distribution rate of 9.42%. All in all, this ultra-diversified fund is ideal for a $25,000 account and I would feel comfortable dedicating $10,000 toward RSPA. Expand Your Portfolio With SCHD and JEPQ Even though the RSPA ETF would already expose you to 500+ stocks, you still probably wouldn&#8217;t want to toss your entire $25,000 into just one fund. Consequently, we will now explore three more ETFs and, after conducting your own due diligence, you could invest $5,000 in each one of them. The first of these three intriguing funds is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and has a portfolio comprising 103 stocks. Again, we&#8217;re looking for famous large-cap names and multi-sector diversification. The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF meets these expectations with recognizable stocks like Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Merck (NYSE:MRK), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF serves up a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.87% but only deducts 0.06% worth of annual operating expenses. Therefore, investors should have no objections to allocating $5,000 toward the SCHD ETF. Next up is the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ), which is centered around the technology-focused NASDAQ 100 index. This fund includes 107 stocks so you can participate in the growth of tech&#8217;s heavy hitters, such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Committing $5,000 of your $25,000 portfolio to the JEPQ ETF will unlock extra share-price appreciation potential from a variety of top tech firms. You&#8217;ll also get access to substantial cash distributions as the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF features an impressive 11.52% annual yield. We&#8217;re still sticking to the low-cost theme here since JEPQ only deducts operating fees of 0.35% per year. So, why not add some technology-fueled firepower to your small portfolio with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF? Round It Out With FDVV To round out your $25,000 passive-income plan, you could assign $5,000 toward the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:FDVV). Instead of concentrating on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, or NASDAQ 100, the FVDD ETF corresponds to the Fidelity High Dividend Index. Among the holdings list of the Fidelity High Dividend ETF, you&#8217;ll find large-cap superstars like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Visa (NYSE:V), Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Overall, you&#8217;ll get exposure to plenty of consistent dividend deliverers with FDVV. The other need-to-know stats are that the Fidelity High Dividend ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.07% but only deducts 0.16% in annualized operating expenses. With all of those benefits in mind, you can proudly add $5,000 worth of FDVV shares to your $25,000 account. Now, you&#8217;ve got a four-pack of funds with RSPA as your anchor as well as SCHD, JEPQ, and FDVV for extra diversification. That&#8217;s a savvy plan to keep the fees to a minimum while turning your $25,000 account into a low-risk regular income producer.The post How to Build a Super Low Cost Passive Income Fund for Only $25,000 appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/23/how-to-build-a-super-low-cost-passive-income-fund-for-only-25000/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/how-to-build-a-super-low-cost-passive-income-20250723.jpg

GLD, VYM, and QQQ have the potential to outpace S&amp;P 500. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) 2025 hasn’t been a smooth ride. The economy has seen volatility, the market has seen several ups and downs, and investors are scrambling to look for low-risk options to invest their money. There are concerns about the impact of tariffs, and consumer spending is low. Amidst the uncertainty, the only way to invest is to look for low-volatility investment options that can generate steady income. Exchange-traded funds have emerged as one of the top investment options this year. They allow investors to own a collection of stocks with just one investment and at a low cost. I was a die-hard fan of mutual funds, but the returns weren’t satisfactory, which is why I decided to make a switch to ETFs. With thousands of ETFs to choose from, it can become overwhelming, and the industry is getting more crowded. Here are the top 3 I invested in. SPDR Gold Shares Gold has always been considered a hedge against inflation, and the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) ETF is a top choice amid uncertain markets. Launched by State Street Global Advisors, the ETF is traded on exchanges in Hong Kong, Mexico, Japan, and Singapore. It is a trust that purchases, stores, and sells gold bullion, allowing investors to capitalize on rising gold prices. It has a low expense ratio of 0.40% and is the largest gold ETF in the market. Its NAV has soared over 40% in a year and about 12% in five years. The fund launched in 2004 and has kept pace with the S&amp;P 500 over the years. Gold prices will fluctuate in the short term, but the past year has seen a steady upside. Geopolitical tensions and the expanding money supply have lifted the commodity’s value. GLD is a defensive investment, and it brings stability to my portfolio. It is easier for me to pay the annual management fee as compared to buying and storing gold bullion. This ETF has become a centrepiece of my portfolio. Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF A reliable dividend ETF by Vanguard, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSE: VYM) has a strong history of delivering steady income and capital appreciation. It has an expense ratio of 0.06% and it tracks the performance of FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. VYM has a yield of 2.57% and holds 582 stocks. The sector distribution includes: Financials: 21.50% Industrials: 13.40% Technology: 12.30% Healthcare: 12.10% It holds some of the biggest dividend paying companies in the top 10, including Walmart, AbbVie, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Exxon Mobil. The ETF pays quarterly dividends, and the strong portfolio allows it to remain consistent at it. VYM has generated double-digit annualized market returns with a return of 10.4% in 5 years and 12.4% in the past year. The fund is filled with large-cap stocks that have a stable balance sheet and a record of strong financial performance. Despite market volatility, the fund has remained resilient and outperformed the S&amp;P 500. It offers a safety net and steady dividend income. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) I believe in the future of tech and wanted to make the most of the sector. Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) allows me to do that. It holds the Magnificent Seven and has a yield of 0.58%. The fund is known for its impressive capital appreciation. QQQ tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100 index and has the 100 largest companies listed on the stock exchange. It aims for high growth while providing exposure to the best U.S. non-financial companies. It is a tech-focused ETF with over 50% allocation to tech stocks, followed by 19.66% in consumer staples and 5.80% in healthcare. It is top heavy with the 10 holdings making up 51% of the portfolio and these include the Magnificent Seven like Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Apple. Slightly on the expensive side, QQQ has an NAV of 530.82 and is up 16% in 12 months. The NAV has soared over 100% in the past five years, generating impressive gains for investors. As long as the tech sector continues to expand, QQQ is set to benefit.

In addition to outperforming the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s gain of 8.61% in 2025, O has provided shareholders with a dividend currently yielding 5.60%. Realty Income remains a staple in dividend investors&#8217; portfolios. The commercial REIT dividend — which pays out monthly and has for 659 consecutive months — is a large reason investors are confident in the stock moving forward. Another reason: its expanding footprint in the European market that has seen commercial properties with long-term net lease agreements added to its +13,000-property portfolio in the U.K., Spain and other countries. Billing itself &#8220;The Monthly Dividend Company,&#8221; the real estate investment trust (REIT) blazed a new path in the field that numerous other REITs now follow. The track record of payments for O is remarkable, and since being listed on the NYSE in 1994, the REIT has increased its dividend every quarter. Having raised the payout for 30 consecutive years, Realty Income is now a Dividend Aristocrat, or a stock that is part of the S&amp;P 500 and has increased its dividend for 25 consecutive years or more. Since its IPO in 1994, Realty Income has provided investors with a 589.46% return, not including reinvested dividends. The question is, where does Realty Income stock go from here. 24/7 Wall St. offers readers insights into our assumptions about the stock’s prospects, what sort of growth we see in O stock for the next several years, and our best estimates for Reality Income stock price each year through 2030. Realty Income (O) Recent Stock Performance Here’s a table summarizing the performance in share price, revenues, and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) of O stock from 2019 to 2024: Year Stock Price Revenue* Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO)* 2019 $71.30 $1.488 $1.050 2020 $60.20 $1.647 $1.172 2021 $71.59 $2.080 $1.488 2022 $63.43 $3.343 $2.401 2023 $57.42 $4.078 $2.774 2024 $52.60 $5.271 $3.621 *Revenue and AFFO $billions. The REIT ended 2019 on a high note, closing out the year with a 21% total return, but like the rest of the market, the next year would be turned upside down due to the pandemic. O stock ended 2020 with a greater than 11% loss. While Realty Income would bounce back sharply in 2022 with a 24% gain, it was a rally that could not be sustained due to rapidly rising inflation and a Federal Reserve determined to tame it. The central bank&#8217;s unprecedented 11 consecutive hikes in the federal funds rate would send the REIT market into a tailspin. That&#8217;s because REITs borrow money to invest in new real estate and the dramatically higher rates they pay hit their bottom line hard. Realty Income tried to mitigate that by hitting the equity markets. From 2013 to 2020, O&#8217;s shares outstanding rose at a fairly consistent 8.8% annually. The onset of inflation and spiraling interest rates saw the REITs stock issuance surge to a 26% compound annual growth rate from 2020 to 2023. The Fed started to lower rates this year, but as inflation flared anew, the rate-easing policy seems to be on hold. Through it all, however, Realty Income was able to continue increasing revenue and AFFO, which has surged 244.85% since 2019. The REIT has used those funds to continue rewarding shareholders with dividend hikes. Key Drivers of Realty Income&#8217;s Stock performance 1. Global &amp; Industrial Expansion: The REIT&#8217;s commercial portfolio, which now includes more than 13,000 properties, is expanding its presence in Europe. Last year, it grew significantly in the U.K. and Spain, having signed a €527 million deal with Decathlon, one of the world&#8217;s leading sports brands. Additionally, it is working to expand its global industrial footprint, which accounted for just 15% of the REIT&#8217;s portfolio in 2024. 2. Quality Tenants: Although the shock to the system was significant, Realty Income was able to withstand the stress test due to the quality of its tenant base. It counts dozens of top-shelf retail outlets amongst its tenants, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). 3. Diversification: Its three largest tenants by space leased are Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR). Although the dollar stores and pharmacy chain are encountering headwinds of their own, none represents more than 3% of the total portfolio, meaning its broad diversification reduces the impact any one tenant will have. It has also expanded into industrial markets, gaming, and data centers, as well as having a growing geographical footprint. Realty Income (O) Stock Price Forecast for 2025 The current Wall Street median, one-year price target for Realty Income is $61.00, good for potential upside of 5.95% based on today&#8217;s share price. Of the 12 analysts covering Realty Income, the REIT receives a consensus &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating, with three analysts assigning it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, nine assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and zero assigning it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. Their one-year price targets range from $68.00 per share to $58.00 per share. However, 24/7 Wall St. sets its one-year price target for Realty Income at $61.70 per share, good for potential upside of 7.17% based on today&#8217;s share price. If we compare O&#8217;s price-to-AFFO versus its peers — such as Agree Realty (NYSE:ADC) or Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) — we see they trade at an average P/AFFO of 12.31, while O goes for 10.52. Realty Income&#8217;s Estimates 2026–2030 Valuing Realty Income’s stock price for the coming years, we will take a look at expected revenue and AFFO and give our best estimate of the market value of the company by assigning a price-to-AFFO multiple. Year Revenue* AFFO* 2026 $3.87 $3.263 2027 $4.652 $3.837 2028 $5.582 $4.512 2029 $6.699 $5.307 2030 $8.039 $6.241 *Revenue and AFFO in thousands. Realty Income (O) Stock Price Forecast for 2025–2030 Although Realty Income&#8217;s stock has steadily risen as the interest rate environment improved and because it no longer needs to to issue significant amounts of stock to offset borrowing costs, the REIT has continued to increase its dividend every quarter for the past six years. Its total return handily surpasses that of the S&amp;P 500. For 2030, we estimate AFFO reaches $6.2 billion with a P/AFFO of around 16, still well below its 10-year average, but more in line with many of its peers. That gives us a price target of $86.43 per share, or 50.13% potential upside from today&#8217;s share price. Year Price Target %Change From Current Price 2025 $61.70 7.17% 2026 $69.15 20.11% 2027 $70.84 23.05% 2028 $80.10 39.13% 2029 $82.13 42.66% 2030 $86.43 50.13% The post Realty Income (NYSE: O) Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 (July 2025) appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/forecasts/2025/07/27/realty-income-o-stock-price-prediction-and-forecast-2025-2030/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/realty-income-nyse-o-stock-price-prediction-and-forecast-20250728.jpg

The data center CPU market is projected to grow from $7.42 billion in 2024 to $8.35 billion in 2025, with Arm’s success potentially boosting its revenue to $3.3–3.4 billion and market cap to as much as 168.3 billion. Arm’s goal faces skepticism due to x86’s entrenched ecosystem, but its energy-efficient designs and hyperscaler adoption make it a formidable contender. On a Mission to Dominate British chip design titan Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) sent shockwaves through the tech industry earlier this year with a bold claim: it aims to capture 50% of the data center CPU market by the end of 2025, up from 15% in 2024. This ambitious goal threatens to reshape the competitive landscape, challenging x86 giants Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). As artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing drive unprecedented demand for energy-efficient processors, Arm’s rise could redefine the data center industry. But who stands to lose most, and what would this mean for Arm’s revenue and valuation? Who Arm Would Displace Arm’s audacious target puts Intel and AMD, the x86 architecture leaders, directly in its crosshairs. Intel, with its Xeon processors, has long dominated the data center CPU market, while AMD’s EPYC chips have gained traction with competitive performance. If Arm achieves a 50% share, it would primarily erode Intel’s larger market position, as Intel lacks new server CPUs until 2026, making it vulnerable to Arm’s energy-efficient designs like Amazon&#8216;s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS Graviton and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Grace. AMD would also face significant losses, as hyperscalers like AWS, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google increasingly adopt Arm-based CPUs for their cost and power savings. Arm’s rise is fueled by the AI boom, with its CPUs serving as host chips in AI systems, and a growing Arm-native software ecosystem that challenges x86’s legacy advantage. A Big and Growing Data Center CPU Market The global data center chip market, encompassing CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators, was valued at $21.21 billion in 2024 by Grand View Research and is projected to grow at a 12.5% CAGR, reaching $23.86 billion by the end of this year. The CPU segment, roughly 30% to 40% of this market, translates to approximately $7.42 billion in 2024 and $8.35 billion in 2025 &#8212; an increase of $930 million. Arm’s 50% share of the CPU market would give it influence over $4.175 billion in chip value, a significant leap from its 15% share last year. What It Means for Arm’s Revenue and Valuation Arm’s business model, centered on licensing IP and collecting royalties (2% to 3% per data center chip), differs from traditional chipmakers. In fiscal 2025, Arm generated $4 billion in total revenue, with its cloud and networking business contributing approximately $326 million to $434 million, based on industry royalty estimates. Capturing 50% of the data center CPU market could boost Arm’s data center revenue to $504 million to $604 million, driving total revenue to as much as $4.1 billion. With some 4.175 million CPUs at a $1,000 average price and a 2.5% royalty, Arm could earn around $104 million in royalties, plus increased licensing fees from hyperscalers like AWS and Nvidia. Note, though, that analysts estimate Arm is earning higher royalty rates for its new v9 architecture, which Morningstar estimates could reach a blended 5% rate by 2030, which would scale revenue significantly higher. In terms of valuation, Arm’s current market cap is $172.5 billion at a stock price of $163 per share. Achieving its goal could justify a premium, with analysts projecting a forward P/E of 73 to 150. At a conservative P/E of 73 and fiscal 2025 earnings of $1.63 per share, Arm’s market cap could grow to around $200 billion. At a bullish P/E of 150, it could hit almost $260 billion by the end of the year. These ranges suggest a stock price between $190 and $246 per share, implying 16% and 51% upside by the end of the year. Analyst price targets currently average $142 per share, but attaining its goal could see them boost it much higher, reflecting optimism around Arm’s AI-driven growth. Key Takeaway Arm’s 50% target is ambitious but faces skepticism. Analysts like Omdia’s Manoj Sukumaran estimate Arm-based servers will reach only 20% to 23% of the market by the end of 2025, citing x86’s entrenched ecosystem and software compatibility challenges. Arm’s success hinges on flawless execution, hyperscaler adoption, and overcoming Intel and AMD’s potential counter-moves, like energy-efficient x86 designs. While Arm’s energy efficiency and AI relevance position it strongly, achieving 50% market share in one year seems aspirational. I&#8217;m not certain Arm Holdings can&#8217;t actually achieve its goal, but it&#8217;s clear the chip designer is laser focused on the future and even partial success could solidify its role as a data center powerhouse.

First Analyst Quote... 5:26 pm &#8220;Congratulations on a really solid quarter. Definitely it looks like the engine is back to running full speed here.&#8221; The key theme around Cloudflare&#8217;s earnings is whether Wall Street believes a significant reacceleration is happening. Quotes like this are extremely bullish. More from CEO Matthew Prince 5:18 pm &#8220;Our dollar-based net retention was 114% in up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our gross margin was 76.3%, in line with our long-term target range of 75% to 77%. We delivered an operating profit of $72.3 million, representing an operating margin of 14.1% and we generated strong free cash flow of $33.3 million during the quarter, again exceeding expectations. Cloudflare keeps innovating faster than ever and customers are voting with their wallets, you can see that in the momentum from our Q2 results. It&#8217;s not just interest, it&#8217;s real investments that drove record ACV bookings in the quarter.&#8221; Cloudflare&#039;s Earnings Call 5:08 pm &#8220;We had an excellent quarter. We crossed $2 billion in annual run rate revenue, achieving $512.3 million of revenue in the quarter. We started the year detailing our strategy to drive reaccelerating growth. Our Q2 results highlight that this formula is working and mark a key inflection point for the company, with revenue growing 28% year-over-year, up from 26.5% in the first quarter. We now have 3,712 customers paying us more than $100,000 per year, a 22% increase year-over-year. Revenue contribution from these large customers grew at 35% year-over-year, contributing to 71% of revenue during the quarter, up from 67% in the second quarter last year. &#8221; &#8211; Matthew Prince That&#8217;s the key idea &#8211; is Cloudflare at an inflection point? Our bet is that it is. If growth keeps scaling past 30%, even with a sky high valuation, its likely Cloudflare shares will soar in the years ahead. Conference Call Coming Soon 4:50 pm Cloudflare&#8217;s conference call is coming soon. We&#8217;ll post highlights. To receive them: simply leave this blog open and an update will post after we&#8217;ve been able to listen in. Here&#039;s What&#039;s Happening After Hours 4:43 pm Apple: Up 2.2% Amazon: Down 3.1% Cloudflare: Up 5.5% Roku: Up 2% Reddit: Up 20.5% Executive Quotes 4:35 pm &#8220;We kicked off 2025 with confidence, momentum, and strong results. In Q1, we landed the largest contract in Cloudflare’s history, a more than $100 million deal driven by our Workers developer platform, and signed the longest-term SASE contract to date.&#8221; Matthew Prince &#8220;We have the scale, the technology, and the team to capture the massive opportunity ahead of us—as evidenced by the size and the length of the deals we’re closing and the caliber of customers betting on Cloudflare.&#8221; Matthew Prince &#8220;In a constantly changing world, one thing’s for certain: innovation wins. From networking, to security, to AI, Cloudflare is the envy of the industry for innovation, and there&#8217;s no slowing down.&#8221; Matthew Prince Cloudflare Now Up 7% 4:27 pm We&#8217;ll see if commentary on Cloudflare&#8217;s earnings moves the stock more, but for now gains have settled in at around 7%. Beat and Raise 4:25 pm Next quarter Cloudflare posted guidance of $543.5 to $544.5M, that&#8217;s above expectations. More Details... 4:23 pm NET | Cloudflare Q2&#8217;25 Earnings Highlights: Adj.

The company is focused on innovation and expanding its product offerings to capture more market share. Q2 Segment Performance: Revenue from Core Services: $512.3M []; UP +28% YoY Other Key Q2 Metrics: Adj. Operating Income: $72.3M []; UP +27% YoY Adj. Operating Expenses: $450.9M []; UP +30% YoY Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Available-for-Sale Securities: $3,959.7M Effective Tax Rate: 6.7% (vs. 8.0% YoY) CEO Commentary: Matthew Prince: &#8220;We had an excellent second quarter, exceeding $2 billion in annualized revenue while also reaccelerating revenue growth to 28% year-over-year. We’re innovating faster than ever, and demand remains strong, as our largest customers grow their investments with Cloudflare at the highest levels we’ve seen since 2022. While we’ve continued to sign even bigger and longer deals, some of our most strategic wins have been centered around our work to help invent the new business model for content creators on the AI-driven Internet. Sitting in front of more than 20% of all websites—with more than half of our dynamic traffic flowing through APIs—Cloudflare is uniquely positioned to enable the agentic web of the future. We are firing on all cylinders, with the right technology, strategy, and team to accelerate the next phase of growth for Cloudflare and for the Internet at-large.” Strategic Updates: Cloudflare is focusing on expanding its product offerings and enhancing its technology to better serve its customers and capture new market opportunities. We Have Lift Off 4:18 pm Cloudflare shares are now up 6% The Headline Numbers 4:17 pm Revenue: $512.3M VS $501M Estimate EPS: $0.21 VS $0.18 Estimate Earnings Are Out - Shares up 3.5% upon initial release 4:15 pm Cloudflare earnings just dropped. Initially the stock dropped, and then immediately flipped positive. We&#8217;re going ot post live news and analysis. Here We Go 4:01 pm We&#8217;re watching for Cloudflare&#8217;s earnings &#8211; they should be out any minute. 20 Minutes to the Closing Bell 3:40 pm We&#8217;re just 20 minutes from the closing bell. Most stocks are in the red today with S&amp;P 500 down .2% and the Dow Jones dropping .54%. Yet, stocks closely aligned with the AI trade have held onto gains. Microsoft&#8217;s stunning Azure numbers yesterday have helped Cloudflare shares trade sharply positive. The company is up 3.5% in late trading. As we&#8217;ve noted throughout this blog, without a beat and raise, Cloudflare shares will likely be down tomorrow. Is NET Overheated? 1:37 pm Cloudflare closed at $200.85 on Tuesday — up more than 75% since May 1. That rally reflects bullish sentiment around its AI platform, SASE expansion, and large enterprise wins. But with valuation stretched, the market is now pricing in not just strong Q2 execution, but raised full-year guidance. Anything short of an outlook above $2.1B could lead to a fade — especially with tech volatility picking up. The setup demands strength on both topline and forward commentary. Another “beat and reiterate” might not be enough to get the stock ripping higher. How Cloudflare Stock Performed After Recent Earnings 12:26 pm Cloudflare has steadily delivered modest EPS beats, but stock reactions have varied — with the strongest gains following Q3 2024. Investors are highly tuned to forward guidance and AI-driven revenue opportunities. Quarter EPS Surprise 1-Day Move 7-Day Move 14-Day Move Q1 2025 +4.41% +1.2% +2.8% +4.5% Q4 2024 –2.10% –0.6% –1.3% –0.9% Q3 2024 +6.77% +3.5% +5.2% +6.1% Q2 2024 +1.25% –0.4% +0.9% +1.6% What Wall Street Expects When Cloudflare Reports Today 10:14 am Here&#8217;s Wall Street&#8217;s consensus expectations for Q2 earnings. Revenue: $501.6 million Adjusted EPS: $.18 Gross Margin: 77.8% Free Cash Flow: $29.9 million More importantly, Cloudflare will likely need to raise forward guidance if shares are going to rise tomorrow. In the third quarter, Wall Street expects: Revenue: $538.6 million Adjusted EPS: $.21 And the company could also raise 2025 growth targets. Currently, Cloudflare is projecting sales of $2.090 billion to $2.094 billion. Wall Street expectations are slightly above that range at $2.096 billion. If Cloudflare took revenue guidance for the year beyond $2.1 billion, that could be enough for shares to rise again tomorrow. Cloudflare (NYSE: NET) reports earnings after the bell today. The company&#8217;s shares have raced forward 78% this quarter. Bears will argue that Cloudflare&#8217;s valuation is stretched to the max. Cloudflare is expected to post revenue of $2.1 billion this year, but is now worth more than $70 billion. Bulls point to Cloudflare being an essential company for the growth of agentic AI. With inference needs rising, companies will look to Cloudflare as a solution to limit latency in the age of AI. Count me in on the bull side, I added shares of Cloudflare to the $500,000 AI Portfolio I manage for 24/7 Wall St. back in January.

Overall, the company did a lot tonight to push the narrative they&#8217;ll be aggressive to catch up in AI and that device sales are rebounding. It&#8217;s a good quarter for Apple that might start turning around what&#8217;s been a disappointing 2025. Tim Cook on AI 5:58 pm TD Cowen Analst: Tim, I was curious about your thoughts on AI for edge devices. There&#8217;s like some people who think that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you think &#8212; do you see a scenario where the LLM become a third part of your iOS or is the SLM the way to go and how to think about evolution of edge devices in a futuristic AI world and is smartphone going to be the choice of device. Just curious your thoughts on it, broadly speaking. Timothy Cook Chief Executive Officer The way that we look at AI is that it&#8217;s 1 of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. And I think it will affect all devices in a significant way what pieces of the chain are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn&#8217;t want to to really talk about today. because that gives away some things on our strategy. But I think it&#8217;s a good question. . Tim Cook on Apple Momentum 5:48 pm Here&#8217;s what Tim Cook had to say about Apple&#8217;s surprising momentum in China last quarter: &#8220;Yes. We did grow in Greater China by 4% during the quarter versus the previous quarter, it was driven by an acceleration by iPhone, although we also had substantial growth on the MAC year-over-year. From a &#8212; as you know, the government has placed certain subsidies that affects some of our products, not all of them, but there are some of them. And I think that had some effect. It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out. that cut in during a portion of the previous quarter. The other things I would say are that the installed base hit a record high in Greater China &#8212; and we set an all-time record for the iPhone installed base. The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter. And according to Boral Panel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top 3 models in Urban China, which is extraordinary. Also, if you look at the other products, Mac, iPad and watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China Mainland were new to the product. So lots of good things there. And the other thing I would point out, which is an interesting point, The MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model in all of China, and the Mac Mini was the top-selling desktop model in all of China. So overall, a positive &#8212; very positive quarter.&#8221; Apple&#039;s CFO Says AI Investments Will Rise 5:47 pm &#8220;I would say, a pretty significant driver as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. So that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we&#8217;ve been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers. The other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where in cases we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. So you are going to see an increase in CapEx. We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities in tooling, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you&#8217;re seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments.&#8221; &#8211; Kevan Parekh, Apple CFO Tariff Implications 5:22 pm On Apple&#8217;s conference call they just said they incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs last quarter.

That’s thanks to mixed earnings, tariff news, and poor jobs growth for July. AMZN, now down about $16 a share, isn’t helping much after its earnings report. Most of the pullback is from President Trump’s latest tariffs, which hit dozens of countries, including crucial partners, with steep tariffs. If other countries respond negatively with increased tariffs, markets could easily drop even more. Stay tuned for more. Morgan Stanley Reiterated Overweight Rating on Apple 9:37 am Morgan Stanley just reiterated its overweight rating on Apple, raising its price target to $240 from $235. The firm noted this was Apple’s strongest quarterly report and guide in more than two years. The firm also reiterated its overweight rating on Amazon. “Retail growth and profit improvements are shining and driving earnings. 2Q AWS growth was better and we detail why we see faster growth ahead. Remain OW, $300 PT,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. Nasdaq Opens Down 292 at the Open 9:31 am With tariffs, mixed earnings, and poor jobs growth, the Nasdaq is down 292 points. Nonfarm payrolls were expected to increase by 100,000 in July. Instead, they increased by just 73,000. The unemployment rate of 4.2% was in line with expectations. Amazon is down $16 at the open. That’s even as the company beat on the top and bottom lines, and offered better-than-expected guidance of between $174 billion and $179.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating $173.2 billion. Apple, up $3 at the open, posted earnings that beat on profit and revenue. iPhone sales grew 13% year over year. And overall revenue jumped 10% — the biggest quarterly jump in revenue growth since late 2023. U.S. Jobs Growth Did Slow to 73,000 8:42 am Nonfarm payrolls were expected to increase by 100,000 in July. Instead, they increased by just 73,000. The unemployment rate of 4.2% was in line with expectations. “June and May totals were revised sharply lower, down by a combined 258,000 from previously announced levels,” added CNBC. “The June total came down from the previously stated 147,000, while the May count fell to just 19,000, revised down by 125,000.” That weakness and the downward revisions could force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates when it meets in September. After a few record-setting days for the tech-heavy Nasdaq, futures are down about 245 points. All after President Trump signed an executive order that modified reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, with updated duties ranging from 10% to 41%. Here are the key points you should know: “Trump set rates including a 35% duty on many goods from Canada, 50% for Brazil, 25% for India, 20% for Taiwan, and 39% for Switzerland, according to a presidential executive order,” according to Reuters. 10% is now the minimum tariff imposed across all imports. Canada: Tariff raised to 35% from 25% 40 Countries now face a 15% tariff. China and Mexico had their deadlines delayed by 90 days. If you want to see the full list of updated tariffs, you can see it here. Shares of Amazon Slip Despite an Earnings Beat Not helping, shares of Amazon are down about $19 in premarket. That’s even as the company beat on the top and bottom lines, and offered better-than-expected guidance of between $174 billion and $179.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating $173.2 billion. Despite that, the stock dropped after Amazon&#8217;s guidance for operating income for its AWS cloud computing unit came in at $15.5 billion to $20.5 billion for the third quarter. Analysts were looking for $19.5 billion. Analysts are sticking by the stock, despite that news. Goldman Sachs still has a buy rating and raised its price target to $240 from $220. JPMorgan reiterated an overweight rating, raising its price target to $265 from $255. Citi has a buy rating and raised its price target to $270 from $265. Apple is Gaining Momentum on an Earnings Beat Just last night, the tech giant posted earnings that beat on profit and revenue. Plus, iPhone sales grew 13% year over year. And overall revenue jumped 10% &#8212; the biggest quarterly jump in revenue growth since late 2023. EPS of $1.57 was better than the estimates of $1.43. Revenue of $94.04 billion was better than the estimates of $89.53 billion. iPhone revenue was $44.58 billion as compared to expectations for $40.22 billion. Mac revenue of $8.05 billion was better than the estimates of $7.26 billion. iPad revenue of $6.58 billion was better than the expectations of $7.24 billion. With AI, the company said that it’s “significantly growing our investments.” U.S. Jobs Growth Slowed to 73,000 Nonfarm payrolls were expected to increase by 100,000 in July. Instead, they increased by just 73,000. The unemployment rate was expected to be 4.2%.

Bank of America Reiterated a Buy Rating on Nvidia 8:44 am After dropping late last week on jobs growth and tariff concerns, the Nasdaq is turning aggressively higher in the pre-market. At the moment, it’s up 188 points at 23,073.75 Bank of America just reiterated its buy rating on Nvidia, noting it sees a strong beat/raise when it posts earnings later this month. UBS just initiated a buy rating on Pony AI with a price target of $20. Evercore ISI reiterated an outperform rating on Amazon, noting, “We reiterate our Outperform on AMZN in the wake of our proprietary research into Alexa+, Amazon’s AI Agent currently being rolled out to its Echo platform devices. We have tested Alexa+ on and off for two weeks now and have run our own proprietary survey of 1,350 current Smart Device owners,” as quoted by CNBC. Markets were doing well until the latest tariffs and a slowdown in jobs created uncertainty. Non-farm payrolls came in at 73,000 with prior months revised lower. With the latest numbers, investors are digesting what it could mean for interest rates. At the moment, investors are betting on reduced chances for a September cut. Unfortunately, the probability of a September fell to 40%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. With tariffs, Trump signed an executive order that modified reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, with updated duties ranging from 10% to 41%. It’s why the Dow dropped 542 points on Friday, why the S&amp;P 500 shed 101, and why the NASDAQ lost 472 points. This morning, in an attempt to brush off the negativity, the major indices are exploding in the pre-market. The Dow Jones is up about 192. The S&amp;P 500 is up about 35, as the NASDAQ tacks on about 174 points. It’ll be interesting to see if they can hold the gains – especially with the latest tariffs, the potential for a worsening trade war, and jobs. We also have to consider that August is historically a weak month for the Dow, heading back to 1988, according to CNBC. It’s the second-worst month for the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. Key Earnings are on Deck Key earnings from Palantir, Disney, McDonald’s, Advanced Micro Devices, and Eli Lilly will also help decide the markets’ direction. This morning, Tyson Foods posted better-than-expected earnings. EPS of 91 cents was above expectations of 80 cents. Revenue of $13.88 billion was also above the estimates of $13.54 billion. It also raised its revenue guidance for the full year, expecting an increase in production for certain meat products like chicken. Berkshire Hathaway saw a year-over-year decline in operating earnings, which fell 4% to $11.16 billion. All thanks to week insurance writing. Warren Buffett also warned that steep tariffs would hurt its business. &#8220;The pace of changes in these events, including tensions from developing international trade policies and tariffs, accelerated through the first six months of 2025,&#8221; Berkshire said in its earnings report. &#8220;Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events.&#8221; OPEC+ Just Agreed to Raise Oil Production OPEC+ just agreed to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September. This is the latest in a series of accelerated output hikes to regain market share, especially with concerns mounting over potential supply disruptions linked to Russia. “Given fairly strong oil prices at around $70, it does give OPEC+ some confidence about market fundamentals,&#8221; said Amrita Sen, co-founder of Energy Aspects, adding that the market structure was also indicating tight stocks, as quoted by CNBC.

That shows how much the company depends on its full-size pickups. Most of these are the F-150, which has been the bestselling vehicle in the United States for almost five decades. It also shows the extent to which Ford has a challenge to diversify away from gasoline-powered cars, which make up nearly all its profits. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: The F-Series remains a significant part of Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE: F) total U.S. sales. The F-150 has been the bestselling vehicle in America for decades. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Sales of the F-150 yield $10,000 in profits each, an indication of how much it contributes to Ford’s bottom line. One question Ford has to face financially is, if it moves successfully into electric vehicles (EVs), what happens to its profits? Will sales of its electric F-150 Lightning cannibalize sales of the gasoline-powered version? Ford objects to the math, but it loses about $100,000 on each EV it sells. A rotation from conventional models to EVs could cost the automaker hundreds of millions of dollars. CEO Jim Farley said recently that U.S. car companies cannot match the quality and prices of Chinese EVs. He says Ford will have a “Model T” moment on August 11. This implies that the company will relaunch its EV initiative after spending nearly $30 billion on the first wave—and losing it. Farley could point out that the first investment is a foundation for a new one. If this so-called Model-T moment is largely to start a new generation of what could be a decades-long transformation of the company, where will the money come from? He has complained about what the new United Auto Workers contract will cost Ford. He has also acknowledged the loss that the company has to take in the EV market. Recently, he added that tariffs will undermine the company’s bottom line further. At the core of Ford’s financials are its warranty costs, which do not seem to be going away. The F-150 is the foundation of Ford’s financial success. What happens when that is no longer true?

As an example, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is down 2% this year, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 6%. That hurts Jeff Bezos’ net worth. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) is down 25%, which undermines Elon Musk’s net worth. One “billionaire” stock is up. Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) trades 9% above where it was at the start of the year. And the net worth of the Walton family has risen with it. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Among the richest people in the world, only the Walton family has become wealthier this year. Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) stock is up sharply year to date. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Of the 15 richest people in the world according to the Bloomberg Billionaire list, only the Walton family has posted a large increase in their wealth. Jim, Rob, and Alice have each had a gain of about $300 million. They are the children of Walmart founder Sam Walton. Walmart is currently the largest retailer in the world (China might be an exception). Walmart has done several things to cement its position as a retailer. It says it has passed some of the price of tariffs on to customers. This should preserve margins. J.P. Morgan recently said Walmart should be highly successful this year. The pricing power advantage was among the reasons. Walmart has also made gains in the artificial intelligence (AI) part of retail. Walmart hired Instacart executive Daniel Danker to run its growing AI business. He will oversee “AI transformation and lead all product management and design across the enterprise.” It has added “super agents” to help online customers. Yahoo reports, “According to the retailer, the four agents powered by agentic AI are designed for Walmart shoppers, store employees, suppliers and sellers, and software developers.” In May, Walmart posted its earnings. Revenue rose 2.5% year over year to $165.6 billion, while adjusted earnings increased 1.7% to $0.61 per share. The Walton family has another distinction. Among the people at the top of the Bloomberg rich list, they are the only ones who inherited their money.

The leading independent demand-side platform (DSP) in adtech posted results that were in line with expectations, but its guidance confirmed that competition was becoming more of a threat to the business. As a result, several Wall Street analysts downgraded the stock this morning, and shares were down 38.1% as of 10:08 a.m. ET. The second-quarter results weren't bad. Revenue rose 19% to $694 million, which topped the consensus at $686 million. The company touted progress in several channels, including connected TV, retail media, and supply chain optimization, and its Kokai AI platform is being adopted by its customers. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose 12% to $271 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased from $0.39 to $0.41, which matched estimates. The Trade Desk's results make it clear that its growth rate is slowing, which is a problem for a stock that has historically traded at a high multiple. Several analysts downgraded the stock on the update. Bank of America double-downgraded the stock to underperform, saying concerns about competitive pressures were justified. At least three other analysts also cut their ratings as it appears that the ""walled gardens"" that The Trade Desk competes with like Netflix, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet are becoming stronger. Looking ahead to the third quarter, the company called for revenue of at least $717 million and EBITDA of about $277 million, indicating margins are expected to fall slightly on a sequential basis. The revenue forecast, which compares to the average estimate at $722 million, implies growth of at least 14%, a clear sign that growth is decelerating. Given that, the sell-off looks justified as The Trade Desk now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 31 based on adjusted earnings, which seems like a fair price now that its growth prospects are in doubt.",https://www.fool.com,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/08/why-the-trade-desk-stock-tumbled-today/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/why-the-trade-desk-stock-tumbled-today-20250808.jpg

When it comes to figuring out the best counties to call home, Patch consulted experts in real estate, travel, and entertainment to help find the ideal spot to hang your hat, no matter if you are single, raising your family, or planning out your golden years. While many reports focus on the best California cities to live in, as locals know, one town tends to flow into the next. Therefore, Patch broadened our view to explore the best counties to call home, based upon home availability, proximity to shopping, restaurants, wineries, and nightlife. In these areas, you can find homes from the upper $500,000 range to the lower $2 million range. Sorted alphabetically by county, here are the places where real estate agents say deals can still be found and career opportunities exist. Take a virtual stroll through these virtual neighborhoods in these counties: 1.

On July 8, it was reported that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sold nearly three million shares worth $665.8 million over two days in July as part of a plan announced earlier in 2025 that will see Bezos unload up to 25 million shares through May 2026. In its most recent earnings call, the company reported that net sales increased 13% to $167.7 billion in the second quarter, compared with $148.0 billion in the year-prior quarter. Net income increased to $18.2 billion, or $1.68 per diluted share, compared with $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per diluted share, in Q2 2024. However, free cash flow decreased to $18.2 billion TTM, compared with $53.0 billion TTM the year prior due to Amazon&#8217;s ongoing CapEx on AI. In June and July the stock saw a series of adjusted price targets. Analysts at Stifel ($262 from $245), Barclays ($275 from $240), Bank of America ($272 from $265), Piper Sandler ($255 from $250), Capital ($270 from $233), Citi ($265 from $225), Needham ($265 from $220), Cantor Fitzgerald ($260 from $240), Truist ($250 from $226), all recently upgraded their price targets for AMZN. Amazon announced in July that it has deployed its 1 millionth robot while also deploying its new AI foundation model to power its robotic fleet. Its first twelfth generation automated fulfillment center launched in late-2024 and the robots are primarily focused on delivery station efficiencies. The robotics cycle is &#8220;early,&#8221; according to Bank of America&#8217;s analyst, who expects Amazon to leverage robots to reduce labor dependency, increase order accuracy and improve warehouse efficiency, driving material cost savings. While there can be little doubt about Amazon&#8217;s current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock.

In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,491%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Wall Street analysts&#8217; median price target of $264.21 is above Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year and good for potential upside of 19.17%. Of the 44 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. With 63.76% of shares held by institutional investors — including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 3,073 position increases versus 2,270 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $235 5.99% Median $264.21 19.17% High $300.00 35.31% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumer spending has rebounded in the wake of Trump&#8217;s tariff threats and subsequent pauses, which could help GDP in Q2 after it contracted GDP in Q1, raising the risks of a possible recession in 2025. Over the past three months, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed the fourth best, posting a gain of 8.94%. While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.

The company&#8217;s reported strong Q2 earnings on July 30. The Magnificent Seven mainstay reported EPS of $3.65 versus analysts&#8217; expectations of $3.35, while quarterly revenue came in at $76.44 billion. MSFT is now up 28.25% this year. Earlier in July, the stock had seen multiple price target upgrades. Citi raised its price target on Microsoft to $613 from $605 while keeping a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. Piper Sandler raised its price target for MSFT to $600 from $475 while keeping an &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating. On June 5, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 33% in FY25 Q3, driven by AI services. When the company last reported earnings, it announced that total revenue rose 13% to $70.1 billion and it generated earnings of $3.46 per share, beating estimates of $3.22 per share. Despite a $800 million charge in Q1 from its investment in General Motors&#8216; (NYSE:GM) Cruise robotaxi initiative that the automaker subsequently shutdown, Microsoft’s focus on AI and cloud resilience continues to fuel optimism. However, its decision earlier in May fire 6,000 employees — or 3% of its workforce — signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth. Key Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms. Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines.

It has a software stock that could ride dominance in AI to returns of 10x or more. Why Invest in Microsoft Microsoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S. Its Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon&#8216;s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. When Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20. Microsoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect Q4 capex to remain elevated at $16 billion to $17 billion to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth. Tariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&amp;D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year. Beyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft&#8217;s AI and cloud momentum. Microsoft As a Stock Broadly, Wall Street analysts&#8217; remain bullish, with 30 of 33 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, three assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and zero assigning it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Wall Street&#8217;s price targets cover a significant range, spanning $475 per share on the low end to $613 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $611.28, which represents 13.87% potential upside from today&#8217;s share price. Institutional ownership currently stands at 73.05%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $520 -0.24% Median $623.34 19.57% High $675 29.48% Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s 33% Azure growth and 20% cloud revenue increase in Q3 position it for AI market gains. However, $20 billion quarterly capex and tariff risks require caution. Its $80 billion cash reserve and Oracle partnership offer stability, making MSFT stock a buy for growth investors, even as valuation concerns linger. 24/7 Wall St.’s price target for Microsoft is $563.64, implying downside potential of 7.98% from the stock&#8217;s current price. This cautious target reflects Azure’s strength and Q4 revenue guidance of $73.7 billion, balanced against the need for higher capex spending and potential supply chain disruptions, positioning it at a realistic estimate of its leading presence in the space.The post Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com,https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/08/14/microsoft-nasdaq-msft-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-where-will-it-be-in-1-year/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/microsoft-nasdaq-msft-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-where-20250814.jpg
