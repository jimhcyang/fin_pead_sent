Buy with Prime will initially be available by invitation only for merchants using Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) and will roll out through 2022 as merchants are invited to participate, including those not selling on Amazon or using FBA. Expanded Shopping Benefits for Prime Members Buy with Prime will allow millions of U.S.-based Prime members to shop directly from merchants’ online stores with the trusted experience they expect from Amazon—including fast, free delivery, a seamless checkout experience, and free returns on eligible orders. Prime members will see the Prime logo and delivery promise on eligible products in merchants’ online stores, which signals the item is available for free delivery, as fast as next day, with free returns. When shopping with Buy with Prime, checkout is simple and convenient. Prime members will use the payment and shipping information stored in their Amazon account and receive timely shipping and delivery notifications after an order is placed. “We always aim to exceed Prime members’ expectations by offering more selection, exclusive deals, quality content, and convenient features,” said Jamil Ghani, vice president of Amazon Prime. “With the introduction of Buy with Prime, we’re expanding where members can enjoy trusted and convenient Prime shopping benefits beyond Amazon, adding even more value to their membership. Members will have the flexibility to shop from merchants directly, all while enjoying the fast, free delivery, seamless checkout, and easy returns they’ve come to know and love from Amazon.” A New Way for Merchants to Grow their Online Stores “For over 20 years, we’ve been empowering small and medium-sized businesses with opportunities to grow,” said Peter Larsen, Amazon’s vice president of Buy with Prime. “Allowing merchants to offer Prime shopping benefits on their own direct-to-consumer online stores is an exciting next step in our mission to help merchants of all sizes grow their business—whether on Amazon or beyond. With shoppers purchasing directly from merchants’ online stores, Buy with Prime will allow merchants to build customer relationships and brand loyalty while offering conversion-driving benefits like fast, free shipping.” For merchants already using FBA, Buy with Prime can be added to their online store within minutes because their inventory is already stored in Amazon fulfillment centers. To get started, merchants sign up for Buy with Prime, link an Amazon Seller Central account, use Multi-Channel Fulfillment to offer one pool of inventory for multiple channels, and link an Amazon Pay account to offer a seamless checkout experience for Prime members. Then, by installing a JavaScript widget in their online store, merchants can easily add Buy with Prime to one or more products. With Buy with Prime, merchants will receive shopper order information, including email addresses for customer orders, which they can use to provide customer service and build direct relationships with shoppers. Using Buy with Prime, merchants simply pay for what they use. Pricing is based on a service fee, a payment processing fee, and fulfillment and storage fees that are calculated per unit. With no fixed subscription fee or long-term contract required, merchants can expand selection or cancel at any time. “Buy with Prime will be a game changer for our brand. Prime members will enjoy the trust and familiarity they have with shopping on Amazon while connecting with our business directly on our own site,” said David Ghiyam, president of MaryRuth Organics. “When we began using Fulfillment by Amazon, our business quadrupled in growth thanks to Amazon’s logistics network and our Prime-eligible listings. Using Buy with Prime, we will be able to drive the conversion we’ve experienced with Fulfillment by Amazon while running our business on our own site.” Buy with Prime is designed to work with most online stores, including ecommerce service providers such as BigCommerce. “Buy with Prime represents a compelling value-add for BigCommerce merchants who wish to increase their sales and optimize the omnichannel experience they provide their customers,” said Troy Cox, senior vice president of product at BigCommerce. “Prime set the bar for a shopping experience customers trust, including convenient and fast shipping. As one of the top ecommerce platforms collaborating with Amazon to add Buy with Prime, extending these benefits to our merchants will help elevate their online shopper experiences, build brand loyalty, and power them to grow and scale.""

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today at AWS Summit San Francisco announced the general availability of AWS IoT TwinMaker, a new service that makes it faster and easier for developers to create digital twins of real-world systems like buildings, factories, industrial equipment, and production lines. Digital twins are virtual representations of physical systems that use real-world data to mimic the structure, state, and behavior of the objects they represent and are updated with new data as conditions change. AWS IoT TwinMaker makes it easy for developers to integrate data from multiple sources like equipment sensors, video cameras, and business applications—and combines that data to create a knowledge graph that models the real-world environment. With AWS IoT TwinMaker, many more customers can use digital twins to build applications that mirror real-world systems that improve operational efficiency and reduce downtime. There are no upfront commitments or fees to use AWS IoT TwinMaker, and customers only pay for accessing the data used to build and operate digital twins. To get started with AWS IoT TwinMaker, visit aws.amazon.com/iot-twinmaker. Industrial companies collect and process vast troves of data about their equipment and facilities from sources like equipment sensors, video cameras, and business applications (e.g., enterprise resource planning systems or project management systems). Many customers want to combine these data sources to create a virtual representation of their physical systems (called a digital twin) to help them simulate and optimize operational performance. But building and managing digital twins is hard even for the most technically advanced organizations. To build digital twins, customers must manually connect different types of data from diverse sources (e.g., time-series sensor data from equipment, video feeds from cameras, maintenance records from business applications, etc.). Then customers have to create a knowledge graph that provides common access to all the connected data and maps the relationships between the data sources to the physical environment. To complete the digital twin, customers have to build a 3D virtual representation of their physical systems (e.g., buildings, factories, equipment, production lines, etc.) and overlay the real-world data on to the 3D visualization—and then ensure the digital twin is kept up to date as conditions change. Once they have a virtual representation of their real-world systems with real-time data, customers can build applications for plant operators and maintenance engineers who can leverage machine learning and analytics to extract business insights about the real-time operational performance of their physical systems. Because the work required is complex, the vast majority of organizations are unable to use digital twins to improve their operations. AWS IoT TwinMaker makes it significantly faster and easier to create digital twins of real-world systems. Using AWS IoT TwinMaker, developers can get started quickly building digital twins of devices, equipment, and processes by connecting AWS IoT TwinMaker to data sources like equipment sensors, video feeds, and business applications. AWS IoT TwinMaker contains built-in connectors for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), AWS IoT SiteWise, and Amazon Kinesis Video Streams (or customers can add their own connectors for data sources like Amazon Timestream, Snowflake, and Siemens MindSphere) to make it easy to gather data from a variety of sources. AWS IoT TwinMaker automatically creates a knowledge graph that combines and understands the relationships of the connected data sources, so it can update the digital twin with real-time information from the system being modeled. Customers can import existing 3D models (e.g., CAD and BIM files, point cloud scans, etc.), directly into AWS IoT TwinMaker to easily create 3D visualizations of the physical system and overlay the data from the knowledge graph on to the 3D visualizations to create the digital twin. Once the digital twin has been created, developers can use an AWS IoT TwinMaker plugin for Amazon Managed Grafana to create a web-based application that displays the digital twin on the devices plant operators and maintenance engineers use to monitor and inspect facilities and industrial systems. For example, developers can create a virtual representation of a metals processing plant by associating data from the plant’s equipment sensors with real-time video of the various machines in operation and the maintenance history of those machines. Developers can then set up rules to alert plant operators when anomalies in the plant’s furnace are detected (e.g., temperature threshold has been breached) and display those anomalies on a 3D representation of the plant with real-time video from the furnaces, which can help operators make quick decisions on predictive maintenance before a furnace fails. “Sensors for equipment, buildings, and industrial processes are proliferating and generating massive amounts of data. Customers are increasingly eager to use that data to optimize their operations and processes and one way to do that is using digital twins, but they find that building a digital twin and custom applications is difficult, time consuming, and prohibitively expensive to maintain today,” said Michael MacKenzie, General Manager, IoT at AWS. “With AWS IoT TwinMaker, customers can now derive previously unavailable insights about their operations that inform real-time improvements to their buildings, factories, industrial equipment, and production lines, and make accurate predictions about system behavior with minimal effort.” AWS IoT TwinMaker is generally available today in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (Ireland) with availability in additional AWS Regions coming soon. Siemens Digital Industries Software is a leader in industrial software including digital twin solutions that connect information technology and operational technology across the entire product lifecycle through design, manufacturing, production, and service. “Through this collaboration, we can leverage AWS IoT TwinMaker and other AWS services within the low-code, data management, visualization, simulation, and industrial IoT applications in our Xcelerator portfolio, making it easier for customers to create digital twin solutions that can scale from the simplest to the most complex use cases,” said Brenda Discher, Senior Vice President for Global Strategy & Marketing, Siemens Digital Industries Software. “Together, we are helping our customers increase manufacturing productivity and flexibility, optimize material costs, and better meet their energy and sustainability goals.” Carrier is a leading provider of healthy, safe, sustainable, and intelligent building and cold chain solutions. “At Carrier, we are pushing to drive more innovation and connectivity to make buildings and the cold chain more sustainable, efficient, and comfortable. To enable rapid development of more digital solutions, we embarked on the development of a shared services platform—carrier.io—as the foundation of all Carrier digital services,” said Dan Levine, Senior Director IoT, Cloud, and Software Engineering at Carrier. “AWS IoT services will be a key enabler to accelerating the development of our carrier.io IoT platform, and AWS IoT TwinMaker will be used to provide critical asset modeling for the platform, enabling our applications to easily create and integrate digital twins of real-world systems. These applications allow our customers to use their data alongside advanced machine learning and data analytics to decrease service costs, optimize maintenance schedules, and increase reliability, efficiency, and profitability of their Carrier equipment.” INVISTA, which is a subsidiary of Koch Industries, transforms daily life through its innovations in the nylon and specialty materials industries used in clothing, carpets, cars, and computers, just to name a few. “INVISTA is using AWS IoT TwinMaker to help our field personnel efficiently address operational notifications and alerts from plant floors across multiple, distributed locations,” said Jerry Grunewald, Vice President of Operations Transformation at INVISTA. “With AWS IoT TwinMaker, we can quickly and easily build a digital twin of our manufacturing operations to give field workers a consolidated view of all assets and operational data. By doing so, INVISTA operations is making significant progress on our vision of the connected worker as the outcome of our transformation effort. For example, a field technician could pinpoint the source of equipment anomalies and identify appropriate corrective actions.” John Holland is one of Australia’s leading integrated infrastructure, rail, multi-modal transport, and building companies. By finding solutions to complex challenges and opportunities, John Holland transforms communities to make them easier to move around, be more connected, and become better to live in. “By their nature, construction projects create change to their surrounding environment, and through the use of IoT and other emerging technologies, John Holland can expand the capabilities of our people,” said Bastian Uber, Chief Digital and Information Officer at John Holland. “As an example, projects are subject to environmental regulations, evidence collection, and monitoring of environmental factors such as noise, dust, vibration, and air quality. Using AWS IoT TwinMaker to create a construction digital twin, we aim to provide environmental managers a 360-degree view into the environmental impact of their project. Our platform collects, analyzes, and displays environmental data in a realistic 3D representation of the construction site, so environmental managers can monitor performance, investigate claims, and gather comprehensive historical evidence.” Element helps industrial enterprises achieve cleaner, safer, healthier, and more profitable operations through analytical insights that are made possible by uniting IT/OT metadata in a flexible knowledge graph, speeding time to insight and governing data in context. “Built with industrial organizations in mind, Element Unify uses automated, no-code data pipelines to integrate and contextualize IT/OT metadata and then stores relationships within the Unify Graph,” said Andy Bane, CEO at Element. “AWS IoT TwinMaker enables users to create highly contextualized 3D scenes and digital twin applications for analytical insights and actions across the plant floor, control room, and remote operations center to help teams collaboratively solve problems with data. The relationships stored in Unify Graph are provisioned as data models in AWS IoT TwinMaker, which is an essential part of making all of this work. Unify shrinks digital twin development cycles by up to tenfold, significantly speeding time to value. It improves data quality through graph-based relationships and brings much needed governance to digital twins that rely on data from multiple legacy IT/OT systems blended together with data from new IoT sources.” FuseForward provides critical energy, education, and health care service providers a clear path to an intelligent digital future, with expertise across cloud, intelligent systems, advanced analytics, data privacy and governance, and cybersecurity. “Recently, FuseForward embarked on a collaboration with a team of academic researchers to create a digital twin of a complete university campus. We started with one building, and the next step is to scale up to all 60, and AWS IoT TwinMaker will make this possible,” said Dr. Michael Lamoureux, VP of Research and Lab Operations at FuseForward. “With AWS IoT TwinMaker, we now have the tools to facilitate the creation of our digital twins at scale. Components of AWS IoT TwinMaker will support digital twin development through secure streaming data ingestion and storage, 3D visualization of buildings and artifacts, display of operating data, and more. These methods will allow our industry to move away from bespoke, one-off, custom-made solutions and move into an automated digital twin creation process for smart cities that rapidly meets the customers’ needs and expectations over the long term.” Radix is a global technology company that provides consulting, engineering, operations technology, and digital solutions. “In today’s world of highly automated manufacturing, many enterprises seek innovations that help modernize older process equipment to remain competitive. A historical obstacle to the development of digital twins was the effort to locate and build the relationships between the metadata and all of the different pieces of process equipment,” said Elliott Bell, Program Director at Radix Engineering & Software. “We at Radix have found that AWS IoT TwinMaker helps systematically build the relationships that exist within the engineering documentation, process data, business systems, and maintenance systems, without human intervention. When applied correctly, digital twins are the ‘automatic spell checker’ of a manufacturing process. This greatly reduces the activities that don’t add value in creating digital twins. Without the obstacles of mapping the metadata, our engineers are able to assist our customers in reaching higher levels of value creation faster.” Matterport is a spatial-data company digitizing the built world that unlocks unparalleled spatial-data insights for companies and individuals to better design, build, promote, and manage their most valuable asset. “Using immersive, dimensionally accurate 3D models from Matterport, AWS IoT TwinMaker allows customers to create game-changing 3D experiences for their users,” said Conway Chen, Vice President of Business Development & Strategic Alliances at Matterport. “Through our collaboration with AWS, enterprise customers in the industrial, manufacturing, and smart-building industries can connect their immersive, dimensionally accurate 3D models from Matterport with IoT devices to enhance remote monitoring, increase working efficiencies, and enable root-cause analysis. This collaboration provides digital twin visualization of any space with associated data insights and analytics, as well as real-time and historical data access to their spaces.” About Amazon Web Services For over 15 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud offering.

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today at AWS Summit San Francisco announced the general availability of AWS Amplify Studio, a new visual development environment for creating web application user interfaces (UIs) that extends AWS Amplify so developers can create fully customizable web applications on AWS with minimal coding. Today, customers like Amazon Music, Credit Genie, Neiman Marcus, Noom, Orangetheory Fitness, and State Auto use AWS Amplify to more easily configure and deploy AWS services (e.g., database, compute, storage, etc.) to power their applications. AWS Amplify Studio extends the capabilities of AWS Amplify to provide a unified visual development environment for building feature-rich web applications on AWS—from provisioning the AWS services that power the application to creating dynamic UIs. Developers can use AWS Amplify Studio to create a UI using a library of prebuilt components (e.g., buttons, newsfeeds, user registration forms, etc.), collaborate with user experience (UX) designers, and connect their UI to AWS services through a visual interface without writing any code. AWS Amplify Studio then converts the UI into JavaScript or TypeScript code, which saves developers from writing thousands of lines of code while allowing them to fully customize their web application design and behavior using familiar programming languages. There are no upfront fees or commitments to use AWS Amplify Studio, and customers only pay for the AWS services used to run their application. To get started with AWS Amplify Studio, visit aws.amazon.com/amplify/studio. Most cloud-based web applications are broadly comprised of three parts—a UI that users engage with, business logic that defines how the web application works, and the backend cloud services that power a range of functions (e.g., user authentication, databases, object storage, etc.). Today, developers typically choose one of two paths for building a modern web application. They can write the application code themselves, which gives them precise control over the finished web application, but often takes weeks of time and effort, including provisioning the backend services, writing the business logic, and collaborating with UX designers on the UI. Alternatively, developers can use low-code tools to quickly build an application. However, applications built with these tools are often less customizable and extensible because developers cannot write their own custom application code or must use proprietary frameworks and programming languages that are more restrictive than common programming languages like JavaScript and TypeScript. What developers want instead is a solution that combines the precision of writing the code themselves with the speed of a low-code tool, so they can deliver innovative, new capabilities to their customers significantly faster. AWS Amplify Studio allows developers to quickly build a web application on AWS with minimal coding, while still empowering them to fully customize their application’s design and behavior using familiar programming languages. To get started, developers use AWS Amplify Studio’s visual development environment to automatically provision the AWS services (e.g., Amazon Cognito for authentication, Amazon DynamoDB for a database, Amazon S3 for storage, etc.) that will power their application. Developers can then build their UI using AWS Amplify Studio’s library of prebuilt UI components, incorporate data or capabilities from AWS services into their UI with just a few clicks, and collaborate with UX designers through an integration with Figma (a popular tool used to design and prototype UIs)—all without writing any code. Once the UI is complete, AWS Amplify Studio automatically translates it into either JavaScript or TypeScript code, so developers have the flexibility to completely customize their application’s design or behavior to deliver the best end-user experience. With AWS Amplify Studio, developers get the precision of writing their own application code with the speed of a low-code tool, so they can build feature-rich, fully customizable applications on AWS faster. “Developers tell us that they want tools that help make them more productive when building on AWS without sacrificing the precision they need to deliver tailored experiences to their end users,” said Ken Exner, Director of AWS Developer Tools at AWS. “With AWS Amplify Studio, we are extending the same fast, flexible backend development experience that customers love when using AWS Amplify to the UI creation process, so they can build feature-rich web applications with minimal coding. AWS Amplify Studio is a game changer for any developer building web applications on AWS, because it enables greater productivity without compromising control throughout the application development process.” AWS Amplify Studio is available today in US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), Middle East (Bahrain), and South America (São Paulo).

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today at AWS Summit San Francisco announced the general availability of Amazon Aurora Serverless v2, the next generation of Amazon Aurora Serverless that automatically scales to hundreds of thousands of transactions in a fraction of a second to support even the most demanding applications. Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 scales capacity in fine-grained increments based on an application’s needs, providing customers up to 90% cost savings compared to provisioning database capacity for peak load. Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 also includes Amazon Aurora’s capabilities for high availability, performance, and resiliency, with low latency and fast querying. There are no upfront commitments or additional costs to use Amazon Aurora Serverless v2, and customers only pay for the database capacity used. To get started with Amazon Aurora Serverless v2, visit aws.amazon.com/aurora/serverless. Customers often face a dilemma when managing database capacity—provision too much and overspend, or underestimate capacity needs and risk application downtime. Since launching in 2018, Amazon Aurora Serverless has been used by tens of thousands of customers as a cost-effective database option for applications that have infrequent, intermittent, or unpredictable traffic, like test and development workloads. V1 of Amazon Aurora Serverless scales database capacity within five to 50 seconds by doubling capacity each time it is needed—­­and because it is serverless, customers don’t have to worry about managing database capacity. However, to run a wider variety of production workloads with Amazon Aurora Serverless, customers need capacity to scale in fractions of a second and in more precise increments. These customers also want to take advantage of the full range of Amazon Aurora’s capabilities. Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 automatically scales database workloads to hundreds of thousands of transactions in a fraction of a second to support even the most demanding applications. Instead of doubling capacity every time a workload must scale, Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 continuously monitors database activity and adjusts capacity in fine-grained increments to provide just the right amount of database resources an application needs. With Amazon Aurora Serverless v2, customers only pay for the capacity they consume, which can save up to 90% of database costs when compared to the cost of provisioning for peak capacity. Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 also provides the full breadth of Amazon Aurora’s capabilities, including using multiple AWS Availability Zones for high availability, Global Database for local reads with low latency, Read Replicas for high performance, and Parallel Query for faster querying. As a result, Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 is ideal for a much broader set of applications. For example, Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 can now support enterprises that have hundreds of thousands of applications and must manage capacity across their entire fleet of databases, as well as software as a service (SaaS) vendors that have multi-tenant environments with hundreds of thousands of databases that each support a different customer. “Amazon Aurora is the first relational database built from the ground up for the cloud. Today, more than a hundred thousand customers choose to run their database workloads on Amazon Aurora because it delivers the performance and availability of the highest-grade commercial databases at one-tenth the cost,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, Vice President of Databases, Analytics, and Machine Learning at AWS. “With the next generation of Amazon Aurora Serverless, it is now even easier for customers to leave the constraints of old-guard databases behind and enjoy the immense cost savings of scalable, on-demand capacity with all of the advanced capabilities in Amazon Aurora.” Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 is generally available today for MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible editions of Amazon Aurora in US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), and South America (São Paulo), with availability in additional AWS Regions coming soon. 3M is one of the world’s largest providers of software for the health care industry. “At 3M, we are committed to empowering clinicians, providers, and payers by reducing the administrative burden of technology,” said Dhanraj Shriyan, Enterprise Data Architect at 3M. “Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 helps us take huge steps toward this goal by automatically scaling database resources based on our business needs, enabling us to spend less time managing database capacity and more time solving customer challenges.” SmugMug is a paid image sharing service, image hosting service, and online video platform on which users can upload photos and videos. The company facilitates the sale of digital and print media for amateur and professional photographers. “As the world's largest photographer-focused community, SmugMug is built on AWS to provide our customers with a secure, fast, and reliable service to store, share, and sell their photography,” said Don MacAskill, CEO & Chief Geek of SmugMug. “With Amazon Aurora Serverless v2, we can innovate more with the fine-grained scalability that removes the overhead of peak capacity planning—and the associated costs of paying for more than we need, saving our customers money while accelerating performance.” Pagely is a leading managed WordPress hosting platform. “Managing database capacity with spiky and unpredictable workloads is a challenging and resource-intensive task,” said Joshua Eichorn, Chief Technology Officer at Pagely. “With Amazon Aurora Serverless v2, that task is much simpler. We no longer need to worry about fluctuating and unpredictable workloads—database capacity scales automatically by just the right amount to meet demand, keeping up with any spike regardless of size, and scaling down when demand decreases, to minimize costs.” UJET offers an all-in-one cloud contact center platform, developed specifically to transform customer experience for the digital economy and smartphone era. “Because our workloads can vary drastically based on the time of the day, we either need to constantly adjust database capacity or over-provision for peak usage,” said Dave Bullock, Vice President of Engineering at UJET. “Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 scales to just the right amount of capacity on demand to support our workload needs, helping us save cost without compromising customer experience.” The Maricopa County Community College District (MCCCD) is one of the largest community college districts in the United States. “At MCCCD, we work hard to ensure that high-quality education is accessible and affordable for all of our students,” said Joseph Licata, Associate Chief Information Officer at MCCCD. “Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 can help us optimize costs, automate maintenance and patching, and ensure high availability across our district.

(“Amazon”) (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that its Counterfeit Crimes Unit (CCU) worked closely with Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A. (SFER:IM) to report a counterfeiter of Ferragamo’s iconic Gancini belt to the Market Supervision and Administration (MSA) authorities located in Yiwu City, Zhejiang Province, China. Following an investigation by the MSA and Amazon’s CCU, officials raided the criminal’s warehouse, seizing hundreds of counterfeit belts and buckle accessories that may otherwise have been sold through retail channels around the world. Amazon and Ferragamo will continue to assist law enforcement in investigating counterfeiters and preventing their products from entering the global supply chain, to help stop this illicit trade at the source. “Amazon is grateful for the collaboration from Ferragamo and the MSA in protecting customers from these counterfeit products,” said Kebharu Smith, head of Amazon’s Counterfeit Crimes Unit. “This should serve as a reminder that bad actors will be held accountable, as Amazon collaborates with both brands and law enforcement agencies around the world to stop inauthentic products from being sold across the retail industry.” The case originates from a worldwide investigative effort against certain bad actors, which Amazon and Ferragamo identified as trying to sell in Amazon’s store. In February 2021, Amazon and Ferragamo jointly filed two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington and allege the defendants conspired to use Ferragamo’s registered trademarks, without authorization, to deceive customers about the authenticity and origin of the products and the affiliation with Ferragamo. Over the years, Salvatore Ferragamo has implemented a series of offline and online anti-counterfeiting measures to protect its customers and its brand. Thanks to these actions, in 2021, more than 22,000 infringing products and pieces of illicit content were removed from social media platforms and more than 130,000 listings related to counterfeit products were identified and removed from marketplace service providers. In 2021, Salvatore Ferragamo also carried out regular controls on physical stores launching several in-and out-of-court administrative and criminal proceedings, with a specific focus on China. Thanks to the increasing cooperation from local authorities, almost 450,000 counterfeit products were seized worldwide. Amazon strictly prohibits infringing and counterfeit products in its store and, in 2020, Amazon invested more than $700 million and employed more than 10,000 people to proactively protect its store from fraud, counterfeit, and abuse. Amazon uses industry-leading tools to verify potential sellers’ identities and ensure product listings are authentic, and Amazon’s proprietary systems analyze hundreds of unique data points to verify information provided by potential sellers. In 2020, only 6% of attempted new seller account registrations passed Amazon’s robust verification processes and listed products for sale. In addition, fewer than 0.01% of all products sold on Amazon received a counterfeit complaint from customers. Amazon launched the CCU in 2020 to help hold counterfeiters accountable through the courts and law enforcement. This global team—which is made up of former federal prosecutors, former law enforcement agents, experienced investigators and data analysts—pursues targets around the globe. Amazon’s CCU supports law enforcement efforts to bring justice to those attempting to sell counterfeits to protect customers, brands, Amazon’s stores, and the retail industry.

Our Consumer business has grown 23% annually over the past two years, with extraordinary growth in 2020 of 39% year-over-year that necessitated doubling the size of our fulfillment network that we’d built over Amazon’s first 25 years—and doing so in just 24 months. Today, as we’re no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity, our teams are squarely focused on improving productivity and cost efficiencies throughout our fulfillment network. We know how to do this and have done it before. This may take some time, particularly as we work through ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures, but we see encouraging progress on a number of customer experience dimensions, including delivery speed performance as we’re now approaching levels not seen since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020.” Highlights Shopping Amazon announced Buy with Prime, a new benefit for Prime members in the U.S. that extends the convenience of shopping with Prime to online stores beyond Amazon.com. Prime members can shop directly from participating merchants’ online stores using their Prime member benefits, including fast and free delivery, a seamless checkout experience, and free returns on eligible orders. This year, Prime Day will take place in July in more than 20 countries. During Amazon’s annual shopping event, Prime members will be able to save on products from national brands and small businesses across every category. Amazon continued to invent and expand ways for customers to discover fashion products. For example, View in 3D enables customers in the U.S. and Canada to view a shoe at any angle, and The Drop provides customers worldwide with access to limited-edition, size-inclusive clothing collections by fashion influencers globally. Amazon also launched Style Feed, a shoppable stream of influencer-curated content on the Amazon shopping app for customers in the U.S. and India to explore fashion, home décor, and beauty items. Amazon launched Amazon Aware, a new brand of consciously created everyday products that span apparel, home, and beauty, and that are made from materials such as recycled polyester, organic cotton, and bio-based ingredients. All Amazon Aware products are certified as carbon neutral and feature certifications that are part of Amazon’s Climate Pledge Friendly program. Amazon opened eight new Amazon Fresh grocery stores and now has 46 Amazon Fresh grocery stores around the world. The newest Amazon Fresh store in Seattle is the world’s first grocery store seeking Zero Carbon certification from the International Future Living Institute and features more than a dozen store design upgrades expected to save nearly 185 tons of carbon emissions each year when compared to an industry-standard grocery store. Amazon opened a new, larger Amazon Go store format for customers in suburban areas in the U.S., with the first location in Mill Creek, Washington. The new format features Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology for a checkout-free shopping experience, an expanded selection of grab-and-go food and beverage items, and a Made-to-Order kitchen with freshly prepared, customizable breakfast and lunch items. Amazon has plans to expand this format to the Los Angeles area in the coming months. For the first time, Amazon introduced Just Walk Out technology at two Whole Foods Market stores in Washington, D.C., and Sherman Oaks, California. Just Walk Out technology also rolled out at new third-party locations, including travel retailer WHSmith in LaGuardia Airport in New York City; UBS Arena in New York; and Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas. In addition, a food and beverage store equipped with Just Walk Out technology and Amazon One will be opening soon at T-Mobile Park in Seattle. The combination of technologies will give fans the option to enter the store with their palm or credit card, take what they want, and leave without stopping to check out. Amazon Business launched Punch-in, an industry-first procurement tool that simplifies the buying experience for businesses. With Punch-in, businesses can start their purchasing directly on Amazon Business and submit their cart to their e-Procurement system for purchase order creation and reconciliation.

Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 28, 2022, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our estimates as of April 28, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as the effect of other factors discussed above. Second Quarter 2022 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $116.0 billion and $121.0 billion, or to grow between 3% and 7% compared with second quarter 2021. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 200 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income (loss) is expected to be between $(1.0) billion and $3.0 billion, compared with $7.7 billion in second quarter 2021. This guidance assumes that Prime Day occurs in third quarter 2022.

This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results. These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic conditions and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks.

The company will expand its Tech Hubs in San Diego and the Los Angeles area, including Irvine and Santa Monica, as it seeks to recruit local talent and continue inventing and innovating on behalf of its customers. These latest investments come after Amazon opened more than 15 sites across Southern California and created more than 17,000 jobs statewide in 2021 alone. “Communities across California have welcomed Amazon over the past decade and have seen firsthand how our investments can unlock new opportunities for their neighbors and local economies. We’ve created more than 170,000 jobs across the state and are committed to continue investing here,” said Holly Sullivan, Amazon’s vice president of worldwide economic development. “These 2,500 new jobs include roles building cloud infrastructure, improving the Alexa experience, and designing cutting edge video games. They’re a fantastic opportunity for Californians of all backgrounds to join Amazon and build a successful career.” Amazon’s expansions in California will support various teams across the company, including retail, Amazon Games, Amazon Web Services, and operations. A variety of roles are already available, including software development engineers, game designers, and user experience designers, along with positions in human resources, finance, IT, and more. People interested in applying for roles at Amazon can learn more here. “Economic development, especially job creation, is critical to our city’s growth. Amazon’s expansion of its tech hub in Irvine is a testament to the fantastic talent pool and high quality of life our city has to offer,” said Farrah Khan, Mayor of Irvine. “Investments like Amazon’s act as a vote of confidence for Irvine and these 800 new corporate and tech roles will continue to unlock economic opportunity for our community.” ""Job creation and economic development is essential to a sustainable and vibrant city,” said San Diego City Councilmember Chris Cate. “I am excited to see how Amazon's expanded presence in San Diego will drive new investments in our region and bring 700 new tech and corporate jobs, boosting economic growth for years to come. San Diego is the perfect place for Amazon to bring cutting edge innovation and technology to reality."" Amazon’s investments in California will include new office space in three cities, contributing to local job creation and the revitalization of downtown areas. These investments include: Santa Monica – As part of Amazon’s expansion at its Los Angeles Tech Hub, the company plans to create more than 1,000 new corporate and tech jobs in Santa Monica over the coming years. To accommodate this hiring effort, Amazon has signed a lease for a 200,000-square-foot space with J.P. Morgan Asset Management at the Water Garden. The new site will begin welcoming employees in mid-2023. Irvine – Further expanding its Los Angeles Tech Hub, Amazon also plans to create more than 800 corporate and tech jobs over the next few years in Irvine. The company has signed a lease for 116,000 square feet of space at Spectrum Terrace with Irvine Company and plans to occupy the office space later this year. San Diego – Amazon has signed a lease for a 123,000-square-foot space with Seritage Growth Properties and Invesco at University Town Center to accommodate more than 700 employees. About 1,000 tech and corporate employees are already working at Amazon’s San Diego Tech Hub. The new office space will open for employees in early 2023. Amazon is constantly innovating and creating new programs to provide candidates of all backgrounds and levels of experience the opportunity to join the company. Now, candidates from California can benefit from Amazon Returnship, an initiative to help professionals get back to work after they’ve lost or left their jobs—including people displaced by the impacts of COVID-19. People applying for a tech role can also use Amazon’s newest recruiting program, Best Fit, which uses a new technology that allows software engineers to apply once and be considered for thousands of jobs across hundreds of Amazon teams—including some roles they may not have even thought of. Unlocking opportunity in Southern California Beyond its hiring efforts, Amazon contributes millions of dollars and continues to partner with more than 100 organizations across Southern California, including the Orange County Children’s Hospital, United Way of Orange County, the San Diego Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Community Center, the San Ysidro Women’s Club, and the Surfrider Foundation. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon has donated transportation services to deliver more than 4 million meals on behalf of LA Regional Food Bank. The company also made philanthropic contributions to programs that provided small business relief, allowed for the expansion of online learning, supported food distribution programs, and created mobile COVID-19 testing and vaccine clinics. As the U.S. emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon continues to build economic opportunity in the communities it calls home. In Southern California, Amazon has built workforce development partnerships with city and county agencies across the region to offer Californian workers the opportunity to learn new skills in emerging fields like robotics, advanced logistics, and cloud computing. Amazon also supports local schools through Amazon Future Engineer, the company’s global philanthropic computer science education program designed to inspire and educate millions of students each year to try computer science and coding. The program supports close to 600 schools across California, including Los Angeles and San Diego schools, providing students with high-quality computer science curriculum, robotics clubs, and project-based learning. Since 2010, Amazon has created more than 170,000 full- and part-time jobs in California and invested more than $81 billion across the state, including infrastructure from fulfillment centers, Whole Foods Market locations, and three Tech Hubs. These investments have contributed an additional $80 billion to the California economy and support 259,000 indirect jobs—in addition to the employees the company directly employs—in industries like construction, logistics, and professional services. Currently, more than 220,000 independent authors and small and medium-sized businesses in California are growing their businesses with Amazon.

The Fund, created by Amazon in 2018 in partnership with the nonprofits Alliance for Education and Bellevue LifeSpring, helps address students’ basic and immediate needs like food, shelter, clothing, and school supplies so students arrive at school prepared to learn. The donation will support all 106 schools within the Seattle Public Schools district and all 29 schools in the Bellevue School District. “Many local families in underserved communities are feeling the impact of surging food and housing prices, and they’re making tough sacrifices to meet their immediate needs. We are determined to help by funding meals, shelter, clothing, school supplies, and other basic needs so kids can be successful students,” said David Zapolsky, Amazon general counsel and senior vice president, and Alliance for Education board member. “The Right Now Needs Fund helps our nonprofit partners and schools quickly identify and eliminate barriers to learning for students across the Puget Sound region, and we’re committed to continue supporting their work as one piece of our broader efforts to help our neighbors throughout the region.” Amazon’s donation includes $1.4 million to the Alliance for Education to help identify and close opportunity gaps for local students and families at all of Seattle Public Schools’ 106 schools. Since the Fund was created with the Alliance for Education in 2018, donations have supported more than 38,000 requests for student support, including helping to cover costs for rent and utilities, food, clothing, and other basic needs. “Amazon has been a tremendous partner to our Seattle Public Schools school community,” said Dr. Brent Jones, superintendent of Seattle Public Schools. “Throughout the life of our collaboration, they have demonstrated time and again that they are committed to expanding resources and providing immediate and tangible solutions for Seattle Public Schools students and families. We extend our gratitude and heartfelt thanks to Amazon and look forward to an even greater partnership in the future.” Amazon also donated $700,000 in cash and $150,000 in Amazon Gift Cards to Bellevue LifeSpring to support all 29 schools in the Bellevue School District. Bellevue LifeSpring supports nearly 4,000 underserved students enrolled in the Bellevue School District and their families. Since the Fund was created with Bellevue LifeSpring in 2020, there have been more than 15,000 instances of student support, including issuing more than 5,400 food vouchers for students, ensuring 178 students remained in their homes, and providing clothing for 666 students. “Our colleagues are working with students and families during these incredibly tough times, and many of the families need support from the Right Now Needs Fund,” said Julie Bronson, family engagement and preschool coordinator at the Bellevue School District. “The challenges are wide-ranging, from food and clothing needs to help with housing while facing financial challenges and other emergencies. We are very grateful for the support from Amazon and our partnership with both the Amazon and Bellevue LifeSpring teams because it ensures a quick response so that no child goes without basic supports that we all deserve.” School-based staff within the districts work with students and families to identify needs and submit requests for financial assistance through their respective nonprofit partner. In addition, any school community member can request assistance if they notice a specific student need. To date, every school within Seattle Public Schools and the Bellevue School District has used the Right Now Need Fund to help students. Since launching the first Right Now Needs Fund in Seattle in 2018, Amazon has donated more than $8 million to provide support across all 106 schools within Seattle Public Schools and all 29 schools in the Bellevue School District. Combined, the donations have supported more than 55,000 requests for support—from clothing to hygiene products to school supplies— for students and their families. In addition to the Right Now Needs Fund donations, Amazon has donated 9,000 laptops and devices to Seattle Public Schools for remote learning. Amazon also delivered more than 1 million school meals to Seattle Public Schools students during the pandemic, to help ensure that students who rely on school meals had access to food while learning remotely, and donated $1 million to the City of Bellevue’s Health and Human Services Fund to support local families in need who were disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

This commitment is part of the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, a more than $2 billion commitment to create and preserve 20,000 affordable homes for individuals and families earning moderate-to-low incomes in Nashville, Washington state’s Puget Sound region, and the Arlington, Virginia, region. “We’ve already hired more than 2,500 people at our Nashville office, and we’re continuing to invest and create jobs across the city. We also know that the city’s growth, the impacts of the pandemic, and various other factors affect the availability of affordable housing, and we want to do our part to help. As one important piece of that, we’re proud to be partnering with MDHA and CrossBridge to bring new housing to residents,” said Michelle Gaskin Brown, Amazon’s Nashville manager of public policy. “These new developments will provide affordable housing, social services support, and convenient access to public transportation to hundreds of families and individuals in the city. We look forward to continuing our investment in Nashville and helping to create and preserve affordable homes so everyone has the opportunity to live, work, and thrive here.” Amazon’s commitment to MDHA consists of a $7.1 million low-rate loan to support the construction of Cherry Oak Apartments, a mixed-income residential development featuring 96 apartments, including 53 affordable homes in the Cayce Place neighborhood in East Nashville. Cherry Oak Apartments will provide housing in proximity to high-quality transit, employment centers, and parks. Families living in the affordable units at Cherry Oak Apartments will have guaranteed affordability at or below 80% of area medium income (AMI) for 99 years. “Cherry Oak Apartments is one of many new residential developments at Cayce Place as we move forward with transforming our largest subsidized housing property into a mixed-income community,” said MDHA Executive Director Dr. Troy D. White. “We are grateful to receive Amazon’s first major investment for affordable housing in Nashville, and we hope this is just the start of a successful partnership.” Additionally, Amazon is providing a $3.5 million grant to CrossBridge, a Nashville nonprofit that provides housing and supportive services to adults overcoming addiction. The grant will support CrossBridge’s housing projects on Lindsley Avenue in the Rolling Hill Mill neighborhood. CrossBridge owns an entire city block, where the organization is completing a new 50-unit building and renovating an existing 24-unit building into a 34-unit building. The grant will allow CrossBridge to complete its projects, operate at affordable rents, and expand services. CrossBridge will also provide tenants with mental health counseling, addiction support, workforce reentry support, and other services. Supportive housing, which helps people with substance use disorders, is the most resource-intensive type of housing. The rents are extremely low and service requirements are high, making it necessary to provide long-term subsidies. The 84 CrossBridge units this funding supports will add to the most difficult to finance stock of permanent supportive housing in Nashville. “CrossBridge provides effective solutions to end destructive cycles,” said Tina Mitchell, president-executive director of CrossBridge. “Through our Restoration House Program, we serve men and women struggling with substance use disorders. By offering high-quality, safe, and affordable housing within the context of a supportive community, we provide a reliable path to break the cycles of addiction, incarceration, and homelessness.” Bill Hart, CrossBridge vice president and general counsel, said, “This grant from the Amazon Housing Equity Fund will allow us to do so much more for those who have so little, resulting in transformed lives and a safer community.” Over the past two years, Amazon has committed more than $94 million to affordable housing efforts in Nashville. In 2020, Amazon donated $2.25 million to local affordable housing nonprofit The Housing Fund—and followed up with another $1.5 million in 2021—to support housing residents in Nashville at risk of losing their homes. After launching the Housing Equity Fund in January 2021, Amazon announced a $75 million commitment to create 800 affordable homes near WeGo transit corridors. Most recently, Amazon launched an accelerator program in collaboration with the Urban League of Middle Tennessee, which offers professional development, mentorship, and early grant funding to emerging developers of color to help increase inclusive housing developments and community building.

Smith Announces the Filing of a Securities Class Action on Behalf of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Investors","BENSALEM, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Law Offices of Howard G. Smith announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock between February 1, 2019 and April 5, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Amazon investors have until July 5, 2022 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors suffering losses on their Amazon investments are encouraged to contact the Law Offices of Howard G. Smith to discuss their legal rights in this class action at 888-638-4847 or by email to howardsmith@howardsmithlaw.com. In June 2019, the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary initiated a bipartisan investigation into the state of competition online, which examined the business practices and market dominance of Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple. On March 9, 2022, media outlets reported that the House Judiciary Committee had requested the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) to open a criminal investigation into Amazon and certain of its executives for allegedly lying to Congress during the course of its investigation. On April 6, 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating how Amazon handled disclosures on employees’ use of third party sellers' data to boost its own private-label business. On this news, the Company’s stock price fell $105.98, or 3.2%, to close at $3,175.12 per share on April 6, 2022, thereby injuring investors. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Amazon engaged in anticompetitive conduct in its private-label business practices, including giving Amazon products preference over those of its competitors and using third-party sellers’ non-public data to compete with them; (2) the foregoing exposed Amazon to a heightened risk of regulatory scrutiny and/or enforcement actions; (3) Amazon’s revenues derived from its private-label business were in part the product of impermissible conduct and thus unsustainable; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

Investors have until July 5, 2022 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. Amazon is a multinational technology company that engages primarily in the businesses of e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. On the Company’s Amazon.com e-commerce platform, Amazon sells both third-party merchandise and Amazon’s own private-label products. As the owner and operator of the Amazon.com e-commerce platform, Amazon has access to certain non-public data of the third-party sellers that use the Amazon.com platform. On or around June 3, 2019, the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary initiated a bipartisan investigation into the state of competition online. The investigation, led by the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law (the “Subcommittee”), examined the business practices and market dominance of Facebook, Google, Apple, and, of particular relevance, Amazon (the “Subcommittee Investigation”). In the course of the Subcommittee Investigation, the Subcommittee held several oversight hearings in which various officers of the above referenced companies, including their respective Chief Executive Officers, offered witness testimony on topics such as the effect of market power on the press, innovation, and privacy, and the market dominance of the firms under investigation. After each of the hearings, members of the Subcommittee submitted questions for the record to the witnesses. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Amazon engaged in anticompetitive conduct in its private-label business practices, including giving Amazon products preference over those of its competitors and using third-party sellers’ non-public data to compete with them; (ii) the foregoing exposed Amazon to a heightened risk of regulatory scrutiny and/or enforcement actions; (iii) Amazon’s revenues derived from its private-label business were in part the product of impermissible conduct and thus unsustainable; and (iv) as a result, the Defendants’ public statements throughout the Class Period were materially false and/or misleading. On March 9, 2022, media outlets reported that the House Judiciary Committee had requested that the U.S. Department of Justice open a criminal investigation into Amazon and certain of its executives for allegedly lying to Congress about its business practices during the course of the Subcommittee Investigation. In response, Amazon asserted that there was “no factual basis” for the House Judiciary Committee’s allegations. Then, on April 6, 2022, The Wall Street Journal published an article entitled “SEC Is Investigating How Amazon Disclosed Business Practices.” The article reported, inter alia, that the SEC’s probe has been underway for more than a year and focuses on Amazon’s disclosures regarding its use of third-party seller data for its own private-label business. On this news, Amazon’s stock price fell $105.98 per share, or 3.2%, to close at $3,175.12 per share on April 6, 2022.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than July 5, 2022. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Amazon engaged in anticompetitive conduct in its private-label business practices, including giving Amazon products preference over those of its competitors and using third-party sellers’ non-public data to compete with them; (2) the foregoing exposed Amazon to a heightened risk of regulatory scrutiny and/or enforcement actions; (3) Amazon’s revenues derived from its private-label business were in part the product of impermissible conduct and thus unsustainable; and (4) as a result, the defendants’ public statements throughout the Class Period were materially false and/or misleading. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Liu has had a strong presence on the IMDbPro STARmeter chart, reaching the top 10 three times in the past year, propelled by his leading roles in Kim's Convenience and Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings. Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings trended as a fan favorite title on the IMDbPro MOVIEmeter chart, landing a spot on the IMDb Top 10 Movies of 2021 list. Liu recently won a People's Choice Award in the category of ‘Action Movie Star’ and is currently shooting Barbie for Warner Bros. His memoir titled We Were Dreamers: An Immigrant Superhero Origin Story will be published by William Morrow this May. Video of Liu accepting his STARmeter Award is available at Video of Liu accepting his STARmeter Award is available at https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1352450585. “I am so incredibly grateful to receive the IMDb STARmeter Award – this is truly an honor,” said Simu Liu, celebrating his STARmeter Award in the UK, where he is currently filming Barbie. “It feels like just yesterday that I got my first IMDb credit but almost 10 years later I’ve been fortunate enough to help bring some incredible movies and TV shows to life. I really couldn’t be happier to receive this award – thank you to IMDb and to all the fans for checking out my IMDb and IMDbPro pages.” “Simu Liu has captivated audiences around the world with his powerful and compelling performances in a broad range of roles and films, and fans and professionals have turned to IMDb and IMDbPro to learn more about him,” said Nikki Santoro, IMDb chief operating officer. “As we celebrate Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month on IMDb, we are thrilled to highlight Simu and his career with an IMDb STARmeter Award, and we can’t wait to see the characters and projects he’ll take on next.” Throughout the month of May, IMDb is celebrating Asian and Pacific Islander actors, directors, producers, and writers with exclusive videos and curated galleries.

Even five years ago the industry landscape was very different; the opportunities did not exist to cultivate the richness of storytelling that we’re seeing today in Lee Isaac Chung, Lulu Wang, Justin Chon, Kogonada, Destin Daniel Cretton, Jon Chu, James Wan, Justin Lin, and so many others,” said Liu. He also commented, “Films such as The Farewell, Minari, and After Yang shine an honest light on the Asian American experience, one that is often overlooked in Hollywood. I’ve been personally inspired by these films to be a champion of our stories and to help amplify the important voices in our community.” IMDb users can add the TV series and films from Liu‘s IMDb filmography, as well as other titles, to their IMDb Watchlist at www.imdb.com/watchlist.

Investors with Substantial Losses Have Opportunity to Lead the Amazon Class Action Lawsuit - AMZN","SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock between February 1, 2019 and April 5, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”) have until July 5, 2022 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in Joyce v. Amazon.com, Inc., No. 22-cv-00617 (W.D. Wash.). Commenced on May 6, 2022, the Amazon class action lawsuit – captioned Joyce v. Amazon.com, Inc., No. 22-cv-00617 (W.D. Wash.) – charges Amazon and certain of its top executive officers with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered significant losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Amazon class action lawsuit, please provide your information by clicking here. You can also contact attorney J.C. Sanchez of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at jsanchez@rgrdlaw.com. Lead plaintiff motions for the Amazon class action lawsuit must be filed with the court no later than July 5, 2022. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Amazon is a multinational technology company that engages primarily in the businesses of e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. On or around June 3, 2019, the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary (the “House Judiciary Committee”) initiated a bipartisan investigation into the state of competition online. The investigation, led by the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, examined the business practices and market dominance of Facebook, Google, Apple, and, of particular relevance, Amazon (the “Subcommittee Investigation”). The Amazon class action lawsuit alleges that, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that: (i) Amazon engaged in anticompetitive conduct in its private-label business practices, including giving Amazon products preference over those of its competitors and using third-party sellers’ non-public data to compete with them; (ii) this exposed Amazon to a heightened risk of regulatory scrutiny and/or enforcement actions; (iii) Amazon’s revenues derived from its private-label business were, in part, the product of impermissible conduct and thus unsustainable; and (iv) as a result, defendants’ public statements throughout the Class Period were materially false and/or misleading. On March 9, 2022, media outlets reported that the House Judiciary Committee had requested that the U.S. Department of Justice open a criminal investigation into Amazon and certain of its executives for allegedly lying to Congress about its business practices during the course of the Subcommittee Investigation. In response, Amazon asserted that there was “no factual basis” for the House Judiciary Committee’s allegations. Then, on April 6, 2022, The Wall Street Journal published an article entitled “SEC Is Investigating How Amazon Disclosed Business Practices.” The article reported, among other things, that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s probe has been underway for more than a year and focuses on Amazon’s disclosures regarding its use of third-party seller data for its own private-label business. On this news, Amazon’s stock price fell approximately 3.2%, damaging investors. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased Amazon stock during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Amazon class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Amazon class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Amazon class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery of the Amazon class action lawsuit is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
