    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Pharrell Williams’ education equity nonprofit YELLOW, and the Georgia Institute of Technology today announced a new educational collaboration called “Your Voice is Power” to encourage middle and high school students to share their voice on equity while learning to code new music remixes. The “Your Voice is Power” collaboration includes five teaching modules with lesson plans that teach coding while kick-starting meaningful conversations among students and their teachers about the importance of racial justice. This collaboration concludes with a competition for students to share their own voices through remixing Pharrell’s new song “Entrepreneur” using computer code on Georgia Tech’s learn-to-code-through-music platform, EarSketch. “Your Voice is Power” is the latest initiative between Amazon Future Engineer, Amazon Music, and Georgia Tech to expand computer science education to more students from underserved communities and groups currently underrepresented in tech. “Your Voice Is Power” is hoping to attract upwards of 100,000 students as a way to add unique, meaningful, and entrepreneurial-minded content to their current virtual learning experiences. The need for high quality computer science education is more important than ever, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that from 2014 to 2024, the market for computer science professionals will grow twice as fast as the rest of the labor market. BLS research also shows that in 2019, the median annual salary for computer science occupations was approximately $48,000 greater than the median wage for all occupations in the U.S. What’s more, while the number of Black students obtaining STEM degrees has increased over the last two decades, Black professionals remain underrepresented within American science and engineering enterprises. The National Science Board (NSB) estimates that the number of Black professionals in science and engineering must more than double to be representative of Black people in the U.S. population in 2030. “This collaboration between YELLOW, Amazon, and Georgia Tech is a celebration of Black creators and change-makers,” said Pharrell. “YELLOW at its core believes that education is a pathway to success. Teaching kids future-ready skills like coding, especially those kids for whom opportunities like this have not been equally distributed, is how we prepare the next generation of entrepreneurs.” “YELLOW’s mission is to even the odds for kids through education. We’re teaching for the future,” said Mike McGalliard, CEO of YELLOW. “Georgia Tech’s EarSketch platform is a powerful tool for kids to explore the connection between coding and creativity. In working alongside Amazon to give kids access to platforms like this, we can help them bring their ideas to life.” “Your Voice is Power'' introduces students to real-world computer science-based careers held by people of color. Through this program, students will meet professionals who use music and computer science to fight for racial justice—people including Mike Larson, Pharrell’s audio engineer; Chalece DeLaCoudray, a music technologist and Georgia Tech alumna; and Joycelyn Wilson, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Hip Hop Studies and Digital Media at Georgia Tech. “Your Voice is Power'' will also encourage students to channel their learning into an original remix of Pharrell’s new song ‘Entrepreneur’ – a celebration of Black culture – using Python computer code. Specifically, they will use looping (repeating) to extend the length of their song, use strings to create new beats, create custom functions representing different song sections, and learn to upload their own sounds to the EarSketch library. “We’re honored to join Amazon Future Engineer, and together build further awareness and enlist more artists to join this program that will break down barriers for students from underrepresented communities,” said Ryan Redington, VP of Music Industry at Amazon Music. “The more we support the next generation of artists and creators, the better the future of music will be. We are proud to work alongside Pharrell, a respected, visionary voice in promoting racial justice and helping students achieve long-term success.” “Across 13 research studies with over 1000 participants, Georgia Tech has shown that students who learn to code through music using EarSketch have a higher intention to persist in studying and pursuing careers in computing – especially BLNA students and women,” said Jason Freeman, Professor and Chair of the School of Music and the co-creator of EarSketch. All middle and high school students around the United States and Canada can participate in “Your Voice is Power.” The first round of the competition will run from January 19 through March 12. The second round of the competition will run from March 15 through June 4. Students who submit their remixes to the competition will be judged by a panel of Amazon engineers, Amazon Music team members, and music industry professionals. Winners will be chosen based on the quality of music, complexity and organization of their code, and their inclusion of thoughtful messaging and calls to action about the importance of racial justice. Teachers and students can visit AmazonFutureEngineer.com to get started, and for a full list of rules, prizes, scoring guidelines, and accompanying curriculum. Beyond this competition and throughout 2021, Amazon Future Engineer and Amazon Music will work with additional inspiring artists to add their songs to the EarSketch library. Right now, students can also use computer code to remix Ciara’s songs “Set” and “Melanin,” and Common’s “God is Love” on EarSketch. This partnership is among the latest in Amazon’s ongoing work to support education and racial equality initiatives in communities across the country where its employees live and work. Recently, the company donated $10 million to organizations that are working to bring about social justice and improve the lives of Black and African Americans. Recipients—selected with the help of Amazon's Black Employee Network (BEN)—include groups focused on combating systemic racism through the legal system as well as those dedicated to expanding educational and economic opportunity for Black communities. Amazon followed this initial donation with a hugely successful employee match program that resulted in an additional $17 million going to these organizations for a total of $27 million from the Amazon community.

    "text": "BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced plans to expand its Boston Tech Hub and create more than 3,000 new corporate and technology jobs over the next several years. The new roles will support teams across the company, including Alexa, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon Robotics, and Amazon Pharmacy. Over the last decade, Amazon has invested more than $6.2 billion in Massachusetts and created more than 20,000 jobs across customer fulfillment, retail, corporate and technology functions. “We’re proud to be creating more than 3,000 new jobs over the next several years at our Boston Tech Hub,” said Rohit Prasad, Vice President & Head Scientist for Alexa at Amazon. “Much of the technology that makes Alexa smarter every day is invented in Boston. Our teams here play a key role in driving Amazon’s innovations – from Alexa to AWS to Amazon Pharmacy – and help us keep delighting customers around the world. We look forward to continuing to be a strong community partner, helping to grow and diversify the local economy, and create new opportunities for Boston and its residents.” The 3,000 jobs that Amazon plans to create in its Boston Tech Hub will include technology roles in software development, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, along with non-tech corporate roles in product management, HR, finance, and more. Amazon already employs more than 3,700 people in its Boston Tech Hub. “Our administration welcomes Amazon's continued efforts to invest in our communities,” said Governor Charlie Baker. “This expansion is significant and will create thousands more jobs for our highly skilled workforce in different regions of the Commonwealth.”​ “By further expanding its Boston Tech Hub, Amazon is continuing to create new economic opportunities in our City,” said Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh. “This expansion will grow our technology workforce and support a strong pipeline of diverse talent and a range of new jobs and opportunities for Boston residents.\" To accommodate its growing teams in Boston, Amazon leased a new 17-story office tower located at One Boston Wharf Road in the 33-acre Boston Seaport project. Owned and developed by Boston-based development company WS Development, the 630,000 square foot location will include working space, innovation labs, and mixed-use common areas for Amazon employees. Set for completion in 2024, One Boston Wharf Road will also feature a community dog park, ground-floor retail space and a new performing arts center for Bostonians to enjoy with two live performance venues consisting of a 500-seat theater and a 100-seat black box theater, which together will add significant state-of-the-art capacity for the performing arts in Boston. “We are proud to continue our partnership with Amazon in Boston’s Seaport, a neighborhood that has grown to serve forward-thinking employers, residents, and retailers and that is now a global hub of innovation and talent,” said Jeremy Sclar, Chairman and CEO of WS Development. This is Amazon’s second full-building lease in Boston’s Seaport after securing a 430,000-square foot building at 111 Harbor Way. Now under construction by WS Development, this office will be completed later this year and will host 2,000 Amazon employees. Using our Scale for Good in Massachusetts Amazon continues to support the communities in which it operates in Boston and Massachusetts. Amazon Future Engineer, our comprehensive childhood-to-career program designed to inspire, educate, and prepare children and young adults from underrepresented and underserved communities to pursue computer science, supports more than 20 schools in the Boston area, and more than 60 across the state of Massachusetts. The program provides local schools with high quality computer science education curriculum and teacher professional development. Amazon has also provided grants of more than $1.5 million to St. Mary’s Center to support women, children and families in need facing homelessness. Since 2010, Amazon has created more than 20,000 jobs in Massachusetts and invested more than $6.2 billion across the Commonwealth, including infrastructure (from fulfillment centers to retail locations to our Boston Tech Hub) and compensation. These investments have contributed an additional $5.3 billion to the Massachusetts economy and have helped create an additional 13,400 jobs on top of those that the company directly employs – from jobs in construction and logistics to healthcare and professional services. Additionally, more than 34,500 independent authors and small and medium businesses in Massachusetts are currently growing their businesses with Amazon. About Amazon Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

Amazon is also announcing today that Jeff Bezos will transition to the role of Executive Chair in the third quarter of 2021 and Andy Jassy will become Chief Executive Officer at that time. “Amazon is what it is because of invention. We do crazy things together and then make them normal. We pioneered customer reviews, 1-Click, personalized recommendations, Prime’s insanely-fast shipping, Just Walk Out shopping, the Climate Pledge, Kindle, Alexa, marketplace, infrastructure cloud computing, Career Choice, and much more,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. “If you do it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. That yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive. When you look at our financial results, what you’re actually seeing are the long-run cumulative results of invention. Right now I see Amazon at its most inventive ever, making it an optimal time for this transition.” Highlights Investing in Employee Safety and Providing Good Jobs Amazon is working to ensure that its front-line employees receive vaccines as soon as possible. The company is closely monitoring the availability of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide, advocating on behalf of its employees, and working in partnership with global medical experts, governments, and health providers to accelerate vaccination programs. Amazon continues to ramp up its in-house COVID-19 testing program as part of its investments to keep front-line employees safe. More than 700 employees are now tested every hour, and Amazon’s dedicated COVID-19 labs have processed more than one million tests globally. Amazon recognized front-line employees by investing $2.5 billion in additional pay in 2020. This is on top of the company’s industry-leading starting wage of at least $15 an hour, which is double the federal minimum wage. All full-time employees also receive healthcare and full benefits from their first day on the job. Amazon received the Lee Anderson Veteran and Military Spouse Employment Award for excellence in hiring, training, and retaining veterans, transitioning service members, and military spouses. Amazon employs more than 40,000 veterans and military spouses across the U.S. Supporting Communities Amazon announced a new Housing Equity Fund, a $2 billion commitment to preserve and create over 20,000 affordable housing units in Washington State’s Puget Sound region; Arlington, Virginia; and Nashville, Tennessee. The Fund provides below-market loans and grants to housing partners, public agencies, and minority-led organizations. It started with initial investments totaling $567 million for 2,300 affordable apartment homes. Amazon announced plans to provide free cloud skills training to 29 million people around the world by 2025, as it continues to invest in upskilling and career development for its customers and employees. The AWS-designed programs range from self-paced online courses to intensive upskilling programs that help participants build new careers in the technology industry. This expands on Amazon’s Upskilling 2025 initiative, a $700 million commitment to upskill 100,000 U.S. employees by helping them transition into high-demand, high-paying jobs, as well as Career Choice, a program that pre-pays tuition for employees looking to earn degrees in in-demand fields. Amazon unveiled plans for the second phase of construction for its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. Amazon plans to build 2.8 million square feet of office space as part of its commitment to create 25,000 jobs and invest $2.5 billion in the community over the next decade. The project will create more than 2.5 acres of open space for the local community, run on renewable energy, and bring retail and other services to local residents. Amazon in the UK expanded its long-standing partnership with nonprofit Magic Breakfast to reach more children at risk of hunger. In addition to being a significant financial donor, Amazon distributed more than two million free, healthy breakfasts to children studying at home due to COVID-19 who would normally receive these meals at school. In the UK, Amazon delivered more than six million COVID-19 testing kits free of charge, in support of the government’s COVID-19 testing program. Globally, Amazon has donated over 65,000 Echo devices, Fire Tablets, and other devices throughout the COVID-19 crisis to organizations that support frontline workers and first responders, and to help keep patients, students, and communities impacted by the pandemic connected. In support of World AIDS Day and Giving Tuesday, Amazon announced the limited-edition (echo)RED. Available in the all-new spherical design, (echo)RED offers premium sound and a built-in smart home hub. Amazon will donate $10 of every (echo)RED sale to support (RED)’s fight against AIDS and COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa. Customers can also donate to (RED)’s fight against the COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS pandemics on any Alexa-enabled device by simply saying, “Alexa, donate to RED.” Ring announced a new program with Habitat for Humanity, a global nonprofit that shares Ring’s commitment to help make homes and neighborhoods safer, including a donation of $1 million worth of Ring Video Doorbells to provide Habitat homeowners with added peace of mind. Protecting the Planet Amazon became the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, taking another step in its journey to be net-zero carbon by 2040. The company is investing in the building of 26 new utility-scale wind and solar projects in Australia, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Sweden, the UK, and the U.S., bringing Amazon’s total number of renewable energy projects to 127. Amazon’s investments will supply its operations with more than 18,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable energy annually, helping put the company on a path to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the initial 2030 target. Thirty-one organizations have signed The Climate Pledge, a commitment co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040. Twenty of those companies signed The Climate Pledge last quarter: Atos, Boom Supersonic, Brooks, Cabify, Canary Wharf Group, Coca-Cola European Partners, ERM, Groupe SEB France, Harbour Air, Henkel, ITV, JetBlue, Microsoft, Neste, Rivian, Rubicon, Signify, Uber, Unilever, and Vaude.

Amazon expanded Climate Pledge Friendly, a program to help customers discover and shop for more sustainable products, in five countries across Europe. The program launched with over 40,000 Climate Pledge Friendly products in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. Empowering Small and Medium-Sized Businesses The 2020 holiday season was the best ever for independent businesses selling on Amazon—nearly all of which are small and medium-sized businesses—with worldwide sales growing over 50% compared to the same period in 2019. Sellers surpassed $4.8 billion in worldwide sales from Black Friday through Cyber Monday, growing about 60% from the previous year. During the holiday season as a whole, small and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. sold nearly one billion products in Amazon’s store. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon has incurred more than $5 billion in operational costs on behalf of independent businesses selling in Amazon’s store, and expects to invest billions more through 2021. In 2020, Amazon increased square footage across its fulfillment and logistics network by 50%, dedicated 60% of fulfillment center capacity to seller products, and postponed annual selling fee adjustments until June 2021. As part of the AWS Activate program, Amazon provided more than $1 billion in AWS credits during 2020 to help early stage startups launch their businesses and accelerate their growth. With this help, startups are using scalable, reliable, and secure cloud services like compute, storage, database, analytics, Internet of Things, machine learning, and many others from AWS to scale their businesses.

These programs offer free access to online training, expert advice, live events, and services, and they include the Amazon Small Business Accelerator in the UK, Quickstart-Online in Germany, Despega in Spain, Accelera con Amazon in Italy, and Accelerateur du Numerique in France. The programs are delivered in collaboration with associations and universities, and they have already supported tens of thousands of small businesses. In December, Amazon India hosted Small Business Day, an event to increase visibility and sales for entrepreneurs and small businesses selling in Amazon’s store. Over 55,000 sellers from over 4,000 Postal Index Codes benefitted from Small Business Day, and over 1,500 sellers had their highest ever day of sales on Amazon. In 2020, thousands of independent authors earned more than $50,000 through Kindle Direct Publishing, with more than 1,000 authors surpassing $100,000 in royalties. In 2020, authors using Amazon’s self-publishing service Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) earned more than $370 million in royalties from their participation in Kindle Unlimited. KDP authors have earned more than $1.5 billion from participation in Kindle Unlimited since 2014. Shopping and Entertainment Thanks to customers, employees, and selling partners, Amazon had a record-breaking holiday season, delivering more than a billion toys, home, fashion, electronics, beauty, and personal care products to customers worldwide.

Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 2, 2021, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our estimates as of February 2, 2021 regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed above, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. This guidance also assumes the impacts on consumer demand and spending patterns, including impacts due to concerns over the current economic outlook, will be in line with those experienced during the first quarter of 2021 to date, and the additional assumptions set forth below. However, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on our operations for the first quarter of 2021, or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations. First Quarter 2021 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $100.0 billion and $106.0 billion, or to grow between 33% and 40% compared with first quarter 2020. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 300 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $6.5 billion, compared with $4.0 billion in first quarter 2020. This guidance assumes approximately $2.0 billion of costs related to COVID-19. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results. These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks.

Prior period amounts were not retrospectively adjusted. Under this new guidance, leases we previously referred to as “capital leases” are now referred to as “finance leases.” Leases we previously referred to as “finance leases” are now referred to as “financing obligations.” (2) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases” of $13,723 million and $11,588 million. (3) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $9,628 million and $10,642 million.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced plans to open a fulfillment center in Alcoa, Tennessee. The site, which is anticipated to launch in 2022, will create nearly 800 new, full-time jobs with benefits and opportunities to engage with advanced robotics. The company currently has fulfillment and sortation centers in Charleston, Chattanooga, Lebanon, Murfreesboro, Memphis and Nashville. “We are excited to continue creating a positive economic impact in the region with job opportunities and industry-leading benefits that start on the first day of the job,” said Holly Sullivan, Amazon’s head of worldwide economic development. “Tennessee is a great state for business and we are excited to have the opportunity to partner, grow and better serve our customers throughout this region.” “Over the past year, Amazon has announced projects in each of Tennessee’s grand divisions, accounting for nearly 3,000 new jobs. As we continue to navigate through the pandemic and reboot our economy, we know our recovery is supported by the success of our Tennessee businesses. We are grateful that Amazon continues to provide jobs to thousands of Tennesseans, and we congratulate the company on its newest fulfillment center in Alcoa,” said Tennessee Governor Bill Lee. The Alcoa facility will be Amazon’s third fulfillment center in Tennessee to use innovative robotics technology and the company’s eighth fulfillment center in the Volunteer State. Amazon employees at the more than 634,812 square-foot fulfillment center will pick, pack and ship smaller customer items, such as books, electronics and consumer goods. “It is a testament to the strength of Tennessee’s business climate that companies are attracted to our state and choose to operate and expand here. Amazon is a global brand that has invested $1.5 billion and created more than 25,000 jobs across all three grand divisions of our state, and we appreciate their team for choosing to grow in East Tennessee,” said Bob Rolfe, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development. “We would also like to thank Tennessee Department of Transportation Commissioner Clay Bright and his outstanding leadership team for their many contributions to help bring this project to fruition.” On top of the company’s industry-leading starting wage from $15, the company offers full-time employees comprehensive benefits including full medical, vision, and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent match starting on day one. The company also offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and parental paid leave and innovative benefits such as Leave Share and Ramp Back, which give new parents flexibility with their growing families. In addition, Amazon has pledged to invest over $700 million to provide upskilling training for 100,000 U.S. employees for in demand jobs. Programs will help Amazonians from all backgrounds access training to move into highly skilled roles across the company’s corporate offices, tech hubs, fulfillment centers, retails stores, and transportation network, or pursue career paths outside of Amazon. \"Blount County, along with the cities of Alcoa and Maryville, are delighted Amazon made its decision to locate here. The jobs and worldwide recognition it brings are extremely beneficial to this area,” said Blount County Mayor Ed Mitchell. “We thank Amazon, Governor Bill Lee, Tennessee ECD Commissioner Bob Rolfe, Tennessee Department of Transportation, and our county and city commissioners for tirelessly working together to bring this project to fruition. I, along with the citizens of Blount County, wish them great success and look forward to working with them for many years to come.\" All associates will go through hours of safety training and have access to continuing education opportunities through Amazon’s upskilling programs such as Career Choice. In this program, the company will pre-pay up to 95 percent of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. Since the program’s launch, more than 25,000 employees have pursued degrees in game design and visual communications, nursing, IT programming and radiology, to name a few. “Having Amazon locate in a community has proven to be beneficial for everyone involved, and on behalf of the Blount County Industrial Development Board, I’m happy to welcome its leadership to Blount County and East Tennessee,” said Blount County Industrial Development Board Chair Matt Murray. “The regional economic impact of an operation like this will be felt almost immediately. We are excited to get this project progressing quickly and look forward to watching it grow.” Amazon’s fulfillment network supports millions of businesses of all sizes worldwide through its Fulfillment by Amazon offering, and many of those local organizations are based in Tennessee. There are more than 30,000 authors, small and medium-sized businesses, and developers in Tennessee growing their companies and reaching new customers on Amazon products and services. The project is being developed by Hillwood Development Company, Inc. To learn more about working at an Amazon fulfillment center, visit www.amazondelivers.jobs.

    "text": "TAMPA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(NASDAQ:AMZN) – Today, Amazon’s Counterfeit Crimes Unit and the U.S. government’s National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center announced they are expanding the joint Operation Fulfilled Action partnership to fight counterfeit Super Bowl merchandise. The IPR Center and Amazon’s CCU will work together in real time to identify counterfeiters wherever they operate: in Tampa, in online stores, and as their goods come through the nation’s ports. Operation Fulfilled Action is an on-going effort between Amazon and the IPR Center to protect American consumers by preventing counterfeit goods from entering the U.S. As counterfeiters attempt to take advantage of this major sporting event, Amazon’s CCU and the IPR Center are sharing information about counterfeits in real time before, during, and after the Super Bowl. This includes historical information about counterfeiters and real time intelligence as law enforcement agencies conduct on-the-ground inspections and raids. By sharing information such as physical addresses, supply routes, shippers, consignees, and other potential fraud identifiers, Amazon and the IPR Center can more quickly and effectively stop and prevent counterfeits from reaching consumers. “Make no mistake – intellectual property theft is not a victimless crime. American manufacturers and retailers – and those they employ – as well as consumers are the losers in this game,” said Steve Francis, IPR Center Director. “Fans who spend their hard-earned money to support the NFL and their favorite team can rest assured that HSI is working around the clock with support from Amazon to ensure they are getting only genuine, high-quality officially licensed merchandise in return.” “We know counterfeiters target high visibility events like the Super Bowl, and we are proud to be working with the IPR Center and other agencies to leverage what we know to better protect customers in our store and across the retail industry,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Vice President, Customer Trust and Partner Support, Amazon. Amazon strictly prohibits the sale of counterfeit products, and in 2019 alone, invested more than $500 million to protect its store and customers from counterfeit and other forms of fraud and abuse. These investments include machine learning and automated systems to detect bad actors and potentially counterfeit products, dedicated teams to operate and continually refine its anti-counterfeiting programs, and tools that empower brands to better protect their intellectual property. As a result, 99.9% of pages viewed by customers on Amazon did not receive a valid counterfeit complaint and customers continue to shop with confidence on Amazon. The IPR Center is one of the U.S. government's key weapons in the fight against criminal counterfeiting and piracy. The center uses the expertise of 25 key federal and international agencies to share information, develop initiatives, coordinate enforcement actions, and conduct investigations related to IP theft and commercial fraud crimes. About National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center The National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, working collaboratively with its public and private sector partners, stands at the forefront of the United States government's response to combatting global intellectual property theft and enforcing intellectual properties rights violations. The IPR Center was established to combat global intellectual property theft – and, accordingly, has a significant role policing the sale and distribution of counterfeit goods on websites, social media, and the dark web. To report IP theft or to learn more about the IPR Center, visit www.IPRCenter.gov.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) Counterfeit Crimes Unit filed four federal lawsuits on behalf of Dutch Blitz Acquisition Corporation (Dutch Blitz), a family-owned card game maker. The lawsuits seek recovery of the profits the owners of Dutch Blitz have lost from counterfeit versions of its card game, which was born in the Pennsylvania Dutch country. Amazon and Dutch Blitz filed four lawsuits collectively against four individuals and two entities (the “defendants”) for counterfeiting Dutch Blitz’s card game product. The defendants attempted to offer the infringing product in Amazon’s store, violating Amazon’s policies, infringing on Dutch Blitz’s trademarks, and breaking the law. The suits were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington and allege that the six defendants used Dutch Blitz’s registered trademarks, without authorization, to deceive customers about the authenticity and origin of the products and the affiliation with Dutch Blitz. Amazon strictly prohibits counterfeit products in its stores, and in 2019 alone, invested more than $500 million to protect customers and brands from fraud and abuse, including counterfeit. Amazon’s proactive investments in preventing counterfeit include robust seller vetting, advanced machine-learning based technologies, and industry-leading brand protection tools like Project Zero, Brand Registry, and Transparency. As a result of Amazon’s efforts, 99.9% of all products viewed by customers on Amazon have not received a valid counterfeit complaint. In June 2020, Amazon launched its Counterfeit Crimes Unit, a global team dedicated to pursuing bad actors and holding them accountable to the fullest extent of the law, including working with law enforcement. Amazon has filed a series of lawsuits against counterfeiters, including a suit against individuals using social media to promote and facilitate the sale of counterfeits, as well as joint lawsuits with Italian luxury brand Valentino, cosmetics brand KF Beauty, family travel accessory brand JL Childress, and YETI. Dutch Blitz is a Pennsylvania-based, family-owned-and-operated business started in the 1960s by Werner Ernst George Muller. Today, Mary and Mike Fisher continue to run Dutch Blitz as a family-owned and family-operated business in Pennsylvania and it is one of more than a million small and medium-sized businesses worldwide that sell their products in Amazon’s store. “We strictly prohibit the sale of counterfeits and have done more than any other retailer to stop the trafficking of counterfeit goods online. We continue to launch new and enhanced verification processes and advanced machine learning based systems to protect customers and prevent bad actors from entering our store. We have invented tools to empower brands to partner with us and better protect their intellectual property, and we have launched the Counterfeit Crimes Unit, staffed with former federal prosecutors and other experts, to hold bad actors accountable to the fullest extent of the law. We are proud that we are able to help protect the intellectual property of small and medium size businesses such as Dutch Blitz through our Counterfeit Crimes Unit,\" said Dharmesh Mehta, VP of Customer Trust and Partner Support. “We are tireless in our efforts to ensure only authentic products are sold in our store, and we urge brands, policymakers, and regulators to remain vigilant and continue to partner with us in our shared mission to stop these bad actors.” “We are seeing real results from Amazon’s work to eliminate counterfeit products from being sold in their store,” said Mary Fisher, President of Dutch Blitz. “It has been incredible to work with their team on these efforts, which have had a meaningful and measurable impact on our brand. We will continue to partner with Amazon to deliver on the commitment we’ve made to our customers who enjoy our game every day.” The court filings are available here: Case: 2:21-cv-00162, United States District Court for the Western District of Washington Amazon has an extensive history protecting brands and taking action to hold bad actors accountable: Amazon Project Zero launches in 7 new countries Amazon Transparency protects more than 10,000 brands Amazon Establishes Counterfeit Crimes Unit to Bring Counterfeiters to Justice Amazon Launches IP Accelerator in Europe to Help Small Businesses Protect Their Brands and Tackle Counterfeit IPR Center, Amazon Launch ‘Operation Fulfilled Action’ to Stop Counterfeiters Amazon Files Lawsuit Against Counterfeiters Using Social Media to Promote Sales Amazon Supports Resolution of 3M Case Against Fraudsters Amazon Supports Investigation, Prosecution of New York Defendants Charged in Fraud Scheme Amazon and KF Beauty File Joint Lawsuit Against Counterfeiters Amazon and Valentino File Joint Lawsuit Against New York-Based Counterfeiter Amazon and YETI File Joint Lawsuit against Counterfeiters About Amazon Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

The NHL will also build an enterprise video platform on AWS to aggregate video, data, and related applications into one central repository that will enable easier search and retrieval of archival video footage, give broadcasters instant access to NHL content for syndication and licensing, and facilitate the creation and delivery of new in-game analyses, predictions, and video highlights to enhance mobile, online, and broadcast experiences. The NHL will work with the Amazon Machine Learning Solutions Lab to apply AWS’s deep portfolio of machine learning services to game video and official NHL data – including data from the NHL’s new Puck and Player Tracking (PPT) System and from the NHL’s Hockey Information & Tracking System (HITS) real-time stats – to develop and share advanced game analytics and metrics that take fans deeper into the game. In addition, the NHL intends to use AWS Elemental Media Services to develop and manage a cloud-based HD and 4K video content delivery system that will provide a complete view of the game to NHL officials, coaches, players, and fans. Powered by AWS, the system will encode, process, store, and transmit game footage from a series of new camera angles to provide continuous video feeds that capture plays and events outside the field of view of traditional broadcast cameras. In addition, by leveraging AWS analytics services including Amazon Kinesis (AWS’s service for easily collecting, processing, and analyzing video and data streams in real time) and machine learning services such as Amazon SageMaker (AWS’s service that enables data scientists and developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly), the NHL will be able to audit its feeds to broadcast partners in real time. This capability will enable the NHL to create a smart monitoring system that detects and automatically fixes potential feed issues, offering fans a seamless in-game experience across viewing platforms. “AWS’s state-of-the-art technology and services will provide us with capabilities to deliver analytics and insights that highlight the speed and skill of our game to drive deeper fan engagement,” said NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. “AWS is unmatched in the portfolio of cloud services that it delivers, including computer vision and machine learning, and we intend to leverage them across the board to provide advanced analysis to our teams, officials, and media partners faster than ever before. We’re thrilled to have AWS join the NHL’s family of blue-chip technology partners as we continue our focus on innovation and building the most advanced technology solutions in sports.” “AWS is working with the world’s most renowned sports leagues to better understand their data and innovate upon it using our deep portfolio of machine learning services,” said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Inc. “With this agreement, AWS will provide our industry-leading cloud technology to the NHL, becoming a foundational partner in delivering NHL performance analytics and collaborating to enhance the way people experience hockey by providing more engaging content and greater insights to fans. AWS’s breadth and depth of services, our proven experience in sports analytics, and our relentless focus on innovation give the NHL the ability to bring an entirely new perspective and layer of fan involvement to the game of hockey.” The NHL will be introducing its new analytics using AWS services and technology throughout the upcoming season.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and the German Bundesliga, Germany’s top national football league, announced three new Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS to give fans deeper insights into action on the pitch. The new Match Facts – Most Pressed Player, which highlights how often a player in possession experiences a significant pressure situation throughout a match; Attacking Zones, which shows fans where their favorite team is attacking and which side of the pitch they view as most likely to score from; and Average Positions – Trends, which shows how changes to a team’s tactical formation can impact a match’s outcome – will debut during Matchday 21 on February 12, 2021 featuring RB Leipzig vs. FC Augsburg. Fans can see videos about each stat, read blogs, and learn more here. Bundesliga Match Facts are generated by gathering and analyzing data from live game video feeds as they’re streamed into AWS. Fans will see these insights as graphics during broadcasts and in the official Bundesliga app throughout the 2020/2021 season and beyond. The data is then provided back to broadcast viewers around the world in real-time as statistics. These advanced statistics help audiences better understand areas like decision-making on the pitch and the probability of a goal for each shot. The three new Match Facts will better showcase the action on the pitch and give fans, coaches, players, and commentators visual support for analyzing a team’s decision making. Understanding the new Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS Most Pressed Player: Football teams are using pressure as a technique, both offensively and defensively, to disrupt a player’s rhythm. Until now, it was not possible to quantify the pressure put on an individual player. Most Pressed Player shows how often a player in possession of the ball experiences a significant pressure situation by measuring the number of opposing players involved, their distance to the player, as well as the direction of every players’ movement. This advanced statistic will also compare the number of pressing situations a player faces while in possession of the ball with the average number of pressure situations faced by their teammates, helping determine which players are under the most pressure. Attacking Zones: As teams look to exploit defensive weaknesses, approach their opponent’s goal, and ultimately score, Attacking Zones allows fans to see where the teams focus their offense to create those scoring opportunities. This new Match Fact divides the last third of the pitch into four equally sized Attacking Zones. Every time the attacking team enters one of these zones, either by dribbling or with a pass, the ball possession algorithm counts an attack and displays it in the graphic. The objective of this advanced statistic is to show fans where their favorite team is attacking and which side of the pitch they seem to view as most likely to score. Average Positions – Trends: This new statistic helps fans, coaches, and commentators identify team strategies by showing how the average positions of players on the pitch change during any desired time frame in the game. It builds on an existing Match Fact, Average Positions (which has been available since the 2019-2020 season), by offering the flexibility to analyze any portion of the game, rather than just at the half or the game’s end. Media partners and commentators can now choose which time spans to analyze and then compare those sections of the match, making it easier to identify tactical trends such as whether a team visibly reacts or begins a period of increased pressure after a significant event such as a goal, red card, or substitution. “Every Bundesliga match generates data that can improve play and help fans better understand team strategies, and we are making tremendous strides in leveraging the vast amount of data in our archives and from our league’s current games to develop and roll-out new Match Facts. The advanced statistics that we’re creating with AWS give fans an even deeper appreciation for how the game is played,” said Andreas Heyden, Executive Vice President of Digital Innovations for DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH. “Together with AWS, we’re delivering a new perspective on what happens on the field and offering a new and engaging way for fans to follow their favorite teams.” “Expanding our work with Bundesliga means more fans will gain an appreciation for the incredible talent on the field and the decisions made by teams, at the same time as the league differentiates itself through the use of advanced analytics to improve the quality of play,” said Klaus Buerg, General Manager for AWS Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL. “In just one year since the launch of Match Facts, AWS and Bundesliga have created statistics that are giving fans around the world a completely new way to experience the game. The pace of innovation we’ve achieved in rolling out these advanced stats will excite even the most rabid fans, help teams shape their strategies, and introduce a whole new generation to the intricacies of football.” The growth of advanced statistics in sports has led to deeper understanding about in-game strategies and athlete performance. To give fans even more insight into these advanced stats and the associated gameplay, former Bundesliga player Simon Rolfes will be offering his expertise on the new Match Facts in a series of blogs posts, the first of which is available now. These three new Match Facts join Speed Alert, Average Positions, and xGoals to bring the total number of insights available for Bundesliga fans to six. Information on all of these statistics can be found on aws.amazon.com/sports/bundesliga. Football fans also can follow all of the latest Bundesliga action on Bundesliga.com and via the official Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram channels.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A. (SFER:IM), jointly filed two lawsuits against four individuals (the “defendants”) and three entities for counterfeiting Ferragamo’s products. The defendants attempted to offer the infringing products in Amazon’s store, violating Amazon’s policies, Ferragamo’s intellectual property rights, and the law. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington and alleges the defendants conspired to use Ferragamo’s registered trademarks, without authorization, to deceive customers about the authenticity and origin of the products and the affiliation with Ferragamo. Amazon strictly prohibits counterfeit products in its stores, and in 2019 alone, invested more than $500 million to protect customers and brands from fraud and abuse, including counterfeit. Amazon’s proactive investments in preventing counterfeit include robust seller vetting, advanced machine-learning based technologies, and industry-leading brand protection tools like Project Zero, Brand Registry, and Transparency. As a result of Amazon’s efforts, 99.9% of all products viewed by customers on Amazon have not received a valid counterfeit complaint. In June 2020, Amazon launched its Counterfeit Crimes Unit, a global team dedicated to pursuing bad actors and holding them accountable to the fullest extent of the law, including working with law enforcement. Amazon has filed a series of lawsuits against counterfeiters, including a suit against individuals using social media to promote and facilitate the sale of counterfeits, as well as joint lawsuits with Italian luxury brand Valentino, cosmetics brand KF Beauty, family travel accessory brand JL Childress, and YETI. Over the years, Ferragamo has implemented a series of offline and online anti-counterfeiting measures to protect its customers and the value of its brand, achieving significant results. In 2020, its online monitoring activities enabled the brand to intercept, block, and remove 3 million illicit profiles from the main social media platforms worldwide and approximately 94,000 counterfeit products were blocked and removed from online auction sites. Ferragamo has also filed actions against hundreds of illegal websites through civil proceedings in New York federal court, and was recently awarded $2.8 million in damages. As a part of its policy to fight counterfeiting, Ferragamo also carries out numerous offline investigations and pursues infringers through civil litigation and out-of-court proceedings. In 2020, 240,000 products bearing Ferragamo’s counterfeit trademarks were seized worldwide thanks to joint efforts with law enforcement authorities. “We do not allow counterfeit products in our store, and we have made it crystal clear that we take aggressive action to hold accountable bad actors who attempt to evade our proactive protections,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Vice President, Customer Trust and Partner Support, Amazon. “Through our Counterfeit Crimes Unit, we are working closely with luxury and cosmetics brands, small businesses, and brands with global name recognition. We will continue to fight to protect intellectual property from small family-owned businesses through Fortune 500 companies.” \"The actions we implemented with great determination in recent years in the fight against counterfeiting have allowed us to achieve good results in protecting the brand. Made in Italy, our brand’s quality is based on values such as research, innovation, sustainability and craftsmanship are fundamental for us and for this reason our commitment to safeguarding the brand and our community of consumers is at its highest,” added Micaela le Divelec Lemmi, CEO of Salvatore Ferragamo. “The joint action with Amazon underlines how the protection of intellectual property is a priority for Ferragamo and how the company is pursuing the fight against counterfeiting with full awareness and resolution.” View the court filings here: Case: 2:21-cv-00170, United States District Court for the Western District of Washington Case: 2:21-cv-00171, United States District Court for the Western District of Washington Amazon has an extensive history protecting brands and taking action to hold bad actors accountable: Amazon Project Zero launches in 7 new countries Amazon Transparency protects more than 10,000 brands Amazon Establishes Counterfeit Crimes Unit to Bring Counterfeits to Justice Amazon Launches IP Accelerator in Europe to Help Small Businesses Protect Their Brands and Tackle Counterfeit IPR Center, Amazon Launch ‘Operation Fulfilled Action’ to Stop Counterfeiters Amazon Files Lawsuit Against Counterfeiters Using Social Media to Promote Sales Amazon Supports Resolution of 3M Case Against Fraudsters Amazon Supports Investigation, Prosecution of New York Defendants Charged in Fraud Scheme Amazon and KF Beauty File Joint Lawsuit Against Counterfeiters Amazon and Valentino File Joint Lawsuit Against New York-Based Counterfeit Amazon and YETI File Joint Lawsuit against Counterfeiters About Amazon Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

    "text": "SEATTLE, USA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services (AWS), ein Amazon.com, Inc.-Unternehmen (NASDAQ: AMZN), und die Deutsche Bundesliga, Deutschlands führende nationale Fußballliga, haben heute drei neue Bundesliga Match Facts auf Basis von AWS angekündigt, um den Fans tiefere Einblicke in das Geschehen auf dem Spielfeld zu ermöglichen. Die neuen Match Facts werden am 21. Spieltag am 12. Februar 2021 mit dem Spiel RB Leipzig gegen FC Augsburg eingeführt. – Hierbei handelt es sich um folgende Analysen: „Most Pressed Player“, zeigt auf, wie oft ein Spieler in Ballbesitz während eines Spiels in eine wesentliche Drucksituation gerät; „Attacking Zones“, zeigt den Fans auf, wo ihr Lieblingsteam angreift und von welcher Seite des Spielfelds aus am wahrscheinlichsten ein Tor erzielt wird; und „Average Positions – Trends“, zeigt auf, wie sich Änderungen in der taktischen Formation eines Teams auf den Ausgang eines Spiels auswirken können. Fans können hier Videos zu den einzelnen Statistiken sehen, Blogs lesen und mehr erfahren. Die Bundesliga Match Facts werden durch das Erfassen und Analysieren von Daten aus Live-Videoübertragungen von Spielen generiert, die in AWS gestreamt werden. Die Fans werden diese Einblicke als Grafiken während der Übertragungen sowie in der offiziellen Bundesliga-App während der gesamten Saison 2020/2021 und auch danach sehen. Die Daten werden dann in Echtzeit als Statistiken an die Fernsehzuschauer in aller Welt zurückgespielt. Diese erweiterten Statistiken helfen den Zuschauern dabei, Dinge wie die Entscheidungsfindung auf dem Spielfeld und die Torwahrscheinlichkeit für jeden Schuss besser zu verstehen. Die drei neuen Match Facts werden das Geschehen auf dem Spielfeld noch besser in Szene setzen und den Fans, Trainern, Spielern und Kommentatoren visuelle Unterstützung bei der Analyse der Entscheidungsfindung einer Mannschaft bieten. Erläuterungen zu den neuen Bundesliga Match Facts auf Basis von AWS Most Pressed Player: Fußballmannschaften setzen Druck als Spieltechnik ein, sowohl offensiv als auch defensiv, um den Spielrhythmus eines Spielers zu stören. Bislang war es nicht möglich, den Druck, der auf einen einzelnen Spieler ausgeübt wurde, zu quantifizieren. „Most Pressed Player“ zeigt an, wie oft ein Spieler in Ballbesitz in eine erhebliche Drucksituation gerät, indem die Anzahl der beteiligten gegnerischen Spieler, deren Abstand zum Spieler sowie die Bewegungsrichtung jedes Spielers gemessen wird. Diese fortschrittliche Statistik vergleicht außerdem die Anzahl der Drucksituationen, denen ein Spieler bei Ballbesitz ausgesetzt ist, mit der durchschnittlichen Anzahl der Drucksituationen, denen seine Mannschaftskameraden ausgesetzt sind. So lässt sich feststellen, welche Spieler am meisten unter Druck stehen. Attacking Zones: Wenn Teams versuchen, Schwächen in der Defensive auszunutzen, sich dem gegnerischen Tor zu nähern und schließlich ein Tor zu erzielen, können die Fans anhand von „Attacking Zones“ sehen, wo die Teams ihre Offensive konzentrieren, um diese Torchancen zu schaffen. Dieser neue Match Fact unterteilt das letzte Drittel des Spielfelds in vier gleich große Angriffszonen. Jedes Mal, wenn das angreifende Team eine dieser Zonen erreicht, entweder per Dribbling oder mit einem Pass, zählt der Ballbesitz-Algorithmus einen Angriff und zeigt ihn in der Grafik an. Das Ziel dieser erweiterten Statistik ist es, den Fans zu zeigen, wo ihr Lieblingsteam angreift und welche Seite des Spielfelds am wahrscheinlichsten zu einem Tor führt. Average Positions – Trends: Diese neue Statistik hilft Fans, Trainern und Kommentatoren beim Erkennen von Teamstrategien. Sie zeigt, wie sich die durchschnittlichen Positionen der Spieler auf dem Spielfeld während eines beliebigen Zeitraums im Spiel verändern. Sie baut auf einem bestehenden Match Fact, Average Positions (Mittlere Positionen) (der seit der Saison 2019–2020 verfügbar ist), auf und bietet die Flexibilität, jeden Abschnitt des Spiels zu analysieren, anstatt nur die Halbzeit oder das Ende des Spiels. Medienpartner und Kommentatoren können nun wählen, welche Zeitspannen analysiert werden sollen, und dann diese Abschnitte des Spiels vergleichen. Dies macht es einfacher, taktische Trends zu erkennen, z. B. ob eine Mannschaft nach einem bedeutenden Ereignis wie einem Tor, einer roten Karte oder einer Auswechslung erkennbar reagiert oder eine Phase mit erhöhtem Druck beginnt. „Jedes Bundesligaspiel generiert Daten, die zur Verbesserung des Spiels beitragen können und den Fans helfen, die Strategien der Teams besser zu verstehen. Wir machen enorme Fortschritte bei der Nutzung der riesigen Datenmengen in unseren Archiven und von den aktuellen Spielen unserer Liga, um neue Match Facts zu entwickeln und einzuführen. Die erweiterten Statistiken, die wir mit AWS erstellen, geben den Fans ein noch umfassenderes Verständnis dafür, wie das Spiel gespielt wird“, sagte Andreas Heyden, Executive Vice President für digitale Innovationen der DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH. „Gemeinsam mit AWS bieten wir eine neue Perspektive auf die Geschehnisse auf dem Spielfeld und bieten den Fans eine neue und faszinierende Möglichkeit, ihre Lieblingsteams zu begleiten.“ „Die Ausweitung unserer Zusammenarbeit mit der Bundesliga bedeutet, dass mehr Fans ein Verständnis für die unglaublichen Talente auf dem Feld und die Entscheidungen der Teams bekommen. Gleichzeitig differenziert sich die Liga durch den Einsatz von fortschrittlichen Analysen, um die Qualität des Spiels zu verbessern“, sagte Klaus Buerg, General Manager für AWS Deutschland, Österreich und die Schweiz bei Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL. „In nur einem Jahr seit der Einführung von Match Facts haben AWS und die Bundesliga Statistiken erstellt, die den Fans auf der ganzen Welt eine völlig neue Art und Weise des Spielerlebnisses bieten. Das Innovationstempo, das wir bei der Einführung dieser fortschrittlichen Statistiken erreicht haben, wird selbst die leidenschaftlichsten Fans begeistern und den Teams helfen, ihre Strategien weiterzuentwickeln sowie einer ganz neuen Generation die Feinheiten des Fußballs näher zu bringen.“ Das Wachstum der erweiterten Statistiken im Sport hat zu einem besseren Verständnis der Spielstrategien und der Leistung der Athleten geführt. Um den Fans noch mehr Einblicke in diese erweiterten Statistiken und den damit verbundenen Spielverlauf zu geben, wird der ehemalige Bundesligaspieler Simon Rolfes sein Fachwissen über die neuen Match Facts in einer Reihe von Blogbeiträgen veröffentlichen, von denen der erste jetzt verfügbar ist. Diese drei neuen Match Facts gesellen sich zu Speed Alert (Schnelligkeits-Alarm), Average Positions (Mittlere Positionen) und xGoals und erhöhen die Gesamtzahl der für Bundesliga-Fans verfügbaren Einblicke auf sechs. Informationen zu all diesen Statistiken finden Sie auf aws.amazon.com/sports/bundesliga. Fußballfans können das aktuelle Bundesliga-Geschehen auch auf Bundesliga.com und über die offiziellen Facebook-, Twitter- und Instagram-Kanäle verfolgen.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--IMDb (www.imdb.com), the world's most popular and authoritative source for movie, TV and celebrity content, presented an IMDb “Breakout” STARmeter Award to Bridgerton star Regé-Jean Page. IMDb STARmeter Awards recognize the stars who are fan favorites on the IMDbPro STARmeter chart, which is determined by the page views of the more than 200 million monthly visitors to IMDb worldwide. Previous IMDb Breakout STARmeter Award recipients include Brie Larson, John David Washington, Bill Skarsgård, Daisy Edgar-Jones, Nicholas Braun and Anya Chalotra. Regé-Jean Page recently surged to the top of the IMDbPro STARmeter chart, fueled by his role as Simon Basset in the hit Netflix series Bridgerton and his performance in the Amazon Studios film Sylvie’s Love. Page ranked #1 on the STARmeter chart for most of January 2021, while Bridgerton continues to trend as a top series on the IMDbPro rankings of TV and streaming shows since its release on Christmas Day. “Thank you, IMDb and IMDbPro - what a wonderful way to be recognised,” said Page. “It’s thrilling to think that so many people across the world have been excited by Bridgerton, and curious about our incredible team who put it all together. IMDb is such a great way to peek behind the curtain and get an insight into all the amazing links between artists, and trace the body of work that’s brought them to where they are today.” “IMDb STARmeter Awards have proven to be a keenly accurate predictor of stars who are about to have a breakthrough career moment, and we are thrilled to present our first award of the year to Regé-Jean Page, who joins an elite group of previous STARmeter Award recipients including some of my favorite actors working today,” said IMDb Founder and CEO Col Needham. “I loved his performance in Bridgerton, and Sylvie’s Love ranked as one of my Top Movies of 2020. On behalf of fans and professionals across the globe who turn to IMDb and IMDbPro to learn more about talent, films and TV shows, we are honored to celebrate Page and continue to watch his career grow.” Page also shared some of the films and TV shows he has recently binged: “Small Axe, I May Destroy you, The Americans, The Queen’s Gambit, Avatar: The Last Airbender and His House have all helped carry me through the long haul of lockdown so far.” IMDb users can add the TV series and films from Page’s IMDb filmography, as well as other titles, to their IMDb Watchlist at https://www.imdb.com/watchlist.
