Amazon estimates that more than 6 million products currently offered by U.S. sellers have a high potential for success in its international stores. “Selling internationally has been terrific for us. International sales account for 20-30% of our business depending on the season, and we’re seeing sales in some geographies grow as much as 50% year over year,” said Ben Clark, CEO of Vermont-based Ann Clark Cookie Cutters. “Expanding to international locations without Amazon would have been more difficult because we’d have had to get a distributor in every country to manage our products. Amazon has made this process much easier and taken a lot of the guesswork out of which products will be successful.” Amazon offers a range of tools and services to help U.S. sellers offer their products to hundreds of millions of customers from 185 countries that are shopping in its 21 stores worldwide. Last month, these 21 stores brought in more than 900 million customer visits, and more than half of the visits came through Amazon’s international stores. Small businesses and emerging brands are able to easily gain traction across the globe by leveraging Amazon’s internationally recognized brand and the company’s state-of-the-art global logistics network. “Global Selling helps small businesses leverage Amazon’s scale and reach to easily expand into countries around the world, while maintaining control of their brand and not having to worry about global logistics,” said Eric Broussard, Vice President of International Selling Partner Services at Amazon. “These capabilities, such as the use of Amazon’s renowned worldwide customer support for all of their products at low or no cost, will help our U.S. sellers capture billions of dollars in international opportunity.” Amazon announced the following new tools at Accelerate 2021: Customer Service by Amazon gives sellers who fulfill their own orders the option to have Amazon manage their customer inquiries, refunds, and returns on self-fulfilled orders—and at Accelerate, the company announced they will offer this service for free or at a discounted rate depending on the seller’s customer contact volume. Customer Service by Amazon reduces the burden of providing quality customer service across geographies and in multiple languages. Customers can contact the more than 130 customer support sites via phone, chat, or email, day or night, and receive help in 15 languages. It is available now and open to all U.S. sellers. Marketplace Product Guidance takes the guesswork out of which products should and can be sold internationally. It helps sellers determine which of their products they should offer internationally and identify other high-potential products they can add to their catalog in international stores. These recommendations are personalized and ranked based on their opportunity score, and calculated by machine learning models that take into account hundreds of parameters at the seller, product, and store level. It is available now and open to all U.S. sellers. Global Inventory Viewer provides a one-stop experience for sellers to monitor inventory supply and demand across all stores in a consolidated manner. Global Inventory Viewer seamlessly integrates with Send to Amazon, making it simple and easy for sellers to send more inventory to Amazon fulfillment centers before running out of stock. It is available now and open to all U.S. sellers. Global Listing enables sellers to list products on Amazon once and sell globally. Instead of managing products separately across Amazon’s stores, sellers can now replicate their product listings in multiple international stores with just a few clicks. Sellers will be able to view their listing from a set of globalized pages and views. Amazon is currently testing the feature in beta and will open it to all U.S. sellers in early 2022. In 2020, Amazon invested more than $18 billion in logistics, tools, services, programs, and teams to help sellers get started, build their brands, and leverage Amazon’s scale to reach more customers. Amazon sellers have created an estimated 1.8 million U.S. jobs managing, operating, and supporting their Amazon-related businesses.

More than half of all products purchased in Amazon’s store are sold by third-party sellers, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses. With Amazon Local Selling, sellers can quickly and easily expand their multichannel offerings by listing products in Amazon’s store and offering them to local customers in designated areas for in-store pickup on the same day that they place an order. When making an order, customers can select in-store pickup and receive a notification when it is ready that day. Or, they can choose fast local delivery by the seller. Amazon Local Selling is now available from both national and local retailers, including Mavis Discount Tire, Sears Hometown Store, 4 Wheel Parts, Electronic Express, Best Buy, Appliance Connection, Mattress Warehouse, Beach Camera, Adorama, DataVision, Exclusive Furniture, World Wide Stereo, MODIA, Focus Camera, and others. Sellers who are interested in joining Local Selling can apply at sell.amazon.com/local as the program expands this year and during 2022. Customers can learn more about Local Selling at www.amazon.com/localpickup. With Amazon Local Selling, sellers can give nearby customers the opportunity to support local businesses with regional offers across all product categories, and they can offer products they couldn’t before, such as large or fragile items. Additionally, sellers can offer customers add-on services, such as product assembly or installation, for the products they deliver. Walt’s Television, a longtime Amazon seller with a store in Tempe, Arizona and distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky and Dallas, Texas, participated in a trial of Amazon Local Selling. “Amazon has been the foundation of our national online selling for years. Now we are bridging our online business with our in-person experience, which means more customers are getting to know our brand and full range of services,” said Bear Hendley, Manager of Walt’s Television. “New local customers are finding us and giving us very positive feedback on the convenience of buying online and picking up at one of our locations. We’ve seen a significant increase in local sales, and we’re excited about the ability to offer installation and repair services to Amazon customers.” “Local Selling presents enormous opportunities to a large number of sellers who want to bring more product selection to their Amazon business, enabling many to expand their multichannel offerings by integrating their physical stores and delivery capabilities with their digital operations,” said Jim Adkins, Vice President of Recreational and Vocational Categories at Amazon. “Our research shows that many customers will opt for local pickup when given the choice. This new capability is an exciting way to help sellers reach and delight more customers with great products and convenience.” Last year, Amazon invested more than $18 billion in logistics, tools, services, programs, and teams to help sellers get started, build their brands, and leverage Amazon’s scale to reach more customers.

The new facility will expand Amazon Robotics manufacturing capability in the U.S. and Amazon’s growth in the region—and has created over 200 new manufacturing jobs in Massachusetts. Amazon began introducing robotics into its facilities in 2012 and has since added over a million new jobs worldwide. Earlier this week, Amazon announced it is hiring for 150,000 seasonal jobs, including 1,500 in Massachusetts. All regular, full-time employees will have access to a starting wage that is more than double the federal minimum wage—along with comprehensive health benefits, paid time off, up to 20 weeks of fully paid parental leave, and more for employees and their families. “Massachusetts offers a highly talented workforce, and this Amazon facility opening further cements our state’s reputation as a key center for robotics development,” said Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito. “The opening of this new state-of-the-art robotics facility creates new jobs for individuals across a wide range of skills and backgrounds in addition to the 1,500 new seasonal jobs Amazon has created in the Commonwealth as the company continues its investment in the state’s economic growth and development and I am pleased to be here for this opening, especially during STEM Week in Massachusetts.” “We care about the communities where we operate. This is why we are proud to expand high-tech robotics manufacturing in the U.S. and in Massachusetts specifically with the opening of this new facility,” said Vice President of Amazon Robotics Joe Quinlivan. “As a company we have created more than 20,000 jobs in Massachusetts since 2010 in communities from Boston to Westborough and beyond. This latest addition to Amazon’s presence in the Commonwealth brings great jobs, from hourly manufacturing roles to engineers and developers working on advancements in robotics, to help our facilities run safely and meet our customers’ needs.” With this new site, Amazon Robotics will continue to grow its engineering, manufacturing, support, and test teams in Massachusetts. The 350,000-square-foot facility will feature corporate offices, research and development labs, and manufacturing space—in addition to Amazon Robotics’ current site in North Reading, Massachusetts. Together, these two facilities serve as an epicenter of the company’s robotics innovation. “I want to welcome Amazon Robotics to Westborough and congratulate them for choosing to build out this first-of-its-kind facility in Massachusetts,” said Housing and Economic Development Secretary Mike Kennealy. “This facility reaffirms the importance of the work we have done to build a talented workforce, foster innovation, and create an ecosystem in the Commonwealth that allows innovation to grow and thrive.” Manufacturing of Amazon Robotics mobile drive units will be a primary focus in the facility. Since 2012, when Amazon first began introducing robotics into its facilities, the company has added over a million new jobs worldwide while deploying more than 350,000 drive units across its facilities. These drive units and other robotic technologies work closely with employees to help safely and reliably fulfill customer orders. ""The opening of this robotics manufacturing facility and the new jobs it provides demonstrate the strength of our regional economy and our workforce. We look forward to a strong partnership with Amazon Robotics,” said Kristi Williams, Westborough’s town manager. Amazon takes its role as an employer in the Commonwealth seriously. In addition to opening the new robotics facility in Westborough, Amazon is hiring 1,500 new full and part-time operations jobs across its sites in Massachusetts. These jobs include stowing, picking, packing, and sorting customer orders, in addition to roles in management, IT, HR, safety, and security. Joining Amazon in an hourly role can be a springboard to an Amazon career. Employees are provided access to the education and training they need to grow their careers at Amazon and beyond. In the U.S., Amazon is investing $1.2 billion to upskill more than 250,000 employees by 2025 to help move them into higher-paying, in-demand jobs.

AMZN,2021-10-28,2021-10-21,2021-11-11,AMZN,,2021-10-25 09:00:00,2021-10-25T09:00:00-04:00,2021-10-25,Amazon Brings Alexa to Senior Living Communities and Healthcare Systems with Alexa Smart Properties,"SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(NASDAQ:AMZN)— Today, Amazon announced two new solutions as part of Alexa Smart Properties that will enable senior living and healthcare providers to integrate Alexa into their properties and empower residents and patients to stay connected, informed and entertained, just by asking Alexa. Designed specifically for the needs of senior living communities and healthcare facilities, Alexa Smart Properties simplifies deploying and managing Alexa-enabled devices at scale, helping properties offer customized Alexa experiences for residents and patients, and increase care team productivity and operational efficiency. “We believe the intuitive and accessible nature of voice and Alexa has the potential to help and delight customers in many scenarios, in and outside of the home,” said Liron Torres, Head of Alexa Smart Properties, Amazon. “We’re excited to extend the experiences customers already love to senior living communities and healthcare systems, and give providers new ways to save time and personalize care for their patients and residents.” Empowering Connection in Senior Living Communities Alexa Smart Properties enables senior living residents to keep in touch with their loved ones, connect with their community, access community news, and more, using the Amazon Echo device in their room. Family members and friends outside the property get peace of mind knowing they can easily get in touch with residents through Alexa calling. Administrators can offer access to tens of thousands of Alexa skills, and tailor resident experiences by customizing community information like activity schedules and meal menus. Care team members can communicate more efficiently with residents using Alexa communication features, which enable them to make Announcements, voice and video calls, or send direct audio messages to other Alexa-enabled devices throughout the property. Alexa can also help communities streamline activities like check-ins, field requests for maintenance, and administrative tasks—enabling associates to save time and increase productivity. Senior living communities like Atria and Eskaton will integrate with Alexa Smart Properties at select locations to provide a better experience for residents, while creating empowered and more connected communities. “We’ve consistently moved to put our residents in the position to live their best lives, now,” said John A. Moore, Chairman and CEO of Atria Senior Living. “Technology has played a critical role in this effort. When you combine our resident and family app with the deployment of Alexa Smart Properties in our communities, seniors have an even greater ability to write the next chapter of their lives through easy-to-use technology that keeps them engaged and connected to their families at all times.” Helping Hospitals Deliver Personalized Care With Alexa Smart Properties, patients can communicate with their care staff, control devices in their room, or stay informed and entertained with news and music, just by asking Alexa. Healthcare providers can communicate with patients quickly and easily with features like calling and Drop In—without the need to enter patient rooms. This enables hospitals to increase productivity, conserve medical supplies and protective equipment, such as masks, gloves, and gowns, and free up staff time to provide more personalized care. Hospitals also can provide information customized to their facility, like notifications about schedule changes or cafeteria menus, and skill experiences like games, podcasts, and more. Health systems including Boston Children’s Hospital, Cedars-Sinai, BayCare, and Houston Methodist are adopting Alexa Smart Properties to help care for their patients more efficiently. ""Voice is intuitive for patients, regardless of age or tech savviness,"" said Peachy Hain, executive director of Medical and Surgical Services at Cedars-Sinai. ""Since it's so easy to operate, patients can use Alexa to connect with their care team and stay entertained as soon as they settle in, while care providers can streamline tasks to make more time to care for those patients. It's a total gamechanger for enhancing our hospital experience."" Deploying Solutions at Scale with Alexa Smart Properties In addition to support for senior living and healthcare, Alexa Smart Properties offers a set of vertical solutions that enable Alexa experiences in properties such as hotels, vacation rentals, apartments, offices, and more. Alexa Smart Properties tools and APIs make it fast and easy for solution providers to manage and service a fleet of Alexa-enabled devices quickly, remotely, and at scale. By working with solution providers like K4Connect, Lifeline Senior Living, Aiva, and Vocera, senior living and healthcare properties can use Alexa Smart Properties to easily deploy and customize large numbers of Alexa-enabled devices. “Working with Alexa Smart Properties has enabled Aiva to bring AI voice technology that can be easily customized, managed, and deployed at enterprise scale,” said Sumeet Bhatia, founder and chief executive officer of Aiva. “Using Alexa Smart Properties, Aiva takes work off of nurses’ plates and enables them to focus on direct, high-value care, while giving patients a better, more self-directed experience.” With the help of solution providers, administrators can build, publish and enable skills to answer property-specific questions and integrate with other property management systems, so residents and patients can request property information like, “Alexa, what time does yoga start?” and perform property-specific actions like, “Alexa, could you ask for my mail to be delivered?” Hospitals and senior living communities can also build and enable HIPAA-eligible skills, like medication tracking, to connect care providers with residents and patients in an environment designed to protect their health information. “Voice integration has the power to transform how resident requests are made and how staff respond,” said Kim Judd, General Manager of Lifeline Senior Living. “Adding Alexa Smart Properties functionality to our CarePoint resident safety system enables residents to make hands-free help requests and receive verbal confirmation to know they’ve been heard. And staff can see the context of requests and triage more efficiently. It opens up new opportunities for better care, from simple requests to daily announcements, resident check-ins, even helping to ease social isolation, CarePoint with Alexa will be a real advantage for our customers.” Built with Privacy in Mind Alexa Smart Properties senior living and healthcare solutions were designed with privacy in mind. No personal information is shared with Alexa to use the device, and voice recordings are not saved. Every Amazon Echo device offers multiple layers of privacy protection, and residents and patients can disable Alexa’s ability to respond to the wake word at any time by simply pressing the mute button on top of their Echo device. Amazon implements administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for protected health information received as part of HIPAA-eligible skill interactions. Alexa Smart Properties will support senior living and healthcare solutions in the U.S. starting next month. To learn more, contact us here.

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced general availability of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) DL1 instances, a new instance type designed for training machine learning models. DL1 instances are powered by Gaudi accelerators from Habana Labs (an Intel company) to provide up to 40% better price performance for training machine learning models than the latest GPU-powered Amazon EC2 instances. With DL1 instances, customers can train their machine learning models faster and more cost effectively for use cases like natural language processing, object detection and classification, fraud detection, recommendation and personalization engines, intelligent document processing, business forecasting, and more. DL1 instances are available on demand via a low-cost pay-as-you-go usage model with no upfront commitments. To get started with DL1 instances, visit aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/dl1. Machine learning has become mainstream as customers have realized tangible business impact from deploying machine learning models at scale in the cloud. To use machine learning in their business applications, customers start by building and training a model to recognize patterns by learning from sample data, and then apply the model on new data to make predictions. For example, a machine learning model trained on large numbers of contact center transcripts can make predictions to provide real-time personalized assistance to customers through a conversational chatbot. To improve a model's prediction accuracy, data scientists and machine learning engineers are building increasingly larger and more complex models. To maintain prediction accuracy and high quality of the models, these engineers need to tune and retrain their models frequently. This requires a considerable amount of high-performance compute resources, resulting in increased infrastructure costs. These costs can be prohibitive for customers to retrain their models at the frequency they need to maintain high-accuracy predictions, while also posing an obstacle to customers that want to begin experimenting with machine learning. New DL1 instances use Gaudi accelerators built specifically to accelerate machine learning model training by delivering higher compute efficiency at a lower cost compared to general purpose GPUs. DL1 instances feature up to eight Gaudi accelerators, 256 GB of high-bandwidth memory, 768 GB of system memory, 2nd generation Amazon custom Intel Xeon Scalable (Cascade Lake) processors, 400 Gbps of networking throughput, and up to 4 TB of local NVMe storage. Together, these innovations translate to up to 40% better price performance than the latest GPU-powered Amazon EC2 instances for training common machine learning models. Customers can quickly and easily get started with DL1 instances using the included Habana SynapseAI SDK, which is integrated with leading machine learning frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow and PyTorch), helping customers to seamlessly migrate their existing machine learning models currently running on GPU-based or CPU-based instances onto DL1 instances, with minimal code changes. Developers and data scientists can also start with reference models optimized for Gaudi accelerators available in Habana’s GitHub repository, which includes popular models for diverse applications, including image classification, object detection, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. “The use of machine learning has skyrocketed. One of the challenges with training machine learning models, however, is that it is computationally intensive and can get expensive as customers refine and retrain their models,” said David Brown, Vice President, of Amazon EC2, at AWS. “AWS already has the broadest choice of powerful compute for any machine learning project or application. The addition of DL1 instances featuring Gaudi accelerators provides the most cost-effective alternative to GPU-based instances in the cloud to date. Their optimal combination of price and performance makes it possible for customers to reduce the cost to train, train more models, and innovate faster.” Customers can launch DL1 instances using AWS Deep Learning AMIs or using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) or Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) for containerized applications. For a more managed experience, customers can access DL1 instances through Amazon SageMaker, making it even easier and faster for developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models in the cloud and at the edge. DL1 instances benefit from the AWS Nitro System, a collection of building blocks that offload many of the traditional virtualization functions to dedicated hardware and software to deliver high performance, high availability, and high security while also reducing virtualization overhead. DL1 instances are available for purchase as On-Demand Instances, with Savings Plans, as Reserved Instances, or as Spot Instances. DL1 instances are currently available in the US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) AWS Regions. Seagate Technology has been a global leader offering data storage and management solutions for over 40 years. Seagate’s data science and machine learning engineers have built an advanced deep learning (DL) defect detection system and deployed it globally across the company’s manufacturing facilities. In a recent proof of concept project, Habana Gaudi exceeded the performance targets for training one of the DL semantic segmentation models currently used in Seagate’s production. “We expect the significant price performance advantage of Amazon EC2 DL1 instances, powered by Habana Gaudi accelerators, could make a compelling future addition to AWS compute clusters,” said Darrell Louder, Senior Engineering Director of Operations, Technology and Advanced Analytics, at Seagate. “As Habana Labs continues to evolve and enables broader coverage of operators, there is potential for expanding to additional enterprise use cases, and thereby harnessing additional cost savings.” Intel has created 3D Athlete Tracking technology that analyzes athlete-in-action video in real time to inform performance training processes and enhance audience experiences during competitions. “Training our models on Amazon EC2 DL1 instances, powered by Gaudi accelerators from Habana Labs, will enable us to accurately and reliably process thousands of videos and generate associated performance data, while lowering training cost,” said Rick Echevarria, Vice President, Sales and Marketing Group, Intel. “With DL1 instances, we can now train at the speed and cost required to productively serve athletes, teams, and broadcasters of all levels across a variety of sports.” Riskfuel provides real-time valuations and risk sensitivities to companies managing financial portfolios, helping them increase trading accuracy and performance. “Two factors drew us to Amazon EC2 DL1 instances based on Habana Gaudi AI accelerators,” said Ryan Ferguson, CEO of Riskfuel. “First, we want to make sure our banking and insurance clients can run Riskfuel models that take advantage of the newest hardware. We found migrating our models to DL1 instances to be simple and straightforward—really, it was just a matter of changing a few lines of code. Second, training costs are a big component of our spending, and the promise of up to 40% improvement in price performance offers potentially substantial benefit to our bottom line.” Leidos is recognized as a top 10 health IT provider delivering a broad range of customizable, scalable solutions to hospitals and health systems, biomedical organizations, and every U.S. federal agency focused on health. “One of the numerous technologies we are enabling to advance healthcare today is the use of machine learning and deep learning for disease diagnosis based on medical imaging data. Our massive data sets require timely and efficient training to aid researchers seeking to solve some of the most urgent medical mysteries,” said Chetan Paul, CTO Health and Human Services at Leidos. “Given Leidos’ and its customers’ need for quick, easy, and cost-effective training for deep learning models, we are excited to have begun this journey with Intel and AWS to use Amazon EC2 DL1 instances based on Habana Gaudi AI processors. Using DL1 instances, we expect an increase in model training speed and efficiency, with a subsequent reduction in risk and cost of research and development.” Fractal is a global leader in artificial intelligence and analytics, powering decisions in Fortune 500 companies. “AI and deep learning are at the core of our healthcare imaging business, enabling customers to make better medical decisions. In order to improve accuracy, medical datasets are becoming larger and more complex, requiring more training and retraining of models, and driving the need for improved computing price performance,” said Srikanth Velamakanni, Group CEO of Fractal. “The new Amazon EC2 DL1 instances promise significantly lower cost training than GPU-based EC2 instances, which can help us contain costs and make AI decision-making more accessible to a broader array of customers.” About Amazon Web Services For over 15 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud offering.

Customers have appreciated this commitment, which is part of what’s driving this past quarter’s AWS growth acceleration to 39% year over year; but, it’s also driven extraordinary investments across our businesses to satisfy customer needs—just one example is that we’ve nearly doubled the size of our fulfillment network since the pandemic began. In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur several billion dollars of additional costs in our Consumer business as we manage through labor supply shortages, increased wage costs, global supply chain issues, and increased freight and shipping costs—all while doing whatever it takes to minimize the impact on customers and selling partners this holiday season. It’ll be expensive for us in the short term, but it’s the right prioritization for our customers and partners.” Highlights Innovating for Our Retail Customers Amazon kicked off the holidays early this year, announcing Black Friday-worthy deals on October 4, including thousands of deals from independent sellers and handmade artisans and Amazon’s biggest ever selection of gift guides. Amazon launched new features like the Holiday Gift List to let customers easily create and share one list of gift ideas for everyone in their household, conveniently organized by recipients.

Amazon expanded its faster Same-Day Delivery service to Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Miami, Minneapolis, and Tampa—bringing the total number of cities with the service, which launched in 2020, to 15. The expansion has led to hundreds of new Amazon jobs in these cities offering competitive hourly wages and a flexible work schedule. Prime members can shop up to 3 million items across a dozen categories, such as baby, beauty and health, and electronics, and receive their order in as fast as five hours. Amazon launched a new gift-giving feature that enables Prime members in the U.S. to use the Amazon mobile shopping app to send gifts with just the recipient’s email or mobile phone number. Recipients receive a gift message—by email or text—that allows them to accept the gift. They are then prompted to enter their preferred delivery address from their Amazon account to receive the gift. Amazon’s Great Indian Festival sales event, which started on October 3, features more than 75,000 small businesses selling on Amazon from 450 cities across India, and provides customers access to a unique selection of products.

The company expanded its A-to-z Guarantee to protect customers in the rare case that a defective third-party product causes property damage or personal injury. Amazon works with sellers and their insurance companies to address claims up to $1 million. Entertainment Amazon Games launched New World, a multiplayer online PC game. New World became the highest-played new game this year on Steam, a widely used distribution platform where players find, buy, and play games on PC.

Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of October 28, 2021, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our estimates as of October 28, 2021 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as the effect of other factors discussed above. Fourth Quarter 2021 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $130.0 billion and $140.0 billion, or to grow between 4% and 12% compared with fourth quarter 2020. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 60 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $0 and $3.0 billion, compared with $6.9 billion in fourth quarter 2020. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results. These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced the general availability of Babelfish for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition, a new capability that allows customers to run applications written for Microsoft SQL Server directly on Amazon Aurora with little to no code changes. Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL enables Amazon Aurora to understand commands from applications written for Microsoft SQL Server, making it easier for customers to migrate to Amazon Aurora. With Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL, customers simply migrate their data and configure their application to point to Amazon Aurora, reducing costs and simplifying operations by removing the dependency on Microsoft SQL Server. Also announced today, open-source Babelfish for PostgreSQL makes the same Microsoft SQL Server language capability in Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL available to any organization interested in running PostgreSQL, and the source code for Babelfish for PostgreSQL is available on GitHub under the permissive Apache 2.0 and PostgreSQL licenses for anyone who wants to extend it or use it for any purpose under the terms of the license. To get started with Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL, visit aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/babelfish. Constrained by commercial-grade database options that don’t offer the flexibility and database freedom of modern offerings, customers have long been unhappy with old-guard database providers. Commercial-grade databases offer high performance but are expensive, proprietary, and have high lock-in and punitive licensing terms that arbitrarily change. Many customers have moved to open-source database engines like PostgreSQL and MySQL because they want the performance of commercial-grade databases with the pricing and flexibility open-source engines provide. However, configuring open-source database engines to achieve high performance is time consuming and labor intensive. That’s why today more than 100,000 customers choose to run their database workloads on Amazon Aurora, a fully managed MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible database that delivers the performance and availability of the highest-grade commercial databases at one tenth the cost. Today, customers use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate databases to the cloud and take advantage of high-performance open-source engines. However, once the initial database migration is complete, customers still need to migrate their application logic to run on PostgreSQL. Migrating application logic requires manual coding, is time consuming, and is often tied to proprietary database commands. Customers interested in adopting PostgreSQL and enjoying the benefits of running an open-source database engine on AWS want an easier way to migrate their Microsoft SQL Server applications to Amazon Aurora. Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL is a new capability that makes it possible to run Microsoft SQL Server applications directly on Amazon Aurora with little to no code changes. Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL provides a new capability for Amazon Aurora that enables Amazon Aurora to understand commands from applications written for Microsoft SQL Server. With Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL now understands T-SQL, Microsoft SQL Server’s proprietary SQL dialect, and supports the same SQL syntax as Microsoft SQL Server, so customers no longer need to rewrite their applications’ database requests. Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL also understands TDS, Microsoft SQL Server’s network protocol, so customers can continue to use the existing Microsoft SQL Server database drivers that their applications rely on. As a result, customers can more easily move applications running on Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora, leading to faster, lower-risk, and more cost-effective database migrations. After customers migrate their data using AWS DMS, they simply update their application configuration to point to Amazon Aurora and start testing their application running on Amazon Aurora instead of Microsoft SQL Server. Once customers test their application, they can put it in production, no longer need Microsoft SQL Server, and can stop paying for the expensive, constrained licenses. Because Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL supports both Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL, customers can migrate at their own speed and run their legacy Microsoft SQL Server code side by side with new functionality they build using PostgreSQL application programming interfaces (APIs). “More and more customers have told us they want a fast, inexpensive, and low-risk way to break free from old-guard database vendors and their punitive licensing terms, high costs, and lack of innovation,” said Raju Gulabani, VP of Databases and Analytics at AWS. “Now, with Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL, anyone can quickly, easily, and cost effectively migrate their applications to Amazon Aurora, giving customers the best of both worlds—the performance and availability of the highest-grade commercial databases at a cost more commonly associated with open source.” In addition to the Amazon Aurora offering, the source code for Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL is now available on GitHub under the permissive Apache 2.0 and PostgreSQL licenses for anyone to view. Organizations can use it for any purpose including distributing it, modifying it, and distributing modified versions of it under the terms of the licenses. In addition to the source code being available on GitHub, all Babelfish for PostgreSQL development is done openly on GitHub, so organizations can see what new features are being developed. Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL is generally available today to customers running Amazon Aurora in US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Milan), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), Middle East (Bahrain), and South America (São Paulo) with availability in additional AWS Regions coming soon. FactSet creates flexible, open data and software solutions for tens of thousands of investment professionals around the world. “FactSet is excited about the launch of Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL,” said Demetry Zilberg, CTO at FactSet. “We are optimistic that Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL will materially accelerate the pace of our migration from commercial relational database platforms to PostgresSQL on Amazon Aurora, which is a key part of our Digital Foundation program for product-driven initiatives. With Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL, our teams can focus on revenue-generating product development rather than re-architecture.” Presidio is a leading information technology (IT) services and solutions provider that helps customers connect IT of today to IT of tomorrow. “Presidio has helped numerous customers migrate their database operations to AWS using AWS DMS, Amazon Relational Database Service, and other AWS data offerings. However, giving clients the flexibility and freedom to choose their relational data store has always required deep, costly application refactoring,” said Sanjeev Pant, VP of Cloud Transformation at Presidio. “With Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL, we now have options to cut out expensive licensing and provide expansive choice of backend options to suit our clients’ needs on their journey to data and app modernization with a data-driven enterprise in mind. The reduction of time, cost, and risk to our projects, and those of our clients, is game changing.” Tyler is the largest and most established provider of integrated software and technology services focused on the public sector. “We’ve been using Amazon Aurora to support new application development because of its high performance and scalability, and we are eager to migrate our large portfolio of existing applications to Amazon Aurora as well,” said Brian McGrath, Senior Vice President of Operations at Tyler Technologies. “Our development teams used Babelfish in preview to move one of our mission-critical applications to Amazon Aurora, and the migration required minimal changes in our SQL Server application code. We pointed the applications at Aurora, and it just worked. We are excited for the general availability launch of Babelfish, which will enable us to migrate the rest of our application portfolio to Aurora in a fraction of the time it might otherwise have taken.” Q2 is a leading provider of secure, cloud-based digital solutions that transform how financial services providers engage with users. “We have tested an end-user application with minimal database changes for Babelfish, and we are pleased with the performance so far,” said Jordan Hager, Vice President of Hosting Architecture at Q2. “We estimate Babelfish’s capabilities will speed up our database migration to Amazon Aurora from SQL Server by 80% or more. The faster we move off SQL Server to Aurora, the sooner we dramatically lower our database licensing costs, increase developer productivity, and improve database performance. Needless to say, we are thrilled with the general availability launch of Babelfish.” About Amazon Web Services For over 15 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud offering.

Amazon FamilyFlex gives employees, which may differ by business and employment type, the resources to create the right balance between home life and work life, including pregnancy and parental leave, adoption assistance, and in select roles, the ability to swap shifts and create custom schedules. The program is a result of feedback from employees on the most effective ways to provide flexibility and support in managing their work and personal lives. “Millions of women have left the workforce as a result of the caregiving crisis created by COVID-19, and women's workforce participation has hit its lowest rate since the 1980s,” said Tami Forman, CEO of Path Forward, a nonprofit dedicated to helping professionals return to the workforce. “Women—and many parents in general—will not be able to return to the workforce and thrive there, without policies like flexible schedules and family support resources. Programs like Amazon FamilyFlex are another step toward meaningful change as employees seek better balance between work and caregiving responsibilities.” “Work-life balance is something that's very important to me. Being able to choose my own schedule allows me to spend time with my daughter,” said Brittany Hartso, an hourly employee at Amazon’s Springfield, Virginia fulfillment center. “A lot of people can't take their kids to school and pick them up as well. I'm able to do that every day and I love it.” Flexible scheduling for employees Through FamilyFlex, Amazon offers employees in select roles a variety of ways to choose and change their schedule, whether they prefer keeping the same, reliable schedule week-after-week, or swapping shifts at the last minute to accommodate family duties. Some of the options, which can differ based on an individual’s role, include: Swap shifts ahead of time or at the last minute: Employees shared that they want the flexibility to manage life events by switching shifts rather than using time off. Eligible employees can now swap shifts easily using Amazon’s internal mobile app or desktop site. With just a few clicks, employees can swap shifts with a co-worker or exchange a current shift for a future one that they have scheduled for themselves, letting them easily choose to work a different day that week. The program is currently available to nearly 500,000 employees in Amazon’s fulfillment and delivery network across the U.S. with more expansion on the horizon. Create your own schedule with “Anytime Shifts”: Anytime Shifts is a flexible option that gives employees in select roles the opportunity to pick the time and type of shift that works best for them. Employees who opt for this type of role can pick up shifts on Amazon’s internal app to create their own preferred schedule. They can also use the app to cancel a shift in as little as 16 hours before the shift begins. The company currently has over 23,000 open roles that qualify for Anytime Shifts across its U.S. operations network, and more than 100,000 employees have utilized the benefit. Flexible pay options Employees have shared there are times when they would like the option to access their earnings without waiting for payday. With “Anytime Pay,” a free, fast pay program, select U.S. employees can transfer the majority of their earnings since their last paycheck to a paycard. The card can be used anywhere that Visa is accepted, like neighborhood grocery stores, and employees can also withdraw cash at participating ATMs and transfer money from their paycard to a regular bank account—all at no cost. The company has tens of thousands of open roles that qualify for Anytime Pay across its U.S. operations network, and more than 150,000 current employees have access to the benefit. Supporting families with care options and resources Employees have said that they appreciate support throughout all stages of their lives. All U.S. regular full-time employees receive comprehensive benefits, including health, vision, and dental insurance; a 401(k) plan with company match; and free mental health resources and support. Benefits can vary by location, the number of regularly scheduled hours worked, length of employment, and job status, such as seasonal or temporary employment. For employees who have or are planning to have a family, Amazon FamilyFlex offers access to: Pregnancy and parental leave: Amazon offers a range of fully paid pregnancy and leave options for eligible new parents, including up to 20 weeks of paid pregnancy and parental leave for birthing parents. The company also has an industry-unique “Leave Share” option and a flexible return-to-work program known as “Ramp Back.” The Leave Share program gives new parents the option to give up to six weeks of paid parental leave to a spouse or partner who isn’t eligible for parental leave from their employer. The Ramp Back program offers parents eight consecutive weeks of flexibility and partial work hours after the birth or adoption of a child as they readjust to work schedules as new parents. Child care, elder care, and referral services: Employees have free access to a network of more than 2 million caregivers, including nannies, babysitters, and special-needs caretakers. Amazon provides free access to UrbanSitter, Sittercity, and Years Ahead, which connect employees to child, elder, and pet care providers. Amazon pays for the memberships to find care, while employees pay for care services. Amazon employees can also receive preferred enrollment for full-service care at Bright Horizons child care centers with waived registration fees up to $250, tuition discounts for full-service care at participating non-Bright Horizons network partner centers, and discounted tutoring and test prep services for students. Rethink: Employees have access to a variety of free resources for parents of children with autism, ADHD, and other developmental disabilities. This benefit includes ongoing remote consultations with a dedicated behavior expert to answer specific questions and other resources to assist children with skills like socialization, self-help, and academics. Rethink also offers free consultations, training videos, and a library of online resources to help support children of employees. Mental health resources: Resources for Living, a free single place to start for personalized, convenient, and confidential mental health and daily life support, is available 24/7 to all employees, their families, and anyone in their household. Free one-on-one counseling sessions—three sessions per person, per topic—are included and can be used by anyone in the employee’s household. Adoption Assistance: The company offers up to six weeks of paid leave for parents who adopt. Amazon also reimburses employees for qualified expenses such as adoption and attorney fees, court costs, and travel, up to $5,000 per child. “The pandemic has put a spotlight on, and even exacerbated, the challenges faced by families who care for young children,” said Alicia Boler Davis, Senior Vice President of Global Customer Fulfillment at Amazon. “Giving employees ways to balance work and home commitments is important to us, which is why we go beyond providing an average starting wage of $18 per hour and comprehensive benefits, and also offer a variety of opportunities with flexible scheduling options to ensure each employee can do what works best for them.” To learn more about Amazon’s FamilyFlex, visit: https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-familyflex-helps-bring-more-parents-back-to-the-workplace. Amazon continues to provide opportunities for full-time and part-time jobs in logistics as it expands its footprint to better serve customers in communities where they live. Roles in fulfillment and transportation offer an average starting wage of more than $18 per hour—and up to $22.50 per hour in some locations. The company also provides full-time employees with comprehensive benefits from day one, worth an additional $3.50 per hour.

I’m excited to be on people’s Christmas playlists because it’s such a magical time of the year and getting to be part of the soundtrack during such an intimate family and friend holiday season is a real honor.

From Mexico, singers María León, Paty Cantú, and María José team up for a rendition of Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” out on November 19, and French-Canadian singer-songwriter Cœur de pirate premieres a melodic new original, “Parfait Noël.” Spanish pop band La Oreja de Van Gogh will also delight customers with their version of “Blanca Navidad.” “When I first heard I was going to do an Amazon Original, I immediately thought of the Marvin Gaye version of ‘Purple Snowflakes,’” said Leon Bridges. “It’s one of my favorite Christmas songs and I love the classic stuff… but this one has a little bit more soul to it. There aren’t too many renditions of this song and I wanted to kind of put my own spin on it as far as figuring out the arrangement and give it the Fort Worth, Texas approach.” “Writing original Christmas songs is difficult, because there’s already so many good songs that exist and ... you feel like everything’s already been said,” shared Dan + Shay. “One day we sat down to write our song and it sort of poured out of us—it was just the soundtrack for folks going out, families, friends going to a Christmas tree farm, or going to a store down the street and picking out a Christmas tree. We’re so excited about it and hopefully it brings a little joy this holiday season.” “Above all, it is important to give thanks! Music has given me everything, and I am grateful and humbled to use it to give back to my fans,” said Sech. ""‘Carta Navideña’ is an original song inspired by the holiday spirit felt around the world. You can recognize the sounds often heard in the classics, but with my unique style and emotions. The lyrics express my fondest holiday memories and traditions. I hope it becomes a popular classic, too, resonating with fans and reminding them to create many happy memories and give thanks always.” In addition to new holiday songs, Amazon Music listeners can explore hundreds of festive playlists and stations across artists and decades, including “REDISCOVER: Mariah Carey Christmas,” “Holiday Favorites,” “Christmas Past,” and “Christmas Present,” and a host of new programmed destinations. “Fluent Holidays” is a new playlist celebrating fans who move fluidly between cultures, featuring English, Spanish and bilingual holiday tunes from artists including Reik, Sebastián Yatra, Camila Cabello, Katy Perry, and Sech. The playlist will spotlight English and Spanish language holiday classics, including new Amazon Original songs. “Merry Mix” is a global playlist on Amazon Music featuring iconic holiday classics mixed with tomorrow’s holiday hits. And starting November 19, customers in the U.S. can check out a hosted version of Merry Mix in DJ Mode, which will feature special guests such as Mariah Carey sharing their holiday memories, the stories behind their own holiday songs, and much more. Customers will also hear festive tracks including Bing Crosby’s “White Christmas,” Darlene Love’s “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home),” and John Legend’s “What Christmas Means to Me” with Stevie Wonder. To listen to the station, simply ask “Alexa, play Merry Mix in DJ Mode” in the Amazon Music app for iOS and Android or on Alexa-enabled devices.

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced plans to open an infrastructure Region in Alberta, Canada, in late 2023/early 2024. The new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region will consist of three Availability Zones (AZs) at launch and join the existing AWS Canada (Central) Region in Montreal, which also consists of three Availability Zones. Globally, AWS has 81 Availability Zones across 25 geographic regions, with plans to launch 27 more Availability Zones and nine more AWS Regions in Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates. The upcoming AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region will enable even more developers, startups, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and nonprofit organizations, to run their applications and serve end users from data centers located in Canada. AWS also released an economic impact study (EIS) estimating that the company’s spending on construction and the operation of the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region and existing AWS Canada (Central) Region in Montreal will together create more than 5,000 new jobs with an estimated investment of over $17 billion (CA$21 billion) in the local economies by 2037. Both infrastructure Regions will add an estimated $31.6 billion (CA$39 billion) to Canada’s GDP over the same time period.

With another AWS Region in Canada, customers will see even lower latency for emerging solutions like 5G-enabled applications and machine learning at the edge, and it will strengthen their ability to architect their regional infrastructure for even greater fault tolerance, resiliency, and availability,” said Prasad Kalyanaraman, Vice President of Infrastructure Services at AWS. “We are excited to build world-class infrastructure to help organizations reinvent how they deliver customer solutions and fuel economic growth.” “This major investment from AWS again demonstrates that Alberta is establishing itself as a dominant player in digital technology and innovation. This multibillion-dollar data center project in our province underscores the work being done by Invest Alberta to create jobs and diversify the economy,” said Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. “I look forward to working with AWS on this project and seeing how it will strengthen Alberta’s information technology and communication sector.” AWS Regions are composed of Availability Zones that place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations. Availability Zones are located far enough from each other to support customers’ business continuity but near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security, and is connected through redundant, ultra-low latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance. The AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region will enable customers with data residency preferences to securely store data in Canada while providing even lower latency across the country and more flexibility to run applications across multiple Regions. Overall, AWS is estimated to invest over $17 billion (CA$21 billion) in Canada by 2037 through the construction and operation of its two infrastructure Regions. This AWS infrastructure investment is expected to increase Canada’s GDP by approximately more than $31 billion (CA$39 billion) over the same time period. In the newly announced AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, AWS plans to invest over $3 billion (CA$4 billion) by 2037, which includes capital expenditures on the construction of data centers, operational expenses such as ongoing utilities and facility costs, and purchases of goods and services from regional businesses. The EIS also estimates that the new AWS Region will bring direct and indirect economic benefits like new employment and sales for the data center supply chain and related sectors in Canada. In total, investment in the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region is estimated to create more than 950 new full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs in Canada. Customers and AWS Partners Welcome the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region Customers in Canada will join the millions of active customers using AWS every month in over 190 countries around the world.

Commitment to Sustainability Amazon is committed to running its business in an environmentally friendly way and has committed to reach net zero carbon across all business operations by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement, as part of The Climate Pledge. A key component of this commitment is powering Amazon’s global infrastructure with 100% renewable energy, and the company is now on a path to achieve this milestone by 2025, five years ahead of the initial 2030 target. Amazon also became the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in 2020, reaching 65% renewable energy across its business. In April 2021, Amazon announced its first renewable energy project in Canada—an 80 megawatt (MW) solar project in the County of Newell in Alberta. Once complete, the project will contribute an estimated 195,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable energy to the grid, which is enough energy to power more than 18,000 Canadian homes for a year. In June 2021, Amazon announced its second and largest renewable energy project in Canada—a 375 MW solar farm in Vulcan, Alberta. When it comes online next year, the project will bring Amazon’s capacity in Canada to more than 1 million MWhs, which is enough to power more than 100,000 Canadian homes for a year. These projects will contribute to powering Amazon’s global infrastructure. More information on AWS sustainability efforts can be found at aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability.

Una vez que se complete, el proyecto contribuirá con un estimado de más de 195 000 megavatios-hora (MWh) de energía renovable para la red, la cual es energía suficiente como para abastecer a más de 18 000 hogares canadienses durante un año. En junio de 2021, Amazon anunció su segundo y mayor proyecto de energía renovable en Canadá: una granja solar de 375 MW en Vulcan, Alberta. Cuando entre en funcionamiento el próximo año, la huerta solar aumentará la capacidad de Amazon en Canadá a más de 1 millón de megavatios hora (MWh), lo suficiente para alimentar más de 100 000 hogares canadienses durante un año. Estos proyectos contribuirán a impulsar la infraestructura global de Amazon.

(“Amazon”) (NASDAQ: AMZN), together with a subsidiary of Weber Inc. (NYSE:WEBR) (“Weber”), jointly filed a lawsuit against 12 defendants for selling products that illegally bear the WEBER® registered trademark in Amazon’s store. The defendants attempted to offer counterfeit versions of the global grill maker’s grill covers, violating Amazon’s policies, infringing on Weber’s registered trademarks, and breaking the law. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington and alleges that the defendants conspired to deceive customers about the authenticity and origin of their products and create a false affiliation with Weber. Amazon closed the defendants’ selling accounts and proactively refunded the impacted customers. “If counterfeiters attempt to sell in our store, they don’t just break the law and violate the rights of companies like Weber, they mislead consumers,” said Kebharu Smith, Director of Amazon’s Counterfeit Crimes Unit. “In the rare instances when counterfeiters are able to bypass our enforcement tools and teams, we will find them and hold them fully accountable.” Amazon strictly prohibits infringing and counterfeit products in its store, and in 2020, Amazon invested more than $700 million and employed more than 10,000 people to proactively protect its store from fraud, counterfeit, and abuse. Amazon uses industry-leading tools to verify potential sellers’ identities and ensure product listings are authentic, and Amazon’s proprietary systems analyze hundreds of unique data points to verify information provided by potential sellers. In 2020, only 6% of attempted new seller account registrations passed Amazon’s robust verification processes and listed products for sale. In addition, fewer than 0.01% of all products sold on Amazon received a counterfeit complaint from customers. “Protecting consumers and our brand are top priorities for Weber,” said Phil Zadeik, General Counsel of Weber. “As the world’s leading company in outdoor cooking, we take tremendous pride in developing, manufacturing, and offering high-quality, durable, innovative products that meet or exceed our strict standards. And when that premise is jeopardized with counterfeit goods, we take action. We appreciate Amazon’s partnership and their commitment to only offering authentic Weber products to those that love to barbecue.” The court filings are available here: Case: 2:21-cv-01512, United States District Court for the Western District of Washington Amazon has an extensive history protecting brands and taking action to hold bad actors accountable: Amazon Counterfeit Crimes Unit Reaches Settlement with Influencers Who Ran Social Media Counterfeiting Scheme Amazon and Asmodee File Joint Lawsuit Against Counterfeiters Amazon and HanesBrands File Joint Lawsuits Against Infringers of Champion Trademarks Amazon Published Comprehensive Brand Protection Report Demonstrating Progress Toward Driving Counterfeits to Zero Amazon Establishes Counterfeit Crimes Unit to Bring Counterfeits to Justice Amazon Launches IP Accelerator in Europe to Help Small Businesses Protect Their Brands and Tackle Counterfeit IPR Center, Amazon Launch ‘Operation Fulfilled Action’ to Stop Counterfeiters Amazon and YETI File Joint Lawsuit against Counterfeiters Amazon and Salvatore Ferragamo File Two Joint Lawsuits Against Counterfeiters About Amazon Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE: UA, UAA) has selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider for SAP to increase resilience, enhance security, and provide more significant insights across its business. The athletic performance brand completed the migration of its SAP environments to AWS earlier this year, providing the foundation for improving performance and visibility across its design, merchandising, planning, manufacturing, supply chain, and sales distribution channels. Under Armour will now integrate its SAP environments with AWS’s broad and deep set of technologies, including analytics, machine learning, compute, and storage. Powered by the world’s leading cloud, this modernization brings a range of AWS capabilities to fuel innovation in areas like 3D apparel and footwear design, digitally connected footwear and apparel, resource-efficient production, direct-to-consumer sales, and global wholesale distribution. “AWS is a critical element of our digital transformation, and we look forward to harnessing its industry-leading cloud capabilities as we enter our next stage of growth,” said Under Armour Chief Technology Officer Danny Miles. “With SAP in the cloud, we can now apply deep analytics and machine learning capabilities to drive greater efficiency across our business. With AWS, we are optimizing our product innovation processes to deliver premium consumer experiences wherever and whenever our customers choose to engage our brand.” Under Armour accelerated its SAP migration with the help of the AWS Professional Services team, shifting its SAP landscape to the cloud in less than six months. As part of the migration, Under Armour moved its enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply network collaboration, global trade services, enterprise reporting (BI, BOBJ), integration (PI/PO, data services), SAP Fiori, and solution manager workloads to AWS. Following the migration, the company implemented CloudEndure Disaster Recovery, AWS’s service for scalable, cost-effective business continuity for physical, virtual, and cloud servers. With this move, Under Armour can maintain optimum system performance and minimize downtime and data loss with a cross-Region disaster recovery solution that includes 65 servers replicating from one AWS Region to another. “Under Armour set out to find the best cloud environment for its most crucial applications and achieved that with AWS. We’re helping Under Armour improve its responsiveness and scalability companywide, while operating more securely,” said Greg Pearson, Vice President of Worldwide Commercial Sales at Amazon Web Services, Inc. “As the operational backbone of Under Armour's business, maintaining a resilient SAP landscape is essential to empowering operational efficiency and speed to market. Like thousands of organizations that choose to run their SAP workloads on AWS, Under Armour did so because of our reliable and scalable infrastructure and breadth of services that help them get the most value out of their data.” Backed by its unmatched experience in running SAP workloads, AWS helps customers get the best performance and most value from their mission-critical SAP platforms. Running SAP on AWS gives customers the control and confidence to securely run their business, leveraging the most reliable and scalable infrastructure, the broadest set of cloud capabilities, and the largest community of technology partners to help with SAP migration and modernization.

AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any cloud workload, and it now has more than 200 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 81 Availability Zones within 25 geographic regions, with announced plans for 27 more Availability Zones and nine more AWS Regions in Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.

(AWS), uma empresa Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), anunciou planos para abrir uma região de infraestrutura em Alberta, Canadá, no final de 2023/início de 2024. A nova região AWS Canada West (Calgary) consistirá em três zonas de disponibilidade (Availability Zones, AZs) na inauguração e se juntará à região AWS Canada (Central) existente em Montreal, que também consiste em três zonas de disponibilidade. Globalmente, a AWS possui 81 zonas de disponibilidade em 25 regiões geográficas, com planos para lançar mais 27 zonas de disponibilidade e mais nove regiões da AWS na Austrália, Canadá, Índia, Indonésia, Israel, Nova Zelândia, Espanha, Suíça e Emirados Árabes Unidos. A futura região AWS Canada West (Calgary) permitirá que mais desenvolvedores, startups e empresas, como também o governo, setores como educação e sem fins lucrativos executem seus aplicativos e atendam usuários finais de data centers localizados no Canadá. A AWS também divulgou um estudo de impacto econômico (Economic Impact Study, EIS) estimando que os gastos da empresa na construção e operação da nova região AWS Canada West (Calgary) e a existente região AWS Canada (Central) em Montreal criarão, juntas, mais de 5 mil novos empregos com um investimento estimado de mais de US$ 17 bilhões (CA$ 21 bilhões) nas economias locais até 2037. As duas regiões de infraestrutura adicionarão cerca de US$ 31,6 bilhões (CA$ 39 bilhões) ao PIB do Canadá no mesmo período. Para mais informações sobre a infraestrutura global da AWS, acesse aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/. “Nossa infraestrutura no Canadá permitiu aos clientes transformar a maneira como empresas, instituições educacionais e órgãos governamentais atendem às suas partes interessadas. Com outra região da AWS no Canadá, os clientes observarão uma latência ainda menor para soluções emergentes como aplicativos habilitados para 5G e aprendizado de máquina na borda, e isso fortalecerá sua capacidade de arquitetar sua infraestrutura regional para maior tolerância a falhas, resiliência e disponibilidade”, disse Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice-presidente de serviços de infraestrutura da AWS. “Estamos entusiasmados para construir uma infraestrutura de classe mundial para ajudar as organizações a reinventar a forma como elas fornecem soluções para os clientes e impulsionar o crescimento econômico”. “Este grande investimento da AWS demonstra mais uma vez que Alberta está se estabelecendo como um agente dominante em tecnologia digital e inovação. Este projeto de data center multibilionário em nossa província ressalta o trabalho que está sendo feito pela Invest Alberta para criar empregos e diversificar a economia”, disse o premiê de Alberta, Jason Kenney. “Estou ansioso para trabalhar com a AWS neste projeto e ver como ele fortalecerá o setor de tecnologia da informação e comunicação de Alberta”. As regiões da AWS são compostas por zonas de disponibilidade que posicionam a infraestrutura em localidades geográficas separadas e distintas. As zonas de disponibilidade estão localizadas longe o suficiente umas das outras para dar suporte à continuidade dos negócios dos clientes, mas perto o suficiente para fornecer baixa latência para aplicativos de alta disponibilidade que usam várias zonas de disponibilidade. Cada zona de disponibilidade possui energia, resfriamento, e segurança física independentes e está conectada por redes redundantes de latência ultrabaixa. Os clientes da AWS focados em alta disponibilidade podem criar seus aplicativos para rodarem em múltiplas zonas de disponibilidade para alcançar uma tolerância de falha ainda maior. A região AWS Canada West (Calgary) permitirá que os clientes com preferências de residência de dados armazenem dados com segurança no Canadá, enquanto fornece latência ainda mais baixa em todo o país e mais flexibilidade para executar aplicativos em várias regiões. No geral, estima-se que a AWS invista mais de US$ 17 bilhões (CA$ 21 bilhões) no Canadá até 2037 por meio da construção e operação de suas duas regiões de infraestrutura. Espera-se que este investimento em infraestrutura da AWS aumente o PIB do Canadá em aproximadamente mais de US$ 31 bilhões (CA$ 39 bilhões) no mesmo período. Na região AWS Canada West (Calgary) recém-anunciada, a AWS planeja investir mais de US$ 3 bilhões (CA$ 4 bilhões) até 2037, incluindo despesas de capital na construção de data centers, despesas operacionais como custos contínuos de serviços públicos e de instalação e compras de bens e serviços de empresas regionais. O EIS também estima que a nova região da AWS gerará benefícios econômicos diretos e indiretos, como novas vagas de trabalho e vendas para a cadeia de suprimentos do data center e setores relacionados no Canadá. No total, estima-se que o investimento na nova região AWS Canada West (Calgary) crie mais de 950 novas vagas de trabalho equivalentes a tempo integral (full-time equivalent, FTE) no Canadá. Clientes e parceiros da AWS dão as boas-vindas à região AWS Canada West (Calgary) Os clientes no Canadá se juntarão aos milhões de clientes ativos que utilizam a AWS mensalmente, em mais de 190 países. Organizações canadenses, incluindo a Air Canada, Athabasca University, Benevity, BMO Financial Group, Canada Border Services Agency, D2L, Hootsuite, Humber College, Keyera, Neo Financial, NHL, Nutrien, lululemon athletica, Provincial Health Services Authority, Porter Airlines, Sun Life, Trimac Transportation e o Vancouver General Hospital escolheram a AWS para executar suas cargas de trabalho para gerar economia de custos, acelerar a inovação e reduzir o tempo de entrada no mercado. A Sun Life é uma organização internacional líder em serviços financeiros que fornece soluções de vida, saúde e patrimônio para clientes individuais e corporativos. “Por meio de nossa transformação digital, estamos constantemente inovando de forma a aprimorar o que fazemos para ajudar nossos clientes a obter segurança financeira vitalícia e uma vida mais saudável”, disse Laura Money, vice-presidente executiva e diretora de informações da Sun Life. “Com o anúncio de hoje de uma segunda região da AWS no Canadá, adicionaremos outra camada de resiliência de negócios para apoiar ainda mais nossos clientes que precisam manter seus dados no Canadá”. A Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) é a espinha dorsal do sistema de saúde da Colúmbia Britânica, garantindo que 5 milhões de residentes tenham acesso a uma rede de serviços e programas de saúde especializados. Durante a pandemia da COVID-19, a PHSA forneceu resultados de testes de COVID-19 e agendamentos de vacinação. “Usando o Amazon Pinpoint, a PHSA enviou milhões de mensagens de texto e e-mails confirmando registros, notificações de agendamento e lembretes de agendamento de vacina para os residentes da Colúmbia Britânica”, disse Shannon Malovec, diretor de inovação digital da PHSA. “A AWS nos permitiu expandir nossas comunicações rapidamente. Vemos o valor em usar a tecnologia mais recente para servir nossos cidadãos, e esta nova região da AWS no oeste do Canadá nos ajudará e a muitas outras organizações a impulsionar a inovação”. A Kidoodle.TV é um serviço de streaming infantil com sede em Calgary, com mais de 100 milhões de downloads em 235 países e territórios em todo o mundo. “Uso a AWS no setor de mídia e entretenimento há tanto tempo que não consigo imaginar um mundo sem ela. Ela é parte integrante da nossa capacidade de lançar novos recursos e produtos rapidamente”, disse Daniel Riddell, diretor de tecnologia da Kidoodle.TV. “Como o serviço de nuvem AWS existia quando criamos esta empresa, podíamos construir tudo fora das instalações. Não tínhamos necessidade de enormes custos indiretos. Pudemos construir essencialmente a mesma arquitetura de serviços que empresas multibilionárias foram capazes de implantar. Quando a COVID começou, nossos números dispararam. Utilizamos o AWS Elemental MediaTailor e outros serviços da AWS para aumentar nossos usuários ativos mensais em 3.200% em um ano e dinamizar rapidamente nosso processo de entrega de anúncios”. A Athabasca University (AU), universidade on-line do Canadá, é uma das instituições de educação on-line e aberta de crescimento mais rápido do mundo, atendendo a mais de 43 mil alunos em 87 países. A AU se tornou a primeira instituição pós-secundária canadense a transferir toda a sua infraestrutura operacional digital para a AWS no ano passado. “Gosto de dizer que não há inovação em escala sem uma base sólida”. A mudança da AU para a AWS em 2020 foi a base da nossa estratégia de transformação digital, fornecendo a infraestrutura e a economia de custos que nos permitirão transformar o aprendizado personalizado para nossos alunos em uma realidade infinitamente escalável”, disse Jennifer Schaeffer, vice-presidente de tecnologia da informação e diretora de informação da AU. “Não apenas transformamos nossa base digital, mas também colocamos a nuvem na vanguarda com nosso currículo. Estamos ajudando a treinar a próxima geração de profissionais de nuvem por meio dos programas AU PowerEDTM e AWS Academy Cloud Foundations”. Como uma das maiores empresas midstream independentes do Canadá, a Keyera opera um negócio de infraestrutura de energia integrada com extensos ativos interconectados. A Keyera desempenha um papel crucial no processamento, transporte e comercialização de gás natural de queima limpa e líquidos de gás natural que alimentam de forma responsável a vida moderna em toda a América do Norte. “Parte de como fornecemos energia sustentável e responsável é colaborando com uma forte parceira de inovação tecnológica. Reconhecemos a necessidade de inovação digital como uma forma de fornecer aos nossos clientes maior precisão e confiabilidade. Trabalhando com a AWS, construímos um novo aplicativo de aprendizado de máquina que identifica problemas na medição proativamente, o que nos permite responder e reagir em dias, em vez de semanas. Até o momento, vimos melhorias significativas na medição para a Keyera e nossos clientes e, com base nesse sucesso, estamos expandindo sua implantação para duas instalações adicionais”, disse Kelly Hill, vice-presidente de tecnologia da informação da Keyera. “Trabalhar com a AWS significa que construímos uma plataforma de inovação digital para nossas necessidades atuais e futuras. O AWS Professional Services está nos ajudando a transformar nosso negócio digital por meio de novos aplicativos e serviços como o Amazon Rekognition para rastreamento de ativos usando visão computacional, e outros serviços como o Amazon SageMaker e Amazon QuickSight para inteligência de negócios e painéis em nossa iniciativa de medição. Estamos entusiasmados em continuar colaborando com a AWS para avançar em nossa jornada de inovação”. Nascida na AWS, a Neo Financial é uma startup de tecnologia financeira que usa a elasticidade da nuvem AWS para escalar seus negócios. “Quando começamos em 2019, precisávamos de um provedor de nuvem para nos ajudar a expandir e atender aos requisitos regulatórios que enfrentamos como uma empresa de serviços financeiros. Nossos clientes também têm mandatos de conformidade que exigem que seus dados sejam mantidos no Canadá”, disse Kris Read, cofundador e diretor de tecnologia da Neo Financial. “Hoje, usamos Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud para nossa infraestrutura central e Amazon Simple Storage Service devido ao seu armazenamento altamente durável. Também melhoramos a segurança com o Amazon GuardDuty e melhoramos o desempenho para nossos clientes com o Amazon CloudFront”. Parceiros baseados no Canadá fazem parte da AWS Partner Network (APN), que inclui mais de 100 mil fornecedores independentes de software (independent software vendors, ISVs) e integradores de sistemas (systems integrators, SIs) ao redor do mundo. Parceiros da AWS constroem soluções e serviços inovadores na AWS, e a APN fornece suporte empresarial, técnico, de marketing e de entrada no mercado aos clientes. SIs, parceiros consultores e ISVs da APN ajudam clientes empresariais e do setor público a migrar para a AWS, implantar aplicativos de missão crítica e fornecer uma completa gama de serviços de monitoramento, automação e gerenciamento para ambientes dos clientes. Exemplos de parceiros da AWS Canada incluem a Accenture, Bell Canada, Deloitte, FuseForward, FX Innovation, Levio, OpsGuru, Rackspace, Slalom, Softchoice, Qalius, Quantiphi e a Xerris. ISVs da AWS no Canadá, incluindo a Arctic Wolf, Benevity, CrowdStrike, D2L, Lightspeed POS, Salesforce, SmartSimple, Tidal Migrations, Vidyard e a Workday já estão usando a AWS para entregar seu software a clientes em todo o mundo e planejam atender seus clientes canadenses da região AWS Canada West (Calgary) no seu lançamento. Acesse aws.amazon.com/partners para a lista completa de membros APN. A Xerris Inc., parceira avançada da AWS com sede em Calgary, Alberta, é especializada no fornecimento de soluções com foco em tecnologia para mídia e entretenimento, energia, setor público e empresas de varejo. “Trabalhamos com a AWS há vários anos e, em 2020, realmente aumentamos nossas operações — passando de uma equipe de oito pessoas para mais de 100”, disse Jeremy Tooley, diretor executivo da Xerris. “Temos ajudado clientes na área de Calgary, como a StellarAlgo, a dimensionar e otimizar suas soluções de dados para usar modelos de aprendizado de máquina para fornecer insights valiosos sobre o comportamento e retenção dos fãs em esportes ao vivo e eventos de entretenimento. Também estamos trabalhando com a Nutrien, Burnco, enerPlus e a Aldo em vários projetos de transformação e fundamentais. A AWS Cloud oferece uma ampla gama de serviços que ajudam nossos clientes a operar com agilidade e escala. Abraçamos o crescimento contínuo e o investimento que a AWS está realizando no Canadá”. A Slalom, uma empresa de consultoria global focada em estratégia, tecnologia e transformação de negócios com mais de 11 mil funcionários em 41 mercados ao redor do mundo, tem autonomia para agir rapidamente e se desenvolver para seus clientes. “A Slalom e a AWS fizeram parceria e concluíram mais de 1.500 projetos juntas em migração, modernização, análise de dados e estratégias gerais de nuvem, levando ao investimento e aumento das operações da Slalom na região AWS Canada (Central) desde 2016”, disse Wayne Ingram, gerente geral nacional da Slalom Canada. “Por meio dessa parceria, a Slalom Canada cresceu para mais de 750 funcionários nos últimos cinco anos, incluindo 150 no oeste do Canadá em Vancouver e Calgary. Com clientes canadenses, como a LoyaltyOne, TC Energy e muitos outros, estamos especialmente entusiasmados em ver o crescente interesse e necessidade de estratégias de nuvem e esperamos ainda mais inovação neste país”. Investindo no futuro do Canadá Além da região AWS Canada (Central) em Montreal, a AWS lançou cinco localidades de ponta Amazon CloudFront em Vancouver, Toronto e Montreal. A Amazon CloudFront é uma rede de distribuição de conteúdo (content delivery network, CDN) altamente segura e programável que acelera a entrega de dados, vídeos, aplicativos e APIs para usuários mundialmente, com baixa latência e altas velocidades de transferência. A Amazon abriu centros de tecnologia em Toronto e Vancouver para desenvolvedores, engenheiros, profissionais de vendas, marketing e desenvolvimento de negócios para ajudar clientes e parceiros locais, e abriu o escritório AWS Thinkbox em Winnipeg com foco no desenvolvimento de soluções e serviços para a indústria criativa. Em março de 2021, a Amazon Games lançou um novo estúdio de desenvolvimento em Montreal, e a Amazon atualmente tem 17 centros de distribuição, seis centros de classificação e 35 estações de entrega em todo o país. A Amazon emprega mais de 39.500 funcionários em tempo integral e parcial, e a empresa anunciou planos para criar milhares de empregos adicionais no país em sua rede de operações e equipes, incluindo a AWS, Amazon Ads, Amazon Games, Alexa e a Prime Video. Aumentando a qualificação da força de trabalho do Canadá A AWS continua investindo na qualificação de desenvolvedores, estudantes e a próxima geração de líderes de TI no Canadá por meio de programas como o AWS re/Start, AWS Academy e AWS Educate, e desde 2013, ajudou a treinar mais de 100 mil pessoas com habilidades de computação em nuvem. Estes programas de educação AWS ajudam alunos de todos os perfis e experiências a se preparar para carreiras na nuvem. Desde cursos universitários a programas de treinamento em tempo integral e conteúdo de aprendizado de ritmo próprio, os programas de educação AWS oferecem acesso às habilidades necessárias para começar uma carreira na computação em nuvem. Com o apoio do programa Edge Up 2.0 da Calgary Economic Development, a AWS e a Mount Royal University se uniram para trazer o programa AWS re/Start para Calgary no início de 2022. O programa de treinamento de habilidades profissionais AWS re/Start preparará indivíduos para funções de nível de entrada em computação em nuvem e conectá-los a potenciais empregadores, como parte do compromisso da Amazon em ajudar 29 milhões de pessoas em todo o mundo a aprimorar suas habilidades de tecnologia com treinamento gratuito em computação em nuvem até 2025. Compromisso com a sustentabilidade A Amazon está comprometida em operar seu negócio de uma maneira ambientalmente amigável e se comprometeu a alcançar carbono líquido zero em todas as suas operações de negócios até 2040, 10 anos antes do Acordo de Paris, como parte do The Climate Pledge. Um importante componente desse compromisso é alimentar a infraestrutura global da Amazon com energia 100% renovável, e a empresa agora está no caminho para atingir esse marco até 2025, cinco anos antes da meta inicial de 2030. A Amazon também se tornou a maior compradora corporativa de energia renovável do mundo em 2020, alcançando 65% de energia renovável em seus negócios. Em abril de 2021, a Amazon anunciou seu primeiro projeto de energia renovável no Canadá, um projeto solar de 80 megawatts (MW) no condado de Newell, em Alberta. Quando concluído, o projeto contribuirá com cerca de 195.000 megawatt-hora (MWh) de energia renovável para a rede, energia suficiente para abastecer mais de 18.000 residências canadenses por um ano. Em junho de 2021, a Amazon anunciou seu segundo e maior projeto de energia renovável no Canadá — um parque solar de 375 MW em Vulcan, Alberta. Quando entrar em operação no próximo ano, o projeto levará a capacidade da Amazon no Canadá para mais de 1 milhão de MWh, suficiente para abastecer mais de 100 mil residências canadenses por um ano. Esses projetos contribuirão para fortalecer a infraestrutura global da Amazon. Mais informações sobre os esforços de sustentabilidade da AWS podem ser encontradas em aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability.

(AWS), une société d’Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ : AMZN), a annoncé aujourd’hui l’ouverture d’une Région infrastructurelle dans l’Alberta, au Canada, fin 2023/début 2024. La nouvelle Région AWS Canada West (Calgary) sera constituée à son lancement, de trois Zones de disponibilité (Availability Zones, AZ), et rejoindra la Région AWS Canada (Central) existante à Montréal, elle-même constituée également de trois Zones de disponibilité. Globalement, AWS compte 81 Zones de disponibilité dans 25 régions géographiques, et projette de lancer 27 autres Zones de disponibilité et neuf autres Régions AWS en Australie, au Canada, en Inde, en Indonésie, en Israël, en Nouvelle-Zélande, en Espagne, en Suisse et aux Émirats arabes unis. La future Région AWS Canada West (Calgary) permettra à un nombre encore plus grand de développeurs, de start-ups et d’entreprises, ainsi qu’au gouvernement, aux établissements d’enseignement et aux organisations à but non lucratif, d’exécuter leurs applications et de desservir leurs utilisateurs finaux, à partir de centres de données situés au Canada. AWS a également publié une étude d’impact économique (Economic Impact Study, EIS) selon laquelle les dépenses de la Société dans la construction et l’exploitation de la nouvelle Région AWS Canada West (Calgary) et la Région AWS Canada (Central) existante à Montréal créeront conjointement plus de 5 000 nouveaux emplois, avec un investissement estimé de plus de 17 milliards USD (21 milliards CAD) dans les économies locales d’ici 2037. Les deux Régions infrastructurelles ajouteront environ 31,6 milliards USD (39 milliards CAD) au PIB du Canada sur la même période. Pour en savoir plus sur l’infrastructure mondiale d’AWS, rendez-vous sur aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/. « Notre infrastructure au Canada a permis aux clients de transformer la façon dont les entreprises, les établissements d’enseignement, et les agences gouvernementales servent leurs parties prenantes. Avec une nouvelle Région AWS au Canada, les clients bénéficieront de latences moindres pour les solutions émergentes telles que les applications compatibles 5G et l’apprentissage machine en périphérie, et cela renforcera leur capacité à concevoir leur infrastructure régionale pour une tolérance aux pannes, une résilience et une disponibilité encore plus grandes », a déclaré Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice-président des services infrastructurels, chez AWS. « Nous sommes impatients de bâtir une infrastructure de classe mondiale pour aider les organisations à réinventer la façon dont elles apportent des solutions aux clients et alimentent la croissance économique. » « Cet investissement majeur d’AWS démontre à nouveau que l’Alberta s’impose comme un acteur dominant de la technologie numérique et de l’innovation. Ce projet de centre de données de plusieurs milliards de dollars dans notre province souligne le travail réalisé par Invest Alberta pour créer des emplois et diversifier l’économie », a indiqué le Premier ministre de l’Alberta, Jason Kenney. « J’ai hâte de collaborer avec AWS sur ce projet et d’être le témoin du regain d’activité pour le secteur des technologies de l’information et des communications de l’Alberta. » Les Régions AWS sont composées de Zones de disponibilité qui placent l’infrastructure dans des emplacements géographiques séparés et distincts. Les Zones de disponibilité sont situées assez loin les unes des autres, de manière à soutenir la continuité des activités, tout en étant assez proches pour fournir une latence faible aux applications à grande disponibilité qui utilisent plusieurs Zones de disponibilité. Chaque Zone de disponibilité possède une alimentation, une sécurité physique et un refroidissement indépendants, tout en étant connectée via des réseaux redondants à ultra faible latence. Les clients d’AWS focalisés sur la disponibilité élevée peuvent concevoir leurs applications de façon à ce qu’elles fonctionnent dans de multiples Zones de disponibilité, afin d’atteindre une tolérance aux pannes encore plus faible. La Région AWS Canada West (Calgary) permettra aux clients ayant des préférences de résidence des données, de stocker leurs données au Canada en toute sécurité, tout en fournissant une latence encore plus réduite dans tout le pays, ainsi qu’une flexibilité accrue propice à l’exécution des applications dans plusieurs Régions. Dans l’ensemble, on estime qu’AWS investira plus de 17 milliards USD (21 milliards CAD) au Canada d’ici 2037, à travers la construction et l’exploitation de ses deux Régions infrastructurelles. Cet investissement dans des infrastructures AWS devrait augmenter le PIB du Canada de plus de 31 milliards USD (39 milliards CAD) environ sur la même période. Dans la Région AWS Canada West (Calgary) nouvellement annoncée, AWS prévoit d’investir plus de 3 milliards USD (4 milliards CAD) d’ici 2037, avec notamment des dépenses en capital pour la construction des centres de données, des dépenses opérationnelles pour les frais de services publics et d’installation courants, et des achats de biens et services auprès d’entreprises régionales. L’EIS estime également que la nouvelle Région AWS apportera des avantages économiques directs et indirects, tels que de nouveaux emplois et de nouvelles ventes pour la chaîne d’approvisionnement des centres de données et les secteurs connexes au Canada. Au total, on prévoit que l’investissement dans la nouvelle Région AWS Canada West (Calgary) crée plus de 950 nouveaux emplois équivalents plein temps (Full-Time Equivalent, FTE) au Canada. Les clients et les partenaires AWS accueillent la Région AWS Canada West (Calgary) Les clients canadiens rejoindront les millions de clients actifs qui utilisent AWS chaque mois dans plus de 190 pays à travers le monde. Les organisations canadiennes, parmi lesquelles Air Canada, Athabasca University, Benevity, BMO Financial Group, Canada Border Services Agency, D2L, Hootsuite, Humber College, Keyera, Neo Financial, NHL, Nutrien, lululemon athletica, Provincial Health Services Authority, Porter Airlines, Sun Life, Trimac Transportation, et Vancouver General Hospital choisissent AWS pour exécuter leurs charges de travail afin de favoriser les économies de coûts, accélérer l’innovation, et réduire le délai de mise sur le marché. Sun Life est une organisation internationale de services financiers, de premier plan, fournissant des solutions d’assurances vie, de santé et de gestion de patrimoine aux clients privés comme aux entreprises. « Grâce à notre transformation numérique, nous innovons constamment pour améliorer notre contribution auprès des clients, de sorte qu’ils bénéficient d’une sécurité financière à toutes les étapes de leur parcours, et d’un mode de vie plus sain », a déclaré Laura Money, vice-présidente exécutive et directrice de l’Information, chez Sun Life. « L’annonce d’aujourd’hui sur la mise en œuvre d’une deuxième Région AWS au Canada, nous permet d’envisager une résilience commerciale renforcée pour mieux soutenir nos clients ayant besoin de conserver leurs données au Canada. » L’Office des services de santé provinciaux (Provincial Health Services Authority, PHSA) est la colonne vertébrale du système de santé de Colombie-Britannique, garantissant que 5 millions d’habitants aient accès à un réseau de services et de programmes de santé, spécialisés. Lorsque la pandémie de COVID-19 a frappé, le PHSA a fourni les résultats de test et géré les réservations de vaccination contre la COVID-19. « Grâce à Amazon Pinpoint, le PHSA a pu envoyer des millions de SMS et d’e-mails confirmant les inscriptions, les avis de réservation, et les rappels de rendez-vous de vaccination aux Britanno-Colombiens », a expliqué Shannon Malovec, directrice de l’Innovation numérique, au PHSA. « AWS nous a permis de faire évoluer rapidement les communications à grande échelle. La valeur ajoutée que confère l’utilisation des technologies d’avant-garde au service de nos citoyens ne fait aucun doute à nos yeux, et cette nouvelle Région AWS au Canada occidental nous aidera, ainsi que de nombreuses autres organisations, à stimuler l’innovation. » Kidoodle.TV est un service de diffusion vidéo destiné aux enfants et basé à Calgary, enregistrant plus de 100 millions de téléchargements dans 235 pays et territoires du monde entier. « J’utilise AWS dans le secteur des médias et des divertissements depuis si longtemps que je ne pourrais pas imaginer devoir m’en passer. Il fait partie intégrante de notre capacité à publier de nouvelles fonctionnalités et de nouveaux produits rapidement », a déclaré Daniel Riddell, directeur de la Technologie, chez Kidoodle.TV. « Comme AWS Cloud existait déjà lorsque nous avons lancé cette entreprise, nous avons pu tout bâtir en dehors des locaux, évitant ainsi des frais généraux considérables. Nous avons pu élaborer une architecture de service du même ordre, pour l’essentiel, que celles déployées par les entreprises pesant plusieurs milliards de dollars. Lorsque la COVID a frappé, nos chiffres ont explosé. Nous avons mis à profit l’AWS Elemental MediaTailor et d’autres services AWS pour développer à grande échelle notre vivier d’utilisateurs mensuels actifs, en hausse de 3 200 % en seulement un an, et faire basculer rapidement notre processus de diffusion publicitaire. » Athabasca University (AU), l’université en ligne, du Canada, est l’un des établissements d’enseignement en ligne et ouvert, à la croissance la plus rapide au monde, desservant plus de 43 000 étudiants dans 87 pays. AU est devenue le premier établissement post-secondaire canadien à déplacer toute son infrastructure opérationnelle numérique vers AWS l’an dernier. « J’aime dire qu’“il n’y a pas d’innovation à grande échelle sans une solide fondation”. Le transfert d’AU vers l’AWS en 2020 a établi la fondation de notre stratégie de transformation numérique, fournissant l’infrastructure et les économies de coûts qui nous permettent de faire de l’apprentissage personnalisé pour nos étudiants une réalité extensible à l’infini », a commenté Jennifer Schaeffer, vice-présidente des Technologies de l’information, et directrice de l’Information, d’AU. « Non seulement nous avons transformé notre fondation numérique, mais nous avons également placé le cloud à l’avant-poste de notre programme éducatif. Nous aidons à former la prochaine génération de professionnels du cloud, grâce aux programmes AU PowerEDTM et AWS Academy Cloud Foundations. » En tant que l’une des principales entreprises intermédiaires indépendantes, du Canada, Keyera exploite une entreprise d’infrastructure énergétique intégrée avec de vastes actifs interconnectés. Keyera joue un rôle crucial dans le traitement, le transport et la commercialisation du gaz naturel et des liquides de gaz naturel sans résidus, qui alimentent de façon responsable la vie moderne dans toute l’Amérique du Nord. « Parmi les moyens mis en œuvre pour fournir une énergie durable et responsable figure la collaboration avec un partenaire fiable, spécialisé dans l’innovation technologique. Nous estimons que l’innovation technologique est indispensable pour fournir à nos clients une précision et une fiabilité accrues. En travaillant avec AWS, nous avons développé une nouvelle application d’apprentissage automatique, qui identifie de façon proactive les problèmes au niveau des compteurs, ce qui nous permet de répondre et intervenir en seulement quelques jours, et non plus sous plusieurs semaines. À ce jour, nous avons observé des améliorations considérables du comptage pour Keyera et nos clients, des résultats qui nous invitent à étendre son déploiement à deux installations supplémentaires », a déclaré Kelly Hill, vice-présidente des Technologies de l’information, chez Keyera. « La collaboration avec AWS signifie que nous avons bâti une plateforme d’innovation numérique pour nos besoins actuels et futurs. AWS Professional Services nous aide à transformer notre activité numérique à travers des applications et des services inédits tels qu’Amazon Rekognition pour le suivi des actifs à l’aide de la vision informatique, et d’autres services comme Amazon SageMaker et Amazon QuickSight pour l’intelligence commerciale et les tableaux de bord, dans le cadre de notre initiative de mesures. Nous sommes ravis à l’idée de poursuivre notre collaboration avec AWS pour faire progresser notre parcours d’innovation. » Née d’AWS, Neo Financial est une start-up des technologies financières qui met à contribution la souplesse d’AWS Cloud pour faire évoluer l’envergure de son activité. « Lorsque nous nous sommes lancés en 2019, nous avions besoin d’un fournisseur de cloud pour nous aider à évoluer à grande échelle et répondre aux exigences réglementaires auxquelles nous sommes confrontés en tant qu’entreprise de services financiers. Nos clients ont également des obligations de conformité qui leur imposent de conserver leurs données au Canada », a déclaré Kris Read, cofondateur et directeur technologique, chez Neo Financial. « Aujourd’hui, nous utilisons Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud pour notre infrastructure fondamentale, et Amazon Simple Storage Service pour son stockage extrêmement durable. Nous avons également amélioré la sécurité grâce à Amazon GuardDuty, et optimisé notre performance, en utilisant Amazon CloudFront, pour le bénéfice de nos clients. » Les partenaires basés au Canada font partie du Réseau de partenaires AWS (AWS Partner Network, APN), qui comprend 100 000 éditeurs de logiciels indépendants (Independent Software Vendors, ISV) et intégrateurs systèmes (Systems Integrators, SI), à travers le monde.

Xerris Inc., un Partenaire AWS avancé, basé à Calgary, en Alberta, se spécialise dans la fourniture de solutions axées sur la technologie, pour les entreprises des médias et du divertissement, de l’énergie, du secteur public, et de la vente au détail. « Nous travaillons avec AWS depuis plusieurs années, et en 2020, nous avons vraiment intensifié nos opérations, en passant d’une équipe de huit personnes à plus de 100 collaborateurs », a déclaré Jeremy Tooley, PDG de Xerris. « Nous avons aidé plusieurs clients dans la région de Calgary, dont StellarAlgo, en lui permettant de faire évoluer à grande échelle et d’optimiser ses solutions de données ; la société a pu ainsi utiliser les modèles d’apprentissage automatique afin d’obtenir des informations précieuses sur le comportement et la rétention des fans lors des événements sportifs et de divertissement en direct. Nous collaborons également avec Nutrien, Burnco, enerPlus, et Aldo sur diverses initiatives de transformation et projets fondamentaux. L’AWS Cloud propose un vaste éventail de services qui aident nos clients à fonctionner avec agilité et à évoluer. Nous nous réjouissons de la croissance continue et des investissements qu’AWS réalise au Canada. » Slalom, un cabinet de conseil, mondial axé sur la stratégie, la technologie, et la transformation commerciale, comptant plus de 11 000 employés sur 41 marchés à travers le monde, a l’autonomie requise pour se déplacer rapidement et élaborer des solutions pour ses clients. « Slalom et AWS ont collaboré sur 1 500 projets jusqu’à leur terme, portant sur la migration, la modernisation, l’analyse des données, et les stratégies d’ensemble du cloud, ce qui a conduit Slalom à investir et développer ses opérations à travers la Région AWS Canada (Central) à partir de 2016 », a déclaré Wayne Ingram, directeur général pour le pays, de Slalom Canada. « À la faveur de ce partenariat, Slalom Canada a développé ses équipes sur les cinq dernières années, jusqu’à compter plus de 750 employés dont 150 au Canada occidental entre Vancouver et Calgary. Avec les clients canadiens tels que LoyaltyOne, TC Energy, et bien d’autres, nous sommes particulièrement impatients de constater l’intérêt et le besoin croissants de stratégies cloud, et la dynamique d’innovations attendue dans ce pays. » Investir dans l’avenir du Canada En plus de la Région AWS Canada (Central) à Montréal, AWS a lancé cinq sites périphériques Amazon CloudFront à Vancouver, Toronto, et Montréal. Amazon CloudFront est un réseau de diffusion de contenu (Content Delivery Network, CDN) hautement sécurisé et programmable qui accélère la fourniture de données, de vidéos, d’applications et d’API, pour les utilisateurs du monde entier, avec une faible latence et des vitesses de transfert élevées. Amazon a ouvert des pôles technologiques à Toronto et Vancouver pour les développeurs, les ingénieurs, les professionnels des ventes, du marketing, et du développement commercial, afin d’aider les clients et les partenaires locaux ; auxquels s’ajoute le nouveau bureau AWS Thinkbox à Winnipeg, axé sur le développement de solutions et services pour l’industrie créative. En mars 2021, Amazon Games a lancé un nouveau studio de développement à Montréal, et Amazon compte aujourd’hui 17 centres d’exécution, six centres de tri, et 35 stations de livraison dans tout le pays. Amazon emploie plus de 39 500 employés à temps plein et à temps partiel, et la Société a annoncé des plans d’embauche visant à créer des milliers d’emplois supplémentaires dans le pays, sur l’ensemble de son réseau et ses équipes d’opérations, notamment AWS, Amazon Ads, Amazon Games, Alexa, et Prime Video. Améliorer les compétences de la main-d’œuvre au Canada AWS continue également d’investir dans l’amélioration des compétences des développeurs, des étudiants et de la prochaine génération de cadres informatiques au Canada, grâce à des programmes comme AWS re/Start, AWS Academy et AWS Educate, et depuis 2013, a aidé à former plus de 100 000 personnes aux compétences infonuagiques. Ces Programmes d’Enseignement AWS aident les apprenants de tous horizons et expériences à se préparer pour des carrières axées sur le cloud. Qu’il s’agisse de cours universitaires, de programmes de formation à temps plein, ou de contenus d’apprentissage adaptés au rythme de l’apprenant, les Programmes d’Enseignement AWS offrent un accès aux compétences nécessaires pour démarrer une carrière dans l’infonuagique. Avec le soutien du programme Edge Up 2.0 de Calgary Economic Development, AWS et Mount Royal University se sont associés pour introduire le programme AWS re/Start à Calgary début 2022. Le programme de formation professionnelle AWS re/Start préparera les étudiants à occuper des postes de débutant dans l’infonuagique, et les mettra en relation avec des employeurs potentiels dans le cadre de l’engagement d’Amazon consistant à aider 29 millions de personnes dans le monde, à développer leurs compétences technologiques au moyen d’une formation gratuite à l’infonuagique d’ici 2025. Engagement en faveur du développement durable Amazon s’est engagée à gérer ses activités dans le respect de l’environnement, et à atteindre la neutralité carbone dans toutes ses opérations commerciales d’ici 2040, soit dix ans avant le délai fixé par l’Accord de Paris, dans le cadre de The Climate Pledge (l’Engagement Climat). Un élément clé de cet engagement est l’alimentation en électricité des infrastructures mondiales d’Amazon à partir de 100 % d’énergies renouvelables, et la société est désormais en bonne voie pour atteindre ce jalon d’ici 2025, soit avec cinq ans d’avance sur l’objectif initial fixé à 2030. Amazon est également devenue le plus grand acheteur mondial d’énergies renouvelables en 2020, atteignant 65 % d’énergies renouvelables dans l’ensemble de ses activités. En avril 2021, Amazon a annoncé sa première incursion dans les énergies renouvelables au Canada avec un projet solaire de 80 mégawatts (MW) dans le comté de Newell, en Alberta. Une fois terminé, le projet contribuera pour environ 195 000 mégawattheures (MWh) d’énergie renouvelable vers le réseau, soit suffisamment d’énergie pour alimenter plus de 18 000 foyers canadiens pendant un an. En juin 2021, Amazon a annoncé son deuxième projet d’énergie renouvelable au Canada, el le plus vaste : une ferme solaire de 375 MW à Vulcan, en Alberta. Lors de sa mise en exploitation l’an prochain, le projet portera la capacité d’Amazon au Canada, à plus de 1 million de mégawattheures (MWh), soit suffisamment pour alimenter plus de 100 000 foyers canadiens pendant un an. Ces projets contribueront à alimenter l’infrastructure mondiale d’Amazon.

(AWS), ein Amazon.com, Inc. Unternehmen (NASDAQ: AMZN), Pläne zur Eröffnung einer Infrastrukturregion in Alberta, Kanada, Ende des Jahres 2023/Anfang 2024 bekannt gegeben. Die neue Region AWS Canada West (Calgary) wird zu Beginn aus drei Verfügbarkeitszonen (Availability Zones, AZs) bestehen und die bestehende Region AWS Canada (Central) in Montreal ergänzen, die ebenfalls aus drei Verfügbarkeitszonen besteht. Weltweit verfügt AWS über 81 Verfügbarkeitszonen in 25 geografischen Regionen und plant die Einführung von 27 weiteren Verfügbarkeitszonen und neun weiteren AWS-Regionen in Australien, Kanada, Indien, Indonesien, Israel, Neuseeland, Spanien, der Schweiz und den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten. Die künftige AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region wird es noch mehr Entwicklern, Startups und Unternehmen sowie Behörden, Bildungseinrichtungen und gemeinnützigen Organisationen ermöglichen, ihre Anwendungen von Rechenzentren in Kanada aus auszuführen und Endbenutzer zu versorgen. AWS hat zudem eine Studie über die wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen (Economic Impact Study, EIS) veröffentlicht, in der davon ausgegangen wird, dass durch die Ausgaben des Unternehmens für den Bau und den Betrieb der neuen AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region und der bestehenden AWS Canada (Central) Region in Montreal bis zum Jahr 2037 insgesamt mehr als 5.000 neue Arbeitsplätze mit einer voraussichtlichen Investitionssumme von über 17 Mrd. USD (21 Mrd. CA$) in den lokalen Volkswirtschaften geschaffen werden. Beide Infrastrukturregionen werden im gleichen Zeitraum schätzungsweise 31,6 Milliarden USD (39 Milliarden CA$) zum BIP Kanadas beitragen. Weitere Informationen über die globale Infrastruktur von AWS finden Sie unter aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/. „Unsere Infrastruktur in Kanada hat unseren Kunden die Möglichkeit gegeben, die Art und Weise zu verändern, wie Unternehmen, Bildungseinrichtungen und Regierungsbehörden ihre Stakeholder bedienen. Mit einer zusätzlichen AWS-Region in Kanada werden Kunden noch geringere Latenzzeiten für künftige Lösungen wie 5G-fähige Anwendungen und maschinelles Lernen an der Edge erleben, und es wird ihre Möglichkeiten stärken, ihre regionale Infrastruktur für noch größere Fehlertoleranz, Ausfallsicherheit und Verfügbarkeit zu gestalten“, sagte Prasad Kalyanaraman, Vice President von Infrastructure Services bei AWS. „Wir freuen uns darauf, eine erstklassige Infrastruktur zu schaffen, um Unternehmen dabei zu unterstützen, die Art und Weise, wie sie Kundenlösungen bereitstellen und das Wirtschaftswachstum fördern, neu zu erfinden.“ „Diese Großinvestition von AWS zeigt erneut, dass Alberta sich als führender Akteur im Bereich der digitalen Technologie und Innovation etablieren wird. Dieses milliardenschwere Rechenzentrumsprojekt in unserer Provinz verdeutlicht die Arbeit, die Invest Alberta für die Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen und die Diversifizierung der Wirtschaft leistet“, sagte Albertas Premierminister Jason Kenney. „Ich freue mich auf die gemeinsame Arbeit mit AWS an diesem Projekt und darauf, zu sehen, wie es den IT- und Kommunikationssektor in Alberta stärken wird.“ AWS-Regionen setzen sich aus Verfügbarkeitszonen zusammen, die die Infrastruktur an getrennten und eigenständigen geografischen Standorten unterbringen. Die Verfügbarkeitszonen sind weit genug voneinander entfernt, um die Geschäftskontinuität der Kunden zu gewährleisten, aber nahe genug, um niedrige Latenzzeiten für Anwendungen mit hoher Verfügbarkeit zu bieten, die mehrere Verfügbarkeitszonen nutzen. Jede Verfügbarkeitszone verfügt über eine unabhängige Stromversorgung, Kühlung und physische Sicherheit. Die Zonen sind über redundante Netzwerke mit ultra-geringer Latenz miteinander verbunden. AWS-Kunden, für die hohe Verfügbarkeit oberste Priorität hat, können ihre Anwendungen entwickeln, um sie in verschiedenen Verfügbarkeitszonen zu betreiben und so eine noch größere Ausfallsicherheit zu erreichen. Die AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region versetzt Kunden mit Präferenzen für den Datenstandort in die Lage, Daten sicher in Kanada zu speichern, während sie eine noch geringere Latenz im ganzen Land und mehr Flexibilität für die Ausführung von über mehrere Regionen verteilten Anwendungen bietet. Insgesamt wird AWS bis zum Jahr 2037 schätzungsweise mehr als 17 Milliarden USD (21 Milliarden CA$) in Kanada in den Aufbau und Betrieb seiner beiden Infrastrukturregionen investieren. Es wird erwartet, dass diese AWS-Infrastrukturinvestitionen das kanadische Bruttoinlandsprodukt im entsprechenden Zeitraum um mehr als 31 Milliarden USD (39 Milliarden CA$) erhöhen werden. AWS plant, in der neu angekündigten AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region bis 2037 mehr als 3 Mrd. USD (4 Mrd. CA$) zu investieren. Dazu gehören Investitionsausgaben für den Bau von Rechenzentren, Betriebskosten wie laufende Versorgungs- und Anlagenkosten sowie der Kauf von Waren und Dienstleistungen von regionalen Unternehmen. Die EIS geht außerdem davon aus, dass die neue AWS-Region direkte und indirekte wirtschaftliche Vorteile wie neue Arbeitsplätze und Absatzmöglichkeiten für die Lieferkette im Bereich der Rechenzentren und die damit verbundenen Sektoren in Kanada bringen wird. Insgesamt werden durch die Investitionen in die neue AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region schätzungsweise mehr als 950 neue Arbeitsplätze auf Vollzeitbasis (full-time equivalent, FTE) in Kanada geschaffen. Kunden und AWS-Partner heißen die AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region willkommen Die Kunden in Kanada werden sich zu den Millionen aktiver Kunden gesellen, die AWS jeden Monat in über 190 Ländern der Welt nutzen. Kanadische Organisationen wie Air Canada, Athabasca University, Benevity, BMO Financial Group, Canada Border Services Agency, D2L, Hootsuite, Humber College, Keyera, Neo Financial, NHL, Nutrien, lululemon athletica, Provincial Health Services Authority, Porter Airlines, Sun Life, Trimac Transportation und Vancouver General Hospital vertrauen bei der Ausführung ihrer Workloads auf AWS, um Kosteneinsparungen zu erzielen, Innovationen voranzutreiben und die Markteinführung zu beschleunigen. Sun Life ist ein führendes internationales Unternehmen für Finanzdienstleistungen, das Privat- und Firmenkunden Lösungen für die Bereiche Leben, Gesundheit und Vermögen anbietet. „Durch unsere digitale Transformation sind wir ständig auf der Suche nach Innovationen, um unsere Kunden bei der Erreichung lebenslanger finanzieller Sicherheit und einem gesünderen Leben zu unterstützen“, sagte Laura Money, Executive Vice President und Chief Information Officer bei Sun Life. „Mit der heutigen Ankündigung einer zweiten AWS-Region in Kanada bieten wir unseren Kunden, die ihre Daten in Kanada speichern müssen, eine weitere Dimension der Ausfallsicherheit.“ Die Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) ist das Rückgrat des Gesundheitssystems von British Columbia und stellt sicher, dass 5 Millionen Einwohner Zugang zu einem Netzwerk aus spezialisierten Gesundheitsdienstleistungen und -programmen haben. Als die COVID-19-Pandemie ausgebrochen ist, hat die PHSA COVID-19-Testergebnisse bereitgestellt und Impfungen gebucht. „Mithilfe von Amazon Pinpoint hat PHSA Millionen von SMS und E-Mails mit Anmeldebestätigungen, Buchungsbenachrichtigungen und Erinnerungen an Impftermine an die Einwohner von British Columbia verschickt“, so Shannon Malovec, Chief Digital Innovation Officer bei PHSA. „AWS hat uns in die Lage versetzt, unsere Kommunikation in kürzester Zeit zu erweitern. Wir erkennen den Wert des Einsatzes der neuesten Technologie im Dienste unserer Bürger, und diese neue AWS-Region in Westkanada wird uns und vielen anderen Organisationen bei der Erschließung neuer Innovationen helfen.“ Kidoodle.TV ist ein in Calgary ansässiger Streaming-Dienst für Kinder mit mehr als 100 Millionen Downloads in 235 Ländern und Regionen weltweit. „Ich nutze AWS schon seit so langer Zeit in der Medien- und Unterhaltungsbranche, dass ich mir eine Welt ohne AWS nicht mehr vorstellen kann. AWS ist für uns unerlässlich, um neue Funktionen und Produkte so schnell wie möglich zu veröffentlichen“, sagt Daniel Riddell, Chief Technology Officer bei Kidoodle.TV. „Da die AWS-Cloud bereits existierte, als wir das Unternehmen gründeten, konnten wir alles vor Ort entwickeln. Wir waren nicht auf riesige Overhead-Kosten angewiesen. Wir konnten im Wesentlichen die gleiche Service-Architektur einrichten, die auch Multimilliarden-Dollar-Unternehmen einsetzen können. Als COVID einschlug, stiegen unsere Zahlen sprunghaft an. Mit AWS Elemental MediaTailor und anderen AWS-Services konnten wir unsere monatlich aktiven Nutzer innerhalb eines Jahres um 3.200 % vergrößern und unseren Prozess der Anzeigenschaltung rasch anpassen.“ Die Athabasca University (AU), die kanadische Online-Universität, ist eine der weltweit am schnellsten wachsenden Online- und freien Bildungseinrichtungen mit mehr als 43.000 Studenten in 87 Ländern. Die AU war die erste kanadische Hochschulinstitution, die im vergangenen Jahr ihre gesamte digitale Betriebsinfrastruktur auf AWS umgestellt hat. „Ich pflege zu sagen, dass es ohne ein solides Fundament keine skalierbare Innovation gibt. Die Umstellung der AU auf AWS im Jahr 2020 war die Grundlage unserer digitalen Transformationsstrategie. Dadurch wurden die Infrastruktur und die Kosteneinsparungen geschaffen, die es uns ermöglichen werden, personalisiertes Lernen für unsere Studenten zu einer unendlich skalierbaren Realität zu machen“, sagte Jennifer Schaeffer, AU Vice President von Information Technology und Chief Information Officer. „Wir stellen nicht nur unsere digitale Basis um, sondern rücken die Cloud auch in den Vordergrund unseres Lehrplans. Mit den Programmen AU PowerEDTM und AWS Academy Cloud Foundations tragen wir zur Ausbildung der nächsten Generation von Cloud-Experten bei.“ Als eines der größten unabhängigen kanadischen Midstream-Unternehmen betreibt Keyera ein integriertes Infrastrukturgeschäft für Energie mit zahlreichen miteinander verbundenen Anlagen. Keyera spielt eine wichtige Rolle bei der Verarbeitung, dem Transport und der Vermarktung von umweltfreundlichem Erdgas und Erdgasflüssigkeiten, die das moderne Leben in ganz Nordamerika auf verantwortungsbewusste Weise bereichern. „Ein Teil unserer nachhaltigen und verantwortungsbewussten Energieversorgung beruht auf der Zusammenarbeit mit einem starken Partner für technologische Innovationen. Wir sind uns der Notwendigkeit digitaler Innovationen bewusst, damit wir unseren Kunden eine höhere Genauigkeit und Zuverlässigkeit bieten können. In Zusammenarbeit mit AWS haben wir eine neue Anwendung für maschinelles Lernen entwickelt, die proaktiv Probleme bei der Verbrauchsmessung erkennt. Dies ermöglicht es uns, innerhalb von Tagen statt Wochen zu reagieren. Bis heute konnten wir erhebliche Verbesserungen bei der Messung für Keyera und unsere Kunden feststellen. Aufgrund dieses Erfolges erweitern wir den Einsatz auf zwei weitere Anlagen“, so Kelly Hill, Vice President von Information Technology bei Keyera. „Die Zusammenarbeit mit AWS ermöglicht uns den Aufbau einer digitalen Innovationsplattform für unsere aktuellen und zukünftigen Anforderungen. AWS Professional Services unterstützt uns bei der Transformation unserer digitalen Geschäfte durch neue Anwendungen und Services wie Amazon Rekognition für die Bestandsnachverfolgung mithilfe von Computer Vision und andere Services wie Amazon SageMaker und Amazon QuickSight für Geschäftsanalysen und Dashboarding in unserer Initiative für Messdaten. Wir freuen uns darauf, weiterhin mit AWS zu kooperieren, um unseren Innovationsprozess voranzutreiben.“ Neo Financial wurde mit AWS entwickelt und ist ein Finanztechnologie-Startup, das die Elastizität der AWS Cloud nutzt, um das Geschäft zu skalieren. „Als wir 2019 an den Start gingen, brauchten wir einen Cloud-Anbieter, der uns bei der Skalierung unterstützt und die regulatorischen Anforderungen erfüllt, die wir als Finanzdienstleistungsunternehmen erfüllen müssen. Unsere Kunden haben darüber hinaus Compliance-Vorgaben, die verlangen, dass ihre Daten in Kanada aufbewahrt werden“, so Kris Read, Mitbegründer und CTO bei Neo Financial. „Heute nutzen wir Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud für unsere zentrale Infrastruktur und Amazon Simple Storage Service für die hochgradig beständige Speicherung. Außerdem haben wir die Sicherheit mit Amazon GuardDuty und die Performance für unsere Kunden mit Amazon CloudFront verbessert.“ Die in Kanada ansässigen Partner sind Teil des AWS Partner Network (APN), zu dem über 100.000 unabhängige Softwareanbieter (Independent Software Vendors, ISVs) und Systemintegratoren (SIs) auf der ganzen Welt gehören. AWS-Partner entwickeln innovative Lösungen und Services auf AWS, und das APN bietet Kunden Unterstützung in den Bereichen Geschäftstätigkeit, Technik, Marketing und Markteinführung. APN SIs, Beratungspartner und ISVs helfen Kunden aus Unternehmen und dem öffentlichen Sektor bei der Migration zu AWS, stellen erfolgskritische Anwendungen bereit und bieten eine breite Palette an Überwachungs-, Automatisierungs- und Verwaltungsservices für Kundenumgebungen. Zu den „AWS Canada“-Partnern gehören Accenture, Bell Canada, Deloitte, FuseForward, FX Innovation, Levio, OpsGuru, Rackspace, Slalom, Softchoice, Qalius, Quantiphi und Xerris. AWS ISVs in Kanada, darunter Arctic Wolf, Benevity, CrowdStrike, D2L, Lightspeed POS, Salesforce, SmartSimple, Tidal Migrations, Vidyard und Workday, nutzen AWS bereits zur Bereitstellung ihrer Software für Kunden auf der ganzen Welt und beabsichtigen, ihre kanadischen Kunden beim Start von der AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region aus zu bedienen. Eine vollständige Liste der APN-Mitglieder ist unter aws.amazon.com/partners verfügbar. Xerris Inc. ist ein fortschrittlicher AWS-Partner mit Sitz in Calgary, Alberta, der sich auf die Bereitstellung von technologieorientierten Lösungen für Unternehmen in den Bereichen Medien und Unterhaltung, Energie, Behörden und Einzelhandel spezialisiert hat. „Wir haben mehrere Jahre lang mit AWS zusammengearbeitet, und im Jahr 2020 haben wir unseren Geschäftsbetrieb stark ausgeweitet – von einem achtköpfigen Team auf weit über 100 Mitarbeiter“, sagte Jeremy Tooley, CEO von Xerris. „Wir haben Kunden im Raum Calgary wie StellarAlgo dabei geholfen, ihre Datenlösungen zu skalieren und zu optimieren, damit sie mit Hilfe von Modellen des maschinellen Lernens wertvolle Erkenntnisse über das Fanverhalten und die Fanbindung bei Live-Sport- und Unterhaltungsveranstaltungen gewinnen können. Wir arbeiten außerdem mit Nutrien, Burnco, enerPlus und Aldo an einer Reihe von Transformations- und Gründungsprojekten. Die AWS-Cloud bietet eine breite Palette von Services, die unseren Kunden helfen, agil und skalierbar zu agieren. Wir freuen uns über das anhaltende Wachstum und die Investitionen, die AWS in Kanada tätigt.“ Slalom, ein globales Beratungshaus mit Schwerpunkt auf Strategie, Technologie und Geschäftstransformation mit mehr als 11.000 Mitarbeitern in 41 Märkten auf der ganzen Welt, verfügt über die nötige Autonomie, um schnell zu handeln und für seine Kunden zu entwickeln. „Slalom und AWS haben gemeinsam mehr als 1.500 Projekte in den Bereichen Migration, Modernisierung, Datenanalyse und allgemeine Cloud-Strategien durchgeführt. Dies hat dazu geführt, dass Slalom seit 2016 in die AWS Canada (Central) Region investiert und den Betrieb ausgebaut hat“, so Wayne Ingram, Country General Manager von Slalom Canada. „Aufgrund dieser Partnerschaft ist Slalom Canada in den letzten fünf Jahren auf mehr als 750 Mitarbeiter angewachsen, davon 150 in Westkanada in Vancouver und Calgary. Mit kanadischen Kunden wie LoyaltyOne, TC Energy und vielen anderen freuen wir uns besonders über das wachsende Interesse und den Bedarf an Cloud-Strategien und freuen uns auf noch mehr Innovation in diesem Land.“ Investitionen in die Zukunft Kanadas Zusätzlich zur AWS Canada (Central) Region in Montreal hat AWS fünf Amazon CloudFront-Edge-Standorte in Vancouver, Toronto und Montreal eröffnet. Amazon CloudFront ist ein extrem sicheres und programmierbares Content Delivery Network (CDN), das die Bereitstellung von Daten, Videos, Anwendungen und APIs für Benutzer weltweit mit geringer Latenz und hohen Übertragungsgeschwindigkeiten erheblich beschleunigt. Amazon eröffnete in Toronto und Vancouver Technologiezentren für Entwickler, Ingenieure, Vertriebs-, Marketing- und Geschäftsentwicklungsexperten mit dem Ziel, lokale Kunden und Partner zu unterstützen. In Winnipeg wurde zudem das AWS Thinkbox-Büro eröffnet, das sich auf die Entwicklung von Lösungen und Dienstleistungen für die Kreativbranche konzentriert. Im März 2021 eröffnete Amazon Games ein neues Entwicklerstudio in Montreal, und Amazon verfügt derzeit über 17 Auslieferungszentren, sechs Sortierzentren und 35 Lieferstationen im ganzen Land. Amazon beschäftigt mehr als 39.500 Vollzeit- und Teilzeitmitarbeiter, und das Unternehmen plant die Schaffung Tausender zusätzlicher Arbeitsplätze im Land in seinem Betriebsnetzwerk und in Teams wie AWS, Amazon Ads, Amazon Games, Alexa und Prime Video. Höhere Qualifikation der kanadischen Belegschaft AWS investiert weiterhin in die Qualifizierung von Entwicklern, Studenten und der nächsten Generation von IT-Führungskräften in Kanada – durch Programme wie AWS re/Start, AWS Academy und AWS Educate. Seit 2013 hat AWS mehr als 100.000 Personen geholfen, ihre Cloud-Computing-Fähigkeiten zu verbessern. Diese AWS Bildungsprogramme bereiten Lernende aller Hintergründe und Erfahrungen auf eine Karriere in der Cloud vor. Von Hochschulkursen über Vollzeit-Schulungsangebote bis hin zu Lerninhalten zum Selbststudium bieten die AWS-Bildungsprogramme einen Zugang zu den Fähigkeiten, die für den Einstieg in eine Cloud-Computing-Karriere erforderlich sind. Mit Unterstützung des Programms Edge Up 2.0 von Calgary Economic Development haben sich AWS und die Mount Royal University zusammengeschlossen, um Anfang 2022 das AWS re/Start-Programm nach Calgary zu übertragen. Das AWS re/Start-Jobtrainingsprogramm wird die Teilnehmer auf Einstiegspositionen im Bereich Cloud Computing vorbereiten und sie mit potenziellen Arbeitgebern in Kontakt bringen. Dies ist Teil der Verpflichtung von Amazon, bis 2025 29 Millionen Menschen auf der ganzen Welt dabei zu helfen, ihre technischen Kompetenzen durch kostenlose Cloud-Computing-Schulungen zu erweitern. Einsatz für Nachhaltigkeit Amazon hat sich verpflichtet, seine Geschäfte auf umweltverträgliche Weise zu tätigen, und hat sich im Rahmen von The Climate Pledge dazu verpflichtet, bis zum Jahr 2040, also 10 Jahre vor dem Übereinkommen von Paris, eine CO2-neutrale Geschäftstätigkeit zu erreichen. Ein zentraler Aspekt dieser Verpflichtung ist es, Amazons globale Infrastruktur zu 100 % mit erneuerbarer Energie zu versorgen, und das Unternehmen ist nun auf dem Weg, diesen Meilenstein bis 2025 zu erreichen, fünf Jahre vor dem ursprünglichen Ziel für 2030. Amazon wurde 2020 auch der größte Unternehmenskäufer erneuerbarer Energien der Welt und erreichte in all seinen Geschäften einen Anteil erneuerbarer Energien von 65 %. Im April 2021 kündigte Amazon sein erstes Projekt im Bereich erneuerbare Energien in Kanada an – ein 80-Megawatt (MW)-Solarprojekt in der Grafschaft Newell in Alberta. Nach Abschluss des Projekts werden schätzungsweise 195.000 Megawattstunden (MWh) erneuerbare Energie in das Netz eingespeist. Das ist genug Energie, um mehr als 18.000 kanadische Haushalte ein Jahr lang zu versorgen. Im Juni 2021 kündigte Amazon sein zweites und größtes Projekt im Bereich erneuerbare Energien in Kanada an – einen 375-MW-Solarpark in Vulcan, Alberta. Sobald das Projekt im nächsten Jahr ans Netz geht, wird die Kapazität von Amazon in Kanada auf mehr als 1 Million MWhs anwachsen. Das ist genug, um mehr als 100.000 kanadische Haushalte ein Jahr lang mit Strom zu versorgen. Diese Projekte werden dazu beitragen, die globale Amazon-Infrastruktur mit Strom zu versorgen.
