    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon has continued to expand its legal efforts to shut down fake review brokers, filing its first criminal complaint in Italy and its first lawsuit in Spain. These two legal proceedings, plus 10 other new lawsuits recently launched in the U.S., target bad actors that operate more than 11,000 websites and social media groups that attempt to orchestrate fake reviews on Amazon and other stores in exchange for money or free products. “Holding bad actors accountable through litigation and criminal referrals is one of many important ways that we protect customers so they can shop with confidence,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon’s Vice President of Selling Partner Services. “In addition to continuing to advance our robust detection and prevention of fake reviews in our store, Amazon will remain relentless in identifying and enforcing against bad actors that attempt to engage in review abuse. There is no place for fake reviews on Amazon or anywhere else in the industry.” Amazon’s first criminal complaint in Europe targets a high-profile broker in Italy selling fake reviews. The defendant claims to have built a network of individuals who are willing to buy products on Amazon and post 5-star reviews in exchange for a full refund. Amazon’s decision to seek criminal proceedings in this case signals the company’s determination to stop bad actors who profit by misleading customers and selling partners. Individuals convicted of this type of crime in Italy may be subject to imprisonment and fines. Amazon also filed its first civil complaint in Spain against the fake review broker, Agencia Reviews. The Spanish-based operator targets sellers and customers of www.amazon.es and communicates via the instant messaging service Telegram to evade detection. According to Amazon’s investigations, the suspected fraudster fully reimburses customers once they publish a fake 5-star review. In addition to these unprecedented lawsuits in Europe, Amazon added to its growing cases in the U.S. by filing 10 more lawsuits1 against fake review brokers and other bad actors attempting to game Amazon’s ratings systems. Amazon also sent warning letters to five websites based in Germany that were directing visitors to a fake review broker. All five websites have since agreed to stop this activity by signing a cease and desist letter. Amazon has devoted significant resources to investigating and bringing legal actions against fake review brokers to stop them from orchestrating fake reviews in its store. A dedicated global team of expert investigators, lawyers, analysts, and other specialists track down fake review brokers, piece together evidence about how they operate, and take legal action against them. These legal actions are intended to uncover the perpetrators and stop the fraud where it starts. However, continued collaboration and investment across the industry is critical to stopping fake reviews for good. Amazon has continued to seek assistance and support from other industry players as well as government agencies, regulatory bodies, and law enforcement to improve detection and increase enforcement action against fake review brokers. “Amazon will continue to devote significant resources to fighting fake reviews and ensuring customers have a trustworthy shopping experience,” added Mehta. “We continue to improve our proactive controls, invent new technologies and machine learning to detect bad actors, and find new ways to hold them accountable.” 1 Accfarm, Amazon Bulk Reviews, Amzonreview.com, Auction Sentinel, Bestsoft.website, Buyreviewservice.com, Buytrustpilot.com, Cash Back Base, Climbazon, Iblmarket.com, Seosmmseller.com, Seosmmworld.com, Seozillow.com, Smmseomarket.com, Smmtopreviews.com, TahoeVine, Usarealshop.com, Usaseoshop.com, Usatopsmm.com, Virtual Experts, Worldtopseo.com",

    "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/aws-20221021.jpg",
    "site": "businesswire.com",
    "text": "シアトル--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- アマゾン・ドット・コム（NASDAQ：AMZN）傘下のアマゾン ウェブ サービス（AWS）は本日、タイにインフラストラクチャリージョンを開設する計画を発表しました。この新しいAWSアジアパシフィック（バンコク）リージョンは、3つのアベイラビリティーゾーン（AZ）で構成され、27の地理的AWSリージョンにある既存の87のアベイラビリティーゾーンに加わります。世界規模では、AWSは現在、オーストラリア、カナダ、インド、イスラエル、ニュージーランド、スペイン、スイス、タイで、さらに24カ所のアベイラビリティーゾーンと8カ所のAWSリージョンを追加する計画を発表しています。近く設けられるタイのAWSリージョンにより、開発者、スタートアップ企業、大企業、ならびに政府機関、教育団体、非営利団体が、タイにあるデータセンターからアプリケーションを実行し、エンドユーザーにサービスを提供することが可能になります。これにより、タイ内にデータを維持したいお客さまは、それが可能になります。さらに、この地域へのコミットメントの一環として、AWSは15年間でタイに推定50億ドル（1900億バーツ）以上の投資を行う予定です。AWSグローバル・インフラストラクチャーの詳細情報については、aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructureをご覧ください。 AWSのインフラストラクチャー・サービス担当バイスプレジデントのプラサド・カリャナラマンは、次のように述べています。「私たちは、現地でのインフラストラクチャー投資と速いペースでの革新を通じてタイのデジタル変革を支援し、タイの顧客がクラウドの可能性を最大限に引き出して、企業や機関がステークホルダーにサービスを提供する方法を変革できるよう注力しています。AWSアジアパシフィック（バンコク）リージョンは、組織が人工知能や機械学習、データ分析、モノのインターネットといったAWS技術を使用した構築を行うことを可能にします。これらの新しいツールにより、AWSは、政府が市民とより密接に関わり、企業が次の成長のために革新し、起業家がビジネスを構築して世界規模で競争できるよう力を与えます。」 タイの副首相兼エネルギー大臣のスパッタナポン・ファンメカオ閣下は、次のように述べています。「AWSのタイにおけるデータセンター建設計画は、より多くの組織に先進的なクラウドコンピューティングサービスを提供し、デジタル化された価値ベースの経済を実現するというタイランド4.0の目標を実現するための重要な節目となります。タイ王国政府は、世界有数のクラウドサービスプロバイダーであるAWSと協力し、安全性と耐障害性に優れた世界クラスのクラウドインフラストラクチャーをタイに導入できることをうれしく思っています。AWSの投資は、国の競争力を高め、長期的に大きな経済的利益を生み出し、高度なスキルを持つ労働力の構築に貢献するでしょう。」 タイ王国デジタル経済社会（MDES）大臣のチャイウット・タナカマヌソーン閣下は、次のように述べています。「タイにおけるAWSリージョンは、企業や政府機関が今後数十年にわたって国民に利益をもたらす優れたデジタルサービスを提供するために役立ちます。MDESとAWSは、レガシー・インフラストラクチャーの近代化と運用の改善によって政府のデジタル変革を支援すべく、協力してきました。AWSの投資により、タイのデジタルの未来に一歩近づくことができるでしょう。」 タイ投資委員会事務局長のナリット・テートサティーラサック氏は、次のように述べています。「クラウドサービスは、デジタル経済の最も重要な推進力の一つです。私たちは、AWSがタイにリージョンを構築する計画を歓迎します。これは、アジアにおける革新のハブとして、またトップレベルの投資先としてのタイの地位を前進させることになるでしょう。AWSアジアパシフィック（バンコク）リージョンは、タイの国際競争力を高めると同時に、タイのあらゆる産業における革新と経済生産性を促進することになるでしょう。」 AWSリージョンはアベイラビリティーゾーンで構成されています。アベイラビリティーゾーンは、明確に異なる地域にインフラストラクチャーを配置するもので、距離が十分に離れているため、単一事象が顧客の事業継続に影響するリスクを大きく減らすことができます。逆に、複数のアベイラビリティーゾーンを使用する高可用性アプリケーションで低遅延を実現できる程度に近接して設けられています。各アベイラビリティーゾーンは独立した電源、冷却装置、物理的セキュリティーを備え、冗長な超低遅延ネットワークで接続されています。高可用性を重視するAWSのお客さまは、複数のアベイラビリティーゾーンで複数地域にわたってアプリケーションを実行することで耐障害性がさらに高まるように設計することも可能です。 新しいAWSアジアパシフィック（バンコク）リージョンにより、データレジデンシーの希望や要件を持つ現地顧客は、タイにデータを安全に保管することが可能になるとともに、国内全体でさらなる低遅延を実現できます。スタートアップ企業から大企業、政府機関、非営利団体まで、さまざまなお客さまが世界をリードするクラウドの先進技術を利用して、イノベーションを推進することが可能になります。AWSは、分析、演算、データベース、モノのインターネット（IoT）、機械学習、モバイル・サービス、ストレージ、その他のクラウド技術など、最も幅広く最も厚みのあるサービス・ポートフォリオを提供しています。 タイの組織は、世界190カ国以上でAWSを利用している数百万のアクティブ顧客の一部です。革新の加速、俊敏性の向上、コスト削減を実現すべくワークロードの実行にAWSを選択しているタイの組織には、2C2P、CP All Plc.、デジタル経済推進庁、Energy Response（ENRES）、Papyrus Studio、PTTグローバル、PTTオイル・アンド・リテール・ビジネス、サイアム・セメント・グループ、スコータイ・タマティラート・オープン大学、タイ証券取引所などの企業があります。これらのタイの組織がAWSサービスを利用してどのようにビジネスを変革しているかを示す使用例については、次のサイトをご覧ください：press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aws-launch-infrastructure-region-thailand タイのパートナーは、AWSパートナー・ネットワーク（APN）の一員です。これには、世界各地の10万社以上の独立系ソフトウェア・ベンダー（ISV）とシステム・インテグレーター（SI）が含まれます。AWSパートナーは、AWS上で革新的なソリューションとサービスを構築しており、APNは、事業面、技術面、マーケティング面、商品化面のサポートを顧客に提供しています。APNのSI、コンサルティング・パートナー、ISVは、企業や公共機関の顧客のAWSへの移行や基幹業務用アプリケーションの導入を支援し、顧客の環境の監視、自動化、管理サービスを全面的に提供しています。AWSタイのパートナーには、DailiTech、G-Able、National Telecom、NTTタイランド、True IDCが挙げられます。2C2PやAmityを含むタイのAWS ISVは、すでにAWSを利用してソフトウェアを世界各地の顧客に提供しており、AWSアジアパシフィック（バンコク）リージョンでは立ち上げ時からタイの顧客にサービスを提供します。APNメンバーの全リストについてはaws.amazon.com/partnersをご覧ください。また、DailiTech、National Telecom、NTTタイランドの使用例については、press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aws-launch-infrastructure-region-thailandをご覧ください。 タイにおけるAWSの投資 今度のAWSアジアパシフィック（バンコク）リージョンは、AWSのタイにおける進行中の投資の中で最新のものであり、顧客に先進的で安全なクラウド技術を提供します。2020年以降、AWSはバンコクで10カ所のAmazon CloudFrontエッジロケーションを立ち上げています。Amazon CloudFrontは、セキュリティーの高いプログラム可能なコンテンツ・デリバリー・ネットワーク（CDN）であり、データ、映像、アプリケーション、APIを世界中のユーザーに低遅延かつ高速に配信します。2020年、AWSはタイでAWS Outpostsを開始しました。AWS Outpostsは、AWSのインフラストラクチャーとサービスを事実上あらゆるオンプレミスまたはエッジロケーションに提供して真に一貫したハイブリッド体験を実現するフルマネージド・ソリューションのファミリーです。 AWSは、近く設けられるバンコクのAWSローカルゾーンにより、タイへの投資を深めていく予定です。AWSローカルゾーンは、AWSインフラストラクチャーの展開の一種で、コンピューティング、ストレージ、データベース、その他の厳選されたサービスを、大規模な人口、産業、ITセンターの近くに配置し、顧客がエンドユーザーに対して、1桁ミリ秒の遅延を必要とするアプリケーションを提供できるようにするものです。 タイにおけるクラウド導入の成長をサポートすべく、AWSは、地元のデベロッパー、学生、タイの次世代のITリーダーのスキルをAWS re/Start、AWS Academy、AWS Educateといったプログラムを通じて高めることに継続的に投資しています。このようなAWS教育プログラムにより、あらゆる経歴や経験を有する学習者がクラウド分野でのキャリアの準備をすることができます。大学の講座からフルタイムのトレーニング・プログラムやマイペース学習用コンテンツまで、AWS教育プログラムは、個人がクラウド分野のキャリアを開始したり発展させたりする上で役立つスキル・トレーニングを提供しています。バンコク、チェンライ、パトゥムタニにあるタイの8つの高等教育機関は、AWS Academyのコースをカリキュラムに組み込んでいます。また、AWSはサイアム・セメント・グループのような組織と直接連携し、需要の高いクラウドスキルの構築や従業員の教育を支援しています。AWSは、タイのデジタル経済社会省とスキリング計画について協力し、クラウドスキル、オンデマンド・デジタル・コース、促進トレーニング・イベントで1200人以上の従業員を訓練するためのサポートを提供する予定です。これにより、政府職員は、クラウド技術の大規模な導入、データに基づいたより良いビジネス上の意思決定、市民のための成果向上を推進する新しいサービスの革新に必要なスキルを身に付けることができます。 タイで起業家精神を継続的に育成するため、AWSは、AWS Activateプログラムにより、早期段階のスタートアップ企業に支援を提供しています。このプログラムは、ガイダンスやAWSエキスパートとの1対1の対話、技術サポート、ビジネス・メンターシップ、そして最大10万ドルのAWSサービスクレジットの利用機会を、すべて無償で提供しています。AWSはまた、新興企業のクラウドでの成長を助けるために、ベンチャー・キャピタル・コミュニティー、新興企業アクセラレーター、インキュベーターとの共同活動を行っています。タイにおいては、AIS The StartupやStormbreakerなどのアクセラレーター組織がこれにあたり、それぞれのポートフォリオ企業が急速に成長できるよう支援しています。 2021年、AWSはStartup RampプログラムをASEANに拡大しました。このプログラムは、早期段階のスタートアップ起業家が、健康、デジタル政府、スマートシティー、農業、宇宙技術におけるソリューションを構築し、立ち上げ、成長する支援を行うことを目的としています。AWS Startup Rampは、複雑な規制やセキュリティー要件を乗り越えるために、技術設計やアーキテクチャーのレビュー、メンターシップ、クレジット、市場参入計画のサポートなどを提供し、公共部門にインパクトを与えたいと考える起業家の障壁を取り除くために活動しています。製品と市場の適合性の発見と最初の顧客との出会いに取り組む最早期段階のスタートアップ企業は、Startup Ramp Innovatorsに応募することができます。成長・規模拡大を目指す有料顧客を持つスタートアップ企業は、Startup Ramp Innovatorsに応募することによって、プログラムの特典を利用できます。 2017年以来、AWS教育技術スタートアップ・アクセラレーターであるAWS EdStartは、起業家による次世代のオンライン学習、分析、キャンパス管理ソリューションの構築を支援してきました。タイのAWS EdStartメンバーには、Gantik、OpenDurian、Vonderが含まれます。これらのメンバーは、AWS EdStartを利用することで、学生が教育課程において十分な情報を得た上で意思決定できるよう支援し、国内の初等・中等学校に体験学習の機会を提供し、学生・起業家間のバーチャルメンタリングを実現する革新的なソリューションを構築しています。 持続可能性への取組み アマゾンは、クライメート・プレッジの一環として、より持続可能な企業になり、パリ協定よりも10年早い2040年までに事業全体で炭素ネットゼロを達成することに取り組んでいます。アマゾンは2019年にクライメート・プレッジを共同で立ち上げ、その最初の署名者になりました。クライメート・プレッジの取組みの一環として、アマゾンは、当初の2030年の目標よりも5年早い2025年までに、100%再生可能エネルギーでの事業運営を実現しようとしています。アマゾンは、世界最大の再生可能エネルギーの購入企業であり、2021年末時点で、事業全体で再生可能エネルギー比率85%を達成しました。アマゾンのアプローチの詳細については、当社が公開している手法をご覧ください。コンピューティング・ワークロードをAWSクラウドに移行する組織は、カーボン・フットプリントを削減するアマゾンの持続可能性への取り組みによる正味の効果を得ることができます。 アマゾン ウェブ サービスについて アマゾン ウェブ サービスは15年以上にわたり、世界で最も包括的で広く導入されているクラウド・サービスとなってきました。AWSは、事実上すべてのクラウド・ワークロードをサポートするためにサービスを継続的に拡大しており、現在、演算、保存、データベース、ネットワーキング、アナリティクス、機械学習、人工知能（AI）、モノのインターネット（IoT）、モバイル、セキュリティー、ハイブリッド、仮想現実と拡張現実（VR、AR）、メディア、アプリケーション開発、導入、管理のための200件を超えるフル機能のサービスを27カ所の地域にある87カ所のアベイラビリティーゾーンから提供しています。また、オーストラリア、カナダ、インド、イスラエル、ニュージーランド、スペイン、スイス、タイでさらに24カ所のアベイラビリティーゾーンと8カ所のAWSリージョンの計画が発表されています。最も急成長している新興企業、大企業、主要政府機関を含む数百万のお客さまが、AWSを信頼してインフラストラクチャーを強化し、即応性を高め、コストを引き下げています。AWSの詳細については、aws.amazon.comをご覧ください。 アマゾンについて アマゾンは、4つの指針として、競争よりも顧客に目を向けること、発明に情熱を傾けること、優れたオペレーションに注力すること、長期的に思考することを拠り所としています。Amazonは、地球上で最も顧客中心主義の企業、地球上で最高の雇用主、地球上で最も安全に働ける職場であるすべく懸命に努力しています。利用者レビュー、ワンクリック・ショッピング、個人に合わせたお勧め、プライム、アマゾン・フルフィルメント、AWS、Kindleダイレクト・パブリッシング、Kindle、Career Choice、Fireタブレット、Fire TV、Amazon Echo、Alexa、Just Walk Out技術、Amazonスタジオ、クライメート・プレッジは、アマゾンが先駆的に開始したものの例です。詳細情報については、amazon.com/aboutをご覧いただき、@AmazonNewsをフォローしてください。

    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Council of Fashion Designers of America is pleased to introduce the Innovation Award presented by Amazon Fashion at the 2022 CFDA Fashion Awards. The Innovation Award presented by Amazon Fashion is an opportunity to recognize a fashion visionary, leading with technology and innovation in branding/marketing, social media, customer engagement, performance, or product development, that shapes how customers are shopping for fashion. The inaugural award will go to SKIMS, the solutions-oriented brand creating the next generation of underwear, loungewear, and shapewear. SKIMS continues to innovate, expand its selection, and introduce new categories with inclusive styles at accessible price points. SKIMS Co-Founder and Creative Director Kim Kardashian, Co-Founder and CEO Jens Grede, and Founding Partner and Chief Product Officer Emma Grede will accept the award at this year’s CFDA Fashion Awards ceremony on November 7. “Fashion relies on true visionaries to push the envelope and propel our industry forward,” CFDA CEO Steven Kolb said. “With SKIMS, Kim, Emma, and Jens have pioneered new technology in the process of reinventing the concept of solutions-oriented shapewear. Together with our CFDA Fashion Awards partner Amazon Fashion, which is a continuous innovator on behalf of customers, the CFDA is incredibly proud to honor SKIMS with the inaugural Innovation Award.” “The Innovation Award is an opportunity for Amazon Fashion to honor the visionaries who have been instrumental in evolving the industry and shaping how customers are shopping for fashion,” said Muge Erdirik Dogan, president of Amazon Fashion. “This year we’re excited to not only unveil our newly established Innovation Award with the CFDA, but to also present the award to SKIMS. Similarly to how we work at Amazon Fashion, SKIMS works backward from the customers' latent needs to innovate on their behalf and provide the solutions they’re seeking, to make shopping easier and more delightful. We look forward to this year’s CFDA Fashion Awards and to continue our joint mission with the CFDA to champion American talent.” “SKIMS is delighted to be recognized as the first-ever recipient of the Innovation Award presented by Amazon Fashion. Thank you to the CFDA and Amazon Fashion for acknowledging our efforts in the industry as we continue to innovate to find solutions for all customers,” Kardashian, Grede, and Grede said in a joint statement from SKIMS.

To mark the CFDA’s 60th anniversary, the awards will be co-hosted by CFDA members Joseph Altuzarra, Gabriela Hearst, Aurora James, Lazaro Hernandez, and Jack McCollough.

It will also provide the Venmo community with another store to shop for their holiday gifts using their Venmo account. Venmo will start to rollout to select Amazon customers today, and it will be available to U.S. customers by Black Friday. “We want to offer customers payment options that are convenient, easy to use, and secure—and there’s no better time for that than the busy holiday season. Whether it’s paying with cash, buying now and paying later, or now paying via Venmo, our goal is to meet the needs and preferences of every Amazon customer,” said Max Bardon, vice president of Amazon Worldwide Payments. “We’re excited to continue to offer customers even more options when it comes to how and when they want to pay for their order.” Placing an order using Venmo is simple and hassle-free. To get started, customers will add their Venmo account as a payment method to their Amazon account. Once their account is added, customers can select Venmo as their payment option during checkout. Customers can also choose to select Venmo as their default payment option after adding their Venmo account. “We know that the Venmo community of nearly 90 million users value the safety, security, ease, and familiarity that paying with Venmo helps to bring to the checkout experience,” said Doug Bland, senior vice president and general manager, head of consumer, PayPal. “The ability to pay with Venmo on Amazon continues our ongoing commitment to offer the community more ways to spend, send, receive, and manage their money with Venmo.” These secure transactions are protected by the back-end technology Amazon has built, as well as Amazon’s A-to-z Guarantee. In addition, Venmo Purchase Protection also applies to eligible purchases. For more information on how to place an Amazon order using Venmo visit here: amazon.com/venmo.",

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced Amazon Neptune Serverless, a new serverless option for Amazon Neptune that automatically scales to support unpredictable and business-critical graph database workloads. Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, and fully managed service that makes it easy to build and run applications that need a graph database to efficiently store and query complex and highly connected datasets. Amazon Neptune Serverless includes Amazon Neptune’s advanced capabilities for high availability, performance, and resiliency. There are no upfront commitments or additional costs to use Amazon Neptune Serverless, and customers only pay for the database resources used. To get started with Amazon Neptune Serverless, visit aws.amazon.com/neptune/serverless. Developers building applications that track relationships among many connected data points (e.g., contact tracing, fraud detection, drug discovery, and network security) use graph databases to understand and quickly connect relationships for a clearer understanding of the full dataset. Today, customers like Accenture, ADP, Cox Automotive, Merck, NBCUniversal, Siemens, Uber, and Zeta Global use Amazon Neptune to build and operate sophisticated and interactive graph-based applications that can query billions of relationships within data. Customers choose Amazon Neptune for its ease of use, durability, performance, and availability. Since many applications that rely on graph databases have variable or unpredictable workloads where the volume and complexity of database queries can be spiky or intermittent, capacity planning can be difficult. For example, a knowledge graph that models commercial airline flights in the United States might see a sudden spike during the holidays, or a knowledge graph that models traffic patterns of New York City taxis might see a sudden spike during rush hour. Traditionally, customers with variable or unpredictable workloads must constantly monitor and reconfigure capacity to maintain consistently fast performance, or over-provision for peak capacity, which results in unnecessary excess costs. With Amazon Neptune Serverless, customers no longer need to provision, scale, and manage clusters of database instances. Amazon Neptune Serverless automatically provisions and scales graph database workloads to hundreds of thousands of queries to maintain consistently fast performance for applications with variable and unpredictable workloads. With Amazon Neptune Serverless, customers only pay for the database resources their applications use, saving customers up to 90% compared to provisioning for peak capacity. Amazon Neptune Serverless supports the same popular, easy-to-write graph query languages as Amazon Neptune. The new serverless offering provides the full breadth of Amazon Neptune capabilities, including supporting multiple AWS Availability Zones for high availability, read replicas for high performance, and fully managed software patching, updates, and backups for ease of use. “Customers tell us that they appreciate the ability to use Amazon Neptune to understand complex relationships among highly connected data points. They have also asked us to take care of the heavy lifting associated with managing capacity and optimizing for cost and performance,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Databases, Analytics, and Machine Learning at AWS. “Now, with Amazon Neptune Serverless, customers have a graph database that automatically provisions and seamlessly scales clusters to provide just the right amount of capacity to meet demand, allowing them to build and run applications for even the most variable and unpredictable workloads without having to worry about provisioning capacity, scaling clusters, or incurring costs for unused resources.” Amazon Neptune Serverless is generally available today to customers running Amazon Neptune in US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), and Europe (London), with availability in additional AWS Regions coming soon. LexisNexis Legal & Professional is a leading global provider of information and analytics. \"Connecting networks of related data is a key source of innovation for our legal research platform, and graph databases enable us to continually expand the sets of legal data which can be linked and queried,\" said Kyle Patrick, senior architect at LexisNexis Legal & Professional. \"With Amazon Neptune Serverless, our ability to scale from data science experiments to large-scale production systems can be far smoother and more cost effective. Since Amazon Neptune Serverless automatically scales capacity based on demand, we can build and share graph models with less concern around hitting capacity limitations or overprovisioning.\" Snap Inc. is a camera company focused on empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. “We use graphs to manage the relationships among 347 million people who use Snapchat every day to Snap with family and friends, watch Stories, and explore content from top publishers around the world,” said Martin Qian, senior manager of Software Engineering at Snap. “We are excited about Amazon Neptune Serverless, which will allow us to scale up our graph database workload performance only when we need it. With Amazon Neptune Serverless, our developers will be able to move faster and focus more on innovating on behalf of our customers rather than building and operating graph database infrastructure.” Wiz is a cloud security platform that transforms how organizations secure their cloud using a graph-based approach. “At Wiz, we use Amazon Neptune to identify and map toxic combinations of cloud risks to reveal which of these pose the greatest threat. This allows our customers, including over 25% of the Fortune 100 and some of the largest cloud environments in the world, to fix what really matters,\" said Roy Reznik, co-founder and vice president of Research and Development at Wiz. “With Amazon Neptune Serverless, graph database workloads scale automatically to meet demand, so we never need to worry about managing database infrastructure and capacity and can instead focus on delivering more value for our customers.” About Amazon Web Services For over 15 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud offering. AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any cloud workload, and it now has more than 200 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 87 Availability Zones within 27 geographic regions, with announced plans for 24 more Availability Zones and eight more AWS Regions in Australia, Canada, India, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, and Thailand.

The customer response to both events was quite positive, and it’s clear that particularly during these uncertain economic times, customers appreciate Amazon’s continued focus on value and convenience,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “We’re also encouraged by the steady progress we’re making on lowering costs in our stores fulfillment network, and have a set of initiatives that we’re methodically working through that we believe will yield a stronger cost structure for the business moving forward. There is obviously a lot happening in the macroeconomic environment, and we’ll balance our investments to be more streamlined without compromising our key long-term, strategic bets. What won’t change is our maniacal focus on the customer experience, and we feel confident that we’re ready to deliver a great experience for customers this holiday shopping season.” Highlights Obsessing over the customer experience Amazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, in the past quarter, Amazon: Premiered several new entertainment series, including The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, which attracted more than 25 million global viewers on its first day, the biggest debut in Prime Video history, and closing in on 100 million viewers to date. The company also premiered three new Original and three returning series, including Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn’s Making the Cut; The Outlaws, starring Christopher Walken and Stephen Merchant; and thriller The Peripheral, starring Chloë Grace Moretz. Kicked off the inaugural season of Prime Video as the exclusive home of NFL Thursday Night Football with more than 15 million viewers for its first game. Live sports also returned to Prime Video across Europe with new seasons of UEFA Champions League soccer in Germany and Italy, Ligue 1 soccer in France, and exclusive coverage of US Open tennis in the UK. Introduced the first-ever Prime Early Access Sale, a two-day shopping event on October 11-12 exclusively for Prime members in 15 countries. Customers could choose from hundreds of thousands of deals across all best-selling categories, such as apparel, home, toys and Amazon devices. Amazon’s selling partners, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses, also took part in the event, and customers responded by ordering more than 100 million items from these businesses. Opened a dozen new fulfillment centers globally in order to serve more customers even more quickly. New sites were opened in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Ireland, and Turkey. Expanded to Belgium with the launch of Amazon.com.be and a Prime program for local customers, providing faster access to more than 180 million products across more than 30 product categories. As part of the launch, Amazon introduced the “Brands of Belgium” storefront to showcase products from Belgian entrepreneurs. Partnered with new brands and retailers to make their products available on Amazon with same-day delivery for Prime members in select ZIP codes across over 10 U.S. cities. Examples of these partners include GNC, PacSun, SuperDry, Sur La Table, and 100% Pure. Continued working to protect customers from fake reviews through legal action against fake review brokers, filing its first criminal complaint in Italy and its first lawsuit in Spain. These two legal proceedings, plus 10 other new lawsuits recently launched in the U.S., target bad actors that operate more than 11,000 websites and social media groups that attempt to orchestrate fake reviews on Amazon and other stores. Amazon stops millions of suspicious reviews before customers ever see them, and these legal actions help uncover perpetrators and stop the abuse where it starts. Rolled out Venmo as a new payment option in the U.S., giving customers more choice during the checkout experience. Hosted Amazon Accelerate, an annual conference dedicated to seller success where numerous new tools were introduced, including new email marketing capabilities, free-to-use shipping software that offers discounted shipping rates, and new features and analytics on conversion-driving content. Announced new commitments and migrations from AWS customers across many industries and geographies, such as BMW Group, which extended its work to help BMW’s developers derive insights from the data their vehicles produce; grocery delivery service Schwan’s Home Delivery, which is optimizing delivery times across its routes, building and scaling its technology infrastructure to support evolving consumer preferences, and personalizing product recommendations; online grocery platform Pick n Pay, which migrated its entire on-premises SAP environment to AWS to automate operations and deliver real-time insights; German national football league Bundesliga, which debuted two new Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS to help fans better understand team performance and game strategy; and South Korea-based wireless telecommunications operator SK Telecom (SKT), which is making it easier and more cost-effective for customers to build, use, and scale computer vision applications. Continued to expand AWS’s infrastructure footprint to support customers, announcing plans to launch the AWS Asia Pacific (Bangkok) Region in Thailand and opening the second Region in the Middle East, the AWS Middle East (UAE) Region. Received CrowdStrike’s 2022 Ecosystem Partner of the year award for AWS. Together, CrowdStrike and AWS delivered end-to-end comprehensive protection that enables AWS customers to build, run, and secure applications with speed and confidence. Inventing on behalf of customers Amazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that customers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better in some meaningful way. For example, this past quarter, Amazon: Introduced a range of new Fire TV devices and entertainment experiences, including the Omni QLED Series smart TV with hands-free Alexa controls and new ambient features that turn the TV into an always-smart device when not streaming; and the all-new Fire TV Cube streaming media player with a faster processor for increased app launch speeds, an industry-first HDMI input port, and Wi-Fi 6E support for smoother 4K streaming. Introduced the next generation of Echo Dot and Echo Auto, as well as upgrades to Echo Studio. The all-new Echo Dot and Echo Dot with Clock feature a redesigned audio architecture, and the Echo Dot Kids now comes in Owl and Dragon designs. The next generation Echo Auto is designed to hear requests over music, the air conditioner, and road noise, and the new Echo Studio features bass extension and custom-built spatial audio processing technology. Launched three new Kindle devices: Kindle Scribe, the first Kindle that makes it possible for customers to both read and write as naturally as they do on paper but with the convenience of Kindle’s glare-free Paperwhite display; the next-generation Kindle, Amazon’s lightest and most compact Kindle yet; and the next-generation Kindle Kids. Expanded the Ring lineup with new security devices and features: Ring Intercom allows customers living in apartment buildings to use their phone to talk to and buzz in visitors; Spotlight Cam Pro and Spotlight Cam Plus use radar sensors to detect motion and send more precise alerts; Ring Alarm Panic Button enables customers to get help at the push of a button in an emergency; and a new integration of Ring Virtual Security Guard and the Amazon Astro robot for businesses offers expanded security options. Announced the Blink Wired Floodlight Camera, which features person detection for the first time in a Blink device, and Blink Mini Pan Tilt accessory, which extends the functionality of the popular Blink Mini with additional viewpoint capabilities. Launched a new Alexa feature called Customers ask Alexa that enables brands and selling partners to answer common customer questions through Alexa and better inform purchase decisions. Continued to collaborate with leading retailers and stadiums to equip their locations with Just Walk Out technology for checkout-free shopping and Amazon One for palm recognition and payment. One or both of these technologies are now available at Texas A&M’s Kyle Field, Lumen Field in Seattle, Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, and a Hudson Nonstop at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. Amazon also continued to roll out Amazon One at Whole Foods Market stores with the technology now available at over 65 stores in California. Announced the general availability of new AWS EC2 machine learning training instances (Trn1), which make it possible to build more accurate machine learning models and reduce training times. AWS-designed Trainium chips are purpose-built for high-performance machine learning training in the cloud. With Trainium-powered Trn1 instances, AWS customers can save up to 50% on deep learning training costs over equivalent GPU-based instances. Announced the general availability of AWS IoT FleetWise, which makes it easier to collect, transform, and transfer vehicle data to the cloud in near real time. Automakers, suppliers, fleet operators, and technology solution vendors can use the data to analyze vehicle fleet health and more quickly identify potential recalls or safety issues, make in-vehicle infotainment systems smarter, and improve advanced technologies like autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems with analytics and machine learning. Announced a new alliance and investment with Harvard University to advance fundamental research and innovation in quantum networking, which will explore applications to combat privacy and security threats. AWS also announced the AWS Generation Q Fund at the Harvard Quantum Initiative to train the next-generation of quantum scientists and engineers. Empowering employees and delivery service partners In addition to its focus on customers, Amazon strives to make every day better for its employees and delivery service providers. There is a long list of initiatives the company continues to pursue. For example, in the third quarter, the company: Announced it is investing nearly $1 billion in pay increases for its fulfillment network employees over the next year in the U.S., bringing average pay to more than $19 per hour. Expanded Anytime Pay to provide hourly employees with instant access to up to 70% of their pay at any time during the month. Celebrated the 10-year anniversary of Career Choice, an education benefit that empowers employees to learn new skills for career success and has seen over 90,000 employees participate so far. Announced it is investing more than $450 million over the next year to help Delivery Service Partners (DSPs) support their teams with access to new and improved benefits, and additional rate increases. One new benefits provider, Next Mile, offers drivers employed by participating DSPs access to more than 1,700 academic programs with tuition assistance from their DSP. Participating DSPs are eligible to receive up to $5,250 per driver per year from Amazon to help cover the costs of tuition assistance. Expanded career advancement and development programs for front-line employees, such as offering the Amazon Intelligence Initiative to enhance technical skills and place employees in engineering roles within AWS. Announced plans to hire 150,000 people for open seasonal, full-time, and part-time roles across its operations network in the U.S. to help deliver for customers during the holidays. Introduced an additional, free mental wellness program for employees and their families in the U.S., the UK, and Brazil. Offered through Twill Therapeutics, the tools and services to improve mental health are available 24/7 and can be used to address in-the-moment concerns or as part of a daily mental health and well-being routine. Supporting communities and protecting the environment Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a small sampling of the many efforts from this past quarter include Amazon: Supporting people affected by Hurricane Fiona in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Ian in Florida by providing hundreds of thousands of essential products such as water filters and medical supplies; sending more than 320,000 bottles of water to residents of Jackson, Mississippi, suffering from a shortage of clean water; and donating items such as blankets and flashlights after the magnitude 6.8 earthquake in Sichuan Luding, China. Continuing to support people impacted by the war in Ukraine with product donations to refugees, financial support to more than 150 nonprofits on the ground in Eastern Europe, and cloud credits and technological assistance through AWS. As part of the support for the Ukrainian government, AWS sent Snowball devices—ruggedized compute and storage hardware—into Ukraine to help secure, store, and transfer over 10 petabytes (10 million gigabytes) of essential data to the cloud. These Snowball devices were the foundation for the effort to preserve Ukraine’s data—including state registries, education records, and other essential databases—which are critical in rebuilding the country. Amazon has donated more than $45 million in assistance since the start of the war and waived the referral fee for all Ukrainian small and medium-sized businesses selling in Amazon’s European stores. In addition, AWS launched IT Skills 4U, a free workforce-development initiative to provide Ukrainians around the world with access to skills training. Committing to hire at least 5,000 refugees in the U.S. by the end of 2024. The company is also providing support and resources through its Welcome Door program, which launched in April 2022 to help refugee employees navigate the immigration process. Committing $147 million to create and preserve 1,260 affordable homes across the Washington, D.C., metro area in partnership with minority-led organizations. This investment is the latest initiative by the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, a $2 billion commitment to create and preserve affordable homes in Amazon’s hometown communities.

This includes investments in electric trucks, vans, and micro mobility solutions like e-cargo bikes, as well as charging infrastructure.

Extending its partnership with Water.org, donating $10 million to help launch the Water.org Water & Climate Fund. The fund is focused on climate-resilient water and sanitation solutions that will result in lasting access for 100 million people across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In addition, Amazon’s funding will help provide 1 million people with access to clean water by 2025. Launching Amazon Catalytic Capital to invest $150 million in venture capital funds, accelerators, incubators, and venture studios that provide funding to entrepreneurs from underrepresented backgrounds. Announcing AWS has now helped more than 13 million people globally gain access to free cloud computing skills training since 2020 as part of Amazon’s commitment to provide free training to 29 million people around the world by 2025. Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of October 27, 2022, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our estimates as of October 27, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as the effect of other factors discussed above. Fourth Quarter 2022 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $140.0 billion and $148.0 billion, or to grow between 2% and 8% compared with fourth quarter 2021. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 460 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $0 and $4.0 billion, compared with $3.5 billion in fourth quarter 2021. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results. These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) launched a new financing solution, a merchant cash advance, provided by Parafin–a U.S.-based provider of growth capital for sellers. This secure financing option ties payment on the cash advance to a portion of sellers’ future sales for a fixed capital fee and provides eligible Amazon sellers with easy and quick access to capital when they need it, paired with flexible payment plans. With this program, sellers can access capital in a matter of days with transparent and capped rates, no fixed term, no personal guarantee, no credit checks or excessive paperwork, and no late fees. The program rolls out to some U.S.-based businesses today, and it will be available to hundreds of thousands of eligible sellers by early 2023. This new merchant cash advance, through which eligible businesses can access capital from $500 up to $10 million, provides sellers with financing opportunities to expand their businesses, protect margins, develop new products, grow inventory, and efficiently manage cashflow. A flexible payment schedule is determined by a fixed percentage of the seller’s Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS) until the funding is paid off, with no minimum payments, no interest (only a fixed capital fee), and no collateral required—unlike a traditional loan. Payments are only required during periods that a seller has made sales, and the fixed payment rate ultimately protects them during periods of slow or no sales. This financing option will provide sellers that have been selling on Amazon.com for at least three months with an additional solution for their financial needs alongside the existing financing solutions portfolio of term loans, interest only loans, and lines of credit provided by Amazon and its third-party financing partners. “Amazon is committed to providing convenient and flexible access to capital for our sellers, regardless of their size,” said Tai Koottatep, director and general manager, Amazon WW B2B Payments & Lending. “Today’s launch is another milestone in strengthening Amazon’s commitment to sellers, and builds on the strong portfolio of financial solutions we already provide. This latest offering significantly expands sellers’ reach and capabilities, and broadens their access to capital in a flexible way—one that helps them control their cashflow, and by extension, their entire business.” “We founded Parafin with the mission to grow small businesses, and we’re thrilled that we have the opportunity to do that by providing Amazon sellers with this merchant cash advance option,” said Vineet Goel, co-founder of Parafin. “It’s a privilege to count ourselves among Amazon’s suite of financial solutions, and we look forward to making a difference for Amazon.com sellers looking to expand their business.” “It can be difficult for small- and medium-sized businesses to access capital, regardless of whether they’re just getting started or are more established,” said Laurie McCabe, partner at SMB Group. “What Amazon is doing in partnership with Parafin to provide quick access to capital in a convenient and transparent way—and one that protects sellers during periods of low or no sales—is significant for the industry. It will be exciting to see how Amazon sellers use this merchant cash advance solution to help grow their businesses.” For more information on this merchant cash advance, please visit https://sell.amazon.com/programs/amazon-lending.",

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) are launching a public-private partnership to address the gender inequities that exist for women in the climate finance ecosystem and support female entrepreneurs with the resources they need to accelerate climate change innovations. Amazon will commit a total of $53 million to help accelerate women’s climate solutions, including $3 million toward the USAID partnership and $50 million for Amazon to invest directly in climate tech companies run by women. Amazon will serve as a founding partner of USAID’s Climate Gender Equity Fund, a new climate finance facility designed to remove systemic market barriers that prevent women and girls from accessing climate finance. USAID will also match Amazon’s $3 million investment to help launch the fund. The Climate Gender Equity Fund will have a global focus and provide grants for businesses, NGOs, accelerators, incubators, and grassroots organizations working on women-led climate solutions. It also will fund efforts to help women access the networks and technical skills they need to accelerate the development of their climate change technologies. As a co-founder of The Climate Pledge, a commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon will work with Pledge signatories and other companies to encourage their additional support and corporate investment in this new fund. The partnership will help advance mutual goals around women’s climate leadership and gender equity, including Amazon’s sustainability goals, the work of The Climate Pledge, and the Biden administration’s National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality. Additionally, Amazon is allocating $50 million from its Climate Pledge Fund to invest in women-founded and women-led climate tech companies, as well as incubators and accelerators that prioritize women-led entities. The Climate Pledge Fund–Amazon’s venture capital program that invests in companies pioneering decarbonizing technologies and solutions–will collaborate with USAID and the Climate Gender Equity Fund to source new investment opportunities and broaden its pipeline of female applicants. “As an important step in solving climate change, we must address the gender inequalities that persist in climate finance, and ensure female entrepreneurs have an equal seat at the table and access to the funding, networks, and technical support they need to scale climate solutions,” said Kara Hurst, vice president of Worldwide Sustainability at Amazon. “We’re proud to collaborate with USAID and the Biden administration to help scale women-led climate solutions globally. This is just one part of our broader Climate Pledge goal to reach net-zero carbon by 2040, and we encourage other companies to join us in this effort.” Female-founded companies typically receive a fraction of global venture capital, and that percentage fell during the pandemic. However, research shows that female entrepreneurs are more likely than their male counterparts to innovate to address social needs. Women-led companies also generate more revenue per dollar invested and produce greater ROI for investors. Amazon has recently taken several additional steps to advance gender equality across its value chain, including: Committing to the United Nations Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs), which offer businesses guidance on ways to promote gender equity and empower women in the workplace, marketplace, and community. Granting $1 million to the Resilience Fund for Women in Global Value Chains, which is investing in organizations supporting women in global value chains, including manufacturing, apparel, and agriculture, with a focus on gender-based violence and reproductive health. Partnering with BSR’s HERproject to combat gender-based discrimination in China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India by engaging suppliers, factory workers, and management. These efforts have reached nearly 10,000 women. Investing in the Elevate Future Fund, which increases funding to women and other underrepresented founders working on climate tech solutions, as well as firms creating economic opportunity for distressed and disadvantaged communities. This investment is part of the new Amazon Catalytic Capital initiative to provide underrepresented entrepreneurs with access to capital. Collaborating with Greentown Labs, North America’s largest climate tech incubator, to source and engage with new startups. The Climate Pledge Fund participates in pitch events, including “Access to Success,” a community event for diverse founders. Amazon also serves on Greentown Labs’ Industry Leadership Council. Working with Elemental Excelerator, a climate tech startup accelerator that is a leader in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion principles in climate tech. Elemental Excelerator recently launched an Equity & Access program that helps startup founders build equity into their organizations’ teams and activities.

    "text": "SEATTLE (EUA)--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A Amazon e a Agência dos Estados Unidos para o Desenvolvimento Internacional (USAID) estão lançando uma parceria público-privada para abordar as desigualdades de gênero que existem para as mulheres no ecossistema de financiamento climático e apoiar as empreendedoras com os recursos necessários para acelerar as inovações relacionadas às mudanças climáticas. A Amazon comprometerá um total de US$ 53 milhões para ajudar a acelerar as soluções climáticas das mulheres, incluindo US$ 3 milhões para a parceria com a USAID e US$ 50 milhões para investir diretamente em empresas de tecnologia climática dirigidas por mulheres. A empresa atuará como parceira fundadora do Climate Gender Equity Fund (Fundo de Igualdade de Gênero no Clima) da USAID, um novo mecanismo de financiamento climático projetado para eliminar as barreiras sistêmicas de mercado que impedem que as mulheres tenham acesso ao financiamento climático. A USAID também utilizará o investimento de US$ 3 milhões da Amazon para ajudar a lançar o fundo. O Climate Gender Equity Fund terá um foco global e fornecerá subsídios para empresas, ONGs, aceleradoras, incubadoras e organizações de base que trabalham em soluções climáticas lideradas por mulheres. Também financiará iniciativas para ajudar as mulheres a acessar as redes e as habilidades técnicas necessárias para acelerar o desenvolvimento de suas tecnologias de mudança climática. Como cofundadora do The Climate Pledge – um compromisso para atingir emissões “net zero” de carbono até 2040 –, a Amazon trabalhará com participantes desse compromisso e outras empresas para incentivar seu apoio adicional e investimento corporativo neste novo fundo. A parceria ajudará a promover objetivos mútuos em torno da liderança climática das mulheres e da igualdade de gênero, incluindo as metas de sustentabilidade da Amazon, o trabalho do The Climate Pledge e a Estratégia sobre Equidade e Igualdade de Gênero do governo dos Estados Unidos. Além disso, a Amazon está destinando US$ 50 milhões do seu Climate Pledge Fund (Fundo de Compromisso Climático) para investir em empresas de tecnologia climática fundadas e lideradas por mulheres, bem como incubadoras e aceleradoras que priorizam entidades lideradas por mulheres. O Climate Pledge Fund – programa de capital de risco da Amazon que investe em empresas pioneiras em tecnologias e soluções de descarbonização – colaborará com a USAID e o Climate Gender Equity Fund para gerar novas oportunidades de investimento e ampliar seu pipeline de candidatas do sexo feminino. “Como um passo importante na solução das mudanças climáticas, devemos abordar as desigualdades de gênero que persistem no financiamento climático e garantir que as mulheres empreendedoras tenham um lugar igual à mesa e acesso ao financiamento, redes e suporte técnico de que precisam para escalar as soluções climáticas”, disse Kara Hurst, vice-presidente de Sustentabilidade Mundial da Amazon. “É um grande orgulho colaborar com a USAID e a administração Biden para ajudar a escalar mundialmente as soluções climáticas lideradas por mulheres. Esta é apenas uma parte de nossa meta mais ampla de compromisso climático, que visa alcançar emissões ‘net-zero’ de carbono até 2040, e gostaríamos de incentivar outras empresas a também participarem dessa iniciativa.” As empresas fundadas por mulheres normalmente recebem uma fração do capital de risco global e essa porcentagem caiu durante a pandemia. No entanto, pesquisas mostram que as mulheres empreendedoras são mais propensas do que os homens a inovar para atender às necessidades sociais. As empresas lideradas por mulheres também geram mais receita por dólar investido e produzem maior ROI (retorno sobre o investimento) para os investidores. Recentemente, a Amazon tomou várias medidas extras para promover a igualdade de gênero em sua cadeia de valor, entre elas: Compromisso com os Princípios de Empoderamento das Mulheres (WEPs) da ONU, que oferecem orientações às empresas sobre formas de promover a igualdade de gênero e empoderar as mulheres no local de trabalho, no mercado e na comunidade. Concessão de US$ 1 milhão ao Resilience Fund for Women in Global Value Chains, que investe em organizações que apoiam as mulheres nas cadeias globais de valor, incluindo manufatura, vestuário e agricultura, com foco na violência de gênero e saúde reprodutiva. Parceria com o projeto HER da BSR para combater a discriminação de gênero na China, Bangladesh, Vietnã e Índia, envolvendo fornecedores, trabalhadores de fábricas e administrações de empresas. Essas iniciativas alcançaram cerca de 10 mil mulheres. Investimento no Elevate Future Fund, que aumenta o financiamento para mulheres e outras pessoas empreendedoras sub-representadas que trabalham em soluções de tecnologia climática, bem como empresas que criam oportunidades econômicas para comunidades em dificuldades e desfavorecidas. Esse investimento faz parte da nova iniciativa Amazon Catalytic Capital para fornecer acesso ao capital a pessoas empreendedoras sub-representadas. Colaboração com a Greentown Labs, maior incubadora de tecnologia climática da América do Norte, para buscar e interagir com novas startups. O Climate Pledge Fund participa de programas de lançamento, incluindo “Access to Success”, um evento comunitário para diversas pessoas fundadoras. A Amazon também atua no Conselho de Liderança da Indústria da Greentown Labs. Colaboração com a Elemental Excelerator, uma aceleradora de startups de tecnologia climática com liderança na promoção de princípios de diversidade, igualdade e inclusão na tecnologia climática. A Elemental Excelerator lançou recentemente um programa de Igualdade e Acesso que ajuda as pessoas fundadoras de startups a criar igualdade nas equipes e atividades de suas organizações.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon und die U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) starten eine öffentlich-private Partnerschaft, um die geschlechtsspezifischen Ungleichheiten zu beseitigen, die für Frauen im Ökosystem der Klimafinanzierung bestehen, und Unternehmerinnen mit den Ressourcen zu unterstützen, die sie benötigen, um Innovationen im Bereich des Klimawandels voranzutreiben. Amazon wird insgesamt 53 Millionen Dollar bereitstellen, die Frauen bei der Entwicklung von Klimalösungen unterstützen sollen, darunter 3 Millionen US-Dollar für die USAID-Partnerschaft und 50 Millionen US-Dollar für Amazon, um direkt in von Frauen geführte Climate-Tech-Unternehmen zu investieren. Amazon wird als Gründungspartner des Climate Gender Equity Fund von USAID fungieren, einer neuen Fazilität zur Klimafinanzierung, die darauf abzielt, systemische Marktbarrieren zu beseitigen, die Frauen und Mädchen am Zugang zur Klimafinanzierung hindern. USAID wird zudem die Investition von Amazon in Höhe von 3 Millionen US-Dollar verdoppeln, um die Einrichtung des Fonds zu unterstützen. Der global ausgerichtete Climate Gender Equity Fund stellt Zuschüsse für Unternehmen, Nichtregierungsorganisationen, Beschleuniger, Inkubatoren und Basisorganisationen bereit, die an frauengeführten Klimalösungen arbeiten. Darüber hinaus werden Maßnahmen finanziert, die Frauen den Zugang zu den Netzwerken und technischen Kompetenzen erleichtern, die sie benötigen, um die Entwicklung ihrer Technologien für den Klimawandel zu beschleunigen. Als Mitbegründer des Climate Pledge, einer Selbstverpflichtung zur Erreichung von Netto-Null-Emissionen bis 2040, wird Amazon mit den Unterzeichnern des Pledge und anderen Unternehmen zusammenarbeiten, um deren zusätzliche Unterstützung und Unternehmensinvestitionen in diesen neuen Fonds zu fördern. Die Partnerschaft soll dazu beitragen, die gemeinsamen Ziele in Bezug auf die Führungsrolle von Frauen beim Klimaschutz und die Gleichstellung der Geschlechter voranzubringen, einschließlich der Nachhaltigkeitsziele von Amazon, der Arbeit von The Climate Pledge und der National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality der Regierung Biden. Darüber hinaus stellt Amazon 50 Millionen Dollar aus seinem Climate Pledge Fund bereit, um in von Frauen gegründete und von Frauen geführte Klimatechnologie-Unternehmen sowie in Inkubatoren und Beschleuniger zu investieren, die vorrangig von Frauen geführte Unternehmen unterstützen. Der Climate Pledge Fund – Amazons Risikokapitalprogramm, das in Unternehmen investiert, die Pionierarbeit bei der Entwicklung von Technologien und Lösungen zur Dekarbonisierung leisten – wird mit USAID und dem Climate Gender Equity Fund zusammenarbeiten, um neue Investitionsmöglichkeiten zu erschließen und seine Pipeline an Bewerberinnen zu erweitern. „Ein wichtiger Schritt zur Lösung des Problems des Klimawandels besteht darin, die Ungleichheiten zwischen den Geschlechtern im Bereich der Klimafinanzierung zu beseitigen. Unternehmerinnen müssen gleichberechtigt am Tisch sitzen und Zugang zu den Finanzmitteln, Netzwerken und der technischen Unterstützung haben, die sie benötigen, um Lösungen für den Klimawandel zu entwickeln“, so Kara Hurst, Vice President of Worldwide Sustainability bei Amazon. „Wir sind stolz darauf, mit USAID und der Regierung Biden zusammenzuarbeiten, um frauengeführte Klimalösungen weltweit zu fördern. Dies ist nur ein Teilaspekt unseres umfassenderen Climate Pledge-Ziels, bis zum Jahr 2040 eine Netto-Null-Emission zu erreichen, und wir ermutigen andere Unternehmen, sich uns in diesem Bemühen anzuschließen.“ Von Frauen gegründete Unternehmen erhalten in der Regel nur einen Bruchteil des weltweiten Risikokapitals, und dieser Anteil ist während der Pandemie gesunken. Untersuchungen zeigen jedoch, dass weibliche Unternehmerinnen eher als ihre männlichen Kollegen innovative Maßnahmen ergreifen, um soziale Bedürfnisse zu erfüllen. Von Frauen geführte Unternehmen erwirtschaften auch mehr Umsatz pro investiertem Dollar und erzielen eine höhere Kapitalrendite für Investoren. Amazon hat in jüngster Zeit mehrere zusätzliche Schritte unternommen, um die Gleichstellung der Geschlechter in seiner gesamten Wertschöpfungskette voranzutreiben. Dazu zählen: Verpflichtung zur Einhaltung der Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs) der Vereinten Nationen, die Unternehmen eine Anleitung zur Förderung der Gleichstellung der Geschlechter und zur Stärkung von Frauen am Arbeitsplatz, auf dem Markt und in der Gemeinschaft bieten. Vergabe von 1 Million US-Dollar an den Resilience Fund for Women in Global Value Chains, für Investitionen in Organisationen, die Frauen in globalen Wertschöpfungsketten unterstützen, wie z. B. in der verarbeitenden Industrie, der Bekleidungsindustrie und der Landwirtschaft, wobei der Schwerpunkt auf geschlechtsspezifischer Gewalt und reproduktiver Gesundheit liegt. Partnerschaft mit dem HERproject von BSR zur Bekämpfung geschlechtsspezifischer Diskriminierung in China, Bangladesch, Vietnam und Indien unter Einbeziehung von Lieferanten, Fabrikarbeitern und Geschäftsführung. Diese Maßnahmen haben fast 10.000 Frauen erreicht. Investitionen in den Elevate Future Fund, der die Finanzierung von Frauen und anderen unterrepräsentierten Gründern erhöht, die an technischen Lösungen für den Klimaschutz arbeiten, sowie von Unternehmen, die wirtschaftliche Chancen für notleidende und benachteiligte Gemeinschaften schaffen. Diese Investition ist Teil der neuen Amazon Catalytic Capital Initiative, die unterrepräsentierten Unternehmern Zugang zu Kapital verschaffen soll. Kooperation mit Greentown Labs, Nordamerikas größtem Inkubator für Klimatechnologien, mit dem Ziel, neue Start-ups zu finden und mit ihnen in Kontakt zu treten. Der Climate Pledge Fund nimmt an Pitch-Veranstaltungen teil, darunter „Access to Success“, eine Gemeinschaftsveranstaltung für diverse Gründer. Amazon ist außerdem Mitglied des Greentown Labs' Industry Leadership Council. Zusammenarbeit mit Elemental Excelerator, einem Beschleuniger von Climate-Tech-Startups, der bei der Förderung von Vielfalt, Gleichberechtigung und Inklusionsprinzipien in der Klimatechnologie-Branche eine führende Rolle spielt. Elemental Excelerator hat kürzlich ein Equity & Access-Programm ins Leben gerufen, das Startup-Gründern hilft, Eigenkapital in die Teams und Aktivitäten ihrer Unternehmen zu integrieren.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon y la Agencia de los Estados Unidos para el Desarrollo Internacional (USAID, por sus siglas en inglés) emprenden una asociación público-privada para abordar las desigualdades de género que existen para las mujeres en el ecosistema de financiación de proyectos climáticos. La finalidad es apoyar a las empresarias con los recursos que necesitan para acelerar las innovaciones en materia de cambio climático. Amazon destinará 53 millones de dólares para ayudar a agilizar las soluciones climáticas a cargo de mujeres, con 3 millones de dólares para la colaboración con USAID y 50 millones de dólares que Amazon invertirá directamente en empresas de tecnología climática dirigidas por mujeres. Amazon se convertirá en socio fundador del Fondo para la Equidad de Género en el Clima de USAID, un nuevo mecanismo de financiación diseñado para eliminar las barreras sistémicas del mercado que impiden a mujeres y niñas acceder a fondos para cuestiones climáticas. USAID también igualará la inversión de 3 millones de dólares de Amazon para ayudar a poner en marcha el fondo. El Fondo para la Equidad de Género en el Clima tendrá un enfoque global y proporcionará subvenciones a empresas, ONG, aceleradoras, incubadoras y organizaciones de base que trabajen en soluciones climáticas dirigidas por mujeres. También financiará actividades para ayudar a las mujeres a acceder a las redes y los conocimientos técnicos que necesitan para impulsar el desarrollo de sus tecnologías para el cambio climático. Como cofundador del fondo de compromiso climático «The Climate Pledge», cuyo objetivo es alcanzar cero emisiones netas de carbono para 2040, Amazon trabajará con los firmantes y otras empresas para fomentar su apoyo adicional y la inversión corporativa en este nuevo fondo. La asociación buscará impulsar los objetivos mutuos en torno al liderazgo climático de las mujeres y la igualdad de género, incluidos los objetivos de sostenibilidad de Amazon, el trabajo de «The Climate Pledge» y la Estrategia Nacional de Equidad e Igualdad de Género de la administración Biden. Además, Amazon asignará 50 millones de dólares de su «Climate Pledge Fund» para invertir en empresas de tecnología climática fundadas y dirigidas por mujeres, así como en incubadoras y aceleradoras que den prioridad a las entidades dirigidas por mujeres. «The Climate Pledge Fund», el programa de capital riesgo de Amazon que invierte en empresas pioneras en tecnologías y soluciones de descarbonización, colaborará con USAID y el Fondo para la Equidad de Género en el Clima para buscar nuevas oportunidades de inversión y ampliar su cartera de candidatas. «Un paso muy importante si queremos resolver el cambio climático es abordar las desigualdades de género que persisten en la financiación de iniciativas climáticas, además de garantizar que las mujeres empresarias tengan un lugar de igualdad en las negociaciones y acceso a la financiación, las redes y el apoyo técnico que necesitan para ampliar las soluciones en esta materia», comentó Kara Hurst, vicepresidenta de Sostenibilidad Mundial de Amazon. «Nos enorgullece colaborar con USAID y el gobierno de Biden para ayudar a ampliar las soluciones climáticas lideradas por mujeres en todo el mundo. Esto no es más que una parte de nuestro objetivo más amplio del “Climate Pledge” de alcanzar un nivel cero de carbono para 2040. Animamos a otras empresas a unirse a nosotros en este esfuerzo». Las empresas fundadas por mujeres suelen recibir una fracción del capital de riesgo mundial, y ese porcentaje se redujo durante la pandemia. Sin embargo, las investigaciones demuestran que las mujeres empresarias tienen más probabilidades que los hombres de innovar para satisfacer las necesidades sociales. Las empresas dirigidas por mujeres también generan más ingresos por cada dólar invertido y producen un mayor retorno de la inversión para los inversores. Recientemente, Amazon ha puesto en marcha varias medidas adicionales para promover la igualdad de género en toda su cadena de valor, entre ellas: Comprometerse con los Principios de Empoderamiento de la Mujer de las Naciones Unidas (WEPs, por sus siglas en inglés), que ofrecen a las empresas orientación sobre cómo promover la igualdad de género y capacitar a las mujeres en el lugar de trabajo, el mercado y la comunidad. Conceder un millón de dólares al Fondo de Resiliencia para las Mujeres en las Cadenas de Valor Globales, que invierte en organizaciones que apoyan a las mujeres en las cadenas de valor internacionales, como la industria manufacturera, la confección y la agricultura, centrándose en la violencia de género y la salud reproductiva. Asociarse con el proyecto HERproject de BSR para luchar contra la discriminación de género en China, Bangladés, Vietnam e India mediante la participación de proveedores, trabajadores de fábricas y directivos. Estos avances han llegado a casi 10 000 mujeres. Invertir en el Elevate Future Fund, un proyecto que amplía la financiación a mujeres y otros fundadores infrarrepresentados que trabajan en soluciones tecnológicas para el clima, así como a empresas que crean oportunidades económicas para comunidades desfavorecidas o en dificultades. Esta inversión forma parte de la nueva iniciativa «Amazon Catalytic Capital» destinada a proporcionar a los emprendedores infrarrepresentados acceso al capital. Colaborar con Greentown Labs, la mayor incubadora de tecnología climática de Norteamérica, para localizar y asumir compromisos con nuevas empresas. El fondo «The Climate Pledge» participa en eventos de presentación, como «Access to Success», un evento comunitario para fundadores muy diversos. Amazon también forma parte del Consejo de Liderazgo Industrial de Greentown Labs. Trabajar con Elemental Excelerator, una aceleradora de startups de tecnología climática que es líder en la promoción de los principios de diversidad, equidad e inclusión en la tecnología climática. Elemental Excelerator ha lanzado recientemente un programa de Equidad y Acceso que ayuda a los fundadores de startups a incorporar la equidad en los equipos y actividades de sus organizaciones.

Ce partenariat contribuera à la réalisation d’objectifs communs en matière de leadership des femmes dans le domaine du climat et d’équité entre les sexes, notamment les objectifs de durabilité d’Amazon, les efforts du Pacte pour le climat et la Stratégie nationale pour l’équité et l’égalité entre les sexes (National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality) de l’administration Biden. Par ailleurs, Amazon allouera 50 millions de dollars de son fonds d’engagement climatique pour financer des entreprises de technologie climatique fondées et dirigées par des femmes, ainsi que des incubateurs et des accélérateurs qui donnent la priorité aux entités dirigées par des femmes. Le Fonds pour l’engagement climatique, un programme de capital-risque d’Amazon qui investit dans des entreprises pionnières en matière de technologies et de solutions de décarbonisation, collaborera avec l’Agence des États-Unis pour le développement international et le Fonds pour l’équité entre les sexes en matière de climat pour créer de nouvelles opportunités d’investissement et élargir sa réserve de candidates. « La résolution du problème du changement climatique passe par une étape importante : nous devons nous attaquer aux inégalités entre les sexes qui persistent dans le financement climatique, et veiller à ce que les femmes entrepreneurs puissent s’asseoir à la même table et avoir accès au financement, aux réseaux et au soutien technique dont elles ont besoin pour développer des solutions climatiques », a déclaré la vice-présidente du développement durable à l’échelle mondiale chez Amazon, Kara Hurst. « Nous sommes fiers de collaborer avec l’Agence des États-Unis pour le développement international et l’administration Biden pour contribuer à la mise en place de solutions climatiques élaborées par des femmes dans le monde entier. Cette initiative ne représente qu’une partie de l’objectif plus large de notre fonds pour l’engagement climatique, dont le but est d’atteindre la neutralité carbone d’ici 2040, et nous encourageons les autres entreprises à se joindre à nous dans cet effort. » Les entreprises fondées par des femmes ne reçoivent en général qu’une fraction du capital-risque mondial, un pourcentage qui a chuté pendant la pandémie. Plusieurs études montrent que les femmes entrepreneurs sont plus susceptibles que leurs homologues masculins d'innover pour répondre aux besoins de la société. Les entreprises dirigées par des femmes génèrent également plus de revenus pour chaque dollar investi et produisent un meilleur retour sur investissement pour les investisseurs. Amazon a récemment adopté plusieurs nouvelles mesures pour faire avancer l’égalité des sexes dans sa chaîne de valeur, notamment les suivantes : Engagement à respecter les principes d’autonomisation des femmes des Nations unies (WEP), qui offrent aux entreprises des conseils sur les moyens de promouvoir l’égalité des sexes et l’autonomisation des femmes sur le lieu de travail, sur le marché et dans la communauté. Octroi d’un million de dollars au Fonds de résilience pour les femmes dans les chaînes de valeur mondiales, qui investit dans des organismes soutenant les femmes dans les chaînes de valeur mondiales, notamment la fabrication, l’habillement et l’agriculture, en mettant l’accent sur la violence sexiste et la santé reproductive. Partenariat avec le projet HERproject de BSR pour lutter contre la discrimination fondée sur le sexe en Chine, au Bangladesh, au Vietnam et en Inde, et ce en impliquant les fournisseurs, les ouvriers d’usine et la direction. Ces efforts ont permis de toucher près de 10 000 femmes. Investissement dans l'Elevate Future Fund, qui renforce le financement des femmes et d’autres fondateurs sous-représentés qui travaillent sur des solutions technologiques liées au climat, ainsi que des entreprises qui créent des opportunités économiques pour les communautés en difficulté et défavorisées. Cet investissement fait partie de la nouvelle initiative Amazon Catalytic Capital visant à fournir aux entrepreneurs sous-représentés un accès au capital. Collaboration avec Greentown Labs, la plus grande pépinière de technologies climatiques d’Amérique du Nord, pour identifier les nouvelles jeunes pousses et s’engager avec elles. Le Fonds pour l’engagement climatique participe à des présentations, notamment Access to Success (Arriver à la réussite), un événement communautaire destiné aux fondateurs d’entreprises diverses. Amazon siège également au conseil de direction de l’industrie de Greentown Labs. Collaboration avec Elemental Excelerator, un accélérateur de jeunes pousses spécialisées dans les technologies climatiques pionnier dans la promotion des principes de diversité, d’équité et d’inclusion dans ce secteur. Elemental Excelerator a récemment lancé un programme d’équité et d’accès qui aide les fondateurs de jeunes pousses à incorporer l’équité dans les équipes et les activités de leur société.

    "site": "businesswire.com",
    "text": "シアトル--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- アマゾンと米国国際開発庁（USAID）は、気候ファイナンス・エコシステムにおいて女性に対して存在するジェンダー不平等に対処し、気候変動対策の革新を加速させるために必要なリソースによって女性起業家をサポートするための官民パートナーシップを開始します。 アマゾンは、女性の気候ソリューションの加速を支援するために、合計5300万ドルを約束しています。これには、USAIDパートナーシップに向けた300万ドルと、女性が経営する気候変動対策技術企業にアマゾンが直接投資するための5000万ドルが含まれます。 アマゾンは、USAIDの気候ジェンダー公平基金の創立パートナーとしての役割を果たします。この基金は、女性や少女の気候ファイナンスへのアクセスを妨げる体系的な市場障壁を取り除くことを目的とした新しい気候ファイナンス・ファシリティです。USAIDはまた、基金の発足をサポートするために、アマゾンの300万ドルの投資にマッチングを行います。 気候ジェンダー公平基金は、世界的な視野に立ち、女性主導の気候ソリューションに取り組んでいる企業、NGO、アクセラレーター、インキュベーター、草の根組織に助成金を提供します。女性が気候変動対策技術の開発を加速するために必要なネットワークや技術的スキルにアクセスできるよう支援する取り組みにも、資金を提供します。 アマゾンは、2040年までに炭素排出量ネットゼロを達成すると約束した取り組みであるクライメート・プレッジの共同創立者として、プレッジの署名者や他の企業と協力して、この新しい基金へのさらなるサポートや企業投資を奨励します。このパートナーシップは、アマゾンの持続可能性目標、クライメート・プレッジの取り組み、バイデン政権のジェンダー公平および平等に関する国家戦略を含め、女性の気候リーダーシップとジェンダー公平に関する双方の目標の前進に寄与します。 さらに、アマゾンは、女性が設立して主導する気候変動対策技術企業や、女性主導の事業体を優先するインキュベーターやアクセラレーターに投資をするために、そのクライメート・プレッジ・ファンドから5000万ドルを割り当てています。脱炭素化の技術とソリューションを開拓する企業に投資するアマゾンのベンチャーキャピタルプログラムであるクライメート・プレッジ・ファンドは、USAIDおよび気候ジェンダー公平基金と連携して、新しい投資機会を見つけ、女性の応募者のパイプラインを広げます。 アマゾンの世界的持続可能性担当バイスプレジデントであるカラ・ハーストは、次のように述べています。「気候変動の解決における重要なステップとして、私たちは気候ファイナンスに根強く残るジェンダー不平等に対処して、女性起業家が平等な立場を確保し、気候ソリューションを拡大するために必要な資金、ネットワーク、技術的サポートにアクセスできるようにしなくてはなりません。当社は、USAIDおよびバイデン政権と連携して、世界中の女性主導の気候ソリューションの規模拡大をサポートできることを誇りに思います。これは、2040年までに炭素排出量ネットゼロを達成するというより広範なクライメート・プレッジ目標の一部に過ぎず、他の企業にも私たちと共にこの取り組みに参加することを呼びかけます。」 女性が設立した企業は一般的に、世界のベンチャーキャピタルのごく一部しか受け取らず、その割合は今回のパンデミック中に低下しました。しかし、女性起業家は男性起業家よりも社会的ニーズに対応するための革新を起こす可能性が高いことが、調査によって示されています。また、女性が主導する企業は、投資額1ドル当りの収益が多く、投資家にとってより大きなROIを生み出します。 アマゾンは最近、そのバリューチェーン全体でジェンダー平等を促進するために、下記を含む追加の措置を幾つか取りました。 職場、市場、コミュニティーにおけるジェンダー公平の促進と女性のエンパワーメントの方法に関する企業指針を提供する国連「女性のエンパワーメント原則（WEPs）」に取り組むと約束。 ジェンダーに基づく暴力および性と生殖に関する健康に着目して、製造、アパレル、農業などのグローバル・バリューチェーンにおける女性をサポートしている組織に投資をするグローバル・バリューチェーンにおける女性のためのレジリエンス・ファンドに100万ドルを供与。 サプライヤー、工場労働者、経営陣の参画を得て、中国、バングラデシュ、ベトナム、インドでのジェンダーに基づく差別と闘うBSRのHERプロジェクトとの提携。これらの取り組みの範囲は、1万人近くの女性に及ぶ。 気候変動対策の技術ソリューションに取り組む女性および不平等な状況にあるその他の創設者や、困窮しており恵まれていないコミュニティーのために経済的機会を創出している企業に対する資金提供を拡大するエレベート・フューチャー・ファンドへの投資。この投資は、不平等な状況にある起業家に資本へのアクセスを提供する新しいアマゾン・カタリティック・キャピタル・イニシアチブの一部。 新しい新興企業を見つけ、これらとの関係を築く北米最大の気候変動対策技術インキュベーターであるグリーンタウン・ラブズとの連携。クライメート・プレッジ・ファンドは、多様な創設者向けのコミュニティーイベントである「アクセス・トゥー・サクセス」などの売り込みイベントに参加している。アマゾンはまた、グリーンタウン・ラブズの業界リーダーシップ評議会の一員でもある。 気候変動対策技術における多様性・公平性・包摂性の原則を推進するリーダーである気候変動対策技術新興企業アクセラレーターのエレメンタル・エクセラレーターとの協力。エレメンタル・エクセラレーターは最近、新興企業の創設者が組織のチームと活動に公平性を組み込むためのサポートをするエクイティ＆アクセス・プログラムを開始。 アマゾンの持続可能性に関する取り組みの詳細をご覧ください。 本記者発表文の公式バージョンはオリジナル言語版です。翻訳言語版は、読者の便宜を図る目的で提供されたものであり、法的効力を持ちません。翻訳言語版を資料としてご利用になる際には、法的効力を有する唯一のバージョンであるオリジナル言語版と照らし合わせて頂くようお願い致します。",

    "text": "西雅图--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美国商业资讯)--亚马逊和美国国际开发署(USAID)正在启动一项公私合作伙伴关系，以解决气候金融生态系统中女性面临的性别不平等问题，为女性企业家提供所需资源，加速气候变化创新。 亚马逊将投入总计5,300万美元，帮助加快女性主导的气候解决方案，其中300万美元用于启动与美国国际开发署的合作伙伴关系，其余5,000万美元则用于直接投资于女性经营的气候技术公司。 亚马逊将成为美国国际开发署气候性别平等基金的创始合作伙伴，该基金是一个新的气候融资机构，旨在消除阻止妇女和女孩获得气候融资的系统性市场障碍。美国国际开发署还将针对亚马逊的300万美元投资提供匹配投入，以帮助启动该基金。 气候性别平等基金将着眼全球，为致力于支持女性主导的气候解决方案的企业、非政府组织、加速器、孵化器和基层组织提供赠款。基金还将通过资助相关工作，帮助女性获得所需的网络和技术技能，以加速女性领导的应对气候变化技术的发展。 亚马逊作为《气候宣言》(The Climate Pledge)的联合发起人，承诺到2040年实现净零碳排放，还将与宣言签署方和其他公司合作，鼓励他们对这一新基金提供额外的支持和企业投资。该合作伙伴关系将有助于推进有关女性气候领导力和性别平等的共同目标，包括亚马逊的可持续发展目标、《气候宣言》的工作以及拜登政府的《性别公平与平等国家战略》(National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality)。 此外，亚马逊还将从其气候宣言基金(Climate Pledge Fund)中拨款5,000万美元，用于投资女性创立和女性主导的气候技术公司，以及优先考虑女性主导实体的孵化器和加速器。气候宣言基金是亚马逊的风险投资项目，投资对象为开创脱碳技术和解决方案的公司，该基金将与美国国际开发署和气候性别平等基金合作，寻找新的投资机会并拓宽面向女性申请人的渠道。 亚马逊全球可持续发展副总裁Kara Hurst表示：“作为解决气候变化的重要一步，我们必须解决气候融资中持续存在的性别不平等问题，并确保女性企业家拥有平等的机会，能够获得扩大气候解决方案规模所需的资金、网络和技术支持。我们很自豪能与美国国际开发署和拜登政府合作，帮助在全球范围内推广女性主导的气候解决方案。这只是我们更广泛的气候宣言目标的一部分，即到2040年实现净零碳排放，我们鼓励其他公司加入我们的行列。” 女性创立的公司通常只能获得全球风险投资的一小部分，而且这一比例在新冠疫情期间有所下降。然而，研究表明，女性企业家比男性企业家更有可能通过创新来满足社会需求。女性领导的公司，其单位投入也能产生更多收入，并为投资者带来更高的投资回报率。 亚马逊最近采取了几项额外措施来促进实现其价值链中的性别平等，包括： 致力于践行联合国妇女赋权原则(WEP)，该原则为企业提供有关如何在工作场所、市场和社区促进性别平等和赋予妇女权力的指导。 向全球价值链女性韧性基金(Resilience Fund for Women in Global Value Chains)捐助100万美元，该基金目前投资于支持全球价值链中女性领导的组织，涵盖制造业、服装业和农业，重点关注基于性别的暴力和生殖健康。 与BSR旗下的HERproject项目合作，通过让供应商、工厂工人和管理层参与，在中国、孟加拉、越南和印度打击基于性别的歧视。这些举措和行动已惠及近1万名妇女。 投资于提升未来基金(Elevate Future Fund)，该基金增加了对致力于气候技术解决方案的女性和其他代表性不足的创始人以及为陷入困境和处境不利的社区创造经济机会的公司提供的资金。这项投资是新的亚马逊催化资本计划的一部分，旨在为代表性不足的企业家提供获得资本的机会。 与北美规模领先的气候技术孵化器Greentown Labs合作，寻找新的初创公司并与之合作。气候宣言基金参与各种宣传活动，包括面向各类创始人的社区活动“Access to Success”。亚马逊也是Greentown Labs旗下行业领导委员会的成员。 与气候技术创业加速器Elemental Excelerator合作。该加速器在促进气候技术的多元、公平和包容原则方面处于领先地位。Elemental Excelerator最近推出了Equity & Access计划，旨在帮助初创公司创始人在其组织的团队和活动中建立公平的环境。 详细了解亚马逊的可持续发展行动。 免责声明：本公告之原文版本乃官方授权版本。译文仅供方便了解之用，烦请参照原文，原文版本乃唯一具法律效力之版本。",

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced the launch of the AWS Europe (Zurich) Region. Starting today, developers, startups, entrepreneurs, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and nonprofit organizations, will have even greater choice for running their applications and serving end users from data centers located in Switzerland, using advanced AWS technologies to drive innovation. AWS also released an economic impact study estimating that the company’s spending on the construction and operation of the new Region will support an average of more than 2,500 full-time jobs annually at external businesses in the Swiss data center supply chain, with a planned $5.9 billion (5.9 billion Swiss francs) investment through 2036. The AWS Europe (Zurich) Region will also add an estimated $16.3 billion (16.3 billion Swiss francs) to Switzerland’s gross domestic product (GDP) during the next 15 years. For more information about AWS Global Infrastructure, visit aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure. “From startups and midsized businesses to enterprises and government organizations, thousands of commercial, nonprofit, and public sector organizations across Switzerland are engaging their end users and growing globally with the support of AWS,” said Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice president of Infrastructure Services at AWS. “With the new AWS Europe (Zurich) Region, we have seven AWS Regions and 21 Availability Zones across Europe in Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Milan, Paris, Stockholm, and now Zurich. This is a continuation of our investment to support customers of all kinds, help startups scale and grow, enable technical skills development, and help organizations create cloud-powered applications that reinvent services for end users.” “We are delighted that AWS continues to invest in Switzerland, enabling new possibilities for businesses and citizens to leverage innovative cloud technologies,” said Dieter Egli, government councillor and head of the Department of Economic and Interior Affairs of the canton of Aargau, Switzerland. “The opening of the new AWS infrastructure Region is a key milestone for our regional enterprises and the digital transformation agenda that will further promote and accelerate the rapid introduction of new digital solutions in our technology and engineering location in the heart of Europe.” With the launch of the AWS Europe (Zurich) Region, AWS has 90 Availability Zones across 28 geographic regions, with announced plans to launch 21 more Availability Zones and seven more AWS Regions in Australia, Canada, India, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, and Thailand. AWS Regions are composed of Availability Zones that place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations. The AWS Europe (Zurich) Region consists of three Availability Zones and is the seventh AWS Region in Europe. Availability Zones are located far enough from each other to support customers’ business continuity, but near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected through redundant, ultra-low latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance. The launch of the AWS Europe (Zurich) Region will enable local customers with data residency requirements to store data securely in Switzerland, while providing customers with even lower latency across the country. AWS is planning to invest an estimated $5.9 billion (approx. 5.9 billion Swiss francs) in Switzerland during the next 15 years through the new AWS Europe (Zurich) Region. This investment includes capital expenditures on the construction of data centers, operational expenses related to ongoing utilities and facility costs, and the purchase of goods and services from regional businesses. The investment is also estimated to support an average of more than 2,500 jobs annually during this time. These jobs, including construction, facility maintenance, engineering, telecommunications, and jobs within the country’s broader economy, will be part of the AWS supply chain in Switzerland. The construction and operation of AWS infrastructure in Switzerland is also estimated to add $16.3 billion (approx. 16.3 billion Swiss francs) to Switzerland’s GDP during the next 15 years. Customers welcome the AWS Europe (Zurich) Region More than 10,000 customers in Switzerland join millions of active customers using AWS every month in more than 190 countries around the world. Large and small Swiss enterprises that use AWS to run their mission-critical workloads to drive cost savings, accelerate innovation, and speed time to market include Buildigo, Clariant, Crisalix, Datwyler, Dentsu Tracking, Explora Journeys, Fisch Asset Management, GSR Zug, Helvetia Group, Hexagon, Hilti, Idorsia, iNovitas, Invit Travel, iptiQ, Klarpay, Kudelski Group, lastminute.com, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, OC Oerlikon Corporation AG, Partners Group, Richemont, Ringier, Swiss Marketplace Group, Swiss Re, Swisscom, Syngenta, Ubique, u-blox, and Zurich Insurance Group. The country’s top startups that built their businesses on AWS to scale rapidly and expand their geographic reach in minutes include ANYbotics, Edgelab, FemTec Health (formerly AVA), flovtec, GenomSys, holo|one, RetinAI, Smallpdf, SonarSource, and Verity. Public sector organizations that use AWS to transform the services they deliver to Swiss citizens include AI Center at Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH Zürich), BERNMOBIL, EF Education First, Radiotelevisione svizzera (RSI), Swiss Federal Office of Topography (Swisstopo), and Swiss Post. As one of the world's leading specialty chemical companies, Clariant addresses key challenges including energy efficiency, renewable raw materials, emission-free mobility, and conserving finite resources. From 2020 to 2022, Clariant migrated their regional data centers around the world to AWS. “When deciding to move from on-premises managed services to the cloud, we sought an agile but cost-effective solution to support our business model as well as merger and acquisition activities. AWS enabled us to build a more secure infrastructure, improve the quality and speed of provisioning, and standardize and consolidate our service model. Since migrating to AWS, we’ve cut our global data center costs by 27% and built a new internal cloud competence team within only two years,\" said Ali Khosravi, head of Global Technology Operation at Clariant. \"As a global company operating out of Switzerland and running on the world’s leading cloud, we welcome the launch of the new AWS Europe (Zurich) Region to even better serve the needs of our business and customers around the world.\" iNovitas, a leading Swiss provider of cloud-based image services, delivers a high-resolution, geo-referenced 3D panoramic image environment (3D street images) to simplify infrastructure maintenance and management. “We chose AWS as our preferred cloud provider at a very early stage as it provided the highest reliability, flexibility, and scalability required to develop and run our services,” said Joel Burkhard, chief technology officer at iNovitas. “Since starting the business in 2011, we have relied on AWS services such as Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2 to build and scale our cloud-built business and digitize more than 77,000 kilometers of streets, 11,000 kilometers of rail tracks, and 200 kilometers of river banks across Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and Sweden, resulting in the processing and storing of more than 2.6 petabytes of image data. For a small enterprise with limited technology resources like ours, the benefits of AWS are compelling. Using AWS allows us to innovate quickly and access machine learning technologies such as Amazon Rekognition for image and video analysis that would otherwise be unavailable to us or too costly. The new AWS Region opens up new opportunities for us to serve more customers, especially those who prefer to keep their data stored in Switzerland.” Global luxury group Richemont—owner of the Cartier, Montblanc, IWC Schaffhausen, and Van Cleef & Arpels brands—moved its entire enterprise information technology (IT) infrastructure, including 120 SAP instances, to AWS, its preferred cloud provider. “AWS, with its depth and breadth of services, enables us to provide our customers with new digital experiences faster, including personalized storefronts and styling services, video chat consultations featuring fashion shows customized to the shoppers’ tastes, and tailored offers for early access to new items before they hit stores,” said Kim Hartlev, group chief information officer at Richemont. “We are delighted that AWS has brought a new infrastructure Region to our home market in Switzerland because it will be a major booster for scaling, curating, and further personalizing the shopping experiences for our customers.” Swisscom, a leading telecom company in Switzerland, selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider to accelerate its digital transformation strategy and support its move toward a built-for-the cloud 5G network. Swisscom is also an AWS Partner with deep technical and industry expertise, helping Swiss companies move to the cloud and adopt advanced technologies. “Our customers have always relied on Swisscom to connect them to the world using the best technology available,” said Frank Dederichs, chief technology information officer at Swisscom. “We have enjoyed a successful relationship with AWS for several years, not only as a cloud and technology provider, but also as a trusted and inspiring partner, delivering top-grade cloud services to our business customers. The opening of the new AWS Europe (Zurich) Region with the same high levels of data protection, user privacy, and regulatory compliance as their other Regions around the world is great news for us and to all tech companies in Switzerland.” Swisstopo, Switzerland's federal mapping agency, adopted AWS in 2010 to empower its digital geographic information system and services for over 80,000 daily users across the country. “Thanks to automatic provisioning, we were able to scale horizontally on demand and achieved a decrease in the setup time for hardware from 10 weeks to under one hour,” said Hanspeter Christ, head of GeoIT at Swisstopo. “The new AWS Region will open up new possibilities to provide users with even faster access to our services and best-in-class experiences with the additional choice to host data in Switzerland.” Founded in 2014, deep-tech startup Verity provides an automated inventory management system powered by self-flying drones, which sets a new standard for big-box retailers, third-party logistics providers, and manufacturers. “Our system uses drones to collect and process accurate inventory data at the edge—up to 10 gigabytes per flight per drone—and uses AWS to transfer data to the cloud,” said Raffaello D'Andrea, founder of Verity. “With the ability to identify discrepancies between data stored in a customer’s warehouse management system and where inventory actually is or isn’t in the warehouse, customers gain valuable insights that enable greater operational efficiencies and help cut labor and equipment costs, eliminate errors and disruptions, and reduce waste and CO2 emissions. AWS's powerful APIs and managed services have helped us take our business to the next level and scale fast. Using AWS’s technology services, Verity is making the zero-error warehouse a reality for our clients.” Switzerland-based AWS Partners also welcome the AWS Europe (Zurich) Region The AWS Partner Network (APN) includes tens of thousands of independent software vendors (ISVs) and systems integrators (SIs) around the world. AWS Partners build innovative solutions and services on AWS, and the APN helps by providing business, technical, marketing, and go-to-market support to customers. AWS SIs, consulting partners, and ISVs help enterprise and public sector customers migrate to AWS, deploy mission-critical applications, and provide a full range of monitoring, automation, and management services for customers' cloud environments. Examples of Switzerland-based AWS Partners include 1plusX (a TripleLift Company), Amanox Solutions, amazee.io, Appway, Avaloq, Beekeeper, BSI, copebit, crealogix, dbi services, ELCA Cloud Services SA, Finnova, Ingram Micro, Nexthink, Secutix, SmartWave, SoftwareONE, Swisscom, TD SYNNEX, Trivadis, WebGate Consulting, and Zühlke Technology Group. For the full list of AWS Partners, visit aws.amazon.com/partners. ELCA Cloud Services SA, known as ELCA, focuses on cloud and workplace managed services and is part of the ELCA Group, one of the largest independent Swiss full-service IT providers. “The opening of the new AWS Region is a pivotal moment in the acceleration of transformation and innovation for Swiss companies, particularly those in highly regulated industries such as financial services, health care, and government. It is key for ELCA to be able to benefit from AWS’s cloud portfolio in Switzerland to help us best serve our customers’ needs,” said Maxime Claux, vice president at ELCA. “The new AWS Region will unleash the full potential of the cloud for Swiss public sector organizations, midsize businesses, and enterprises. It will enable them to securely deploy applications, increase efficiencies, improve performance, and meet data residency requirements. AWS’s continued investment will also help ELCA to expand our business and train local cloud professionals to further support Switzerland’s digital transformation efforts.” SoftwareONE is a global leader in software and cloud portfolio management with more than 9,000 technology experts in more than 90 countries providing end-to-end software and cloud technology solutions. “Like AWS, SoftwareONE has been a pioneer in shaping the way customers deploy technology and innovate around the world. We are proud to work closely with AWS to help our customers strengthen their reliability, flexibility, scalability, security, and compliance in the cloud,” said Reinhard Waldinger, president at SoftwareONE EMEA. “As a global company headquartered in Switzerland, we welcome the continued growth and investment AWS is making in the region as it demonstrates how important Switzerland is in the global technology space. We look forward to empowering our customers with the scale and agility of AWS Cloud to further thrive and grow while improving security and cloud skills.” AWS investment in Switzerland Swiss companies have been among the earliest adopters of cloud services in Europe, and as the number of Swiss customers has grown, so has the size of AWS’s presence in the country. The new AWS Europe (Zurich) Region is the latest in AWS’s ongoing investment in Switzerland. In order to support its rapidly growing customer base across the country, AWS opened two offices in Switzerland, Zurich (2016) and Geneva (2017), and created new jobs, including technical experts, solutions architects, technical account managers, partner managers, systems engineers, and professional services experts. AWS established Points of Presence in Zurich (2017 and 2019), connecting Switzerland to the AWS network backbone and offering customers access to AWS services like Amazon CloudFront and AWS Direct Connect, among others. Amazon CloudFront is a highly secure and programmable content delivery network that accelerates the delivery of data, videos, applications, and application programming interfaces (APIs) to users worldwide with low latency and high transfer speeds. AWS Direct Connect enables customers to establish private connectivity between AWS and their data center, office, or colocation environment. This can reduce network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience. In December 2019, AWS launched AWS Outposts in Switzerland. AWS Outposts offers customers and partners in Switzerland access to the same AWS infrastructure services, APIs, and tools in virtually any data center, colocation space, or on-premises facility for a truly consistent hybrid experience. AWS Outposts enables customers and partners to run key AWS services in their own data centers while connecting to a broad range of AWS global infrastructure services. AWS continues to invest in the upskilling of local developers, students, and the next generation of IT leaders in Switzerland through programs like AWS re/Start, AWS Academy, and AWS Educate. These programs help learners of all backgrounds and experiences prepare for careers in the cloud. From higher education courses to full-time training programs and self-paced learning content, AWS education programs offer access to the skills needed to begin or grow a cloud career. Several universities in Switzerland, including Fachhochschule Luzern, Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz (FHNW), and Technische Berufsschule Zürich, have delivered AWS Academy courses as part of their curriculum. To date, 32 Swiss institutions participated in the AWS Academy program, and 16 offered classes in 2022. As part of its AWS re/Start program, AWS collaborates with Swiss educational and training providers like Powerhouse Lausanne and Powercoders on programs targeted to unemployed and underemployed individuals. The programs prepare individuals with no technical experience for careers in the cloud and connect them to potential employers. AWS has partnered with the ICT Berufsbildung Schweiz association for several years to deliver vocational education and training to Swiss workers. In 2020, AWS supported the association in its efforts to rework the national IT curriculum by helping develop new cloud modules that have been taught to every Swiss IT apprentice (3,000 per year) since 2021. To continue fostering entrepreneurship in Switzerland, AWS offers startups and small businesses support through the AWS Activate program. This program provides access to guidance, one-on-one time with AWS experts, web-based training, self-paced labs, customer support, third-party offers, and an opportunity to access up to $100,000 in AWS service credits—all at no charge. AWS also works with venture capital investors, startup accelerators, and incubators to help startups grow in the cloud. In Switzerland, this includes fostering entrepreneurs such as the Swiss Startup Association and Swisspreneur, as well as venture capital firms like btov, F10, Redalpine, Verve Ventures, and Wingman Ventures to support the rapid growth of their portfolio companies. Commitment to sustainability Amazon is committed to becoming a more sustainable business and reaching net-zero carbon across its operations by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement, as part of The Climate Pledge. Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge and became its first signatory in 2019. As part of its Climate Pledge commitment, Amazon is on a path to power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the original 2030 target. Amazon is the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, and as of the end of 2021, the company reached 85% renewable energy across its business. See Amazon's public methodology for more on its approach. Organizations that move compute workloads to AWS can benefit from the net effect of Amazon’s sustainability efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. Compared to the computing resources of the average European company, AWS infrastructure is up to five times more energy efficient. About Amazon Web Services For over 15 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud offering. AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any cloud workload, and it now has more than 200 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 90 Availability Zones within 28 geographic regions, with announced plans for 21 more Availability Zones and seven more AWS Regions in Australia, Canada, India, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, and Thailand.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced the identification and disruption of three counterfeiting operations in China thanks to local Public Security Bureaus (PSB) and intel provided by Amazon’s Counterfeit Crimes Unit (CCU). Law enforcement seized more than 240,000 counterfeit items in the Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces. The items were imitations of luxury, sports, and automotive brands. The seizure prevented the fake products from reaching Amazon customers or being sold elsewhere in the supply chain. These seizures of counterfeit goods based on intelligence from Amazon follow similar actions by law enforcement in England and the U.S. that took place in California and New Jersey. “Our efforts to identify and dismantle counterfeit organizations are working,” said Kebharu Smith, associate general counsel and director of the Amazon Counterfeit Crimes Unit. “We appreciate law enforcement acting on our referrals and thoroughly pursuing these cases. These outcomes protect Amazon customers, disrupt the counterfeit supply chain, and halt their illicit proceeds.” Information and intelligence provided by Amazon’s CCU to local authorities, including the locations of warehouses and manufacturing facilities, led to the successful identification and disruption of three major counterfeit operations and their upstream suppliers. The main suspects have been detained by local PSBs for further investigation. Any infringing listings connected to these cases have been eliminated. Upon searching the facilities, law enforcement seized more than 130,000 counterfeit car accessories and fake brand labels that infringed on many brands’ intellectual property including BMW, Porsche, and General Motors; nearly 80,000 counterfeit luxury products; and more than 30,000 pieces of counterfeit clothing and fake brand labels that infringed on Hugo Boss, Puma and Under Armour’s intellectual property among others. This latest effort adds to the more than 3 million counterfeit products Amazon identified, seized, and appropriately disposed of last year, which included counterfeits sent to Amazon’s fulfillment centers in an unsuccessful attempt to sell to Amazon customers. Amazon has also cooperated with local PSBs in China on operations involving bad actors that illegally purchased government-issued personal identities and business licenses in an attempt to register fraudulent Amazon seller accounts. As a result, 84 individuals were detained. Last year, Amazon stopped more than 2.5 million attempts by bad actors around the world to create new selling accounts, preventing them from listing a single product for sale. Amazon works across the globe to fight counterfeiters, recently filing joint lawsuits with well-known brands, including Cartier, GE Appliances, WWE, Salvatore Ferragamo, and FELCO. Through its partnership with brands of all sizes, Amazon’s CCU constantly uncovers new approaches counterfeiters take to try to deceive customers and evade the law. The CCU uses that intelligence to equip law enforcement to pursue bad actors. In 2021, the CCU sued or referred for investigation over 600 criminals in the U.S., UK, EU, and China. “There is no place for fraud on Amazon,” said Dharmesh Mehta, vice president of Amazon’s Worldwide Selling Partner Services. “The production and sale of counterfeit goods poses serious harm to the intellectual property rights of the brands involved, as well as to the legitimate interests of honest sellers—and the customers who place their trust in our stores. While we are proud of the progress we have made, we will not stop until we drive counterfeits to zero, and we will continue to invest and innovate until we get there.” To learn more information about how Amazon’s tools protect brands and fight counterfeiters, click here.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), une société Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ : AMZN), a annoncé aujourd’hui le lancement de la région AWS Europe (Zurich). À compter d'aujourd'hui, les développeurs, startups, entrepreneurs et entreprises, ainsi que les organisations gouvernementales, d'éducation et à but non lucratif, disposeront d'un choix plus étendu pour exécuter leurs applications et desservir les utilisateurs finaux depuis des centres de données situés en Suisse, utilisant des technologies AWS avancées pour favoriser l’innovation. AWS a par ailleurs publié une étude d'impact économique estimant que les dépenses de la société pour la construction et l’exploitation de la nouvelle région soutiendront la création de plus de 2 500 emplois à temps plein par an en moyenne dans des entreprises externes dans la chaîne logistique suisse des centres de données, avec un investissement prévu de 5,9 milliards de dollars (5,9 milliards de francs suisses) jusqu’en 2036. La région AWS Europe (Zurich) contribuera par ailleurs au produit intérieur brut (PIB) de la Suisse à hauteur d'un montant estimé à 16,3 milliards de dollars (16,3 milliards de francs suisses) au cours des 15 prochaines années. Pour plus d’informations sur AWS Global Infrastructure, rendez-vous sur aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure. « Des startups aux organisations gouvernementales, en passant par les entreprises moyennes et les grandes entreprises, des milliers d’organisations commerciales, à but non lucratif et du secteur public dans toute la Suisse mobilisent leurs utilisateurs finaux et se développent à l'échelle mondiale avec l’aide d’AWS », a déclaré Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice-président des services d'infrastructure chez AWS. « Avec la nouvelle région AWS Europe (Zurich), nous disposons de sept régions AWS et de 21 zones de disponibilité dans toute l’Europe, en Irlande, à Francfort, Londres, Milan, Paris, Stockholm et maintenant Zurich. Il s’agit là d’une poursuite de notre investissement pour accompagner les clients de tous types, aider les startups à se développer et à croître, contribuer au développement des compétences techniques et aider les organisations à créer des applications basées sur le Cloud qui réinventent la notion de service pour les utilisateurs finaux. » « Nous nous réjouissons qu’AWS continue d’investir en Suisse, créant de nouvelles opportunités pour les entreprises et les citoyens de tirer parti de technologies Cloud innovantes », a déclaré Dieter Egli, conseiller d'État et chef du département Économie et Affaires intérieures du canton d'Argovie, en Suisse. « L’ouverture de la nouvelle région d’infrastructure AWS constitue une avancée majeure pour nos entreprises régionales et l’agenda de transformation numérique, qui continuera à promouvoir et accélérer l'introduction rapide de nouvelles solutions numériques sur notre site technologique et d’ingénierie au cœur de l’Europe. » Avec le lancement de la région AWS Europe (Zurich), AWS dispose de 90 zones de disponibilité dans 28 régions géographiques, avec des plans annoncés de lancement de 21 zones de disponibilité supplémentaires et sept autres régions AWS en Australie, au Canada, en Inde, en Israël, en Nouvelle-Zélande, en Espagne et en Thaïlande. Les régions AWS sont composées de zones de disponibilité qui mettent l’infrastructure dans des emplacements géographiques séparés et distincts. Septième région AWS en Europe, la région AWS Europe (Zurich) comprend trois zones de disponibilité. Les zones de disponibilité sont situées suffisamment loin l’une de l’autre pour assurer la continuité des opérations des clients, mais suffisamment proches pour offrir une faible latence pour les applications à haute disponibilité utilisant plusieurs zones de disponibilité. Chaque zone de disponibilité dispose d’une alimentation, d’un refroidissement et d’une sécurité physique indépendants, et est connectée via des réseaux redondants, à très faible latence. Les clients AWS axés sur la haute disponibilité peuvent concevoir leurs applications pour qu’elles s’exécutent dans de multiples zones de disponibilité afin d’obtenir une tolérance aux pannes encore meilleure. Le lancement de la région AWS Europe (Zurich) permettra aux clients locaux avec des exigences de résidence des données de conserver leurs données en toute sécurité en Suisse, tout en offrant aux clients une latence encore plus faible à l'échelle du pays. AWS prévoit d’investir un montant estimé à 5,9 milliards de dollars (environ 5,9 milliards de francs suisses) en Suisse au cours des 15 prochaines années via la nouvelle région AWS Europe (Zurich). Cet investissement inclut des dépenses en capital pour la construction de centres de données, des dépenses opérationnelles liées aux dépenses courantes pour les services publics et les installations, et l’achat de biens et services à des entreprises régionales. On estime par ailleurs que l’investissement soutiendra la création de plus de 2 500 emplois par an en moyenne durant cette période. Ces emplois, y compris les emplois liés à la construction, à l'entretien des installations, à l’ingénierie, aux télécommunications, et ceux au sein de l'économie du pays dans son ensemble, feront partie de la chaîne logistique d’AWS en Suisse. La construction et l’exploitation de l’infrastructure d’AWS en Suisse devrait par ailleurs contribuer au PIB de la Suisse à hauteur d'un montant estimé à 16,3 milliards de dollars (environ 16,3 milliards de francs suisses) au cours des 15 prochaines années. Les clients accueillent favorablement la région AWS Europe (Zurich) Plus de 10 000 clients en Suisse rejoignent des millions de clients actifs qui utilisent AWS chaque mois dans plus de 190 pays à travers le monde. Parmi les petites et grandes entreprises suisses qui utilisent AWS pour exécuter leurs charges de travail critiques pour réaliser des économies, accélérer l’innovation et écourter les délais de commercialisation figurent Buildigo, Clariant, Crisalix, Datwyler, Dentsu Tracking, Explora Journeys, Fisch Asset Management, GSR Zug, Helvetia Group, Hexagon, Hilti, Idorsia, iNovitas, Invit Travel, iptiQ, Klarpay, Kudelski Group, lastminute.com, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, OC Oerlikon Corporation AG, Partners Group, Richemont, Ringier, Swiss Marketplace Group, Swiss Re, Swisscom, Syngenta, Ubique, u-blox et Zurich Insurance Group. Parmi les plus importantes startups du pays qui ont bâti leurs entreprises sur AWS pour évoluer rapidement et étendre leur présence géographique en quelques minutes figurent ANYbotics, Edgelab, FemTec Health (anciennement AVA), flovtec, GenomSys, holo|one, RetinAI, Smallpdf, SonarSource et Verity. Parmi les organisations du secteur public qui utilisent AWS pour transformer les services qu’elles offrent aux citoyens suisses figurent le centre d’IA de l’École polytechnique fédérale de Zurich (ETH Zürich), BERNMOBIL, EF Education First, Radiotelevisione svizzera (RSI), l'Office fédéral de topographie (Swisstopo) et La Poste Suisse. Clariant, l’une des plus importantes entreprises de chimie de spécialités au monde, relève des défis majeurs, notamment en matière d’efficacité énergétique, de matières premières renouvelables, de mobilité zéro émission et de conservation des ressources finies. Entre 2020 et 2022, Clariant a migré vers AWS ses centres de données régionaux répartis à travers le monde. « Lorsque nous avons décidé de passer de services gérés sur site au Cloud, nous avons cherché une solution souple mais néanmoins économique pour soutenir notre modèle d’affaires ainsi que nos activités de fusion et acquisition. AWS nous a permis de construire une infrastructure plus sécurisée, d’améliorer la qualité et la rapidité de l’approvisionnement et de standardiser et consolider notre modèle de service. Depuis notre migration vers AWS, nous avons réduit de 27 % nos coûts mondiaux pour les centres de données et formé une nouvelle équipe interne de compétences Cloud en seulement deux ans », a déclaré Ali Khosravi, responsable de l’exploitation technologique mondiale chez Clariant. « En tant qu’entreprise internationale opérant à partir de la Suisse et utilisant le principal Cloud au monde, nous nous réjouissons du lancement de la nouvelle région AWS Europe (Zurich) en vue de répondre encore mieux aux besoins de nos entreprises et clients à travers le monde. » iNovitas, un fournisseur suisse de premier plan de services d'imagerie basés sur le Cloud, propose un environnement d'images panoramiques 3D haute résolution à référence spatiale (images de rue en 3D) pour simplifier la maintenance et la gestion des infrastructures. « Nous avons choisi AWS comme fournisseur Cloud préféré à un stade très précoce car il nous a fourni la fiabilité, la flexibilité et l'extensibilité les plus élevées requises pour développer et exploiter nos services », a affirmé Joel Burkhard, directeur de la technologie chez iNovitas. « Depuis les débuts de l’entreprise en 2011, nous nous sommes appuyés sur des services AWS comme Amazon S3 et Amazon EC2 pour développer et dimensionner notre activité basée sur le Cloud et numériser plus de 77 000 kilomètres de rues, 11 000 kilomètres de voies ferrées et 200 kilomètres de berges de rivières en Suisse, en Allemagne, en Autriche et en Suède, conduisant au traitement et au stockage de plus de 2,6 pétaoctets de données d'images. Pour une petite entreprise avec des ressources technologiques limitées comme la nôtre, les avantages d’AWS sont incontestables. L’utilisation d’AWS nous permet d’innover rapidement et d’accéder à des technologies d’apprentissage automatique comme Amazon Rekognition pour l’analyse d’images et de vidéos qui, sans cela, aurait été inaccessibles pour nous ou trop coûteuses. La nouvelle région AWS nous donne de nouvelles occasions de servir davantage de clients, en particulier ceux qui préfèrent conserver le stockage de leurs données en Suisse. » Propriétaire des marques Cartier, Montblanc, IWC Schaffhausen et Van Cleef & Arpels, le groupe mondial de luxe Richemont a transféré toute son infrastructure informatique, dont 120 instances SAP, vers AWS, son fournisseur Cloud préféré. « Grâce à l’étendue et à l’éventail de ses services, AWS nous permet de fournir à nos clients de nouvelles expériences numériques plus rapidement, dont des vitrines et des services de stylisme personnalisés, des consultations vidéo intégrant des défilés de mode personnalisés en fonction des goûts des acheteurs, ainsi que des offres adaptées pour un accès anticipé à de nouveaux articles avant qu'ils n’arrivent dans les magasins », a expliqué Kim Hartlev, directeur des systèmes d'information du groupe Richemont. « Nous sommes ravis qu’AWS ait créé une nouvelle région d’infrastructure sur notre marché domestique en Suisse car ce sera un stimulant majeur pour développer, organiser et personnaliser davantage les expériences d’achat de nos clients. » Swisscom, une société de télécommunications de premier plan en Suisse, a choisi AWS comme fournisseur Cloud préféré pour accélérer sa stratégie de transformation numérique et accompagner son cheminement vers un réseau 5G conçu pour le Cloud. Swisscom est également un partenaire AWS avec une vaste expertise technique et sectorielle, aidant les entreprises suisses à migrer vers le Cloud et à adopter des technologies avancées. « Nos clients ont toujours compté sur Swisscom pour les relier au monde en utilisant la meilleure technologie disponible », a déclaré Frank Dederichs, directeur des technologies de l'information chez Swisscom. « Nous entretenons une relation fructueuse avec AWS depuis des années, non seulement en tant que fournisseur Cloud et de technologies, mais aussi en tant que partenaire de confiance et inspirant, proposant des services Cloud de premier plan à nos clients commerciaux. L’ouverture de la nouvelle région AWS Europe (Zurich) avec les mêmes niveaux élevés de protection des données, de respect de la vie privée et de conformité réglementaire que les autres régions à travers le monde est une excellente nouvelle pour nous et pour toutes les entreprises de technologie en Suisse. » Swisstopo, l'organisme national de cartographie de la Suisse, a adopté AWS en 2010 en vue de dynamiser ses services et son système d'information géographique numérique pour plus de 80 000 utilisateurs quotidiens dans le pays. « Grâce au provisionnement automatique, nous avons été en mesure d'évoluer horizontalement à la demande et bénéficié d’une réduction du temps de configuration du matériel, qui est passé de 10 semaines à moins d’une heure », a indiqué Hanspeter Christ, responsable de GeoIT chez Swisstopo. « La nouvelle région AWS offrira de nouvelles possibilités de fournir aux utilisateurs un accès encore plus rapide à nos services et les meilleures expériences avec le choix supplémentaire d’héberger leurs données en Suisse. » Fondée en 2014, la startup deep-tech Verity propose un système automatisé de gestion des stocks reposant sur des drones autonomes, qui établit une nouvelle norme pour les détaillants de la grande distribution, les prestataires logistiques tiers et les fabricants. « Notre système utilise des drones pour collecter et traiter des données de stocks précises en périphérie – jusqu’à 10 gigaoctets par vol et par drone – et utilise AWS pour transférer les données vers le Cloud », a expliqué Raffaello D'Andrea, fondateur de Verity. « Avec la possibilité d’identifier les différences entre les données stockées dans le système de gestion d'entrepôt d’un client et l’endroit où se trouve ou ne se trouve pas le stock dans l'entrepôt, les clients obtiennent des informations précieuses permettant une meilleure efficacité opérationnelle et bénéficient d’une réduction des frais de main-d'œuvre et d'équipement, d’une élimination des erreurs et perturbations et d’une réduction des déchets et des émissions de CO2. Les puissants services gérés et API d’AWS nous ont aidés à faire passer notre entreprise au niveau supérieur et à croître rapidement. En utilisant les services technologiques d’AWS, Verity fait de l’entrepôt zéro erreur une réalité pour nos clients. » Les partenaires AWS basés en Suisse accueillent également favorablement la région AWS Europe (Zurich) Le réseau de partenaires AWS comprend des dizaines de milliers de fournisseurs de logiciels indépendants et d’intégrateurs de systèmes dans le monde entier. Les partenaires AWS construisent des solutions et services innovants sur AWS, et le réseau de partenaires AWS aide en offrant un support commercial, technique, marketing et de mise en marché aux clients. Les intégrateurs de systèmes, partenaires conseils et fournisseurs de logiciels indépendants d’AWS aident les clients grandes entreprises et du secteur public à migrer vers AWS, à déployer des applications critiques et à fournir une gamme complète de services de surveillance, d’automatisation et de gestion pour les environnements Cloud des clients. Comme exemples de partenaires AWS basés en Suisse, on peut citer 1plusX (une société TripleLift), Amanox Solutions, amazee.io, Appway, Avaloq, Beekeeper, BSI, copebit, crealogix, dbi services, ELCA Cloud Services SA, Finnova, Ingram Micro, Nexthink, Secutix, SmartWave, SoftwareONE, Swisscom, TD SYNNEX, Trivadis, WebGate Consulting et Zühlke Technology Group. Pour connaître la liste complète des partenaires AWS, veuillez consulter aws.amazon.com/partners. ELCA Cloud Services SA, connue sous le nom d’ELCA, se concentre sur les services gérés pour le Cloud et l’environnement de travail et fait partie du groupe ELCA, l’un des plus importants prestataires informatiques indépendants à service complet en Suisse. « L’ouverture de la nouvelle région AWS constitue un moment charnière dans l’accélération de la transformation et de l’innovation pour les entreprises suisses, en particulier celles opérant dans des secteurs très réglementés comme les services financiers, les soins de santé et l’administration. Il est essentiel qu’ELCA puisse bénéficier du portefeuille Cloud d’AWS en Suisse pour nous aider à répondre au mieux aux besoins de nos clients », a affirmé Maxime Claux, vice-président d’ELCA. « La nouvelle région AWS libérera le plein potentiel du Cloud pour les organisations du secteur public, les moyennes entreprises et les grandes entreprises suisses. Elle leur permettra de déployer des applications en toute sécurité, d’améliorer leur efficacité et leurs performances et de satisfaire aux exigences de résidence des données. L’investissement continu d’AWS aidera également ELCA à étendre nos activités et à former des professionnels du Cloud locaux pour soutenir encore plus les efforts de transformation numérique de la Suisse. » SoftwareONE est un leader mondial de la gestion de logiciels et de portefeuilles Cloud, avec plus de 9 000 experts en technologie dans plus de 90 pays proposant des solutions technologiques de bout en bout pour les logiciels et le Cloud. « Tout comme AWS, SoftwareONE a été précurseur pour façonner la manière dont les clients déploient la technologie et innovent à travers le monde. Nous sommes fiers de travailler en étroite collaboration avec AWS pour aider nos clients à améliorer leur fiabilité, leur flexibilité, leur extensibilité, leur sécurité et leur conformité sur le Cloud », a indiqué Reinhard Waldinger, président de SoftwareONE EMEA. « En tant qu’entreprise internationale qui a son siège social en Suisse, nous nous félicitons de la croissance et de l’investissement continus d’AWS dans la région, car cela démontre l’importance de la Suisse dans le secteur mondial des technologies. Nous sommes impatients d’offrir à nos clients l’envergure et l'agilité d’AWS Cloud pour qu’ils puissent continuer de prospérer et de croître tout en améliorant la sécurité et les compétences en matière de Cloud. » Investissement d’AWS en Suisse Les entreprises suisses ont été parmi les premières à adopter les services infonuagiques en Europe et, à mesure que le nombre de clients suisses augmentait, il en était de même pour la présence d’AWS dans le pays. La nouvelle région AWS Europe (Zurich) est la dernière composante de l'investissement continu d’AWS en Suisse. Afin d’accompagner sa clientèle en croissance rapide dans le pays, AWS a ouvert deux bureaux en Suisse, à Zurich en 2016 et à Genève en 2017, et créé de nouveaux emplois, notamment d’experts techniques, d’architectes de solutions, de responsables techniques de comptes, d’associés-gérants, d’ingénieurs système et d’experts des services professionnels. AWS a établi des points de présence à Zurich (2017 et 2019), connectant la Suisse au réseau fédérateur d’AWS et offrant aux clients un accès à des services AWS comme Amazon CloudFront et AWS Direct Connect. Amazon CloudFront est un réseau de distribution de contenus hautement sécurisé et programmable qui accélère la livraison de données, vidéos, applications et interfaces de programmation d’applications (API) aux utilisateurs dans le monde entier, avec une faible latence et des vitesses de transfert élevées. AWS Direct Connect permet aux clients d’établir une connectivité privée entre AWS et leur centre de données, leur siège ou leur environnement de colocation. Cela peut réduire les coûts de réseau, augmenter le débit de bande passante et fournir une expérience réseau plus constante. En décembre 2019, AWS a lancé des AWS Outposts en Suisse. Les AWS Outposts permettent aux clients et partenaires en Suisse d’accéder aux mêmes services d’infrastructure, API et outils AWS dans pratiquement n’importe quel centre de données, espace de colocation ou installation sur site pour une expérience hybride vraiment cohérente. Les AWS Outposts permettent aux clients et partenaires d’exécuter des services AWS clés dans leurs propres centres de données, tout en connectant à un large éventail de services d’infrastructure mondiaux d’AWS. AWS continue d’investir dans le perfectionnement professionnel des développeurs et étudiants locaux et de la prochaine génération de responsables informatiques en Suisse via des programmes comme AWS re/Start, AWS Academy et AWS Educate. Ces programmes aident les apprenants de tous horizons, quelle que soit leur expérience, à se préparer pour des carrières dans le Cloud. Des cours d'enseignement supérieur aux programmes de formation à plein temps et aux contenus d’apprentissage à son propre rythme, les programmes d'éducation d’AWS donnent accès aux aptitudes requises pour démarrer ou faire progresser une carrière dans le Cloud. Plusieurs universités en Suisse, dont la Haute École de Lucerne, la Haute école spécialisée du Nord-Ouest de la Suisse (FHNW) et l’École professionnelle technique de Zurich, ont proposé des cours AWS Academy dans le cadre de leur curriculum. À ce jour, 32 institutions suisses ont participé au programme AWS Academy, et 16 ont proposé des cours en 2022. Pour son programme AWS re/Start, AWS collabore avec des prestataires d'enseignement et de formations suisses comme la Powerhouse Lausanne et Powercoders dans le cadre de programmes ciblant les personnes sans emploi et sous-employées. Les programmes préparent les individus sans expérience technique à des carrières dans le Cloud et les mettent en relation avec des employeurs potentiels. AWS est associée à l’association ICT-Formation professionnelle Suisse depuis plusieurs années pour proposer des formations et un enseignement professionnels aux travailleurs suisses. En 2020, AWS a soutenu l’association dans ses efforts visant à repenser le curriculum informatique national en contribuant au développement de nouveaux modules Cloud qui sont enseignés à chaque élève suisse dans l’informatique (3 000 par an) depuis 2021. Pour continuer à favoriser l'entrepreneuriat en Suisse, AWS propose aux startups et aux petites entreprises un soutien via le programme AWS Activate. Ce programme donne accès à des conseils, du temps en tête-à-tête avec des experts AWS, des formations en ligne, des ateliers d'autoformation, un support client, des offres de tiers, ainsi qu’une occasion d’accéder à une somme jusqu’à 100 000 dollars en crédits de service AWS, le tout gratuitement. AWS collabore par ailleurs avec des investisseurs en capital-risque, des accélérateurs de startups et des incubateurs pour aider les startups à se développer sur le Cloud. En Suisse, cela inclut la promotion d’entrepreneurs comme la Swiss Startup Association et Swisspreneur, ainsi que de sociétés de capital-risque comme btov, F10, Redalpine, Verve Ventures et Wingman Ventures pour accompagner la croissance rapide de leurs sociétés de portefeuille. Un engagement à l'égard du développement durable Amazon s’est engagée à devenir une entreprise plus durable et à atteindre la neutralité carbone dans toutes ses opérations d’ici 2040, 10 ans avant l’échéance de l'Accord de Paris, dans le cadre du Climate Pledge. Amazon a cofondé le Climate Pledge et est devenue son premier signataire en 2019. Dans le cadre de son engagement en faveur du Climate Pledge, Amazon est en bonne voie pour alimenter ses opérations avec 100 % d’énergie renouvelable d’ici 2025, cinq ans avant l'objectif initial de 2030. Amazon est le plus grand acheteur d’énergie renouvelable au monde et, fin 2021, l’entreprise a atteint 85 % d’énergie renouvelable dans l’ensemble de ses activités. Consultez la méthodologie publique d’Amazon pour en savoir plus sur son approche. Les organisations qui transfèrent des charges de travail informatiques vers AWS peuvent bénéficier de l’effet net des efforts de développement durable d’Amazon pour réduire leur empreinte carbone. En comparaison des ressources informatiques d’une entreprise européenne moyenne, l’infrastructure d’AWS est jusqu’à cinq fois plus efficace sur le plan énergétique. À propos d'Amazon Web Services Depuis plus de 15 ans, Amazon Web Services est l’offre Cloud la plus complète et la plus largement adoptée au monde. AWS n’a cessé d’étendre ses services pour prendre en charge pratiquement toutes les charges de travail sur le Cloud et propose désormais plus de 200 services complets pour le calcul, le stockage, les bases de données, la mise en réseau, l’analyse, l’apprentissage automatique et l’intelligence artificielle, l’Internet des objets, la téléphonie mobile, la sécurité, les solutions hybrides, les réalités virtuelle et augmentée, les médias, ainsi que le développement, le déploiement et la gestion d’applications à partir de 90 zones de disponibilité dans 28 régions géographiques, avec des plans annoncés pour 21 zones de disponibilité supplémentaires et sept autres régions AWS en Australie, au Canada, en Inde, en Israël, en Nouvelle-Zélande, en Espagne et en Thaïlande. Des millions de clients, notamment certaines des startups enregistrant la croissance la plus rapide, de très grandes entreprises et des agences gouvernementales de premier plan, font confiance à AWS pour gérer leur infrastructure, gagner en agilité et réduire leurs coûts.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), uma empresa da Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), anunciou hoje o lançamento da Região AWS Europa (Zurique). Com início hoje, desenvolvedores, startups, empreendedores e empreendimentos, bem como organizações governamentais, educacionais e sem fins lucrativos, terão uma opção ainda melhor para executar seus aplicativos e atender os usuários finais a partir de centros de dados localizados na Suíça, usando as tecnologias avançadas da AWS para impulsionar inovação. A AWS também divulgou um estudo do impacto econômico, estimando que o gasto da empresa na construção e operação da nova Região gerará uma média de mais de 2.500 empregos em período integral anualmente em negócios externos na cadeia de suprimento suíça de centros de dados, com um investimento planejado de $5,9 bilhões de dólares (5,9 bilhões de francos suíços) até 2036. A Região AWS Europa (Zurique) também adicionará um valor estimado de $16,3 bilhões de dólares (16,3 bilhões de francos suíços) ao produto interno bruto (PIB) da Suíça durante os próximos 15 anos. Para mais informações sobre a Infraestrutura Global da AWS, acesse aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure. “De startups e empresas de médio porte a empreendimentos e organizações governamentais, milhares de organizações comerciais, sem fins lucrativos e do setor público em toda a Suíça estão mobilizando seus usuários finais e crescendo globalmente com o suporte da AWS\", disse Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice-presidente de serviços de infraestrutura da AWS. \"Com a nova Região AWS Europa (Zurique), temos sete Regiões AWS e 21 zonas de disponibilidade na Europa: em Frankfurt, Irlanda, Londres, Milão, Paris, Estocolmo e, agora, Zurique. Isso é uma continuação do nosso investimento a fim de apoiar clientes de todos os tipos, ajudar startups a escalonar e crescer, possibilitar desenvolvimento de habilidades técnicas e ajudar as organizações a criar aplicativos operados na nuvem que reinventam serviços para os usuários finais\". \"Estamos contentes que a AWS continua investindo na Suíça, permitindo novas possibilidades para que os negócios e cidadãos aproveitem tecnologias inovadoras na nuvem\", disse Dieter Egli, conselheiro governamental e chefe do Departamento de Assuntos Econômicos e do Interior do cantão de Argóvia na Suíça. \"A abertura da nova Região de infraestrutura da AWS é um marco importante para nossos empreendimentos regionais e para a agenda de transformação digital que promoverá e acelerará ainda mais a rápida introdução de novas soluções digitais em nossa unidade de tecnologia e engenharia no coração da Europa\". Com o lançamento da Região AWS Europa (Zurique), a AWS chega a 90 zonas de disponibilidades em 28 áreas geográficas, com planos anunciados de lançar mais 21 zonas de disponibilidade e mais sete Regiões AWS na Austrália, no Canadá, na Índia, em Israel, na Nova Zelândia, na Espanha e na Tailândia. As Regiões AWS são compostas de zonas de disponibilidade que posicionam infraestrutura em localizações geográficas separadas e distintas. A Região AWS Europa (Zurique) consiste de três zonas de disponibilidade e é a sétima Região AWS na Europa. As zonas de disponibilidade são localizadas longe o suficiente umas das outras, apoiando a continuidade dos negócios dos clientes, mas perto bastante para fornecer baixa latência para aplicativos de alta disponibilidade que usam várias zonas de disponibilidade. Cada zona de disponibilidade tem energia, resfriamento e segurança física independentes, e está conectada por meio de redes de latência ultrabaixa e redundante. Os clientes da AWS focados em alta disponibilidade podem desenhar seus aplicativos para que sejam executados em várias zonas de disponibilidade para alcançar uma tolerância ainda maior contra falhas. O lançamento da Região AWS Europa (Zurique) permitirá que os clientes locais com requerimentos de residência de dados armazenem dados com segurança na Suíça, ao passo em que fornecerá aos clientes uma latência ainda menor em todo o país. A AWS planeja investir um valor estimado de $5,9 bilhões de dólares (aprox. 5,9 bilhões de francos suíços) na Suíça durante os próximos 15 anos através da nova Região AWS Europa (Zurique). Esse investimento inclui gastos de capital na construção de centros de dados, despesas operacionais relacionadas com custos constantes das instalações e contas de serviços públicos, e a compra de mercadorias e serviços de negócios regionais. Também estima-se que o investimento gerará uma média de mais de 2.500 empregos anualmente durante esse período. Esses empregos, incluindo construção, manutenção da instalação, engenharia, telecomunicações e também dentro do escopo econômico nacional mais amplo, farão parte da cadeia de suprimentos da AWS na Suíça. Estima-se, ademais, que a construção e a operação da infraestrutura da AWS na Suíça adicionarão $16,3 bilhões de dólares (aprox. 16,3 bilhões de francos suíços) ao PIB da Suíça nos próximos 15 anos. Os clientes dão as boas-vindas à Região AWS Europa (Zurique) Mais de 10.000 clientes na Suíça se juntam a milhões de clientes ativos que usam a AWS todo mês em mais de 190 países ao redor do mundo. Entre as empresas suíças de pequeno e grande porte que usam a AWS na execução das suas cargas de trabalho de missão crítica para gerar economias de custo, acelerar inovação e disparar o tempo de comercialização estão Buildigo, Clariant, Crisalix, Datwyler, Dentsu Tracking, Explora Journeys, Fisch Asset Management, GSR Zug, Helvetia Group, Hexagon, Hilti, Idorsia, iNovitas, Invit Travel, iptiQ, Klarpay, Kudelski Group, lastminute.com, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, OC Oerlikon Corporation AG, Partners Group, Richemont, Ringier, Swiss Marketplace Group, Swiss Re, Swisscom, Syngenta, Ubique, u-blox e Zurich Insurance Group. As principais startups do país que construíram seus negócios com base na AWS para escalonar rapidamente e expandir seu alcance geográfico em minutos incluem a ANYbotics, Edgelab, FemTec Health (anteriormente AVA), flovtec, GenomSys, holo|one, RetinAI, Smallpdf, SonarSource e Verity. Entre as organizações do setor público que usam a AWS para transformar os serviços que prestam aos cidadãos suíços estão o Centro de IA em Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH Zürich), a BERNMOBIL, a EF Education First, a Radiotelevisione svizzera (RSI), o Gabinete Federal de Topografia da Suíça (Swisstopo) e o Swiss Post. Como uma das principais empresas químicas especializadas do mundo, a Clariant lida com desafios importantes, incluindo eficiência de energia, matérias-primas renováveis, mobilidade sem emissão e conservação de recursos finitos. De 2020 a 2022, a Clariant migrou seus centros de dados regionais ao redor do mundo para a AWS. \"Ao decidir mudar dos serviços gerenciados no local para a nuvem, buscamos uma solução ágil, porém com custo-benefício para apoiar nosso modelo de negócios bem como nossas atividades de fusão e aquisição. Com a AWS, nos foi possível construir uma infraestrutura mais segura, melhorar a qualidade e a velocidade dos fornecimentos, além de padronizar e consolidar nosso modelo de serviços. Desde que migramos para a AWS, cortamos custos dos nossos centros de dados globais em 27% e formamos uma nova equipe interna de competência na nuvem em apenas dois anos\", afirmou Ali Khosravi, chefe de operação tecnológica global da Clariant. \"Como uma empresa global que opera a partir da Suíça e executa na principal nuvem mundial, apreciamos o lançamento da nova Região AWS Europa (Zurique) para atender ainda melhor as necessidades do nosso negócio e dos nossos clientes ao redor do mundo\". A iNovitas, principal provedora suíça de serviços de imagens na nuvem, entrega um ambiente de imagens panorâmicas 3D de alta resolução e com referência geográfica (imagens de ruas em 3D) para simplificar a manutenção e gestão de infraestruturas. \"Escolhemos a AWS como nosso provedor na nuvem preferido em um estágio bem cedo, pois oferecia a melhor a confiabilidade, flexibilidade e escalabilidade requerida para desenvolvermos e executarmos nossos serviços\", afirmou Joel Burkhard, diretor tecnológico da iNovitas. \"Desde o início dos negócios em 2011, contamos com os serviços da AWS, como Amazon S3 e Amazon EC2, para construir e escalonar nosso negócio construído na nuvem e digitalizar mais de 77.000 km de ruas, 11.000 km de vias ferroviárias e 200 km de margens fluviais na Suíça, Alemanha, Áustria e Suécia, resultando no processamento e armazenamento de mais de 2,6 petabytes de dados de imagens. Para um empreendimento pequeno com recursos tecnológicos limitados como o nosso, os benefícios oferecidos pela AWS são atrativos.

Investimento da AWS na Suíça As empresas suíças estão entre as primeiras a adotar os serviços na nuvem na Europa, e, com o crescimento do número de clientes suíços, cresceu também a presença da AWS no país. A nova Região AWS Europa (Zurique) é o mais recente investimento contínuo da AWS na Suíça. A fim de apoiar sua base de clientes em rápido crescimento em todo o país, a AWS abriu dois escritórios na Suíça (em Zurique em 2016, e em Genebra em 2017), e criou novos empregos, como para especialistas técnicos, arquitetos de soluções, gestores técnicos de contas, gestores de parceiros, engenheiros de sistemas e especialistas em serviços profissionais. A AWS estabeleceu pontos de presença em Zurique (2017 e 2019), conectando a Suíça ao cerne da rede da AWS e dando aos clientes acesso aos serviços da AWS, como Amazon CloudFront e AWS Direct Connect, entre outros. A Amazon CloudFront é uma rede de entrega de conteúdos altamente segura e programável, que acelera a entrega de dados, vídeos, aplicativos e interfaces de programação de aplicativos (APIs) aos usuários com baixa latência e altas velocidades de transferência mundialmente. A AWS Direct Connect permite que os clientes estabeleçam conectividade privada entre a AWS e seu centro de dados, escritório ou ambiente de colocação. Isso pode reduzir os custos de rede, aumentar a taxa de transferência da largura de banda e fornecer uma experiência de rede mais consistente. Em dezembro de 2019, a AWS lançou a AWS Outposts na Suíça. O AWS Outposts dá aos clientes e parceiros na Suíça acesso aos mesmos serviços de infraestrutura, APIs e ferramentas da AWS em basicamente qualquer centro de dados, espaço de colocação e instalação no local, fornecendo uma experiência híbrida verdadeiramente consistente. A AWS Outposts permite que os clientes e parceiros executem serviços importantes da AWS nos seus próprios centros de dados, ao passo em que conectam com uma ampla gama de serviços globais de infraestrutura da AWS. A AWS continua investindo na qualificação de desenvolvedores locais, de estudantes e da próxima geração de líderes de TI na Suíça por meio de programas como AWS re/Start, AWS Academy e AWS Educate. Esses programas ajudam alunos de todos os tipos e experiências a se prepararem para carreiras na nuvem. De cursos de ensino superior a programas de treinamento em período integral e conteúdo de aprendizado individualizado ao ritmo do aluno, os programas educativos da AWS dão acesso às habilidades necessárias para iniciar ou desenvolver uma carreira na nuvem. Várias universidades na Suíça, incluindo a Fachhochschule Luzern, Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz (FHNW) e Technische Berufsschule Zürich, oferecerem cursos da AWS Academy como parte do seu currículo. Até o momento, 32 instituições suíças participaram do programa da AWS Academy e 16 ofereceram aulas em 2022. Como parte do seu programa AWS re/Start, a AWS colabora com provedores educacionais e de treinamento da Suíça, como Powerhouse Lausanne e Powercoders em programas voltados para desempregados e subempregados. Os programas preparam os indivíduos sem experiência técnica para carreiras na nuvem e os conectam a possíveis empregadores. A AWS fechou parceria com a associação ICT Berufsbildung Schweiz por vários anos para fornecer educação e treinamento profissionalizante a trabalhadores suíços. Em 2020, a AWS apoiou a associação em seus esforços para reformular o currículo nacional de TI, ajudando a desenvolver novos módulos sobre tecnologia na nuvem, que são ensinados a todos os aprendizes de TI na Suíça (3.000 por ano) desde 2021. Para continuar promovendo empreendedorismo na Suíça, a AWS oferece apoio às startups e pequenos negócios através do programa AWS Activate. Esse programa dá acesso à orientação, consulta individualizada com especialistas da AWS, treinamento na web, laboratórios ao ritmo do participante, suporte ao cliente, ofertas de terceiros e a oportunidade de acessar até $100.000 em créditos de serviços da AWS, tudo sem custo nenhum. A AWS também trabalha com investidores de capital de risco, aceleradores de startups e incubadoras para ajudar as startups a crescer na nuvem. Na Suíça, isso inclui a promoção de empreendedores como a Swiss Startup Association e Swisspreneur, bem como empresas de capital de risco como btov, F10, Redalpine, Verve Ventures e Wingman Ventures, para apoiar o rápido crescimento das empresas do seu portfólio. Compromisso com a sustentabilidade A Amazon está comprometida em se tornar um negócio mais sustentável e atingir zero carbono líquido em suas operações até 2040, 10 anos antes do Acordo de Paris, como parte do The Climate Pledge (Compromisso Climático). A Amazon cofundou o Compromisso Climático e foi a primeira a assiná-lo em 2019. Como parte do comprometimento com o Compromisso Climático, a Amazon segue rumo a equipar suas operações com 100% de energia renovável até 2025, cinco anos antes da meta original, em 2030. A Amazon é a maior compradora corporativa de energia renovável do mundo e, no final de 2021, atingiu 85% de energia renovável em seus negócios. Consulte a metodologia pública da Amazon para saber mais sobre sua abordagem. As organizações que transferirem cargas de trabalho de informática para a AWS podem se beneficiar do efeito líquido dos esforços de sustentabilidade da Amazon em reduzir sua pegada de carbono. Comparada com os recursos computacionais de uma empresa comum europeia, a infraestrutura da AWS tem até cinco vezes mais eficiência de energia.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), ein Unternehmen von Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), gab heute die Einführung der Region AWS Europe (Zürich) bekannt. Ab heute stehen Entwicklern, Startups, Unternehmern und Unternehmen sowie Regierungs-, Bildungs- und Non-Profit-Organisationen noch mehr Auswahlmöglichkeiten zur Verfügung, um unter Nutzung fortschrittlicher AWS-Technologien zur Förderung von Innovationen ihre Anwendungen von Rechenzentren in der Schweiz aus zu betreiben und Endnutzer zu bedienen. Darüber hinaus hat AWS eine Studie über die wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen veröffentlicht, in der prognostiziert wird, dass die Ausgaben des Unternehmens für den Bau und den Betrieb der neuen Region mit einer geplanten Investition in Höhe von 5,9 Milliarden US-Dollar (5,9 Milliarden Schweizer Franken) bis zum Jahr 2036 jährlich durchschnittlich mehr als 2.500 Vollzeitarbeitsplätze bei externen Unternehmen in der Schweizer Lieferkette für Rechenzentren schaffen werden. Die Region AWS Europe (Zürich) wird in den nächsten 15 Jahren zudem geschätzte 16,3 Milliarden Dollar (16,3 Milliarden Schweizer Franken) zum Bruttoinlandsprodukt (BIP) der Schweiz beitragen. Weitere Informationen über AWS Global Infrastructure finden Sie unter aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure. „Von Startups und mittelständischen Unternehmen bis hin zu Konzernen und Regierungsorganisationen beziehen Tausende von kommerziellen, gemeinnützigen und öffentlichen Organisationen in der Schweiz ihre Endnutzer ein und verzeichnen mit der Unterstützung von AWS globales Wachstum“, so Prasad Kalyanaraman, Vice President of Infrastructure Services bei AWS. „Mit der neuen Region AWS Europe (Zürich) verfügen wir über sieben AWS Regionen und 21 Availabilty Zones in ganz Europa in Frankfurt, Irland, London, Mailand, Paris, Stockholm und jetzt auch Zürich. Damit investieren wir weiter in die Unterstützung von Kunden aller Art, helfen Startups bei der Skalierung und dem Wachstum, ermöglichen den Aufbau von technischen Fähigkeiten und unterstützen Unternehmen bei der Entwicklung von Cloud-basierten Anwendungen, die Services für Endnutzer neu erfinden.“ „Wir freuen uns darüber, dass AWS weiter in der Schweiz investiert und damit neue Möglichkeiten für Unternehmen und Bürger schafft, innovative Cloud-Technologien zu nutzen“, so Dieter Egli, Regierungsrat und Leiter des Departements für Wirtschaft und Inneres des Kantons Aargau, Schweiz. „Die Eröffnung der neuen AWS-Infrastrukturregion ist ein bedeutender Meilenstein für unsere regionalen Unternehmen und die digitale Transformationsagenda, die eine schnelle Einführung neuer digitaler Lösungen an unserem Technologie- und Ingenieurstandort im Herzen Europas weiter fördern und beschleunigen wird.“ Mit der Einführung der Region AWS Europe (Zürich) hat AWS 90 Availability Zones in 28 geografischen Regionen und plant die Einführung von 21 weiteren Availability Zones und sieben weiteren AWS Regionen in Australien, Kanada, Indien, Israel, Neuseeland, Spanien und Thailand. Die AWS Regionen setzen sich aus Availability Zones zusammen, die Infrastruktur an separaten und unterschiedlichen geografischen Standorten bereitstellen. Die Region AWS Europe (Zürich) besteht aus drei Availability Zones und ist die siebte AWS Region in Europa. Die Availability Zones liegen weit genug voneinander entfernt, sodass die Geschäftskontinuität der Kunden unterstützt wird, jedoch auch nahe genug beieinander, um niedrige Latenzzeiten für Hochverfügbarkeitsanwendungen bereitzustellen, die mehrere Availability Zones nutzen. Jede Availability Zone wird separat mit Strom versorgt, gekühlt und physisch gesichert und ist über redundante Netzwerke mit extrem niedriger Latenzzeit verbunden. AWS-Kunden, denen es auf hohe Verfügbarkeit ankommt, können ihre Anwendungen so entwickeln, dass sie in mehreren Availability Zones laufen, wodurch eine noch größere Fehlertoleranz erreicht wird. Die Einführung der Region AWS Europe (Zürich) wird es lokalen Kunden mit Anforderungen an die Datenresidenz ermöglichen, ihre Daten sicher in der Schweiz zu speichern, und ihnen gleichzeitig eine noch geringere Latenzzeit im ganzen Land bieten. AWS beabsichtigt, in den nächsten 15 Jahren über die neue Region AWS Europe (Zürich) rund 5,9 Milliarden US-Dollar (ca. 5,9 Milliarden Schweizer Franken) in der Schweiz zu investieren. Diese Investition umfasst Kapitalausgaben für die Errichtung von Rechenzentren, Betriebskosten für laufende Versorgungs- und Anlagenkosten sowie den Kauf von Waren und Dienstleistungen von regionalen Unternehmen. Die Investition wird in diesem Zeitraum schätzungsweise durchschnittlich mehr als 2.500 Arbeitsplätze pro Jahr schaffen. Diese Arbeitsplätze, beispielsweise in den Bereichen Bau, Anlagenwartung, Technik, Telekommunikation und in der Wirtschaft des Landes insgesamt, werden Teil der AWS-Lieferkette in der Schweiz sein. Der Bau und Betrieb der AWS-Infrastruktur in der Schweiz wird Schätzungen zufolge in den nächsten 15 Jahren 16,3 Milliarden US-Dollar (ca. 16,3 Milliarden Schweizer Franken) zum BIP der Schweiz beitragen. Kunden begrüßen die Region AWS Europe (Zürich) Über 10.000 Kunden in der Schweiz schließen sich den Millionen aktiver Kunden an, die AWS jeden Monat in mehr als 190 Ländern auf der ganzen Welt nutzen. Große und kleine Schweizer Unternehmen, die AWS für den Betrieb ihrer geschäftskritischen Workloads nutzen, um Kosteneinsparungen zu erzielen, Innovationen zu fördern und die Zeit bis zur Markteinführung zu verkürzen, sind Buildigo, Clariant, Crisalix, Datwyler, Dentsu Tracking, Explora Journeys, Fisch Asset Management, GSR Zug, Helvetia Group, Hexagon, Hilti, Idorsia, iNovitas, Invit Travel, iptiQ, Klarpay, Kudelski Group, lastminute.com, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, OC Oerlikon Corporation AG, Partners Group, Richemont, Ringier, Swiss Marketplace Group, Swiss Re, Swisscom, Syngenta, Ubique, u-blox, und die Zurich Insurance Group.

Von 2020 bis 2022 migrierte Clariant seine regionalen Rechenzentren weltweit zu AWS. „Als wir beschlossen, von On-Premises-Managed-Services in die Cloud zu wechseln, wollten wir eine flexible, aber kostengünstige Lösung, um unser Geschäftsmodell sowie Fusions- und Übernahmeaktivitäten zu unterstützen. Mit AWS konnten wir eine sicherere Infrastruktur aufbauen, die Qualität und Geschwindigkeit der Bereitstellung verbessern und unser Servicemodell standardisieren und konsolidieren. Seit der Migration zu AWS konnten wir unsere globalen Rechenzentrumskosten um 27 % senken und innerhalb von nur zwei Jahren ein neues internes Cloud-Kompetenzteam aufbauen“, so Ali Khosravi, Head of Global Technology Operation bei Clariant. „Als globales, von der Schweiz aus operierendes Unternehmen, das auf der weltweit führenden Cloud läuft, begrüßen wir die Einführung der neuen Region AWS Europe (Zürich), mit der wir die Anforderungen unseres Unternehmens und unserer Kunden auf der ganzen Welt noch besser erfüllen können.“ iNovitas, ein führender Schweizer Anbieter von Cloud-basierten Bilddiensten, liefert eine hochauflösende, georeferenzierte 3D-Panoramabildumgebung (3D-Straßenbilder), um die Wartung und Verwaltung von Infrastruktur zu vereinfachen. „Wir haben uns sehr früh für AWS als unseren favorisierten Cloud-Anbieter entschieden, weil AWS die höchste Zuverlässigkeit, Flexibilität und Skalierbarkeit bietet, die wir für die Entwicklung und den Betrieb unserer Dienste benötigen“, so Joel Burkhard, Chief Technology Officer bei iNovitas. „Seit unserer Unternehmensgründung im Jahr 2011 haben wir für den Aufbau und die Skalierung unseres Cloud-basierten Geschäfts auf AWS-Dienste wie Amazon S3 und Amazon EC2 gesetzt und mehr als 77.000 Kilometer Straßen, 11.000 Kilometer Bahngleise und 200 Kilometer Flussufer in der Schweiz, Deutschland, Österreich und Schweden digitalisiert, wobei wir mehr als 2,6 Petabyte an Bilddaten verarbeitet und gespeichert haben. Für ein kleines Unternehmen wie unseres, das nur über begrenzte technologische Ressourcen verfügt, bietet AWS überzeugende Vorteile. Durch die Nutzung von AWS können wir schnell innovativ sein und auf Technologien für maschinelles Lernen wie Amazon Rekognition für die Bild- und Videoanalyse zugreifen, die uns sonst nicht zur Verfügung stünden oder zu teuer für uns wären. Die neue AWS Region eröffnet für uns neue Möglichkeiten, mehr Kunden zu bedienen, vor allem diejenigen, die ihre Daten lieber in der Schweiz speichern.“ Der weltweit tätige Luxuskonzern Richemont, Inhaber der Marken Cartier, Montblanc, IWC Schaffhausen und Van Cleef & Arpels, hat seine gesamte Unternehmens-IT-Infrastruktur, einschließlich 120 SAP-Instanzen, auf seinen bevorzugten Cloud-Anbieter AWS übertragen. „Mit den tiefgreifenden und breit gefächerten Dienstleistungen von AWS können wir unseren Kunden neue digitale Erlebnisse schneller zur Verfügung stellen, zum Beispiel personalisierte Schaufenster und Styling-Services, Video-Chat-Beratungen mit Modeschauen, die auf den Geschmack der Kunden ausgerichtet sind, und individuelle Angebote für den frühzeitigen Zugang zu neuen Artikeln, bevor sie im Handel erhältlich sind“, so Kim Hartlev, Group Chief Information Officer bei Richemont. „Wir freuen uns sehr über die neue Infrastrukturregion, die AWS in unseren Schweizer Heimatmarkt gebracht hat, da sie einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Skalierung, Kuratierung und weiteren Personalisierung der Einkaufserlebnisse für unsere Kunden leisten wird.“ Swisscom, ein führendes Schweizer Telekommunikationsunternehmen, hat sich für AWS als bevorzugten Cloud-Anbieter entschieden, um seine digitale Transformationsstrategie zu beschleunigen und den Schritt hin zu einem Cloud-fähigen 5G-Netzwerk zu unterstützen. Swisscom ist zudem ein AWS-Partner mit umfassender technischer und branchenspezifischer Expertise, der Schweizer Unternehmen beim Wechsel in die Cloud und bei der Einführung fortschrittlicher Technologien unterstützt. „Unsere Kunden haben sich schon immer darauf verlassen, dass Swisscom sie mit der Welt verbindet und dabei die bestmögliche verfügbare Technologie einsetzt“, so Frank Dederichs, Chief Technology Information Officer bei Swisscom. „Wir arbeiten schon seit mehreren Jahren erfolgreich mit AWS zusammen, und das nicht nur als Cloud- und Technologieanbieter, sondern auch als vertrauenswürdiger und inspirierender Partner, der unseren Geschäftskunden erstklassige Cloud-Services zur Verfügung stellt. Die Eröffnung der neuen Region AWS Europe (Zürich) mit demselben hohen Niveau an Datenschutz, Benutzerdatenschutz und Einhaltung gesetzlicher Vorschriften wie in den anderen Regionen auf der ganzen Welt ist eine großartige Nachricht für uns und für alle Schweizer Technologieunternehmen.“ Swisstopo, das Schweizer Bundesamt für Kartographie, setzt seit 2010 auf AWS, um sein digitales geografisches Informationssystem und seine Dienste für über 80.000 tägliche Nutzer im ganzen Land zu optimieren. „Dank der automatischen Bereitstellung waren wir in der Lage, nach Bedarf horizontal zu skalieren. Außerdem konnten wir die Einrichtungszeit für Hardware von 10 Wochen auf unter eine Stunde reduzieren“, so Hanspeter Christ, Leiter der Abteilung GeoIT bei Swisstopo. „Die neue AWS Region wird neue Möglichkeiten eröffnen, um den Nutzern einen noch schnelleren Zugang zu unseren Diensten und erstklassigen Erfahrungen zu bieten, verbunden mit der Möglichkeit, Daten in der Schweiz zu hosten.“ Das 2014 gegründete Deep-Tech-Startup Verity stellt ein automatisiertes Bestandsverwaltungssystem bereit, das von selbstfliegenden Drohnen unterstützt wird und einen neuen Standard für große Einzelhändler, Logistikdienstleister und Hersteller setzt. „Unser System setzt Drohnen ein, um mit bis zu 10 Gigabyte pro Flug und Drohne genaue Bestandsdaten zu sammeln und zu verarbeiten. Die Daten werden über AWS in die Cloud übertragen“, so Raffaello D'Andrea, Gründer von Verity. „Durch die Möglichkeit, Diskrepanzen zwischen den im Lagerverwaltungssystem eines Kunden gespeicherten Daten und dem tatsächlichen Lagerbestand zu erkennen, gewinnen unsere Kunden wertvolle Erkenntnisse, die zu einer höheren Betriebseffizienz führen und dazu beitragen, Lohn- und Ausrüstungskosten zu senken, Fehler und Unterbrechungen zu vermeiden sowie Abfall und CO2-Emissionen zu reduzieren. Die leistungsstarken APIs und Managed Services von AWS haben uns geholfen, mit unserem Geschäft die nächste Stufe zu erreichen und schnell zu skalieren. Dank der Technologiedienste von AWS lässt Verity das Null-Fehler-Lager für unsere Kunden Wirklichkeit werden.“ Auch in der Schweiz ansässige AWS-Partner begrüßen die Region AWS Europe (Zürich) Das AWS Partner Network (APN) umfasst Zehntausende von unabhängigen Softwareanbietern (Independent Software Vendors, ISVs) und Systemintegratoren (Systems Integrators, SIs) auf der ganzen Welt.

Zur Unterstützung des schnell wachsenden landesweiten Kundenstamms eröffnete AWS zwei Büros in der Schweiz, Zürich (2016) und Genf (2017), und schuf neue Arbeitsplätze, darunter technische Experten, Lösungsarchitekten, technische Account Manager, Partnermanager, Systemingenieure und Experten für professionelle Dienstleistungen. AWS hat in Zürich Points of Presence eingerichtet (2017 und 2019), die die Schweiz an das AWS-Netzwerk-Backbone anbinden und den Kunden Zugang zu AWS-Diensten wie Amazon CloudFront und AWS Direct Connect bieten. Amazon CloudFront ist ein extrem sicheres und programmierbares Netzwerk zur Bereitstellung von Inhalten, das die Bereitstellung von Daten, Videos, Anwendungen und Anwendungsprogrammierschnittstellen (Application Programming Interfaces, APIs) für Benutzer weltweit mit geringen Latenzzeiten und hohen Übertragungsgeschwindigkeiten beschleunigt. Über AWS Direct Connect können Kunden eine private Verbindung zwischen AWS und ihrem Rechenzentrum, Büro oder ihrer Colocation-Umgebung herstellen, um die Netzwerkkosten zu senken, die Bandbreite zu erhöhen und ein konsistenteres Netzwerkerlebnis zu bieten. AWS hat im Dezember 2019 AWS Outposts in der Schweiz eingeführt. AWS Outposts bietet Kunden und Partnern in der Schweiz Zugang zu denselben AWS-Infrastrukturservices, APIs und Tools in nahezu jedem Rechenzentrum, Colocation-Raum oder vor Ort für ein wirklich konsistentes Hybrid-Erlebnis. Mit AWS Outposts können Kunden und Partner wichtige AWS-Services in ihren eigenen Rechenzentren ausführen und zugleich auf eine breite Palette von globalen AWS-Infrastrukturservices zugreifen. AWS investiert weiterhin in die Qualifizierung von lokalen Entwicklern, Studierenden und der nächsten Generation von IT-Führungskräften in der Schweiz durch Programme wie AWS re/Start, AWS Academy und AWS Educate. Diese Programme unterstützen Lernende mit unterschiedlichem Hintergrund und unterschiedlicher Erfahrung bei der Vorbereitung auf ihre Karriere in der Cloud. Ob Hochschulkurse, Vollzeit-Trainingsprogramme oder Lerninhalte zum Selbststudium: Die AWS-Bildungsprogramme ermöglichen den Erwerb der Fähigkeiten, die für den Beginn oder Ausbau einer Cloud-Karriere erforderlich sind. Mehrere Hochschulen in der Schweiz, darunter die Fachhochschule Luzern, die Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz (FHNW) und die Technische Berufsschule Zürich, haben Kurse der AWS Academy als Teil ihres Lehrplans angeboten. Bislang haben 32 Schweizer Hochschulen am AWS Academy-Programm teilgenommen und 16 bieten 2022 Kurse an. Im Rahmen seines AWS re/Start-Programms kooperiert AWS mit Schweizer Bildungs- und Schulungsanbietern wie Powerhouse Lausanne und Powercoders, um gezielte Programme für Arbeitslose und unterbeschäftigte Personen anzubieten. Die Programme bereiten Teilnehmer ohne vorherige technische Erfahrung auf eine Karriere in der Cloud vor und bringen sie mit potenziellen Arbeitgebern zusammen. AWS pflegt seit mehreren Jahren eine Partnerschaft mit dem Verein ICT Berufsbildung Schweiz, um die berufliche Aus- und Weiterbildung von Schweizer Arbeitnehmern zu fördern. Im Jahr 2020 unterstützte AWS den Verein bei der Überarbeitung des nationalen IT-Lehrplans, indem es die Entwicklung neuer Cloud-Module unterstützte, die seit 2021 jedem Schweizer IT-Lehrling (3.000 pro Jahr) beigebracht werden. Zur fortgesetzten Förderung des Unternehmertums in der Schweiz bietet AWS Startups und kleinen Unternehmen Unterstützung durch das AWS Activate-Programm. Dieses Programm bietet Zugang zu Unterstützung, persönlichen Gesprächen mit AWS-Experten, webbasierten Schulungen, Übungen zum Selbststudium, Kundensupport, Angeboten von Drittanbietern und die Möglichkeit, bis zu 100.000 US-Dollar in Form von AWS-Servicegutschriften zu erhalten — und das alles kostenlos. Darüber hinaus arbeitet AWS mit Risikokapitalgebern, Startup-Beschleunigern und Inkubatoren zusammen, um Startups beim Wachstum in der Cloud zu unterstützen. In der Schweiz gehören dazu die Förderung von Unternehmern wie die Swiss Startup Association und Swisspreneur sowie Risikokapitalfirmen wie btov, F10, Redalpine, Verve Ventures und Wingman Ventures, die das zügige Wachstum ihrer Portfoliounternehmen vorantreiben. Engagement für Nachhaltigkeit Amazon hat sich im Rahmen von The Climate Pledge dazu verpflichtet, ein nachhaltigeres Unternehmen zu werden und im gesamten Unternehmen bis 2040, also 10 Jahre vor dem Pariser Abkommen, eine Netto-Null-Emission zu erreichen. Amazon ist Mitbegründer von The Climate Pledge und war 2019 dessen Erstunterzeichner. Im Rahmen seiner Climate Pledge-Verpflichtung verfolgt Amazon das Ziel, seinen Betrieb bis 2025 zu 100 % mit erneuerbarer Energie zu versorgen, fünf Jahre vor dem ursprünglichen Ziel von 2030. Amazon ist der weltweit größte gewerbliche Abnehmer von erneuerbaren Energien und hat Ende 2021 einen Anteil von 85 % erneuerbarer Energien in seinem gesamten Unternehmen erreicht. Siehe Amazons öffentlich zugängliche Methodik für weitere Informationen zu seinem Ansatz. Unternehmen, die ihre Rechenlasten auf AWS verlagern, können vom Nettoeffekt der Nachhaltigkeitsbemühungen von Amazon profitieren und so ihren CO2-Fußabdruck verringern. Im Vergleich zu den Rechenressourcen eines durchschnittlichen europäischen Unternehmens arbeitet die AWS-Infrastruktur bis zu fünfmal energieeffizienter. Über Amazon Web Services Amazon Web Services bietet seit über 15 Jahren das umfassendste und am weitesten verbreitete Cloud-Angebot der Welt. AWS hat seine Services kontinuierlich erweitert, um praktisch jede Cloud-Arbeitslast zu unterstützen. Heute verfügt AWS über mehr als 200 voll funktionsfähige Services für Rechenleistung, Speicher, Datenbanken, Netzwerke, Analytik, maschinelles Lernen und künstliche Intelligenz (KI), Internet der Dinge (IoT), Mobiles, Sicherheit, Hybrid, Virtual und Augmented Reality (VR und AR), Medien sowie Anwendungsentwicklung, -bereitstellung und -verwaltung aus 90 Availability Zones in 28 geografischen Regionen. Es sind 21 weitere Availability Zones und sieben weitere AWS-Regionen in Australien, Kanada, Indien, Israel, Neuseeland, Spanien und Thailand geplant. Millionen von Kunden, darunter die am schnellsten wachsenden Startups, die größten Konzerne und führende Regierungsbehörden, vertrauen bei der Bereitstellung ihrer Infrastruktur auf AWS, um agiler zu werden und Kosten zu senken.

    "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/aws-lanza-una-regin-de-infraestructura-en-suiza-20221110.jpg",

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), una empresa de Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), anunció hoy el lanzamiento de la región de AWS Europa (Zúrich). A partir de hoy, los desarrolladores, las empresas emergentes, los emprendedores y las compañías, así como las organizaciones gubernamentales, educativas y sin fines de lucro, tendrán aún más opciones para ejecutar sus aplicaciones y atender a los usuarios finales desde los centros de datos ubicados en Suiza, utilizando las tecnologías avanzadas de AWS para impulsar la innovación. AWS también publicó un estudio de impacto económico que estima que el gasto de la compañía en la construcción y operación de la nueva región ofrecerá un promedio de más de 2500 trabajos de tiempo completo por año en empresas externas en la cadena de suministros de los centros de datos suizo, con una inversión planificada de $5,9 mil millones (5,9 mil millones de francos suizos) hasta 2036. La región de AWS Europa (Zúrich) también agregará un estimado de $16,3 mil millones (16,3 mil millones de francos suizos) al producto bruto interno (PBI) de Suiza durante los próximos 15 años. Para obtener más información sobre la Infraestructura Global de AWS, visite aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure. “Desde empresas emergentes y medianas empresas hasta compañías y organizaciones gubernamentales, miles de organizaciones comerciales, sin fines de lucro y del sector público de toda Suiza están atrayendo a sus usuarios finales y están creciendo a nivel global con el apoyo de AWS”, expresó Prasad Kalyanaraman, vicepresidente de servicios de infraestructura de AWS. “Con la nueva región de AWS Europa (Zúrich), tenemos siete regiones de AWS y 21 zonas de disponibilidad en Europa, en Fráncfort, Irlanda, Londres, Milán, París, Estocolmo y ahora, en Suiza. Esta es una continuación de nuestra inversión para apoyar a clientes de todo tipo, ayudar a las empresas emergentes a escalar y crecer, permitir el desarrollo de habilidades técnicas y ayudar a las organizaciones a crear aplicaciones basadas en la nube que reinventan los servicios para los usuarios finales”. “Estamos encantados de que AWS siga invirtiendo en Suiza, permitiendo nuevas posibilidades para que las empresas y los ciudadanos aprovechen las tecnologías innovadoras en la nube”, manifestó Dieter Egli, consejero del gobierno y director del Departamento de Economía y Asuntos Interiores del cantón de Aargau, Suiza. “La inauguración de la nueva región de infraestructura de AWS es un hito clave para las empresas de nuestra región y la agenda de transformación digital que promocionará y acelerará aún más la rápida introducción de las nuevas soluciones digitales en nuestro sitio de tecnología e ingeniería en el centro de Europa”. Con el lanzamiento de la región de AWS Europa (Zúrich), AWS cuenta con 90 zonas de disponibilidad en 28 regiones geográficas, y planes anunciados para lanzar 21 zonas de disponibilidad más y otras siete regiones de AWS en Australia, Canadá, India, Israel, Nueva Zelanda, España y Tailandia. Las regiones de AWS se componen de zonas de disponibilidad que colocan la infraestructura en ubicaciones geográficas distintas y separadas. La región de AWS Europa (Zúrich) consiste en tres zonas de disponibilidad y es la séptima región de AWS en Europa. Las zonas de disponibilidad están ubicadas lo suficientemente lejos unas de otras para respaldar la continuidad del negocio de los clientes, pero lo suficientemente cerca como para proporcionar baja latencia para aplicaciones de alta disponibilidad que utilizan múltiples zonas de disponibilidad. Cada zona de disponibilidad tiene energía, refrigeración y seguridad física independientes y está conectada a través de redes redundantes de latencia ultrabaja. Los clientes de AWS enfocados en la alta disponibilidad pueden diseñar sus aplicaciones para que se ejecuten en varias zonas de disponibilidad con el objeto de lograr una tolerancia a fallos aún mayor. El lanzamiento de la región de AWS de Europa (Zúrich) permitirá a los clientes locales con requisitos de residencia de datos almacenar sus datos en Suiza de manera segura y, al mismo tiempo, ofrecer a los clientes una latencia aún menor en todo el país. AWS planea invertir aproximadamente $5,9 mil millones (aprox. 5,9 mil millones de francos suizos) en Suiza durante los próximos 15 años en toda la nueva región de AWS Europa (Zúrich). Esta inversión incluye gastos de capital en la construcción de centros de datos, gastos operativos relacionados con los costos continuos de servicios públicos e instalaciones, y la compra de bienes y servicios de empresas regionales. También se estima que la inversión ofrecerá un promedio de más de 2500 trabajos anualmente durante este tiempo. Estos trabajos, que incluyen construcción, mantenimiento de instalaciones, ingeniería, telecomunicaciones y puestos de trabajo dentro de una economía más amplia del país, serán parte de la cadena de suministro de AWS en Suiza. También se estima que la construcción y funcionamiento de la infraestructura de AWS en Suiza agregará más de $16,3 mil millones (aproximadamente 16,3 mil millones de francos suizos) al PBI de Suiza durante los próximos 15 años. Los clientes dan la bienvenida a la región de AWS Europa (Zúrich) Más de 10 000 clientes de Suiza se unen a los millones de clientes activos que utilizan AWS cada mes en más de 190 países de todo el mundo. Entre las grandes y pequeñas empresas de Suiza que utilizarán AWS para ejecutar sus cargas de trabajo de misión crítica para generar ahorros de costos, acelerar la innovación y acelerar el tiempo de comercialización se incluyen Buildigo, Clariant, Crisalix, Datwyler, Dentsu Tracking, Explora Journeys, Fisch Asset Management, GSR Zug, Helvetia Group, Hexagon, Hilti, Idorsia, iNovitas, Invit Travel, iptiQ, Klarpay, Kudelski Group, lastminute.com, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, OC Oerlikon Corporation AG, Partners Group, Richemont, Ringier, Swiss Marketplace Group, Swiss Re, Swisscom, Syngenta, Ubique, u-blox y Zurich Insurance Group. Entre las principales empresas emergentes del país que desarrollarán sus negocios en AWS para escalar con rapidez y expandir su alcance geográfico en minutos se incluyen ANYbotics, Edgelab, FemTec Health (ex-AVA), flovtec, GenomSys, holo|one, RetinAI, Smallpdf, SonarSource y Verity. Entre las organizaciones del sector público que utilizan AWS para transformar los servicios que brindan a los ciudadanos suizos se incluyen AI Center en Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH Zürich), BERNMOBIL, EF Education First, Radiotelevisione svizzera (RSI), la Oficina Federal Suiza de Topografía (Swiss Federal Office of Topography) (Swisstopo) y Swiss Post. Como una de las empresas químicas especializadas líder en el mundo, Clariant aborda los desafíos clave que incluyen eficiencia energética, materia prima renovable, movilidad sin emisiones y conservación de los recursos finitos. Entre 2020 y 2022, Clariant migró sus centros de datos regionales de todo el mundo a AWS. “Al decidir trasladar los servicios gestionados en los sitios a la nube, buscamos una solución económica pero ágil para apoyar a nuestro modelo comercial, así como también las actividades de fusiones y adquisiciones. AWS nos permitió construir una infraestructura más segura, mejorar la calidad y velocidad de aprovisionamiento, y estandarizar y consolidar nuestro modelo de servicio. Desde que migramos a AWS, hemos reducido los costos globales de los centros de datos en un 27 % y hemos creado un nuevo equipo de competencia en la nube interno solo en dos años”, manifestó Ali Khosravi, director de operación global de tecnología de Clariant. “Como una empresa global líder en el mundo que opera fuera de Suiza y ejecuta en la nube, le damos la bienvenida al lanzamiento de la nueva región de AWS Europa (Zúrich) para atender aún mejor las necesidades de nuestras empresas y clientes de todo el mundo”. iNovitas, principal proveedor suizo de servicios de imágenes basados en la nube ofrece un entorno de imágenes panorámicas 3D georreferenciadas de alta resolución (imágenes de calles en 3D) para simplificar el mantenimiento y la gestión de la infraestructura. “Elegimos a AWS como nuestro proveedor en la nube de preferencia desde un primer momento, dado que ofrecía la mejor confiabilidad, flexibilidad y escalabilidad necesarias para desarrollar y ejecutar nuestros servicios”, dijo Joel Burkhard, director de tecnología de iNovitas. “Desde que abrimos la empresa en 2011, hemos confiado en los servicios de AWS, tales como Amazon S3 y Amazon EC2 para construir y escalar nuestra empresa generada en la nube y digitalizar más de 77 000 kilómetros de calles, 11 000 kilómetros de vías férreas y 200 kilómetros de bancos de ríos en toda Suiza, Alemania, Austria y Suecia, que dio como resultado el proceso y almacenamiento de más de 2,6 petabytes de datos de imágenes. Para una pequeña empresa con limitados recursos de tecnología como la nuestra, los beneficios de AWS son atractivos. Usar a AWS nos permite innovar con rapidez y acceder a tecnologías de aprendizaje automático, tales como Amazon Rekognition para análisis de imágenes y video que, de otro modo, no estarían a nuestra disposición o serían demasiado costosas. La nueva región de AWS genera flamantes oportunidades para que podamos atender a más clientes, especialmente aquellos que prefieren mantener sus datos guardados en Suiza”. Richemont, el grupo de productos de lujo global, dueño de las marcas Cartier, Montblanc, IWC Schaffhausen y Van Cleef & Arpels, trasladó toda su infraestructura de tecnología de la información (TI) empresarial, que incluye 120 puestos de SAP, a AWS, su proveedor de servicios en la nube de preferencia. “AWS, con su profundidad y amplitud de servicios, nos permite brindar a nuestros clientes nuevas experiencias digitales más rápidas, que incluyen servicios de tiendas en línea y de estilo personalizados, videoconsultas que presentan programas de moda para los gustos de los compradores y ofertas personalizadas para tener un acceso anticipado a los nuevos artículos antes de que lleguen a las tiendas”, comentó Kim Hartlev, director de información del grupo en Richemont. “Nos complace que AWS haya traído una nueva región de infraestructura a nuestro mercado doméstico en Suiza porque será un refuerzo importante para escalar, seleccionar y personalizar aún más las experiencias de compras para nuestros clientes”. Swisscom, una empresa de telecomunicaciones líder en Suiza, eligió a AWS como su proveedor de servicios en la nube de preferencia para acelerar su estrategia de transformación digital y apoyar su traslado hacia una red 5G construida para la nube. Swisscom también es socia de AWS con una experiencia profunda técnica e industrial que ayuda a las empresas suizas a trasladar a la nube y a adoptar tecnologías avanzadas. “Nuestros clientes siempre han confiado en Swisscom para conectarlos con el mundo usando la mejor tecnología disponible”, expresó Frank Dederichs, director de información de la tecnología de Swisscom. “Hemos disfrutado de una relación exitosa con AWS durante varios años, no solo como proveedor de tecnología y servicios en la nube, sino también como un socio inspirador y confiable, que entrega servicios en la nube de primera categoría a nuestros clientes comerciales. La inauguración de la nueva región de AWS Europa (Zúrich) con los mismos altos niveles de protección de datos, privacidad del usuario y cumplimiento normativo que sus otras regiones en todo el mundo es una gran noticia para nosotros y para todas las empresas de tecnología en Suiza”. Swisstopo, la agencia federal de cartografía de Suiza, adoptó AWS en 2010 para potenciar sus sistemas y servicios de información geográfica digital para más de 80 000 usuarios diarios en todo el país. “Gracias al aprovisionamiento automático, pudimos expandir de manera horizontal a demanda y lograr una reducción en el tiempo de configuración del hardware de 10 semanas a menos de una hora”, dijo Hanspeter Christ, director de GeoIT en Swisstopo. “La nueva región de AWS abrirá nuevas posibilidades para brindarle a los usuarios un acceso incluso más rápido a nuestros servicios y las mejores experiencias en su clase con una elección adicional para hospedar datos en Suiza”. Verity, fundada en 2014, una empresa emergente de tecnología desafiante ofrece un sistema de gestión de inventarios automatizado impulsado por drones autónomos, que establece una nueva norma para los minoristas de grandes dimensiones, proveedores de logística de terceros y fabricantes. “Nuestro sistema utiliza drones para recopilar y procesar datos de inventario precisos al límite —hasta 10 gigabytes por vuelo por dron— y utiliza AWS para transferir datos a la nube”, manifestó Raffaello D'Andrea, fundador de Verity. “Gracias a la capacidad de identificar discrepancias entre los datos guardados en un sistema de gestión de depósito del cliente y en el que el inventario realmente está o no está en el depósito, los clientes obtienen información valiosa que permite una mayor eficacia operativa y ayuda a reducir los costos de fuerza laboral y equipos, elimina errores e interrupciones, y reduce residuos y emisiones de CO2. Las API potentes y los servicios gestionados de AWS nos han ayudado a llevar el negocio al próximo nivel y escalar con rapidez. Verity, utilizando los servicios de tecnología de AWS, está haciendo que el depósito con cero margen de error sea una realidad para nuestros clientes”. Los socios de AWS con sede en Suiza también le dan la bienvenida a la región de AWS Europa (Zúrich) La AWS Partner Network (APN) incluye decenas de miles de proveedores de software independientes (ISV) e integradores de sistemas (SI) en todo el mundo. Los socios de AWS crean soluciones y servicios innovadores en AWS, y APN ayuda proporcionando soporte comercial, técnico, de comercialización y de lanzamiento al mercado a los clientes. Los SI de AWS, socios de consultoría, y los ISV ayudan a los clientes empresariales y del sector público a migrar a AWS, implementar aplicaciones de misión crítica y proporcionar una gama completa de servicios de monitoreo, automatización y administración para los entornos de nube de los clientes. Como ejemplos de socios de AWS con sede en Suiza se incluyen 1plusX (una empresa de TripleLift), Amanox Solutions, amazee.io, Appway, Avaloq, Beekeeper, BSI, copebit, crealogix, dbi services, ELCA Cloud Services SA, Finnova, Ingram Micro, Nexthink, Secutix, SmartWave, SoftwareONE, Swisscom, TD SYNNEX, Trivadis, WebGate Consulting y Zühlke Technology Group. Para obtener la lista completa de socios de AWS, visite aws.amazon.com/partners. ELCA Cloud Services SA, conocida como ELCA, se enfoca en servicios gestionados en la nube y en el lugar de trabajo y forma parte del ELCA Group, uno de los mayores proveedores de TI de servicio completo independiente de Suiza. “La inauguración de la nueva región de AWS es un momento fundamental en la aceleración de la transformación e innovación de las empresas suizas, específicamente, aquellos que están en sectores altamente regulados, tales como los servicios financieros, la atención médica y el gobierno. Para ELCA es clave poder beneficiarse de la cartera de la nube de AWS en Suiza para ayudarnos a atender mejor las necesidades de nuestros clientes”, manifestó Maxime Claux, vicepresidente de ELCA. “La nueva región de AWS aportará todo el potencial de la nube para las organizaciones del sector público de Suiza, empresas medianas y de gran tamaño. Les permitirá implementar aplicaciones de manera segura, aumentar la eficacia, mejorar el rendimiento y cumplir con los requisitos de residencia de datos. La inversión permanente de AWS también ayudará a ELCA a expandir nuestro negocio y a capacitar profesionales en la nube a nivel local para poder brindar más apoyo a los esfuerzos de transformación digital de Suiza”. SoftwareONE es un líder global en software y gestión de carteras en la nube con más de 9000 expertos en tecnología en más de 90 países que brinda soluciones de tecnología en la nube y software de extremo a extremo. “Al igual que AWS, SoftwareONE ha sido pionera en darle forma a la manera en que los clientes implementan la tecnología e innovan en todo el mundo. Nos enorgullece trabajar de manera estrecha con AWS para ayudar a los clientes a fortalecer su confiabilidad, flexibilidad, escalabilidad, seguridad y cumplimiento en la nube”, dijo Reinhard Waldinger, presidente de SoftwareONE EMEA (Europa, Oriente Medio y África). “Como una compañía global con sede en Suiza, le damos la bienvenida al crecimiento continuo y la inversión que AWS está haciendo en la región, dado que demuestra cuán importante es Suiza en el espacio de la tecnología a nivel mundial. Esperamos con ansias empoderar a nuestros clientes con la escala y agilidad de AWS Cloud para cumplir y crecer más a la vez que mejoran la seguridad y las habilidades en la nube”. Inversión de AWS en Suiza Las empresas suizas se encuentran entre las primeras que adoptaron los servicios en la nube en Europa y, a medida que la cantidad de clientes suizos crecen, también lo hace la presencia de AWS en el país. La nueva región de AWS Europa (Zúrich) es la última de las inversiones en curso de AWS en Suiza. A fin de apoyar su veloz crecimiento de la base de clientes en todo el país, AWS abrió dos oficinas en Suiza, Zúrich (2016) y Ginebra (2017), y creó nuevos puestos de trabajo que incluyen expertos técnicos, arquitectos de soluciones, gerentes de cuentas técnicas, gerentes de socios, ingenieros en sistemas y expertos de servicios profesionales. AWS estableció puntos de presencia en Zúrich (2017 y 2019), conectando a Suiza a la red troncal de AWS y ofreciendo a los clientes acceso a los servicios de AWS como Amazon CloudFront y AWS Direct Connect, entre otros. Amazon CloudFront es una red de entrega de contenido altamente segura y programable que acelera la entrega de datos, videos, aplicaciones e interfaces de programación de aplicaciones (API) a usuarios de todo el mundo con baja latencia y altas velocidades de transferencia. AWS Direct Connect permite a los clientes establecer conectividad privada entre AWS y sus centros de datos, oficina o entorno de colocación. Esto puede reducir los costos de la red, aumentar el rendimiento del ancho de banda y brindar una experiencia de red más uniforme. En diciembre de 2019, AWS lanzó AWS Outposts en Suiza. AWS Outposts ofrece a los clientes y socios de Suiza acceso a los mismos servicios de infraestructura de AWS, API y herramientas a prácticamente cualquier centro de datos, espacio de colocación o instalación local para una experiencia híbrida verdaderamente uniforme. AWS Outposts permite a los clientes y socios ejecutar servicios clave de AWS en sus propios centros de datos, mientras se conectan a una gama más amplia de servicios en la infraestructura global de AWS. AWS continúa invirtiendo en la mejora de las habilidades de los desarrolladores locales, los estudiantes y la próxima generación de líderes de TI en Suiza a través de programas como AWS re/Start, AWS Academy y AWS Educate. Estos programas ayudan a los estudiantes de todos los orígenes y experiencias a prepararse para las carreras en la nube. Desde cursos de educación superior hasta programas de capacitación de tiempo completo y contenido de aprendizaje a su propio ritmo, los programas educativos de AWS ofrecen acceso a las habilidades necesarias para comenzar o hacer crecer una carrera en la nube. Varias universidades de Suiza, entre las que se incluyen la Fachhochschule Luzern, Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz (FHNW) y Technische Berufsschule Zürich, han ofrecido cursos de la AWS Academy como parte de sus programas de estudios. Hasta la fecha, 32 instituciones suizas participaron en el programa de AWS Academy y ofrecieron 16 clases en 2022. Como parte de su programa de AWS re/Start, AWS colabora con los prestadores de educación y capacitación de Suiza, por ejemplo, Powerhouse Lausanne y Powercoders en programas dirigidos a las personas desempleadas o subempleadas. Los programas preparan a las personas sin experiencia técnica para carreras en la nube y los conecta con potenciales empleadores. AWS ha colaborado con la asociación ICT Berufsbildung Schweiz durante varios años para impartir educación vocacional y capacitación a los trabajadores suizos. En 2020, AWS dio apoyo a la asociación en sus esfuerzos por reelaborar el programa de estudios nacional de TI ayudándolos a desarrollar nuevos módulos sobre la nube que se han enseñado a cada aprendiz de TI suizo (3000 por año) desde 2021. Para continuar promoviendo la iniciativa empresarial en Suiza, AWS ofrece a las empresas emergentes y pequeñas empresas soporte a través del programa AWS Activate. Este programa proporciona acceso a orientación y tiempo individual con expertos de AWS, capacitación basada en la web, laboratorios de autoaprendizaje, soporte al cliente, ofertas de terceros y oportunidad para acceder a hasta $100 000 en créditos de servicio de AWS, todo sin costo. AWS también trabaja con inversores de capital de riesgo, los aceleradores de empresas emergentes y las incubadoras para ayudar a que las empresas emergentes crezcan en la nube. En Suiza, esto incluye promover la iniciativa empresarial, tales como la Asociación de Empresas Emergentes de Suiza (Swiss Startup Association) y Swisspreneur, así como también firmas de capital de riesgo como btov, F10, Redalpine, Verve Ventures y Wingman Ventures para respaldar el rápido crecimiento de las empresas de su cartera. Compromiso con la sostenibilidad Amazon se compromete a transformarse en una empresa más sostenible y a alcanzar cero emisiones netas de carbono en todas las operaciones para 2040, 10 años antes de los objetivos del Acuerdo de París, como parte de The Climate Pledge. Amazon cofundó The Climate Pledge y se convirtió en su primer signatario en 2019. Como parte de su compromiso con el Climate Pledge, Amazon está estableciendo una ruta para abastecer sus operaciones con energía totalmente renovable para 2025, cinco años antes de la fecha objetivo inicial de 2030. Amazon, el mayor comprador corporativo de energía renovable del mundo, a finales de 2021 alcanzó el 85 % de energía renovable en todas sus empresas. Para obtener más información sobre este enfoque, consulte la metodología pública de Amazon. Las organizaciones que mueven las cargas de trabajo de cómputo a AWS pueden beneficiarse del efecto neto de los esfuerzos de sostenibilidad de Amazon para reducir su huella de carbono. En comparación con los recursos de computación de la empresa promedio europea, la infraestructura de AWS es hasta cinco veces más eficiente desde el punto de vista energético. Acerca de Amazon Web Services Durante más de 15 años, Amazon Web Services ha sido la oferta de servicios en la nube más completa y con mayor adopción del mundo. AWS ha estado expandiendo sus servicios constantemente para admitir prácticamente cualquier carga de trabajo en la nube y ahora cuenta con más de 200 servicios completos relacionados con cómputos, almacenamiento, bases de datos, redes, analítica, aprendizaje automático e inteligencia artificial (IA), Internet de las cosas (Internet of Things, IdeC), servicios móviles, seguridad, servicios híbridos, realidad virtual y aumentada (RV y RA), desarrollo y aplicación de medios, despliegue y gestión desde 90 zonas de disponibilidad en 28 regiones geográficas, con planes anunciados para 21 zonas de disponibilidad más y otras siete regiones más de AWS en Australia, Canadá, India, Israel, Nueva Zelanda, España y Tailandia. Millones de clientes, como las empresas emergentes de más rápido crecimiento, las empresas más grandes y las principales agencias gubernamentales, confían en AWS para impulsar su infraestructura, facilitar su agilidad y reducir los costos.
