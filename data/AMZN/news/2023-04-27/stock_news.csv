ACX allows participating stores to share information about confirmed counterfeiters who attempted to use their services to try to sell counterfeit products.",businesswire.com,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230420005438/en/Amazon-Announces-Anti-Counterfeiting-Exchange-to-Help-Eliminate-Counterfeits-Across-the-Retail-Industry/,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/amazon-announces-anticounterfeiting-exchange-to-help-eliminate-counterfeits-across-the-20230420.jpg
AMZN,2023-04-27,2023-04-20,2023-05-11,AMZN,,2023-04-20 09:01:00,2023-04-20T09:01:00-04:00,2023-04-20,Amazon Announces Anti-Counterfeiting Exchange to Help Eliminate Counterfeits Across the Retail Industry,"SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced the Anti-Counterfeiting Exchange (ACX), an industry collaboration designed to make it safer to shop online and more difficult for counterfeiters to move among different stores to attempt to sell their counterfeit goods. ACX allows participating stores to share information about confirmed counterfeiters who attempted to use their services to try to sell counterfeit products. By sharing information about these counterfeiters, ACX participants can identify and stop perpetrators more quickly than they would in the absence of this collaborative data sharing. In accordance with industry standards and best practices, an independent third party provides anonymized access for participants to share and receive information. ACX has enabled regular information sharing and participants use this information in their ongoing efforts to detect and address counterfeiting, improve their individual risk evaluation systems, and make more robust referrals to law enforcement so bad actors can be held accountable. Through ACX, Amazon has already detected hundreds of matching accounts where the same counterfeiter tried to create selling accounts on Amazon and at least one other store operator. The power of ACX comes from the fact that as soon as one of the participating stores catches a counterfeiter and shares the account information through the exchange, all the other stores participating in ACX can know about that counterfeiter and can stop them even more quickly in their store. Each participant makes its own independent decisions about whether and how to use the information in ACX. “We want our customers to have confidence in their shopping experience and for brands to know they are protected from counterfeits,"" said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon’s vice president of Selling Partner Services. “As we laid out in our blueprint for private and public sector partnership to stop counterfeiters, we think it is critical to share information about confirmed counterfeiters to help the entire industry stop these criminals earlier. By leading the way in creating an industry-wide solution to share information about known counterfeiters, we are excited to have helped improve the industry’s collective ability to fight counterfeit crime, providing consumers and rights owners with greater peace of mind.” “The IPR Center applauds the foundational efforts made by the Anti-Counterfeiting Exchange, and we’re pleased to have been a part of its creation,” said James Mancuso, director of the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center. “This is an opening salvo in a much larger battle against counterfeiters and criminal organizations, and the effort will need even greater participation, from all industries and sectors, to reach its full potential. We look forward to supporting this momentous effort with all of the tools that the IPR Center brings to bear.” Daniel Castro, director of the Center for Data Innovation, reiterated the importance of this type of voluntary collaboration. “Active cooperation among private sector firms is key to combating illicit counterfeiting networks. In 2020, the Department of Homeland Security called on private sector stakeholders to take a more active role in detecting and preventing the trafficking of counterfeit goods. It’s encouraging to see Amazon and other stores answer this call by creating the Anti-Counterfeiting Exchange.” Amazon has been working with other members of ACX to pilot the exchange, ensure the appropriate guardrails, and design a scalable way to broaden participation to additional companies interested in stopping counterfeiters. Private sector partnerships around data sharing are crucial to combating counterfeiting. Amazon invites other retailers and marketplace service providers to join the Anti-Counterfeiting Exchange and collaborate with the founding members to further strengthen the industry’s collective efforts against counterfeiters. Through ACX, counterfeiters and criminal organizations are on notice that the private sector is aligning against them and working to protect consumers and rights owners across the retail industry.

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced three new capabilities for Amazon GuardDuty, AWS’s threat detection service, that further strengthen customer security through expanded coverage and continuous enhancements in machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence. GuardDuty is part of a broad set of AWS security services that help customers identify potential security risks, so they can respond quickly, freeing security teams to focus on tasks with the highest value. The three new capabilities expand GuardDuty protection to container runtime behavior, as well as database and serverless environments. EKS Runtime Monitoring deepens threat detection inside customers’ containerized workloads. GuardDuty RDS Protection helps customers protect data stored in Amazon Aurora databases. GuardDuty Lambda Protection helps customers detect threats to their serverless applications. To get started with Amazon GuardDuty, visit aws.amazon.com/guardduty. The ability to gather, synthesize, and alert on security-relevant events is fundamental to any organization’s risk management program. The evolving cybersecurity landscape and multitude of security tools from different vendors, combined with a shortage of IT security professionals, make it challenging for customers to integrate and scale security detection and response across their environments. Many security teams today have to build or integrate multiple tools to detect anomalies, such as web server vulnerabilities, compromised instances used to serve malware or mine cryptocurrency, or compromised access credentials. Integration challenges can lead to inefficiencies, data inconsistencies, and increased costs. In addition, the workplace and threat landscape continue to evolve, requiring chief information security officers (CISOs) to continually raise the bar on enterprise security to account for cloud adoption, remote working, and third-party infrastructure integration. Demand for technologies and services such as cloud threat detection, security analytics, cloud security posture management, and threat intelligence has been rising to tackle new vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other IT risks emerging from this digital transformation. GuardDuty helps protect customers from the latest threats through ongoing innovation in machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence continuously derived from the broad visibility AWS has across the global threat landscape. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, customers can activate GuardDuty across multiple accounts in multiple AWS Regions on highly trusted and secure-by-design AWS Cloud infrastructure and mitigate threats early by initiating automated responses. Since its launch in 2017, GuardDuty has added more than 100 new threat detection capabilities, including the ability to detect credential exfiltration and compromise even when highly evasive techniques are used. GuardDuty uses machine learning detections trained to identify highly suspicious data access and any potential Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) compromise, and uses integrated threat intelligence to detect malware and malicious container, database, and serverless access. GuardDuty comes with pre-integrated and continuously updated threat intelligence feeds from AWS and industry-leading, third-party providers such as CrowdStrike, Proofpoint, and Bitdefender. AWS-developed threat intelligence offers customers unique coverage against the latest global threat landscape, including emerging Linux-based malware, evolving credential exfiltration techniques, and new malicious domains identified through machine learning–based reputation models. The three new capabilities added to GuardDuty build on the hundreds of features and enhancements available since its launch and expand security coverage to other AWS workloads and core deployment use cases. The capabilities can all be easily enabled organization-wide with a few steps and no other requirements or prerequisites, resulting in actionable, contextual, and timely security findings with resource-specific details to help quickly investigate and respond. The new capabilities include: New container runtime protection for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS): GuardDuty EKS Runtime Monitoring introduces a fully managed, lightweight security agent that profiles and monitors on-host operating system–level behavior such as file access, process execution, and network connections. In tight collaboration with Amazon EKS, the agent performs without requiring customers to deploy, maintain, or update it. This allows GuardDuty to add security coverage comparable to other agent-based solutions, while maintaining easy-on enablement. It deepens GuardDuty protection for Amazon EKS deployments and decreases the operational overhead and complexity often required to achieve this level of coverage, especially in highly dynamic, containerized compute environments. GuardDuty now makes it easier to achieve runtime coverage across all Amazon EKS workloads in an account or organization. Account and data compromise can often start with a single compromised endpoint or container that then escalates to credential compromise and can spread to the broader AWS environment and data stored in it. With GuardDuty's visibility across runtime events, Kubernetes audit logs, and broader AWS control plane and networking logs, customers can identify steps in an attack and are signaled early to contain potential security threats before the threat escalates to broader business-impacting breaches. This capability builds on the initial integration of GuardDuty EKS Protection, which monitors control plane activity by analyzing Kubernetes audit logs from existing and new Amazon EKS clusters in customers’ accounts. Extended coverage for data stored in Amazon Aurora: GuardDuty RDS Protection identifies potential threats to data stored in Aurora databases without compromising performance, productivity, or availability. GuardDuty RDS Protection profiles and monitors access activity to existing and new databases in customer accounts, and using integrated threat intelligence and a machine learning model that is trained with highly contextual RDS login activity, it can detect suspicious login activity to Aurora databases. Support for serverless applications in AWS Lambda: GuardDuty Lambda Protection mitigates security risks in customers’ serverless applications, which can be challenging for traditional threat detection methods to identify due to the added abstraction layers in serverless workloads. Once enabled, GuardDuty Lambda Protection continuously monitors serverless workloads, analyzing network communications mapped back to individual Lambda functions to detect malicious communications and popular compromise activity, such as cryptocurrency mining. “Tens of thousands of organizations across virtually every industry and geography use Amazon GuardDuty, including more than 90% of our 2,000 largest customers, helping to protect more than half a billion EC2 instances and millions of S3 buckets,” said Jon Ramsey, vice president for Security Services at AWS. “GuardDuty’s new capabilities build on this powerful foundation to expand security detection and monitoring even further, to where customers tell us they need it most: containers’ runtime monitoring, databases, and serverless applications. We’ve now more than tripled the number of managed detections since we introduced GuardDuty.” Arctic Wolf Networks is a global leader in security operations that provides security monitoring to detect and respond to cyberthreats. “Continuous monitoring is a required component for effective security operations, and as both a customer and partner of AWS, GuardDuty is a service we entrust across all of our AWS workloads,” said Adam Marrè, CISO at Arctic Wolf. “With real-time threat detection, Amazon EKS audit log monitoring, and now database protection provided via RDS Protection, GuardDuty plays a key role in helping us secure our internal security tooling and processes with the most advanced technologies, allowing us to stay focused on our mission of ending cyber risk for our customers.” Best Buy is an American multinational consumer electronics retailer. “Security is always top of mind for us, especially as we expanded our use of Amazon Aurora for our migrated and cloud native applications,” said Vaibhav Sonawane, enterprise risk and compliance cloud security engineer at Best Buy. “With GuardDuty RDS Protection, our security posture around legitimate and nonlegitimate login attempts remains strong thanks to its machine learning and intelligent threat detection capabilities. We are excited to see Amazon GuardDuty expand into new categories in AWS environments like databases because of its seamless integration, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use.” GE Digital, a business unit of General Electric (GE), is an industrial software leader bringing simplicity, speed, and scale to their customers’ digital transformations. “As a longtime customer of GuardDuty, we’re very pleased to see the continued additions of critical detections and increased coverage across AWS’s compute native services,” said Chuck Rees, senior director of cyber engineering and architecture at GE Digital. “We rely on GuardDuty and its machine learning detections to monitor access to our S3 buckets, allowing us to safeguard our sensitive data. Using GuardDuty is an easy choice for us, and the service is an integral part of securing our workloads on AWS.” Siemens, a technology and industrial manufacturing company based in Munich, produces equipment and components for energy, healthcare, and other industries around the world. “We initially selected Amazon GuardDuty to monitor our AWS accounts for malicious activity,” said Scott Schwartz, senior infrastructure engineer at Siemens. “One of the primary drivers of our decision to use AWS was to strengthen our security posture and automate important tasks. We also wanted to have centralized access to all of our information by aggregating it from accounts across the organization. The ease with which we could adopt AWS services and integrate them into our existing tools made GuardDuty a clear choice for us.” Wiz is a cybersecurity startup with a mission to help organizations create secure cloud environments that accelerate their business. “Wiz uses Amazon GuardDuty, fully integrated with the Wiz platform’s Cloud Events & Detection, to continuously monitor our AWS environment,” said Ryan Kazanciyan, CISO at Wiz. “We are excited to see GuardDuty broaden as a comprehensive threat detection solution with the addition of detections for databases and container environments.” About Amazon Web Services Since 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

Our Advertising business continues to deliver robust growth, largely due to our ongoing machine learning investments that help customers see relevant information when they engage with us, which in turn delivers unusually strong results for brands. And, while our AWS business navigates companies spending more cautiously in this macro environment, we continue to prioritize building long-term customer relationships both by helping customers save money and enabling them to more easily leverage technologies like Large Language Models and Generative AI with our uniquely cost-effective machine learning chips (“Trainium” and “Inferentia”), managed Large Language Models (“Bedrock”), and AI code companion CodeWhisperer. We like the fundamentals we’re seeing in AWS, and believe there’s much growth ahead.” Highlights Obsessing over the customer experience Amazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, in the past quarter, Amazon: Continued to delight customers with convenient delivery options and broad selection. Nearly 26 million customers ordered items with Same-Day Delivery in the quarter, an increase of 50% compared to last year. Increased selection in its U.S. online store with the addition of new marquee beauty, home, and fashion brands, including Lancôme, Shiseido, World of Martha by Martha Stewart, Rent the Runway, KNOW Beauty by Vanessa Hudgens, as well as new The Drop collections from Harlem Fashion Row and Coco & Breezy.

Launched a new Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) capacity management system to help sellers who use Amazon’s storage, packing, and shipping fulfillment service to manage their inventory and capacity more efficiently as they scale their businesses. The management system provides sellers with more insight, predictability, visibility, and control to better plan and manage their inventory and supply chains, as well as increase capacity limits when needed. Released the third annual Brand Protection Report highlighting the company’s efforts to protect customers, brands, and selling partners from counterfeit products in 2022. The efforts resulted in more seized products, criminal referrals, and industry partnerships than ever before. The report demonstrates how Amazon is stopping bad actors and making an impact beyond Amazon’s store, including by identifying, seizing, and appropriately disposing of more than 6 million counterfeit products, preventing them from reaching customers and being resold elsewhere in the global supply chain. Launched Reviews from Amazon, a new capability that enables Buy with Prime merchants to display customer ratings and reviews from Amazon.com within their own online stores at no additional cost. Nearly 20% of Buy with Prime merchants are already using this feature, and the early feedback is that it’s helping merchants drive higher shopper conversion. Acquired One Medical, a primary care organization offering both 24/7 virtual care services and in-office visits across the U.S. for preventive and everyday health, chronic care management, pediatric care, and mental health services.

Inventing on behalf of customers Amazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that customers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better in some meaningful way. For example, this past quarter, Amazon: Announced new AWS tools that make building with generative artificial intelligence (AI) easy, practical, and cost-effective for organizations of all sizes. The tools include: Amazon Bedrock, a new managed service that offers customers the easiest way to build and scale enterprise-ready generative AI applications. Amazon Bedrock provides easy access to leading foundation models (ultra-large machine learning models that generative AI relies on) from AI startups like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, and Stability AI, as well as exclusive access to the Titan family of foundation models developed by AWS. Broad access to models gives customers flexibility and choice to customize and scale to their specific needs. Two next-generation compute offerings to deliver the lowest cost for training models and running inference in the cloud: the general availability of instances powered by AWS-designed Inferentia2 chips, AWS’s second-generation accelerator, purpose-built for deep learning inference, as well as the general availability of network-optimized Trn1n instances for large, network-intensive models. Compared to other EC2 instances, Inferentia2 provides up to 40% better inference price performance, and Trainium delivers up to 50% savings on training costs. General availability of Amazon CodeWhisperer, an AI coding companion that improves developer productivity by generating code suggestions in real time. Amazon CodeWhisperer is free for individual developers. CodeWhisperer is the most accurate, fastest, and most secure way to generate code for AWS services, including Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and Amazon S3. During a productivity challenge, participants who used CodeWhisperer completed tasks 57% faster (on average) and were 27% more likely to complete them successfully than those who didn’t use CodeWhisperer.

Amazon has surpassed 200 million Fire TV devices sold globally. Amazon also launched Amazon-built TVs in Germany, Mexico, and the UK, and collaborated with Cochlear to help people with hearing loss stream sound from their Amazon smart TVs directly to their Cochlear hearing implants. Unveiled three customer terminal designs for Project Kuiper, Amazon’s low Earth orbit satellite broadband initiative. Kuiper’s mission is to bridge the digital divide by providing fast, affordable broadband to communities worldwide that are unserved or underserved by traditional technologies. To use Kuiper’s broadband, residential and commercial customers will install an outdoor antenna, called a customer terminal, to communicate with satellites overhead. Amazon is preparing to launch two prototype satellites to test the entire end-to-end communications network this year and plans to be in beta with commercial customers in 2024. Opened Amazon Sidewalk to developer testing for the first time as part of the company’s vision to put a billion Internet of Things (IoT) devices on the network. Amazon Sidewalk is a low-bandwidth, long-range community network that connects devices across long distances where Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals often cannot reach. With Sidewalk coverage extending to 90% of the U.S. population, developers can now build and connect a new range of devices for the network. Launched a loyalty linking capability for Amazon One, Amazon’s palm recognition service that lets customers enter, identify, and pay. Panera is the first restaurant chain to offer the new loyalty linking capability, allowing customers to easily enroll in and redeem rewards, and pay for their purchases with just their palm. Empowering employees and delivery service partners In addition to its focus on customers, Amazon strives to make every day better for its employees and delivery service partners. For example, in the first quarter, the company: Announced plans to spend $200 million on safety technologies across Amazon’s U.S. transportation network in 2023. These innovations include front-collision warning, lane-departure warning, speed limiters, and 360-degree camera detection systems. They are part of Amazon’s work to ensure that vehicles and delivery partners are safe on the road, and the innovations are better for the environment. Announced that Amazon improved recordable incident rates worldwide by 11% from 2021 to 2022 and by almost 24% from 2019 to 2022. The company shared the data in the second edition of its safety report, Delivered With Care, which details how Amazon is advancing safety across its operations through investments in capital improvements, safety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineered ergonomic solutions to reduce risks for employees, partners, and communities. Reached 1 billion packages handled by Robin, a robotic system used across Amazon’s operations network in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Robin robotic systems use artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning to help employees handle and sort customer packages before shipment. For employees, this reduces the number of repetitive tasks, improving safety and helping them focus their time and energy on activities that make better use of their talents. Ranked No. 2 on Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for the seventh year in a row. The annual ranking is determined by a survey of top executives and analysts, and companies are evaluated on factors including the quality of their management and products, commitments to social responsibility, and ability to attract talent. Introduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders. Supporting communities and protecting the environment Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon: Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes. Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy for three years running. Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and now has thousands on the road. Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and Capitol Heights, Maryland.

Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.

Hans Kobler, Founder and Managing Partner at EIP, commented, “Urgent action is needed to combat climate change and a task this size cannot be done alone. It requires a coalition of diverse thought, perspective and collaboration to make actionable progress toward decarbonizing the global economy. The Elevate Future Fund is one great step forward in advancing equity and opportunity in the clean energy industry.” Investors Leading the Equitable Energy Transition Elevate attracted equity commitments from a multi-faceted LP base, with investors from the rural and urban U.S., as well as indigenous populations from the U.S. and Canada.

Amazon Business also released findings from a new poll of small-business decision-makers, which paint a picture of optimism and resilience in the face of a challenging economic climate. According to the poll of small-business decision-makers across the United States, the ​​top three challenges small-business decision-makers say are keeping them up at night are high inflation (63%), economic recession (39%), and supply chain disruptions (30%). While contending with these challenges, small businesses are heavily focused on financial resilience. Finding ways to save money and staying within budget (both at 61%) are the two most important purchasing priorities for them in the next 12 months. Even with the challenges they’re facing, small-business decision-makers remain optimistic. More than half (55%) of respondents say they feel more hopeful about the success of their business than they did a year ago. Small businesses also are looking for ways to drive future growth. They see streamlining business purchases as a way to do so. While product prices will continue to be a key factor in reducing costs and driving growth, small-business leaders also are looking at how easily they can find the products they need, alongside how convenient the purchasing process is to improve efficiency. 91% say the ability to find items that are within their price range is a key factor in growing their businesses long term. 88% say the ability to easily find items they need is a key factor in growing their businesses long term. 90% say the ability to easily purchase items they need is a key factor in growing their businesses long term. “Our small-business customers face unique challenges and are operating with more limited resources—every dollar and minute they save helps them focus their energy on growing their businesses,"" said Todd Heimes, director of Amazon Business Worldwide. ""With Amazon Business, small businesses get the selection and convenience of Amazon, alongside powerful tools that help them make buying decisions that drive towards their business goals, automate the procurement process, and save money with business pricing."" Continuing its investment in the success of small-business customers, Amazon Business launched its Small Business Grants to empower small-business growth. This year, Amazon Business will give eligible small businesses in the U.S. the chance to win more than $250,000 in grants. Existing Amazon Business customers with annual revenues of $1 million or less can apply for a grant, with one grand-prize winner, a group of finalists, and semifinalists receiving monetary grants, Business Prime memberships, select Amazon devices, and more. Applications are due by May 21, and winners will be announced on July 17. For additional information and to apply, visit this page on Amazon Small Business Grants. Virtual X Kitchen, based out of College Park, Maryland, was a 2022 grant finalist, receiving $20,000 to put into its business. The small business aims to create a sustainable restaurant model for urban areas by maximizing kitchen space for multiple owners to share and using the newest technology to streamline the ordering process. They used the grant money to fund branding initiatives to raise awareness of the company. “We are so grateful for the opportunity that the Small Business Grant has provided our business,” said Naumaan “Nomie” Hamid, CEO and founder. “Thank you to everyone that voted! It has been amazing to see how far Virtual X Kitchen has come since our launch a little over a year ago, and we can't wait to see how far it will go.” To learn about the 2022 grant winners and how they used their awards, visit the 2022 recipients page. “At Amazon Business, we are committed to the growth of small businesses and invest in education, grants, and tools to help them overcome challenges they face, and free up time and resources to focus on their mission and customers,” said Heimes. “I am particularly passionate about our Small Business Grants. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and when they succeed, we all succeed.” Survey methodology Amazon Business asked 500 small-business decision-makers in the U.S. about their online purchasing patterns, the challenges and opportunities impacting purchasing processes, and the broader landscape for small businesses.

The IMX is TD Ameritrade’s proprietary, behavior-based index, aggregating Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets. The reading for the four-week period ending April 28, 2023 ranks “moderate low” compared to historic averages. “Since the start of the year, we’ve seen the IMX score creep up month-over-month, although it remains relatively low,” said Lorraine Gavican-Kerr, Managing Director, Investor Education at TD Ameritrade. “Time will tell, but this may indicate that TD Ameritrade clients are feeling cautiously optimistic when it comes to the many unknowns the market currently faces.” The April IMX period included several macroeconomic catalysts and the beginning of the latest earnings season. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employment Situation report showed a stubbornly strong jobs market with an unemployment rate that ticked down to 3.5%. The International Monetary Fund cut its World Economic Outlook, forecasting global growth at 2.8% for 2023, down from 3.4% in 2022, before settling at 3% in 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.1% during the first quarter of 2023, well below Street forecasts of 2%. Throughout the recent corporate earnings season, many companies posted better-than-expected results but provided cautious outlooks for the rest of the year. All of this painted a picture of economic uncertainty, which could cloud the path forward for the Federal Reserve’s efforts to restore price stability. Despite this, the S&P 500® index (SPX) managed a modest rally of 1.46%, ending on its highs for the month. The Cboe Volatility Index® (VIX) ended the April period at 15.78, its lowest level since November 2021, reflecting less-volatile trading activity during the month. Still, significant risks remain, including U.S. lawmakers’ imminent need to reach a deal on raising the debt ceiling. The 10-year Treasury note yield (TNX) moved slightly lower to 3.45%, and the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) eased to 101.67. Crude Oil (/CL) was volatile once again as prices fluctuated on demand concerns, but ultimately settled modestly higher at $76.63 per barrel, up 1.05% for the month. TD Ameritrade clients were net buyers of equities overall during the period. Popular names bought included: Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Realty Income Corp. (O) Medical Properties Trust Inc. (MPW) AT&T Inc. (T) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) Names net sold during the period included: Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Apple Inc. (AAPL) Intel Corp. (INTC) Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Millennial Buys & Sells TD Ameritrade millennial clients, like the overall TD Ameritrade client population, increased exposure during the April period and were net buyers of equities. Both TD Ameritrade millennial clients and the overall TD Ameritrade client population were net buyers of Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) companies Realty Income Corporation (O) and Medical Properties Trust (MPW), as they appeared to see an opportunity to increase their exposure to real estate. Both populations were net buyers of electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (TSLA) despite its recent price cuts weighing on the company’s margins. Amazon (AMZN) was net bought by TD Ameritrade millennials in April despite comments from company leadership during its quarterly earnings call that sounded alarms regarding the future growth rate of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment. Meta Platforms (META) continued its red-hot start to 2023 with a blowout quarterly earnings report that sent shares soaring; both populations were net sellers into its strength. TD Ameritrade millennials were also net sellers of Nvidia (NVDA) as the semiconductor giant sputtered in April despite positioning itself to benefit strongly from the recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) arms race. TD Ameritrade millennial clients bought most heavily in Consumer Discretionary names, while selling was strongest in Communication Services stocks.

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized, a new configuration for Amazon Aurora that offers improved price performance and predictable pricing for customers with input/output (I/O)-intensive applications. With the new Aurora configuration, customers only pay for their database instances and storage consumption with no charges for I/O operations. Customers can now confidently predict costs for their most I/O-intensive workloads, regardless of I/O variability, helping to accelerate their decision to migrate more of their database workloads to AWS. Today, hundreds of thousands of customers, including Airbnb, Atlassian, and Samsung, rely on Aurora, a fully managed MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database that provides the performance and availability of commercial databases at up to one-tenth the cost. For customers with I/O-intensive applications like payment processing systems, ecommerce, and financial applications, I/O-Optimized offers improved performance, increasing throughput and reducing latency to support customers’ most demanding workloads. With Aurora I/O-Optimized, customers can maximize the value of their cloud investment and optimize their database spend by choosing the Aurora configuration that best matches their I/O consumption patterns. To get started with Aurora I/O-Optimized, visit aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/pricing. Organizations of all sizes and across all industries are looking to optimize their IT spend and maximize the value of their cloud investment, so they can continue to break free of their legacy databases. Historically, customers have had to choose between performance and price when evaluating database solutions. Commercial databases offer high performance and advanced availability features, but are expensive, complex to manage, have high lock-in, and come with punitive licensing terms. Other database options require less capital expense, but customers often find those cannot achieve the performance or availability of commercial databases. Amazon Aurora gives customers the right tool for the job, so that they can optimize for performance, scale, and costs when designing applications. Aurora provides simple, pay-per-request pricing based on I/O usage, so customers do not need to provision I/Os in advance. While most customers benefit from the cost-effectiveness of this pricing, the needs of individual businesses can vary widely based on sudden changes in database queries and I/O consumption from spikes in customer demand, leading to price variability. For example, the I/Os on a database powering an ecommerce application may spike based on seasonality, creating variability that makes it challenging to predict I/O needs. Alternatively, some database offerings provide a fixed price for compute, storage, and I/O, but customers must still provision I/Os in advance. Customers want cost predictability without having to provision I/Os in advance. Now, customers can choose between two Amazon Aurora configurations: Aurora Standard or Aurora I/O-Optimized. For applications with low-to-moderate I/O operations that represent less than 25% of the customer’s Aurora database spend, the Standard configuration of the service continues to offer customers a cost-effective option with high performance and availability at global scale. For customers with high I/O variability or I/O-intensive applications, Aurora I/O-Optimized provides improved price performance and predictable pricing. I/O-Optimized streamlines I/O processing by using smaller, more frequent batches, which reduces latency and improves throughput. Using I/O-Optimized, customers are not charged for individual read and write I/O operations, but instead, pay a set price for their database instances and storage. This allows customers to easily predict their database spend upfront, regardless of the I/O variability of their applications. Neither configuration requires upfront I/O provisioning, and both can scale I/Os to support a customer’s most demanding applications. “We launched Amazon Aurora with the aim of providing customers with a relational database, built for the cloud, that offered the performance and availability of commercial databases at up to one-tenth the cost. Since then, we have continued innovating to improve performance while offering customers simplicity and flexibility with solutions like Amazon Aurora Serverless v2,” said Rahul Pathak, vice president of Relational Database Engines at AWS. “Now, with Aurora I/O-Optimized, we’re giving customers great value for their high-scale I/O-intensive applications, and an even better option for customers looking to migrate their most demanding workloads to Aurora and the cloud.” Customers can launch a new cluster with Aurora I/O-Optimized, or convert an existing cluster, and easily switch between Aurora I/O-Optimized and Aurora Standard pay-per-request configurations in the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or via an AWS software development kit (SDK). For improved price performance, customers can take advantage of Aurora I/O-Optimized using existing Reserved Instances. Customers can also deploy either Aurora configuration using new Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) R7g instances, powered by AWS Graviton3 processors, with up to 20% price performance improvement. Aurora I/O-Optimized is generally available today for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition and Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition in most AWS Regions, with availability in Mainland China (Beijing), Mainland China (Ningxia), AWS GovCloud (US-East), and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions coming soon. Ancestry is a global leader in family history with more than 3 million subscribers around the world. ""Ancestry hosts more than 40 billion family history records and maintains the largest consumer DNA network in the world, with more than 23 million customer DNA samples. It’s a lot of data, and some of our I/O workloads can be highly variable,” said Cary Hoddy, vice president of Cloud Operations at Ancestry. “We use Amazon Aurora to process this data because it provides low-latency transaction processing and the ability to scale storage and I/O seamlessly to match the growing needs of our business. With Aurora I/O-Optimized, we can more accurately predict our database spend, allowing us to invest in our customer experience, benefiting our subscribers.” Edison is the oldest energy company in Europe, operating 200 plants and providing 1.6 million consumers with electricity and gas. “At Edison, we use Amazon Aurora extensively because of its reliability, performance, and features,” said Federico Morreale, head of Enterprise Architecture and Data Platform at Edison. ""With Aurora I/O-Optimized, we can pay a fixed price for database instances and storage, with no additional charges for read and write I/O operations. This will help us improve our price predictability, regardless of spikes in our I/O-intensive applications. We are excited that AWS could learn from Edison’s feedback to launch this new feature.” The NetScaler (formerly part of Citrix) business unit in Cloud Software Group radically simplifies application delivery and security in hybrid multi-cloud deployments. “We use Amazon Aurora as a relational database for the NetScaler application delivery management platform, which enables automation, orchestration, management, and analytics for application delivery across hybrid multi-cloud environments. We gather a lot of application, network, and endpoint data to help customers derive insights and ensure timely application monitoring and infrastructure performance, which is write-heavy and results in variable I/O charges,” said Raghu Goyal, director of Engineering for Cloud Services and Analytics at NetScaler. “With Aurora I/O-Optimized, we will have a predictable Aurora bill with unlimited read and write I/O capacity. By minimizing the variability of our database costs with Aurora I/O-Optimized, we can more confidently plan future spend focused on providing enhanced analytical capabilities to our end-customers using artificial intelligence and machine learning.” Razorpay is a payments solution provider in India that allows businesses to accept, process, and disburse payments with its product suite. “We use Amazon Aurora because of its security, performance, and ability to scale compute, storage, and I/O to meet the growing needs of our I/O-intensive payments processing system,"" said Murali Brahmadesam, chief technology officer and head of Engineering at Razorpay. “We’re encouraged by our early testing of Aurora I/O-Optimized that demonstrates increased throughput, lower latencies, cost savings, and price-performance gains, and we’re considering switching our entire Aurora fleet to use Aurora I/O-Optimized.” Verafin, a Nasdaq company, is an industry leader in anti-financial crime management that provides innovative solutions to fight crimes such as human trafficking, terrorist financing, and elder abuse. ""We leverage Amazon Aurora and other database systems to provide fraud detection, compliance, and high-risk customer management services and are impressed with Aurora’s ability to handle our most demanding workloads,"" said Chris Stuckless, director of Cloud at Verafin. ""We are excited that Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized will ensure predictable costs for all our customers, despite highly variable workloads. With the introduction of Aurora I/O-Optimized, we are planning to migrate all our customers to Aurora this year to simplify our database management load and better focus our resources on supporting our customers’ evolving needs.” About Amazon Web Services Since 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.
