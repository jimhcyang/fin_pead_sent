    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced the launch of its second AWS infrastructure Region in Australia—the AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) Region. Starting today, developers, startups, entrepreneurs, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and nonprofit organizations, will have greater choice for running their applications and serving end users from AWS data centers located in Australia. AWS is planning to invest an estimated $4.5 billion (approx. A$6.8 billion) in Australia by 2037 through the AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) Region. For more information about AWS Global Infrastructure, visit aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure. “Australia has a strong history of technical innovation, and the launch of a second AWS Region in Australia provides even greater resilience and enables more customers to develop cloud-based applications that help fuel economic development across the country,” said Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice president of Infrastructure Services at AWS. “The AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) Region adds to our ongoing infrastructure expansion and investments in Australia since we launched the AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region in 2012. We are proud to deepen our investment by driving local job creation, building cloud skills, and creating opportunities for growth and collaboration with our local customers and AWS Partners.” “We know how important access to secure cloud infrastructure is to Victorian businesses, and providing more choice will deliver a boost to the economy, support innovation, and help to create new jobs locally,” said Victorian Minister for Trade and Investment Tim Pallas. With the launch of the AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) Region, AWS now has 99 Availability Zones across 31 geographic regions, with announced plans to launch 12 more Availability Zones and four more AWS Regions in Canada, Israel, New Zealand, and Thailand. AWS Regions are composed of Availability Zones that place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations. The AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) Region consists of three Availability Zones and joins the existing AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region, which opened in November 2012. Availability Zones are located far enough from each other to support customers’ business continuity and near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected through redundant, ultra-low latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance. The launch of the AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) Region will enable local customers with data residency preferences to store data securely in Australia while providing customers with even lower latency to drive greater productivity, more efficient business operations, and enhanced real-time application performance. Customers will also have access to advanced AWS technologies to drive innovation including compute, storage, networking, business applications, developer tools, data analytics, security, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. AWS also released an economic impact study estimating that the company’s projected spending on the construction and operation of the new Region will support more than 2,500 full-time jobs at external businesses annually, with a planned $4.5 billion (approx. A$6.8 billion) investment in Australia by 2037. The investment includes capital expenditures on the construction of data centers, operational expenses related to ongoing utilities and facility costs, and purchases of goods and services from regional businesses. These jobs, including construction, facility maintenance, engineering, telecommunications, and other jobs within the country’s broader economy, will be part of the AWS supply chain in Australia. The construction and operation of the AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) Region is also estimated to add approximately $10.6 billion (approx. A$15.9 billion) to Australia’s GDP by 2037. Customers welcome the AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) Region Hundreds of thousands of organizations in Australia are among the millions of active customers using AWS in more than 190 countries around the world. Enterprises in Australia choose AWS to innovate and assist with accelerating time to market. Customers using AWS include Airtasker, Animal Logic, ANZ Bank, Atlassian, Canva, Cochlear, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Jim’s Group, Kmart, Lion, Lovisa, National Australia Bank, Optus, PEXA Group, Pizza Hut, Smiling Mind, Swimming Australia, Target, Telstra, Ticketek, Woodside Energy, and Youfoodz. Australian public sector customers use AWS to help drive cost savings and better serve local citizens. These customers include FrontierSI, Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT), University of Melbourne, and Victorian Land Registry Services. Australian startups, including Brighte, FloodMapp, FrankieOne, Illuvium, Law On Earth, Littlepay, Mr Yum, Omniscient Neurotechnology (o8t), Reejig, and Swoop Aero, are building their businesses with the use of AWS to rapidly scale nationally and around the world. ANZ Bank provides banking and financial products and services to more than 8.5 million retail and business customers, and operate across 32 markets. “We plan to deploy our AWS targeted workloads and applications through the AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) Region on day one and want to make it our long-term primary AWS location,” said Gerard Florian, group executive of Technology at ANZ. “The lower latency and higher performance we expect of the new AWS Region in Melbourne will help us improve our customer experience and accelerate our cloud adoption.” Littlepay is a Melbourne-based financial technology company that works with more than 250 transport and mobility providers to enable contactless payments on local buses, city networks, and national public transport systems. “Our mission is to create a universal payment experience around the world, which requires world-class global infrastructure that can grow with us,” said Amin Shayan, CEO at Littlepay. “To drive a seamless experience for our customers, we ingest and process over 1 million monthly transactions in real time using AWS, which enables us to generate insights that help us improve our services. We are excited about the launch of a second AWS Region in Australia, as it gives us access to advanced technologies, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, at a lower latency to help make commuting a simpler and more enjoyable experience.” PEXA Group operates Australia’s leading digital property settlement platform, which provides an efficient, reliable, and secure settlement experience for home buyers and sellers. “Operational resilience is at the heart of our commitment to customers and our regulatory imperatives, which is why it is a top strategic priority at PEXA,” said Eglantine Etiemble, chief technology officer at PEXA Group. “The launch of a second AWS Region in Australia makes it possible for us to deploy applications securely across multiple Regions to improve the availability and performance of our PEXA platform and continue helping more than 20,000 families a week settle their homes sooner.” RMIT is a public research university with more than 96,000 students globally. “The launch of an AWS Region in Melbourne gives us the additional capacity to assist researchers, students, and academics to deliver world-class research outcomes that benefit society,” said professor Calum Drummond, deputy vice chancellor of Research and Innovation and vice president at RMIT. “We recently launched RMIT University’s AWS Cloud Supercomputing facility, known as RACE. RMIT researchers are using RACE to advance battery technologies, photonics, and geospatial science. The low latency and high throughput of the AWS Region in Melbourne, combined with our high-bandwidth private fiber network, will enable researchers and students to innovate beyond the limitations of traditional on-premises data centers.” Australian AWS Partners also welcome the AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) Region The AWS Partner Network (APN) includes tens of thousands of independent software vendors (ISVs) and systems integrators (SIs) around the world. AWS Partners build innovative solutions and services on AWS, and the APN helps by providing business, technical, marketing, and go-to-market support to customers. AWS ISVs, SIs, and consulting partners help enterprise and public sector customers migrate to AWS, deploy mission-critical applications, and provide a full range of monitoring, automation, and management services for customers' cloud environments. Examples of Australian-based AWS Partners include Cevo, CMD Solutions, DiUS, IntelligenceBank, Local Measure, NCS, Stax, Unleash live, Urban.io, and Versent. For the full list of AWS Partners, visit aws.amazon.com/partners. Cevo is an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner that provides cloud services such as migration, data analytics, and managed services to Australian companies including David Jones, Insignia Financial, MYOB, and Jim’s Group. “Working with AWS has enabled us to expand our team by more than 60 consultants in the past 12 months to meet increased customer demand for deploying highly-regulated cloud environments,” said James Lewis, CEO at Cevo. “As cloud adoption continues to scale, we’re seeing more customers—particularly in the financial, government, and retail sectors—move to the cloud to tap into advanced modernization and analytics capabilities to ideate, design and build new customer-focused services. With the AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) Region, we can enable customers to drive more experimentation at scale, while providing assurance that their data is stored securely in Australia.” Commitment to sustainability As part of The Climate Pledge, Amazon is committed to reaching net-zero carbon across its business by 2040 and is on a path to powering operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the original 2030 target. Amazon is the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, and as of 2021, reached 85% renewable energy across its business. Additionally, AWS will be water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations. Amazon has three renewable energy investments in Australia, which include a wind farm in Hawkesdale, Victoria, and two solar farms in New South Wales, in Gunnedah and Suntop. When all three projects are operational, these renewable energy investments are expected to generate 717,000 megawatt-hours of renewable energy annually, the equivalent of the annual power use of almost 115,000 Australian homes. Amazon now has 57 renewable energy projects across the Asia-Pacific region. About Amazon Web Services For over 15 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud offering. AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any workload, and it now has more than 200 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 99 Availability Zones within 31 geographic regions, with announced plans for 12 more Availability Zones and four more AWS Regions in Canada, Israel, New Zealand, and Thailand.

AWS plant, bis 2037 durch die Region AWS Asien-Pazifik (Melbourne) schätzungsweise 4,5 Milliarden US-Dollar (ungefähr 6,8 Milliarden australische Dollar) in Australien zu investieren. Weitere Informationen über AWS Global Infrastructure finden Sie unter aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure. „Australien hat eine starke Tradition technischer Innovationen. Die Einführung der zweiten AWS-Region in Australien bietet noch mehr Stabilität und ermöglicht es mehr Kunden, cloudbasierte Anwendungen zu entwickeln, die wiederum die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung im ganzen Land fördern“, so Prasad Kalyanaraman, Vice President of Infrastructure Services bei AWS. „Die Region AWS Asien-Pazifik (Melbourne) ergänzt unsere fortlaufende Infrastrukturerweiterung und unsere Investitionen in Australien seit der Einführung der Region AWS Asien-Pazifik (Sydney) im Jahr 2012. Wir sind stolz, durch die Schaffung lokaler Arbeitsplätze, die Entwicklung von Cloud-Kompetenzen und die Schaffung von Wachstumschancen und Möglichkeiten der Zusammenarbeit mit unseren lokalen Kunden und AWS-Partnern unsere Investitionen zu vertiefen.“ „Wir wissen, wie wichtig Unternehmen in Victoria der Zugang zu einer sicheren Cloud-Infrastruktur ist. Die Bereitstellung von mehr Auswahlmöglichkeiten wird der Wirtschaft einen Schub geben, die Innovationsleistung unterstützten und bei der Schaffung neuer lokaler Arbeitsplätze helfen“, so der Minister für Handel und Investment von Victoria, Tim Pallas. Mit der Einführung der Region AWS Asien-Pazifik (Melbourne) hat AWS 99 Availability Zones in 31 geografischen Regionen und plant die Einführung von 12 weiteren Availability Zones und vier weiteren AWS-Regionen in Kanada, Israel, Neuseeland und Thailand. Die AWS-Regionen setzen sich aus Availability Zones zusammen, die Infrastruktur an separaten und unterschiedlichen geografischen Standorten bereitstellen. Die Region AWS Asien-Pazifik (Melbourne) besteht aus drei Availability Zones und ergänzt die bestehende Region AWS Asien-Pazifik (Sydney), die im November 2012 eingeführt wurde. Die Availability Zones liegen weit genug voneinander entfernt, sodass die Geschäftskontinuität der Kunden unterstützt wird, jedoch auch nahe genug beieinander, um niedrige Latenzzeiten für Hochverfügbarkeitsanwendungen bereitzustellen, die mehrere Availability Zones nutzen. Jede Availability Zone wird separat mit Strom versorgt, gekühlt und physisch gesichert und ist über redundante Netzwerke mit extrem niedriger Latenzzeit verbunden. AWS-Kunden, denen es auf hohe Verfügbarkeit ankommt, können ihre Anwendungen so entwickeln, dass sie in mehreren Availability Zones laufen, wodurch eine noch größere Fehlertoleranz erreicht wird. Die Einführung der Region AWS Asien-Pazifik (Melbourne) wird es lokalen Kunden mit Anforderungen an die Datenresidenz ermöglichen, ihre Daten sicher in Australien zu speichern, und ihnen gleichzeitig eine noch geringere Latenzzeit bieten, um die Produktivität zu steigern, die Geschäftsabläufe effizienter zu machen und die Echtzeit-Anwendungsleistung zu verbessern. Kunden erhalten darüber hinaus Zugang zu fortschrittlichen AWS-Technologien, die sie bei ihrer Innovationsarbeit unterstützen, darunter Rechenleistung, Speicher, Netzwerke, Geschäftsanwendungen, Entwicklertools, Datenanalytik, Sicherheit, maschinelles Lernen und künstliche Intelligenz. AWS hat ferner eine Studie über die wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen herausgegeben, laut der die projizierten Ausgaben des Unternehmens für den Bau und Betrieb der neuen Region jährlich mehr als 2.500 Vollzeitarbeitsplätze bei externen Unternehmen schaffen werden, wobei die geplanten Investitionen in Australien bis 2037 auf 4,5 Milliarden US-Dollar (ungefähr 6,8 Milliarden australische Dollar) beziffert werden. Die Investitionen umfassen Kapitalausgaben für den Bau von Rechenzentren, operative Kosten im Zusammenhang mit laufenden Versorgungs- und Anlagenkosten sowie die Beschaffung von Gütern und Dienstleistungen von regionalen Unternehmen. Diese Jobs in Sektoren wie Bau, Anlagenwartung, Technik, Telekommunikation und weitere Jobs in der breiteren Wirtschaft des Landes werden Teil der Lieferkette von AWS in Australien sein. Der Bau und Betrieb der Region AWS Asien-Pazifik (Melbourne) soll bis 2037 geschätzte 10,6 Milliarden US-Dollar (ungefähr 15,9 Milliarden australische Dollar) zu Australiens Bruttoinlandsprodukt beitragen. Kunden begrüßen die Region AWS Asien-Pazifik (Melbourne) Hunderttausende Organisationen in Australien schließen sich den Millionen aktiver Kunden an, die AWS in mehr als 190 Ländern auf der ganzen Welt nutzen. Unternehmen in Australien entscheiden sich für AWS, um Innovationsarbeit zu betreiben und die Markteinführungszeit zu verkürzen. Zu den Kunden, die AWS nutzen, gehören Airtasker, Animal Logic, ANZ Bank, Atlassian, Canva, Cochlear, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Jim’s Group, Kmart, Lion, Lovisa, National Australia Bank, Optus, PEXA Group, Pizza Hut, Smiling Mind, Swimming Australia, Target, Telstra, Ticketek, Woodside Energy und Youfoodz.

Con el lanzamiento de la Región de AWS de Asia Pacífico (Melbourne), AWS cuenta con 99 zonas de disponibilidad en 31 regiones geográficas, y planes para lanzar 12 zonas de disponibilidad más y otras cuatro regiones de AWS en Canadá, Israel, Nueva Zelanda y Tailandia. Las regiones de AWS se componen de zonas de disponibilidad que colocan la infraestructura en ubicaciones geográficas distintas y separadas. La Región de AWS de Asia Pacífico (Melbourne) consta de tres zonas de disponibilidad y se suma a la región ya existente de AWS de Asia Pacífico (Sídney), que abrió en noviembre de 2012. Las zonas de disponibilidad están ubicadas lo suficientemente lejos unas de otras para respaldar la continuidad del negocio de los clientes y lo suficientemente cerca como para proporcionar baja latencia para aplicaciones de alta disponibilidad que utilizan múltiples zonas de disponibilidad. Cada zona de disponibilidad tiene energía, refrigeración y seguridad física independientes y está conectada a través de redes redundantes de latencia ultrabaja. Los clientes de AWS enfocados en la alta disponibilidad pueden diseñar sus aplicaciones para que se ejecuten en varias zonas de disponibilidad con el objeto de lograr una tolerancia a fallos aún mayor. El lanzamiento de la Región de AWS de Asia Pacífico (Melbourne) permitirá a los clientes locales con preferencia de residencia de datos que almacenen datos de manera segura en Australia, a la vez que brindan a los clientes una latencia aún menor para impulsar una mayor productividad, más eficacia en las operaciones comerciales y rendimiento de aplicaciones mejorado en tiempo real. Los clientes tendrán acceso a tecnologías de AWS avanzadas para impulsar la innovación, que incluyen cómputos, almacenamiento, redes, aplicaciones comerciales, herramientas de desarrollo, análisis de datos, seguridad, aprendizaje automático e inteligencia artificial. AWS también publicó un estudio de impacto económico que estima que el gasto de la empresa proyectado para la construcción y operación de la nueva Región generará más de 2500 puestos de trabajo de tiempo completo por año entre sus proveedores externos, con una inversión planificada de $4,5 mil millones (aprox. A$6,8 mil millones) en Australia para 2037. La inversión incluye gastos de capital en la construcción de centros de datos, gastos operativos como los costos continuos de servicios públicos e instalaciones, y la compra de bienes y servicios de empresas regionales. Estos trabajos serán parte de la cadena de suministro de AWS en Australia, que incluyen puestos de trabajo en la construcción, el mantenimiento de instalaciones, la ingeniería, las telecomunicaciones y en la economía del país en general. También se estima que la construcción y la operación de la Región de AWS de Asia Pacífico (Melbourne) agregará aproximadamente $10,6 mil millones (aprox. A$15,9 mil millones) al PBI de Australia para 2037.

    "text": "SEATTLE (EUA)--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A Amazon Web Services (AWS), uma empresa da Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), anunciou hoje o lançamento de sua segunda região de infraestrutura da AWS na Austrália, a região da AWS Ásia-Pacífico (Melbourne). A partir de hoje, desenvolvedores, startups, empreendedores e empresas, bem como organizações governamentais, educacionais e sem fins lucrativos, terão mais opções para executar seus aplicativos e atender usuários finais a partir de data centers da AWS localizados na Austrália. A AWS planeja investir cerca de US$ 4,5 bilhões na Austrália até 2037 por meio da região da AWS Ásia-Pacífico (Melbourne). Para obter mais informações sobre a Infraestrutura global da AWS, acesse aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure. “A Austrália tem um forte histórico de inovação técnica e o lançamento de uma segunda região da AWS na Austrália oferece uma resiliência ainda maior e permite que mais clientes desenvolvam aplicativos baseados em nuvem que ajudam a impulsionar o desenvolvimento econômico em todo o país”, disse Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice-presidente de Serviços de Infraestrutura da AWS. “A região da AWS Ásia-Pacífico (Melbourne) se soma à nossa expansão contínua de infraestrutura e investimentos na Austrália desde que lançamos a região da AWS Ásia-Pacífico (Sydney) em 2012. Temos orgulho de aprofundar nosso investimento impulsionando a criação de empregos locais, desenvolvendo habilidades na nuvem e criando oportunidades de crescimento e colaboração com nossos clientes locais e parceiros da AWS.” “Sabemos o quão importante é o acesso à infraestrutura de nuvem segura para as empresas de Vitória [estado no sudeste da Austrália], e fornecer mais opções impulsionará a economia, apoiará a inovação e ajudará a criar novos empregos localmente”, comentou o Ministro de Comércio e Investimento de Vitória, Tim Pallas. Com o lançamento da região da AWS Ásia-Pacífico (Melbourne), a AWS possui agora 99 zonas de disponibilidade em 31 regiões geográficas, com planos anunciados para lançar mais 12 zonas de disponibilidade e mais quatro regiões da AWS no Canadá, Israel, Nova Zelândia e Tailândia. As regiões da AWS são compostas por zonas de disponibilidade que posicionam a infraestrutura em localizações geográficas separadas e distintas. A região da AWS Ásia-Pacífico (Melbourne) consiste em três zonas de disponibilidade e se une à região existente da AWS Ásia-Pacífico (Sydney), inaugurada em novembro de 2012. As zonas de disponibilidade estão localizadas longe o suficiente umas das outras para dar suporte à continuidade dos negócios dos clientes, mas próximas o suficiente para fornecer baixa latência para aplicativos de alta disponibilidade que usam várias zonas de disponibilidade. Cada zona de disponibilidade tem energia, resfriamento e segurança física independentes e é conectada por meio de redes redundantes de latência ultrabaixa. Os clientes da AWS focados em alta disponibilidade podem projetar seus aplicativos para serem executados em várias zonas de disponibilidade para obter uma tolerância a falhas ainda maior. O lançamento da região AWS Ásia-Pacífico (Melbourne) permitirá que clientes locais com preferências de residência de dados armazenem dados com segurança na Austrália, ao mesmo tempo em que oferece aos clientes uma latência ainda menor para gerar maior produtividade, operações comerciais mais eficientes e melhor desempenho de aplicativos em tempo real. Os clientes também terão acesso a tecnologias avançadas da AWS para impulsionar a inovação, incluindo computação, armazenamento, rede, aplicativos de negócios, ferramentas de desenvolvimento, análise de dados, segurança, aprendizado de máquina e inteligência artificial. A AWS também publicou um estudo de impacto econômico estimando que os gastos projetados da empresa na construção e operação da nova região suportarão mais de 2,5 mil empregos em tempo integral em empresas externas anualmente, com um investimento planejado de US$ 4,5 bilhões na Austrália até 2037. O investimento inclui despesas de capital na construção de data centers, despesas operacionais relacionadas a serviços públicos em andamento e custos de instalação e compras de bens e serviços de empresas regionais. Esses trabalhos, incluindo a construção, manutenção de instalações, engenharia, telecomunicações e outros empregos na economia do país, farão parte da cadeia de suprimentos da AWS na Austrália. Estima-se que a construção e operação da região da AWS Ásia-Pacífico (Melbourne) acrescente algo em torno a US$ 10,6 bilhões ao PIB da Austrália até 2037. Clientes dão as boas-vindas à região da AWS Ásia-Pacífico (Melbourne) Centenas de milhares de organizações na Austrália estão entre os milhões de clientes ativos que usam a AWS em mais de 190 países ao redor do mundo.

    "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/aws2-20230126.jpg",
    "site": "businesswire.com",
    "text": "シアトル--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- アマゾン・ドット・コム（NASDAQ：AMZN）傘下のアマゾン ウェブ サービス（AWS）は本日、オーストラリアで2番目のAWSインフラストラクチャリージョンとなるAWSアジアパシフィック（メルボルン）リージョンの開設を発表しました。本日より、デベロッパー、スタートアップ企業、起業家、大企業のほか、政府、教育機関、非営利団体は、オーストラリアにあるAWSデータセンターからアプリケーションを実行してエンドユーザーにサービスを提供するためのより広範な選択肢を利用できます。AWSは、AWSアジアパシフィック（メルボルン）リージョンを通じて、2037年までにオーストラリアで推定45億ドル（約68億豪ドル）を投資する計画です。AWSグローバル・インフラストラクチャーの詳細情報については、aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructureをご覧ください。 AWSのインフラストラクチャー・サービス担当バイスプレジデントのプラサド・カリャナラマンは、次のように述べています。「オーストラリアは技術革新の強固な歴史を持っており、オーストラリアにおける2つ目のAWSリージョンの開設によって、さらに回復性が高まり、より多くの顧客が国全体の経済発展を促進するクラウドベースのアプリケーションを開発できるようになります。AWSアジアパシフィック（メルボルン）リージョンは、2012年にAWSアジアパシフィック（シドニー）リージョンを開設して以来オーストラリアで継続しているインフラストラクチャーの拡張と投資に追加するものです。現地の雇用創出を促進し、クラウドのスキルを高め、現地の顧客やAWSパートナーとの成長と協力の機会を創出することによって、投資を深めていけることを誇りに思います。」 ビクトリア州のティム・パラス貿易・投資大臣は、次のように述べています。「私たちは、ビクトリア州の企業にとって安全なクラウド・インフラストラクチャーへのアクセスがいかに重要であるかを承知しています。より多くの選択肢を提供することは、経済の活性化をもたらし、革新を支援し、現地での新たな雇用創出を助けるでしょう。」 AWSアジアパシフィック（メルボルン）リージョンの開設により、AWSは31地域で99カ所のアベイラビリティーゾーンを持つことになり、カナダ、イスラエル、ニュージーランド、タイでさらに12カ所のアベイラビリティーゾーンとさらに4カ所のAWSリージョンを立ち上げる計画がすでに発表されています。AWSリージョンは、明確に異なる地域にインフラストラクチャーを配置するアベイラビリティーゾーンで構成されています。AWSアジアパシフィック（メルボルン）リージョンは、3つのアベイラビリティーゾーンで構成され、2012年11月に開設された既存のAWSアジアパシフィック（シドニー）リージョンに加わります。各アベイラビリティーゾーンは相互に距離が十分に離れているため、顧客の事業継続を支えることができます。そして、複数のアベイラビリティーゾーンを使用する高可用性アプリケーションで低遅延を実現できる程度に近接して設けられています。各アベイラビリティーゾーンは独立した電源、冷却装置、物理的セキュリティーを備え、冗長な超低遅延ネットワークで接続されています。高可用性を重視するAWSのお客さまは、複数のアベイラビリティーゾーンでアプリケーションを実行することで耐障害性がさらに高まるように設計することも可能です。 AWSアジアパシフィック（メルボルン）リージョンの開設により、データレジデンシーを望む現地顧客は、オーストラリアにデータを安全に保管することが可能になるとともに、顧客にさらなる低遅延を提供し、生産性の向上、業務の効率化、リアルタイム・アプリケーションのパフォーマンス向上を推進できます。また、お客さまは、高度なAWSテクノロジーを使用して、演算、保存、ネットワーキング、ビジネスアプリケーション、開発者ツール、データ分析、セキュリティー、機械学習、人工知能を含む革新を推進できます。 また、AWSは経済効果調査を発表しました。この調査では、新しいリージョンの建設・運営に費やすプロジェクト支出が外部企業で年間平均2500人以上のフルタイム雇用をサポートすると試算されており、2037年までにオーストラリアで45億ドル（約68億豪ドル）の投資が計画されています。この投資には、データセンター建設のための設備投資、継続的な光熱費や設備費などの運営費、地域企業からの商品やサービスの購入が含まれています。この雇用は、建設、設備保守、エンジニアリング、通信、国内経済全体のその他の仕事を含み、オーストラリア内のAWSのサプライチェーンの一部となります。また、AWSアジアパシフィック（メルボルン）リージョンの建設と運用により、2037年までにオーストラリアのGDPが約106億ドル（約159億豪ドル）押し上げられると見積もられています。 顧客はAWSアジアパシフィック（メルボルン）リージョンを歓迎 オーストラリアの数十万の組織は、世界190カ国以上でAWSを利用している数百万のアクティブ顧客の一部です。オーストラリアの企業は、革新を起こし、市場投入までの時間短縮を支援するためにAWSを選択しています。AWSを利用している顧客には、エアタスカー、アニマル・ロジック、ANZ銀行、アトラシアン、キャンバ、コクレア、オーストラリア・コモンウェルス銀行、ジムズグループ、Kマート、ライオン、ロビサ、ナショナルオーストラリア銀行、オプタス、PEXAグループ、ピザハット、スマイリング・マインド、スイミング・オーストラリア、ターゲット、テルストラ、チケテック、ウッドサイド・エナジー、Youfoodzが含まれます。オーストラリアの公共部門の顧客は、AWSを利用してコスト削減を促進し、地元市民により良いサービスを提供できるようにしています。これらの顧客には、フロンティアSI、メルボルン・ゲノミクス・ヘルス連盟、ロイヤル・メルボルン工科大学（RMIT）、メルボルン大学、Victorian Land Registry Servicesが含まれます。Brighte、FloodMapp、FrankieOne、Illuvium、Law On Earth、Littlepay、Mr Yum、オムニシエント・ニューロテクノロジー（o8t）、Reejig、Swoop Aeroなどのオーストラリアのスタートアップ企業は、国内および世界中で急拡大するために、AWSを使用してビジネスを構築しています。 ANZ銀行は、850万以上の個人顧客および法人顧客に銀行・金融の商品やサービスを提供し、32市場で事業を展開しています。ANZの技術担当グループエグゼクティブのジェラード・フロリアン氏は、次のように述べています。「私たちは、AWSアジアパシフィック（メルボルン）リージョンを通じて、AWSの対象ワークロードとアプリケーションを初日から展開する計画です。このリージョンを長期的に主要なAWS拠点にしたいと考えています。私たちがメルボルンの新しいAWSリージョンに期待する低遅延性と高いパフォーマンスは、顧客体験の向上と、クラウド導入の加速を支援するでしょう。」 Littlepayはメルボルンの金融技術企業であり、250以上の交通機関やモビリティー事業者と提携し、ローカルバス、都市ネットワーク、全国規模の公共交通システムでの非接触決済を可能にしています。Littlepay最高経営責任者（CEO）のAmin Shayan氏は、次のように述べています。「私たちの使命は、世界中で共通の決済体験を作り出すことです。そのためには、私たちと共に成長できるワールドクラスの世界的インフラストラクチャーが必要です。顧客にシームレスな体験を提供するために、私たちはAWSを利用して毎月100万件以上のトランザクションをリアルタイムに取り込んで処理しており、これによって私たちはサービス向上に役立つ洞察を生み出すことができます。オーストラリアで2つ目のAWSリージョンの開設をうれしく思います。これにより、機械学習や人工知能などの先進技術を低遅延で利用できるようになり、通勤をよりシンプルで楽しいものにするために役立ちます。」 PEXAグループは、オーストラリアで有数のデジタル不動産決済プラットフォームを運営しており、住宅の買い手と売り手に効率的で信頼性が高く安全な決済体験を提供しています。PEXAグループ最高技術責任者のEglantine Etiemble氏は、次のように述べています。「業務回復力は、顧客への約束と規制要件の中核をなすものであるため、PEXAでは戦略上の最優先事項となっています。オーストラリアで2つ目のAWSリージョン開設により、私たちは、複数のリージョンにわたって安全にアプリケーションを展開して当社のPEXAプラットフォームの可用性とパフォーマンスを向上させ、週に2万世帯以上が早期に住居を決済する支援を継続的に行うことが可能になります。」 RMITは、世界で9万6000人以上の学生が在籍する公立研究大学です。RMITの研究・革新担当バイスチャンセラーでバイスプレジデントのカルム・ドラムンド教授は、次のように述べています。「メルボルンでのAWSリージョン開設により、私たちは、研究員、学生、研究者が社会に貢献する世界レベルの研究成果を出すことを支援するための追加的能力を得られます。私たちは最近、RACEと呼ばれる、RMIT大学のAWSクラウド・スーパーコンピューティング施設を立ち上げました。RMITの研究者は、バッテリー技術、フォトニクス、地理空間科学の発展のためにRACEを利用しています。メルボルンのAWSリージョンの低遅延性と高スループットと、私たちの広帯域プライベートファイバーネットワークによって、研究者や学生は従来のオンプレミスデータセンターの限界を超えた革新を実現できるようになるでしょう。」 オーストラリアのAWSパートナーもAWSアジアパシフィック（メルボルン）リージョンを歓迎 AWSパートナーネットワーク（APN）には、世界各地の数万社の独立系ソフトウェア・ベンダー（ISV）とシステム・インテグレーター（SI）が含まれます。AWSパートナーは、AWS上で革新的なソリューションとサービスを構築しており、APNは、事業面、技術面、マーケティング面、商品化面のサポートを顧客に提供することで支援を提供しています。AWSのISV、SI、コンサルティング・パートナーは、企業や公共機関の顧客のAWSへの移行や基幹業務用アプリケーションの導入を支援し、顧客のクラウド環境の監視、自動化、管理サービスを全面的に提供しています。オーストラリアを拠点とするAWSパートナーには、Cevo、CMDソリューションズ、DiUS、インテリジェンスバンク、ローカル・メジャー、NCS、Stax、Unleash live、Urban.io、Versentが含まれます。AWSパートナーの完全なリストは、aws.amazon.com/partnersをご覧ください。 Cevoは、AWSアドバンスト・コンサルティング・パートナーとして、デビッド・ジョーンズ、インシグニア・ファイナンシャル、MYOB、Jim’s Groupなどのオーストラリア企業に、移行、データ分析、マネージドサービスなどのクラウド・サービスを提供しています。Cevo最高経営責任者（CEO）のジェームズ・ルイス氏は、次のように述べています。「AWSとの連携により、過去12カ月間で60名以上のコンサルタントを増員することができ、規制の厳しいクラウド環境の導入に対する顧客の要望の高まりに応えることができました。クラウドの導入が拡大を続ける中、特に金融、政府、小売の分野において、より多くの顧客がクラウドに移行し、高度な近代化と分析能力を活用して、顧客に焦点を当てた新しいサービスを考案、設計、構築しています。AWSアジアパシフィック（メルボルン）リージョンにより、私たちは、顧客のデータがオーストラリアで安全に保管されていることを保証しつつ、顧客が実験をより大規模に進められるようにすることができます。」 持続可能性への取り組み アマゾンは、クライメート・プレッジの一環として、2040年までに事業全体で炭素ネットゼロを達成することに取り組んでおり、当初の2030年の目標よりも5年早い2025年までに、100%再生可能エネルギーでの事業運営を実現する歩みを進めています。アマゾンは、世界最大の再生可能エネルギーの購入企業であり、2021年時点で、事業全体で再生可能エネルギー利用率85%を達成しました。さらに、AWSは2030年までにウォーター・ポジティブを実現し、直接事業で使用する以上の水を地域社会に還元する予定です。アマゾンはオーストラリアで、ビクトリア州ホークスデールの風力発電所、ニューサウスウェールズ州のガンネダとサントップの2つの太陽光発電所を含む3つの再生可能エネルギー投資を行っています。この3つのプロジェクトがすべて稼働すると、これらの再生可能エネルギー投資は、年間71万7000メガワット時の再生可能エネルギーを生み出す見込みです。これは、オーストラリアの約11万5000世帯の年間電力使用量に相当する量です。アマゾンは現在、アジア太平洋地域に57件の再生可能エネルギープロジェクトを有しています。 アマゾン ウェブ サービスについて アマゾン ウェブ サービスは15年以上にわたり、世界で最も包括的で広く導入されているクラウド・サービスとなってきました。AWSは、事実上すべてのワークロードをサポートするためにサービスを継続的に拡大しており、現在、演算、保存、データベース、ネットワーキング、アナリティクス、機械学習、人工知能（AI）、モノのインターネット（IoT）、モバイル、セキュリティー、ハイブリッド、仮想現実と拡張現実（VR、AR）、メディア、アプリケーション開発、導入、管理のための200件を超えるフル機能のサービスを31カ所の地域にある99カ所のアベイラビリティーゾーンから提供しています。また、カナダ、イスラエル、ニュージーランド、タイでさらに12カ所のアベイラビリティーゾーンと4カ所のAWSリージョンの計画が発表されています。最も急成長している新興企業、大企業、主要政府機関を含む数百万のお客さまが、AWSを信頼してインフラストラクチャーを強化し、即応性を高め、コストを引き下げています。AWSの詳細については、aws.amazon.comをご覧ください。 アマゾンについて アマゾンは、4つの指針として、競争よりも顧客に目を向けること、発明に情熱を傾けること、優れたオペレーションに注力すること、長期的に思考することを拠り所としています。Amazonは、地球上で最も顧客中心主義の企業、地球上で最高の雇用主、地球上で最も安全に働ける職場であるすべく懸命に努力しています。利用者レビュー、ワンクリック・ショッピング、個人に合わせたお勧め、プライム、アマゾン・フルフィルメント、AWS、Kindleダイレクト・パブリッシング、Kindle、Career

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced that Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich), a leading multi-line insurer providing property, casualty, and life insurance solutions globally, is moving its enterprise information technology (IT) infrastructure to AWS. Zurich will use AWS’s reliable global infrastructure, advanced analytics, and machine learning technologies to deliver new digital customer experiences and drive automation at scale, in support of its worldwide digital strategy. As part of the multiyear strategic collaboration, Zurich will move 1,000 applications to AWS by 2025, including core insurance and SAP workloads. Zurich will move its critical applications to AWS, simplifying, modernizing, and automating the company’s infrastructure. This approach will provide flexible and scalable application environments, enabling agile product development. Using Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Aurora (AWS’s fully managed MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud), and AWS App Runner (AWS’s service to quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs), Zurich will develop and bring new products to market quicker, saving approximately $30 million a year. As a result, Zurich can focus on innovation and new customer experiences, reinvesting valuable resources into new business opportunities, recruitment, and acquisition strategies. By embracing cloud technologies, Zurich will also be able to streamline and optimize its core business processes and better prepare for new reporting requirements in 2023, including alignment with international financial reporting standards—IFRS 9 and IFRS 17. Zurich will use RISE with SAP on AWS, a fully managed offering that combines SAP’s solution and implementation experience with AWS' experience in helping customers transform their SAP landscapes on the cloud. By migrating its SAP environment to AWS, Zurich will create a modern, cloud-based system connecting data across its entire business. The SAP workloads migration will consist of 20 landscapes, a collection of servers for a specific workload, including more than 100 individual systems such as human resources (HR) and finance. AWS’s extensive SAP experience will allow Zurich to increase the performance of its SAP applications and integrate its data with advanced analytics and machine learning services to gain predictive capabilities and enterprise-wide reporting. Zurich works with AWS Skills Guild, a comprehensive skills enablement program that helps organizations accelerate cloud outcomes by creating excitement, increasing employee engagement, and nurturing a culture of learning. The insurance provider has already trained more than 400 employees, with plans to further grow the program. Zurich offers skills development opportunities to help attract and train new employee talent, and accelerate cloud adoption across the company. “We want to help our retail customers lead safer and healthier lives, and bring our business customers peace of mind, by using the power of digital technologies to meet their evolving needs,” said Zurich’s Ericson Chan, Group Chief Information and Digital Officer. “Working with AWS will transform the way we bring solutions to market and enable us to make the most accurate and up-to-date insights available to our customers. We look forward to using the new AWS Region in Switzerland to support our regulatory reporting requirements.” “Zurich’s focus on customers and innovation over the last 150 years is why it remains a leading insurer for more than 55 million people and businesses around the world. Moving their most critical business applications to AWS allows Zurich to put data at the heart of its business to automate processes, increase efficiency, and improve customer responsiveness,” said Matt Garman, senior vice president of Sales, Marketing, and Global Services at Amazon Web Services. “Combining Zurich’s financial expertise with AWS’s broad functionality will help the insurer continue to evolve its business to anticipate customer needs, and provide more personalized insurance products.” About Amazon Web Services Since 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud. AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any workload, and it now has more than 200 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 99 Availability Zones within 31 geographic regions, with announced plans for 12 more Availability Zones and four more AWS Regions in Canada, Israel, New Zealand, and Thailand.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced that in 2022 it grew its renewable energy capacity by 8.3 gigawatts (GW) through 133 new projects in 11 countries. This brings Amazon’s total portfolio to more than 20 GW—that could generate the amount of energy to power 5.3 million U.S. homes—across 401 renewable energy projects in 22 countries. The company’s renewable energy purchases continue to add new wind and solar projects on the grids that power Amazon’s operations, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers, Amazon fulfillment centers, and physical stores around the world. With these continued investments, Amazon set a new corporate record for the most renewable energy announced by a single company in one year. The company remains the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy—a position it’s held since 2020, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Amazon’s continued investment in renewable energy helps to accelerate growth in new regions through innovative deal structures, technologies, and cloud solutions. These purchases also bring Amazon closer to powering its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of its original 2030 target. In 2022, the company announced new projects in Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Poland, Singapore, Spain, and the U.S., and broke ground in Brazil, India, and Indonesia. With 25 new renewable energy projects secured to close out the year, the company now has 401 projects globally, including 164 wind farms and solar farms, and 237 rooftop solar projects on Amazon facilities. Once operational, Amazon’s global renewable energy projects are expected to generate 56,881 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of clean energy each year. “As we continue to launch new renewable energy projects around the world, we’re pleased to be on track to power our operations with 100% renewable energy, five years ahead of our original target. With 133 projects in 11 countries announced in 2022, Amazon had another record year,” said Adam Selipsky, CEO of AWS. “These projects highlight the diversity of our renewable energy sources and showcase our ability to bring new technologies to new markets and further reduce the impacts of climate change.” In addition to the 108 clean energy projects the company announced in 2022, Amazon today is announcing 25 additional 2022 clean energy projects. These include: Eleven new projects in Europe, including Finland, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, totaling 372 megawatts (MW) of capacity. Tapping into one of the world’s best renewable energy resources, Amazon continued to add to its portfolio of offshore wind projects, investing in two new offshore wind projects in Europe totaling 280 MW of capacity. Four new projects in North America, totaling 918 MW of energy in Arizona, California, and Texas. A new solar project paired with energy storage in California allows Amazon to store clean energy produced by its solar projects and deploy it when solar energy is not available, such as in the evening hours, or during periods of high demand. Also in California, Amazon added its first on-site solar project at the Amazon Air Hub, where employees pack and handle freight and conduct planeside operations. Ten new renewable energy projects in India, Indonesia, and Japan. In India, a third 200 MW wind-solar hybrid project was added to Amazon’s first two wind-solar hybrid projects. Renewable hybrid energy systems can play a key role in helping India accelerate the decarbonization of power generation, lowering the cost of electricity in the medium term. These hybrid energy systems also maximize clean energy use on the grid by combining two technologies with different generation profiles, reducing variability in renewable generation, and improving grid stability. In Indonesia, Amazon invested in its first renewable energy projects, securing a first-of-its-kind agreement for corporations to access additional utility-scale solar projects. In Japan, Amazon added three on-site solar projects and a new 38 MW utility-scale solar project. Rapidly scaling renewable energy is one of the most effective strategies to fight climate change. To ensure organizations’ renewable energy purchases have the greatest impact on emissions reductions, Amazon recently led the creation of the new Emissions First coalition. This coalition is leading advocacy efforts to modernize the world’s leading carbon-accounting standard, helping to reduce carbon from global electricity grids as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. \"Amazon's clean energy portfolio doesn't just top the corporate charts—it is now among the leading utilities globally, as well,” said Kyle Harrison, head of sustainability research at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “The fact that it announced a new annual record of clean energy in a year mired by a global energy crisis, supply chain bottlenecks and high interest rates speaks to its forward planning and expertise in navigating power markets and executing long-term contracts.\" “Amidst the market uncertainty of 2022, Amazon led clean energy buyers and doubled down on its commitment to renewable energy,” said Miranda Ballentine, CEO of Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA). “Amazon’s commitment to decarbonization is demonstrated through its leading placement on CEBA’s Deal Tracker Top 10, within our member community, and on a global scale.” “As Asia continues to transition away from coal and gas, these investments by Amazon in wind and solar are further evidence that there is a large and growing corporate renewable electricity demand in this region. We look forward to continuing to work with Amazon and our other ACEC members to rapidly increase the supply of renewables and to achieve our shared 100% renewable ambitions in the region,” said Sam Kimmins, director of energy at Climate Group and Asia Clean Energy Coalition (ACEC) spokesperson. Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge in 2019, committing to reach net-zero carbon by 2040—10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The Pledge now has nearly 400 signatories, including Best Buy, IBM, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Siemens, Unilever, Verizon, and Visa. Amazon continues to transform its transportation network, including electrifying its delivery fleet and sourcing alternatives to fossil fuels—it currently has thousands of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian in more than 100 cities and regions in the U.S., more than 3,000 electric vans delivering packages to customers in Europe, and several electric vehicle partnerships in APAC. The company is also investing $2 billion in the development of decarbonizing services and solutions through The Climate Pledge Fund.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services (AWS), ein Unternehmen von Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), hat heute bekannt gegeben, dass die Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich), ein führender Mehrspartenversicherer mit weltweiten Sach-, Unfall- und Lebensversicherungslösungen, seine IT-Infrastruktur auf AWS verlagert. Zurich wird die zuverlässige globale Infrastruktur, die fortschrittliche Analytik und die Technologien für maschinelles Lernen von AWS nutzen, um zur Unterstützung seiner weltweiten digitalen Strategie in großem Umfang neue digitale Kundenerlebnisse bereitzustellen und die Automatisierung voranzutreiben. Im Rahmen der mehrjährigen strategischen Zusammenarbeit will Zurich bis 2025 insgesamt 1.000 Anwendungen, darunter zentrale Versicherungs- und SAP-Workloads, auf AWS verlagern. Durch die Verlagerung kritischer Anwendungen auf AWS soll die Infrastruktur von Zurich vereinfacht, modernisiert und automatisiert werden. Dieser Ansatz schafft flexible und skalierbare Anwendungsumgebungen und ermöglicht eine agile Produktentwicklung. Mit Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Aurora (der vollständig verwalteten, mit MySQL und PostgreSQL kompatiblen relationalen Datenbank von AWS, die für die Cloud entwickelt wurde) und AWS App Runner (dem AWS-Service für die schnelle Bereitstellung von containerisierten Webanwendungen und APIs) will Zurich neue Produkte schneller entwickeln und auf den Markt bringen, um rund 30 Millionen US-Dollar pro Jahr einzusparen. So kann sich Zurich auf Innovationen und neue Kundenerlebnisse konzentrieren und wertvolle Ressourcen in neue Geschäftsmöglichkeiten, Rekrutierungs- und Akquisitionsstrategien reinvestieren. Durch den Einsatz von Cloud-Technologien wird Zurich auch in der Lage sein, die Kerngeschäftsprozesse zu rationalisieren und zu optimieren und sich besser auf die neuen Anforderungen an die Rechnungslegung im Jahr 2023 vorzubereiten, einschließlich der Anpassung an die internationalen Rechnungslegungsstandards IFRS 9 und IFRS 17. Zurich plant die Nutzung von RISE mit SAP on AWS, ein vollständig verwaltetes Angebot, das die Lösungs- und Implementierungserfahrung von SAP mit der Erfahrung von AWS bei der Transformation von SAP-Landschaften in der Cloud kombiniert. Durch die Migration seiner SAP-Umgebung zu AWS wird Zurich ein modernes, cloudbasiertes System schaffen, das Daten über das gesamte Unternehmen hinweg verknüpft. Die Migration der SAP-Workloads wird aus 20 Landschaften bestehen, einer Sammlung von Servern für einen bestimmten Workload, darunter mehr als 100 Einzelsysteme wie Personalwesen (HR) und Finanzen. Die umfassende SAP-Erfahrung von AWS wird es Zurich ermöglichen, die Leistung seiner SAP-Anwendungen zu steigern und seine Daten mit fortschrittlichen Analyse- und maschinellen Lerndiensten zu integrieren, um Prognosefunktionen und unternehmensweite Berichte zu erhalten. Zurich nutzt AWS Skills Guild, ein umfassendes Qualifizierungsprogramm, das Unternehmen dabei hilft, Cloud-Ergebnisse zu beschleunigen, indem es Begeisterung weckt, das Engagement der Mitarbeiter steigert und eine Kultur des Lernens fördert. Der Versicherungsanbieter hat bereits mehr als 400 Mitarbeiter geschult und plant, das Programm weiter auszubauen. Zurich bietet Weiterbildungsmöglichkeiten an, um neue Mitarbeiter zu gewinnen und zu schulen und die Einführung der Cloud im gesamten Unternehmen zu beschleunigen. „Wir wollen unseren Privatkunden helfen, ein sichereres und gesünderes Leben zu führen, und unseren Geschäftskunden ein sorgenfreies Leben ermöglichen, indem wir die Leistungsfähigkeit digitaler Technologien nutzen, um ihre sich entwickelnden Bedürfnisse zu erfüllen“, sagte Ericson Chan, Group Chief Information und Digital Officer bei Zurich. „Die Zusammenarbeit mit AWS wird die Art und Weise, wie wir Lösungen auf den Markt bringen, verändern und es uns ermöglichen, unseren Kunden die genauesten und aktuellsten Erkenntnisse zur Verfügung zu stellen. Wir freuen uns darauf, die neue AWS-Region in der Schweiz zur Unterstützung unserer aufsichtsrechtlichen Berichtsanforderungen zu nutzen.“ „Dank seiner kunden- und innovationsorientierten Ausrichtung in den letzten 150 Jahren ist Zurich nach wie vor ein führender Versicherer für mehr als 55 Millionen Menschen und Unternehmen auf der ganzen Welt. Die Verlagerung der wichtigsten Geschäftsanwendungen zu AWS ermöglicht es Zurich, Daten in den Mittelpunkt seines Geschäfts zu rücken, um Prozesse zu automatisieren, die Effizienz zu steigern und die Reaktionsfähigkeit gegenüber Kunden zu verbessern“, so Matt Garman, Senior Vice President of Sales, Marketing, and Global Services bei Amazon Web Services. „Die Kombination von Zurichs Finanz-Know-how mit der umfassenden Funktionalität von AWS wird dem Versicherer helfen, sein Geschäft weiterzuentwickeln, um Kundenbedürfnisse zu antizipieren und stärker personalisierte Versicherungsprodukte anzubieten.“ Über Amazon Web Services Amazon Web Services bietet seit 2006 das umfassendste und am weitesten verbreitete Cloud-Angebot der Welt. AWS hat seine Services kontinuierlich erweitert, um praktisch jede Cloud-Arbeitslast zu unterstützen. Heute verfügt AWS über mehr als 200 voll funktionsfähige Services für Rechenleistung, Speicher, Datenbanken, Netzwerke, Analytik, maschinelles Lernen und künstliche Intelligenz (KI), Internet der Dinge (IoT), Mobiles, Sicherheit, Hybrid, Virtual und Augmented Reality (VR und AR), Medien sowie Anwendungsentwicklung, -bereitstellung und -verwaltung aus 99 Availability Zones in 31 geografischen Regionen. Es sind 12 weitere Availability Zones und vier weitere AWS-Regionen in Kanada, Israel, Neuseeland und Thailand geplant. Millionen von Kunden, darunter die am schnellsten wachsenden Startups, die größten Konzerne und führende Regierungsbehörden, vertrauen bei der Bereitstellung ihrer Infrastruktur auf AWS, um agiler zu werden und Kosten zu senken. Weitere Informationen über AWS finden Sie unter aws.amazon.com. Über Amazon Amazon verfolgt vier Prinzipien: Kundenbesessenheit statt Wettbewerbsorientierung, Leidenschaft für Erfindungen, Engagement für operative Exzellenz und langfristiges Denken. Amazon hat es sich zum Ziel gesetzt, das kundenorientierteste Unternehmen der Welt, der beste Arbeitgeber der Welt und der sicherste Arbeitsplatz der Welt zu sein.

    "text": "西雅圖--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美國商業資訊)--亞馬遜公司(NASDAQ: AMZN)旗下的亞馬遜網路服務公司(Amazon Web Services, AWS)今天宣佈，為全球提供財產、意外和人壽保險解決方案的知名多線保險公司蘇黎世保險集團（Zurich Insurance Group，簡稱“Zurich”）正在將其企業資訊科技(IT)基礎設施遷移到AWS。Zurich將利用AWS可靠的全球基礎設施、先進的分析技術和機器學習技術來提供全新的數碼化客戶體驗，並大規模推動自動化，以支援其全球數碼化策略。根據雙方的多年期策略性合作協定，Zurich將於2025年前把1,000個應用程式轉移到AWS，包括核心保險和SAP工作負載等。 Zurich將把其關鍵應用程式轉移到AWS，以簡化該公司的基礎設施，並使之現代化和自動化。這種方法將帶來靈活且可擴充的應用程式環境，支援敏捷型產品開發。利用亞馬遜關係型數據庫服務(Amazon RDS)、Amazon Aurora（AWS的全託管型並與MySQL和PostgreSQL相容的關係型數據庫，專為雲端運算打造）和AWS App Runner（可快速部署容器化Web應用程式和應用程式設計介面(API)的 AWS服務），Zurich將以更快的速度開發新產品並將之推向市場，每年可節省約3,000萬美元。應用程式遷移至AWS後，Zurich可以專注於創新和新的客戶體驗，將寶貴的資源重新投入到新的商機、招聘和收購策略中。採用雲端技術還使Zurich能夠精簡和優化其核心業務流程，並為2023年的新報告要求做更充分的準備，包括符合國際財務報告準則IFRS 9和IFRS 17的要求。 Zurich將使用AWS上的“RISE with SAP”，這是完全託管型產品，結合SAP的解決方案和實施經驗，以及AWS在協助客戶在雲端改造SAP場景方面的經驗。通過將SAP環境遷移到AWS，Zurich將打造現代的雲端型系統，連接整個業務中的數據。SAP工作負載的遷移將由20個場景組成，涉及一系列針對特定工作負載的伺服器，包括人力資源(HR)和財務等100多個獨立系統。AWS豐富的SAP經驗將幫助Zurich提高其SAP應用程式的效能，並將其數據與先進的分析和機器學習服務相融合，以獲得預測能力和企業級報告。 Zurich還將參與AWS Skills Guild計畫。AWS Skills Guild是全面的技能培育計畫，通過創造興奮點、提高員工參與度和孕育學習文化，幫助企業加快獲得雲端運算成果。Zurich已經培訓了超過400名員工，並打算進一步發展該計畫。Zurich提供技能發展機會，幫助吸引和培訓新的員工人才，並加速整個公司的雲端普及。 Zurich集團資訊與數碼總監Ericon Chan表示：「我們希望利用強大的數碼科技來迎合客戶不斷演變的需求，協助零售客戶擁有更安全、更健康的生活，並使商業客戶安心無憂。與AWS合作將改變我們將解決方案推向市場的方式，使我們能夠為客戶提供更正確和更新的見解。我們期待利用位於瑞士的新AWS區域來支援我們的監管報告要求。」 AWS銷售、營銷和全球服務高級副總裁Matt Garman表示：「在過去的150年裡，Zurich專注於客戶和創新，從而鑄就了該公司今天的一流保險公司地位，為全球5,500多萬個人和企業提供服務。將至關重要的業務應用程式轉移到AWS，使Zurich能夠將數據置於其業務核心，促使流程自動化，提高效率，並改善客戶回應能力。Zurich的金融專長與AWS的廣泛功能相結合，將有助於Zurich持續發展業務，預測客戶需求，並提供更多個人化的保險產品。」 關於亞馬遜網路服務 自2006年以來，亞馬遜網路服務一直是世界上全面性和採用廣泛度首屈一指的雲端平臺。AWS不斷地擴大其服務，現已支援幾乎所有的工作負載。目前，AWS通過31個地理區域內的99個可用區(Availability Zone)，為運算、儲存、數據庫、網路、分析、機器學習和人工智能(AI)、物聯網(IoT)、手機、安保、混合、虛擬和擴增實境、媒體和應用程式開發、部署和管理提供超過200項功能齊全的服務，並已宣佈計畫在加拿大、以色列、紐西蘭和泰國增加12個可用區和四個AWS區域。數以百萬計的客戶，包括增長最快的初創企業、規模最大的企業和主要的政府機構，都信賴AWS為他們的基礎設施提供助力，幫助他們提高敏捷性、降低成本。如需瞭解關於AWS的更多資訊，請造訪aws.amazon.com。 關於亞馬遜 亞馬遜遵循四項原則：專注於客戶而非競爭對手、熱衷創新、追求卓越營運和長遠思考。亞馬遜力求成為以客戶為中心的全球頂級企業、全球最佳雇主和全球最安全的工作場所。公司率先推出了用戶評論、一鍵購物、個人化推薦、Prime會員、亞馬遜物流、AWS（亞馬遜網路服務）、Kindle直接出版(Kindle Direct Publishing)、Kindle、職業選擇計畫(Career Choice)、Fire平板電腦、Fire TV、Amazon Echo、Alexa、Just Walk Out技術、Amazon Studios和《氣候宣言》等產品和服務。如需瞭解更多資訊，請造訪amazon.com/about並關注@AmazonNews。 免責聲明：本公告之原文版本乃官方授權版本。譯文僅供方便瞭解之用，煩請參照原文，原文版本乃唯一具法律效力之版本。",

In the short term, we face an uncertain economy, but we remain quite optimistic about the long-term opportunities for Amazon. The vast majority of total market segment share in both Global Retail and IT still reside in physical stores and on-premises datacenters; and as this equation steadily flips, we believe our leading customer experiences in these areas along with the results of our continued hard work and invention to improve every day, will lead to significant growth in the coming years. When you also factor in our investments and innovation in several other broad customer experiences (e.g. streaming entertainment, customer-first healthcare, broadband satellite connectivity for more communities globally), there’s additional reason to feel optimistic about what the future holds.” Highlights Obsessing over the customer experience Amazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, in the past quarter, Amazon: Had a record-breaking holiday season with customers purchasing nearly half a billion items from small businesses in the U.S. During Amazon’s biggest Thanksgiving-through-Cyber-Monday holiday shopping weekend ever, customers around the world purchased hundreds of millions of products, and small businesses in the U.S. generated more than $1 billion in sales over the five-day period. Made Same-Day Delivery even faster in major metropolitan areas in the U.S., such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, Sacramento, and Portland, Oregon, where customers can now receive hundreds of thousands of items within hours. Amazon’s new Same-Day Delivery site in Sacramento is set to be the world’s first logistics facility certified as Zero Carbon by the International Living Future Institute. In the EU, Same-Day Delivery is now available in Belgium. Attracted more than 100 million viewers worldwide to the first season of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, making it the most watched Amazon Original series in every region of the world, with more than 24 billion minutes streamed, and driving more Prime sign-ups worldwide during its launch window than any previous Prime Video content.

Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 2, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. First Quarter 2023 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $121.0 billion and $126.0 billion, or to grow between 4% and 8% compared with first quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 210 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $0 and $4.0 billion, compared with $3.7 billion in first quarter 2022. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks.
