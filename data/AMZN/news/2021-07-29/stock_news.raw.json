At the same time, AWS has helped so many businesses and governments maintain business continuity, and we’ve seen AWS growth reaccelerate as more companies bring forward plans to transform their businesses and move to the cloud,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “Thank you to all of our passionate, innovative, mission-driven employees around the world for continuing to stay focused on delivering for customers—I am very excited to work with you as we invent and build for the future.” Highlights Investing in Employee Safety and Providing Good Jobs Amazon announced a first-of-its-kind partnership with the National Safety Council, a 100-year-old nonprofit that protects workers on and off the job, to invent new ways of preventing musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), the most common workplace injury in the U.S. The five-year effort aims to reduce MSDs across a variety of industries by engaging key stakeholders, conducting new research, inventing technology and processes, and scaling the results. Amazon is investing over $300 million into safety projects in 2021, including redesigning and retrofitting workstations, re-engineering cross-dock operations and powered-industrial-truck barriers, and implementing new safety control systems. In the UK, Amazon announced that it is creating more than 10,000 new corporate and operations jobs and investing £10 million over three years to train up to 5,000 employees in new skills. Amazon surpassed its commitment to hire 25,000 U.S. veterans and military spouses by 2021 and set a new commitment to hire an additional 100,000 veterans and military spouses by 2024. Amazon launched the Amazon Returnship program, a new initiative to help 1,000 experienced corporate professionals outside of Amazon who have been out of work for an extended period of time return to the workforce, including people who stopped working due to COVID-19, caregiving responsibilities, or medical circumstances. Amazon offers participants a paid, 16-week work opportunity with an abbreviated interview process, dedicated support, and personalized coaching and mentoring—as well as the possibility to transition into a full-time job at Amazon. Amazon introduced a new mental health benefit for all of its 950,000 U.S. employees, their families, and household members, which provides free access to personalized support, including one-on-one counseling and 24/7 crisis support. For the fourth year in a row, Amazon was included on the Disability Equality Index’s Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion. Economic Impact and Small Business Empowerment For the second year in a row, Amazon placed No. 1 on the Progressive Policy Institute’s Investment Heroes list, which ranks U.S. companies’ investments in America. According to the study, Amazon invested more in the U.S. than any other company in 2020; was key to sustaining the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic; and helped drive economic expansion, wage growth, and job creation across the country. Amazon launched the Black Business Accelerator, committing $150 million over four years to help Black business owners and entrepreneurs succeed as third-party selling partners. The program aims to spur growth and advance equity for Black-owned businesses by providing financial support, education and mentorship, and marketing and promotional support. In the two-week lead-up to Prime Day, customers spent $1.9 billion on products from third-party sellers during the Spend $10, Get $10 promotion—more than double compared to the 2020 Prime Day small business promotion. Prime Day 2021 was the biggest two-day period ever for small and medium-sized businesses in Amazon’s stores worldwide. Amazon Advertising launched over 40 new features and self-service capabilities, making it easier for sellers, companies, and authors to grow their businesses by helping customers discover their brands and products. Recent launches include regional sponsored product campaign creation tools; access to educational, technical, and marketing resources via the Partner Network; and a simplified creative asset management solution. In addition, Amazon Advertising expanded the services it offers in Australia, Europe, India, Japan, and Saudi Arabia, creating more opportunities for local and global sellers and brands to grow their businesses in these regions.

Its latest commitment of $300 million will create 3,000 affordable housing units near public transit centers in the Puget Sound region of Washington state; Arlington, Virginia; and Nashville, Tennessee. Amazon India sprung into urgent action to help employees, partners, sellers, customers, and communities in recent months as the country faced an increase in COVID-19 cases. Amazon helped airlift over 14,000 life-saving medical items, including 100 intensive care unit ventilators as well as 10,000 oxygen and ventilation machines. As part of its efforts, Amazon worked with partners and nonprofits to deliver items to hospitals in the most urgent need, bearing the cost of airlifts and managing the urgent movement of medical equipment. In addition, Amazon India has vaccinated over 100,000 employees and their family members and has committed to vaccinate a total of 1 million employees, sellers, partners, and dependents. Amazon committed $16.5 million in relief efforts, including direct donations and medical equipment delivery.

The kits are processed by Amazon’s in-house laboratory, which has processed millions of tests from over 750,000 Amazon front-line employees. Amazon opened its first Disaster Relief Hub in an Atlanta fulfillment center to help relief organizations respond more quickly to natural disasters in the U.S., the Caribbean, and Central America. The hub will store over 500,000 Amazon-donated relief supplies so they can be rapidly deployed when needed.

Amazon celebrated Asian Pacific American Heritage Month in the U.S. by signing on as a founding partner of The Asian American Foundation, a new nonprofit dedicated to accelerating opportunity and prosperity for Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities. Amazon committed $10 million over five years as part of the AAPI Giving Pledge. Ring launched a community program with the nonprofit Strength Based Community Change to improve individual and family resiliency, and advance community safety. As part of the program, Ring donated 1,000 Ring Video Doorbells, free installation, and a Ring Protect subscription to eligible residents in Wilmington, California. Protecting the Planet Amazon announced 14 new renewable energy projects in Canada, Finland, Spain, and the U.S., making Amazon the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the U.S., Europe, and the world. The new projects bring Amazon’s total renewable energy investments to date to 10 gigawatts of electricity production capacity—enough to power 2.5 million U.S. homes. Amazon has reached 65% renewable energy across its business, up from 42% in 2019—putting the company on a path to power 100% of company activities with renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of its 2030 target. Amazon welcomed Interpublic Group, Iron Mountain, JLL, Klarna, Macquarie Asset Management, and RELX to The Climate Pledge, joining other Pledge signatories such as PepsiCo, Uber, Microsoft, Unilever, Visa, and Colgate-Palmolive. From deploying clean energy solutions such as wind and solar, to implementing vehicle electrification and supporting nature-based climate solutions, the 112 Climate Pledge signatories are working together to significantly reduce corporate carbon emissions. Amazon added five new certifications to its Climate Pledge Friendly program to help shoppers find more sustainable products across grocery, household, and beauty. Amazon customers can now shop for products that are Animal Welfare Approved, EWG Verified, and Regenerative Organic Certified, as well as for those certified by Higg Index Materials and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Safer Choice program. The Climate Pledge Fund invested in BETA Technologies to help accelerate the development of fully electric, zero-emission aircraft and in ION Energy, a technology platform that leverages intelligent battery analytics to significantly improve the life and performance of lithium-ion batteries. The Climate Pledge Fund also joined Greentown Labs, the largest climate tech startup incubator in North America, to further engage with startups and help accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. As part of its recent debt offering, Amazon issued a $1 billion sustainability bond to further investments in tackling critical social and environmental issues. The proceeds are being used to fund projects in five areas: renewable energy, clean transportation, sustainable buildings, affordable housing, and socioeconomic advancement and empowerment.

Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of July 29, 2021, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our estimates as of July 29, 2021 regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed above, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. This guidance also assumes the impacts on consumer demand and spending patterns, including impacts due to concerns over the current economic outlook, will be in line with those experienced during the third quarter of 2021 to date, and the additional assumptions set forth below. However, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on our operations for the third quarter of 2021, or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations. Third Quarter 2021 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $106.0 billion and $112.0 billion, or to grow between 10% and 16% compared with third quarter 2020. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 70 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $2.5 billion and $6.0 billion, compared with $6.2 billion in third quarter 2020. This guidance assumes approximately $1.0 billion of costs related to COVID-19. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results. These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE: BBY) announced a new lineup of Best Buy Insignia F50 Series Fire TVs. The TVs are the latest from the strategic collaboration between the two companies, which began three years ago. The new F50 series TVs feature enhanced screen resolution, premium audio functionality, and Alexa voice integration for an immersive entertainment experience. “Customers have purchased millions of Insignia and Toshiba – Fire TVs in the U.S. and Canada, and given them an average rating of 4.4 stars on Amazon.com,” said Daniel Rausch, Amazon Vice President, Entertainment Devices & Services. “Our collaboration with Best Buy has grown over the last three years, allowing us to deliver our content-first Fire TV experience and Alexa features to customers through a diverse line of high-quality smart TVs. Today, we’re thrilled to further expand the Fire TV line with a new generation of Insignia – Fire TVs including the F50 Series.” “From the start of this collaboration, our goal has always been to enrich the lives of our customers,” said Luke Motschenbacher, Category Officer at Best Buy. “We’re thrilled that our relationship with Amazon continues to give our customers even more choices to bring the latest in smart TV technology into their homes.” The Insignia F50 Series Fire TV uses quantum dot technology in 4K Ultra HD for vibrant, true-to-life images with rich subtle details. Delivering an immersive home theater experience, the TVs feature Dolby Vision HDR to contrast bright highlights with dark shadows to showcase subtle details, and DTS Virtual-X speaker technology to deliver three-dimensional sound. The displays have a narrow bezel for optimal video playback for living room entertainment. The Insignia F50 Series Fire TV will be available at Best Buy stores and online, as well as Amazon.com later this summer. Insignia – Fire TVs come with the latest Fire TV experience for content-first and customized entertainment with Alexa at the core. The included Voice Remote with Alexa allows customers to get all of the benefits of Alexa, plus the ability to launch apps, switch inputs, and control smart home devices, with simple voice commands. Press and hold the voice button and ask Alexa to search for favorite movies, TV shows, or directors; start a live TV program; discover new recipes; check stocks; and more. In addition to collaborating on Fire TVs, Best Buy and Amazon are working together to innovate on purchase options for customers. Best Buy and Amazon rolled out a new option for customers with their in-store pick up option. The latest purchase option for customers to order on Amazon.com and pick up in a Best Buy store launched in November 2020 with one Fire TV model. Today, this option is available for the full lineup of Toshiba and Insignia – Fire TVs at all Best Buy store locations in the U.S. With in-store pickup, customers can buy on Amazon.com and pick up at a local Best Buy store within the hour. With more than 80 models available in the U.S. and Canada, Toshiba and Insignia – Fire TVs remain a top favorite among customers. Providing choice to customers, Toshiba and Insignia – Fire TVs range from 24-inches to 75-inches, and are available in 2K, 4K, QLED resolution technologies. In June, Amazon.com customers purchased a record-setting number of Fire TVs including the Toshiba and Insignia – Fire TVs during Prime Day and the two week lead-up period.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) Amazon today announced plans to open a fulfillment center in Port St. Lucie, FL. The site, which is anticipated to launch in 2022, will create more than 500 new, full-time jobs that pay at least $15 per hour and provide comprehensive benefits starting day one on the job. “We’re excited to expand our network to better serve our customers in Port St. Lucie,” said Mark Marzano, Director of Operations at Amazon. “We are grateful for the strong support we’ve received from local and state leaders as we broaden our footprint throughout the Sunshine State. We look forward to bringing more than 500 good jobs to St. Lucie County and contributing positively to the community.” Employees at the more than one million-square-foot fulfillment center will pick, pack and ship large customer items, such as sports equipment, patio furniture, fishing rods, pet food, kayaks, bicycles, and larger household goods. Amazon may be a large global business, but it’s truly made up of small businesses and communities. From the local jobs the company brings, to the local people, Amazon employs, trains, and upskills. Amazon also plans to hire for roles in human resources, operations management, safety, security, finance and information technology to name a few. Amazon currently employs more than 52,000 full-time associates throughout the state of Florida and has fulfillment and sortation centers in Miami, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville. \"The city of Port St. Lucie is thrilled to be home to the latest Amazon fulfillment center. At more than 1 million square feet, the building will be the largest in Port St. Lucie,\" said Port St. Lucie Vice Mayor Shannon Martin. \"More importantly, Amazon will employ about 500 local people, offering full-time jobs with fantastic benefits from Day One. There is much to be celebrated today with the announcement of these jobs, along with the investment in Port St. Lucie by Amazon and developer Seefried Industrial Properties.\" “This latest, in a series of substantial corporate investments, shows the commitment of the county to stabilize our economy and ensure the employment options for all residents of our community,” said St. Lucie County Commission Chair Chris Dzadovsky. “It is also a testament of how the outside corporate world sees the benefit of local government cooperation that offers certainty and speed-to-market. Without the stability created through government agency cooperation, these investments would likely not come our way.” COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS On top of Amazon’s industry-leading $15 per hour starting wage, the company offers full-time employees comprehensive benefits including full medical, vision, and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent match starting on day one. Amazon prioritizes the safety and health of its employees and has invested millions of dollars to provide a safe workplace. The company also offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and parental paid leave and innovative benefits such as Leave Share and Ramp Back, which give new parents flexibility to support their growing families. Amazon leverages its scale to help support local communities. Amazon has also pledged to invest over $700 million to provide upskilling training for 100,000 U.S. employees for in-demand jobs. The programs will help Amazon team members from all backgrounds access training to move into highly skilled roles across the company’s corporate offices, tech hubs, fulfillment centers, retail stores, and transportation network, or pursue career paths outside of Amazon. AMAZON IN FLORIDA Since 2010, Amazon has created 52,000 jobs in Florida and invested more than $9.5 billion across the state, including infrastructure and compensation to its employees. Amazon’s investments have contributed more than $9 billion in GDP to the Florida economy and have helped create 29,000 indirect jobs on top of Amazon’s direct hires – from jobs in construction and logistics to professional services. More than 140,000 independent authors and small and medium businesses in Florida are selling to customers in Amazon’s store, creating thousands of additional jobs across the state.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) (NASDAQ: AMZN) and GoPro, Inc. (“GoPro”) (NASDAQ: GPRO) unsealed a jointly filed lawsuit against seven individuals and two entities (the “defendants”) for counterfeiting GoPro’s popular camera accessories, including the floating hand grip, “The Handler,” and the “3-Way” grip, extension arm, and tripod mount. The defendants attempted to offer the infringing products in Amazon’s store, violating Amazon’s policies, infringing on GoPro’s trademarks, and breaking the law. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington and alleges that the nine defendants used GoPro’s registered trademarks without authorization to deceive customers about the authenticity and origin of the products and create a false affiliation with GoPro. Amazon closed the defendants’ selling accounts and proactively refunded the impacted customers. \"When counterfeiters attempt to sell in our store, they not only violate the intellectual property rights of companies like GoPro, they also mislead consumers and harm Amazon's reputation as a place to buy authentic goods,” said Kebharu Smith, Director of Amazon’s Counterfeit Crimes Unit. Amazon strictly prohibits infringing and counterfeit products in its store, and in 2020, Amazon invested more than $700 million and employed more than 10,000 people to proactively protect its store from fraud, counterfeit, and abuse. Amazon uses industry-leading tools to verify potential sellers’ identities and ensure product listings are authentic, and Amazon’s proprietary systems analyze hundreds of unique data points to verify information provided by potential sellers. In 2020, only 6% of attempted new seller account registrations passed Amazon’s robust verification processes and listed products for sale. In addition, fewer than 0.01% of all products sold on Amazon received a counterfeit complaint from customers In June 2020, Amazon launched its Counterfeit Crimes Unit, a global team dedicated to pursuing counterfeiters and holding them accountable to the fullest extent of the law, including by working through the court system and in partnership with law enforcement. Amazon has filed a series of lawsuits against counterfeiters, including a suit against individuals using social media to promote and facilitate the sale of counterfeits, as well as joint lawsuits with apparel manufacturer HanesBrands, Italian luxury brands Valentino and Ferragamo, cosmetics brand KF Beauty, family travel accessory brand JL Childress, cooler manufacturer YETI, family-owned-and-operated card game company Dutch Blitz, and global board game publisher Asmodee. GoPro was founded in 2002 and its products are used extensively by active people wishing to capture and share themselves in immersive and exciting ways. GoPro makes the world’s most versatile cameras and mounts, subscription-based cloud services and sophisticated, yet simple-to-use content-management and mobile editing software. The Handler floating hand grip helps customers capture themselves and others in the water without the fear of losing a camera to the depths. The 3-Way mount features a three-in-one design enabling use as a camera grip, extension arm, or tripod, providing the ultimate in versatility.

    "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/amazon-continues-right-now-needs-fund-with-additional-1-20210810.jpg",

    "text": "ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced it will continue its commitment to the Right Now Needs Fund in Northern Virginia for the upcoming academic year with an additional $1 million investment to support students attending Arlington Public Schools, Alexandria City Public Schools, and Fairfax County Public Schools. The Fund, in partnership with Communities In Schools NOVA, helps remove barriers to learning and works to meet the basic needs of thousands of schoolchildren from underserved communities. Launched in October 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Amazon Right Now Needs Fund in Northern Virginia was initially made available to students across all 41 Arlington Public Schools and Programs and all 18 Alexandria City Public Schools. In its first year, the Fund provided 8,500 students with immediate access to essential items. This year, the Fund will continue to provide support for immediate needs like clothing, hygiene products, and school supplies to students in the region. Site coordinators with the nonprofit Communities In Schools NOVA will work with school social workers to distribute Amazon-provided supplies tailored to specific community needs. School social workers and site coordinators will also help support individual school students who could access the Fund for much-needed items throughout the year, from books to winter coats. Support is provided through prepaid Amazon Vouchers, or Amazon Education Assistance Product Vouchers, which students can redeem online at their convenience. The Fund will also be leveraged to provide educational community programs and events, including tech literacy workshops, college advisement, and career panels. “Amazon is committed to ensuring children and families from historically underrepresented and underserved communities are supported, which is why we are renewing our Right Now Needs Fund in Northern Virginia,” said Andrea Muscadin, head of Partnerships, Right Now Needs at Amazon. \"While we have already been able to support thousands of families in the Northern Virginia area, we recognize many families are facing unique challenges as students prepare to return to school in-person. We are pleased to continue our support in the region.” To begin the yearlong $1 million investment for the 2021-22 school year, Amazon will donate new backpacks filled with thousands of essential school supplies to qualifying elementary and middle schools in Northern Virginia. Amazon is working in partnership with Communities In Schools NOVA to fulfill students’ basic needs as they prepare to return to the classroom. \"Communities In Schools NOVA is thrilled that Amazon is continuing to support our local students as they head back to school this year,” said Patrick Brennan, executive director of Communities In Schools NOVA. “These backpacks will help many students, some returning to school in-person for the first time since the pandemic began, start the year with supplies to help set them up for success.” Amazon employees will fill and deliver the backpacks to elementary and middle schools across the three districts before the school year begins. \"We know a strong foundation in education is essential to a child’s success and are proud to partner with Communities In Schools NOVA,” said Brian Huseman, Amazon’s Vice President of Public Policy. “However, Amazon's contributions are just a small piece of the puzzle. The U.S. needs a comprehensive effort aimed at expanding access to resources and opportunities for students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities. In addition to partnering with organizations like Communities in Schools NOVA, we are also actively supporting policies at the federal and state level to address education as a top priority when it comes to the success of students and their families.\" Amazon has invested in several programs in the Washington, D.C., metro region since announcing its selection of Arlington, Virginia, as the site of its second headquarters. Amazon donated $3.9 million to CodeVA to help the nonprofit expand computer science education to schools in underserved communities. The company also distributed $1 million and thousands of devices to help provide basic necessities to students experiencing barriers to learning within Arlington Public Schools and Alexandria City Public Schools. Amazon has also donated $1 million to launch emergency COVID-19 response efforts; paid local restaurants to prepare and deliver 10,000 lunches and dinners for first responders, front-line healthcare workers, and vulnerable neighbors at the height of COVID-19; funded delivery services to provide more than 50,000 meals—60,000 pounds of food—directly to the doorsteps of local seniors and those disproportionately impacted by COVID-19; donated $3 million to four legal service providers to support families with housing-related issues; invested in affordable housing through the Housing Equity Fund; and funded many more highly local donations.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced the beginning of Amazon Air Hub operations at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG). After more than four years of planning and construction, the Amazon Air Hub will serve as the central hub for Amazon Air’s U.S. cargo network, facilitating the rapid transport of customer packages across the country. This $1.5 billion investment in Northern Kentucky will eventually create thousands of jobs for people from various backgrounds, including load planning, management of package sortation, and robotics technology. All regular, full-time employees will have access to Amazon’s industry-leading wages of up to $19.50 per hour; comprehensive benefits including medical, vision, and dental; and a 401(k) beginning on day one. “Wonderful communities and diverse teams like this are the heart and soul of our operations,” said Vice President of Amazon Global Air Sarah Rhoads. “We’re excited to get rolling in Northern Kentucky, and we’re thrilled to employ thousands of fantastic people from the area in this next-generation, highly sophisticated facility that will connect our air cargo network for years to come.” The 800,000-square-foot sortation building sits on an over 600-acre campus that features seven buildings, an expansive new ramp for aircraft parking, and a multi-story vehicle parking structure. The sortation facility is equipped with the innovative use of robotics technology that helps move and sort packages—including robotic arms and mobile drive units that transport packages across the building—miles of interlinked conveyors, and ergonomic workstations that support a comfortable work environment for employees. The building will also feature a solar rooftop scheduled for installation over the next year, and all energy generated from the panels will feed directly into the electrical grid of the local community. “The Amazon Air Hub at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport will make Kentucky the undisputed national leader in air cargo,” said Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. “In addition to creating thousands of direct and indirect jobs, this hub puts Kentucky at the center of Amazon’s U.S. distribution network. Across the coming years, Amazon Air will help attract more manufacturers, service providers, and tech companies to Kentucky seeking to take similar advantage of our key geographic location. Congratulations and thanks to Amazon for this monumental investment in our state and workforce. We look forward to continuing the commonwealth’s longstanding and successful partnership with Amazon for decades to come.” “CVG is proud to be home to Amazon Air’s primary U.S. air cargo hub,” said Chief Executive Officer of Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport Candace McGraw. “We’ve worked hard to ensure our airport is a great place to do business, and we couldn’t be more pleased to partner with Amazon on the transformational impact this hub is having and will continue to have on our local economy well into the future, from job creation to innovation and increased connection to the country.” Amazon Air continues to expand globally to meet the needs of its growing customer base while investing in jobs and sustainable solutions to power its network. Amazon Air has expanded its presence in the U.S. to more than 40 locations and launched its European air hub in 2020 at Germany’s Leipzig/Halle Airport. Amazon Air has also purchased six million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel and invested in leading-edge electric ground service equipment. Amazon has invested in the region for many years; the most recent investment is a state-of-the-art diagnostics laboratory in Hebron, Kentucky, that processed millions of COVID-19 tests for front-line employees and recently expanded testing capability to support customers. Amazon has created more than 18,000 jobs in Kentucky since 2010 and invested more than $20 billion across the state, both in infrastructure and compensation for local employees. These investments have contributed an additional $18 billion to the Kentucky economy and have helped create over 49,000 indirect jobs on top of Amazon’s direct hires—from jobs in construction and logistics to professional services. Amazon also announced in July a commitment to hire over 100,000 U.S. veterans and military spouses by 2024, and has pledged to invest over $700 million to provide upskilling training for 100,000 U.S. employees for in-demand jobs across the company’s corporate offices, tech hubs, fulfillment centers, retail stores, and transportation network, or even to pursue career paths in high-demand fields outside of Amazon.

As Amazon continues to invest, the company has created more than 52,000 full-time jobs throughout the state according to findings from its 2021 U.S. Economic Impact Report. The report also notes Amazon’s more than $18 billion investment in the state and $530 billion in the U.S., since 2010 over the last decade, demonstrating the company’s commitment to creating quality jobs and generating economic opportunity.

Employees at the fulfillment center will pick, pack and ship small items, such as books, electronics and toys, to customers. The five new delivery stations will power the last mile of Amazon’s order process and help increase efficiency of deliveries for customers. Delivery stations also offer entrepreneurs the opportunity to build their own business delivering Amazon packages. In addition, independent contractors gain the flexibility to be their own boss and create their own schedule delivering for Amazon Flex. Amazon expects the six new sites to open in 2022 at the following locations: Fulfillment Center – 6720 Mahan Drive, Tallahassee, FL 32308 Delivery Station – 3998 Sarno Road, Melbourne, FL 32934 Delivery Station – 1301 President Barack Obama Highway, Riviera Beach, FL 33404 Delivery Station – 4000 NW 126th Avenue, Coral Springs, FL 33076 Delivery Station – 16300 Lee Road, Fort Myers, FL 33967 Delivery Station – 6101 45th Street N, St. Petersburg, FL 33714 (City of Pinellas Park) This announcement comes one week after the company announced a new fulfillment center in Port St. Lucie, Florida, which is set to create 500 full-time jobs.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced a global collaboration with Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (NYSE: WH), the world’s largest hotel franchising company, to upgrade its technology infrastructure and develop and deliver new guest services across its 21 hotel brands—including Days Inn, La Quinta, Microtel, Ramada, Super 8, and Wyndham. Moving to AWS enables Wyndham to enhance business performance, reinvest approximately 45% of reduced data center operating costs, and shut down additional physical datacenters, putting it on track to achieve its goal of running 90% of its infrastructure in the cloud. The announcement is part of Wyndham’s multiyear digital transformation and investment in technology that automates hotel reservations, supports its franchisees by helping simplify operations, and enhances the guest experience across Wyndham properties globally. Wyndham began working with AWS in 2018 when it was spun off from Wyndham Worldwide and needed to quickly stand up its own IT infrastructure. The hotel company migrated its core reservation system, property management system, and data processing platform to AWS to more easily launch new services for franchisees and guests while also improving operational efficiency. Expanding its presence in the cloud will enable Wyndham to focus on growing its core hotel franchise business—seamlessly integrating new properties into its network—while leveraging AWS’s proven global infrastructure to help meet demand where it arises post-pandemic during the peak summer travel season. For example, Wyndham will use AWS machine learning to help optimize over 90,000 daily rate changes across its approximately 9,000 hotels to help maximize occupancy rates that vary according to factors such as location, weather, and time of year. This will benefit Wyndham franchisees by helping them identify and offer the best rates, discounts, and stay rules appropriate for the geographic market, brand, and specific hotel. In addition, Wyndham will use AWS to develop new digital services for guests to automate check-in and leverage AWS partners to deliver customized offers during hotel stays, such as recommendations on local attractions, restaurants, and entertainment. During COVID-19, Wyndham leveraged AWS technologies to provide flexibility for franchisees and guests, helping them navigate evolving safety protocols. For example, Wyndham was able to launch a housekeeping application in just a few weeks’ time to provide hotels with an updated checklist of protocols for cleaning staff. The app also gives franchisees the ability to run “last-rented” room reports to accommodate new guest requests to stay in rooms that have been vacant for more than 24 hours. Looking ahead, Wyndham will use AWS to remain agile and adapt to rapidly changing guest and market needs with plans to use AWS machine learning to drive demand with greater personalization and more timely and relevant guest offers. “We are excited to expand our strategic relationship with AWS, the world’s leading and most comprehensive cloud provider, to create one-of-a-kind experiences for our guests and increase our operational efficiency on a global scale,” said Scott Strickland, Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. “By moving the majority of our workloads to the cloud, Wyndham was able to rapidly respond to the changing business conditions brought on by COVID-19, and now we’re positioned to scale our operations as different parts of the world begin to reopen. The agility we have gained in moving to the cloud, thanks to AWS’s vast portfolio of cloud technologies, helps us expand our digital guest services and introduce new solutions and functionality for our franchisees in a matter of days rather than months.” “The hotel industry has faced a series of rapid changes recently, yet by running on AWS Wyndham gains the insights and agility it needs to support its franchisees, transform its customer engagement, service, and business models, and remain an industry leader,” said Greg Pearson, Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Sales at Amazon Web Services, Inc. “Leveraging AWS’s proven operating experience, global infrastructure, and unparalleled portfolio of cloud capabilities, Wyndham has the ability to scale its operations to every corner of the globe and drive innovations across its digital channels. This collaboration is helping Wyndham to become an even more resilient organization that can meet customers’ ever-changing needs and build for what’s next.” About Amazon Web Services For over 15 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud offering.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is on pace to spend over $120 billion on supplies and services from businesses in the U.S. in 2021. The purchases are from more than 200,000 companies that operate in communities across the country that help keep Amazon running—from electric vehicle manufacturers to cardboard box producers to construction and engineering firms. The 2021 spending represents an increase of 20% year over year and does not include any of the products Amazon buys and sells to customers in its stores. “Millions of families rely on us to deliver what they need every day,” said Dave Clark, CEO of Worldwide Consumer at Amazon. “Delivering for our customers takes teamwork—we can’t do it alone. We rely on strong partnerships with hundreds of thousands of American businesses—from our forklift manufacturer in Kentucky to the construction company in Texas that builds our delivery stations. Today is about renewing our commitment to these businesses and betting big on them.” The spending is also having a ripple effect. An independent analysis from Keystone Economics estimates that Amazon’s expected 2021 spending in suppliers will help local economies and support an additional 840,000 American jobs in multiple industries, including construction, transportation, manufacturing, and hospitality. “In a time defined by uncertainty, having Amazon as a customer is a lifeline for many small and medium-sized businesses across the country. It’s not just a big vote of confidence, it’s also a source of income that can keep them thriving,” said Tom Sullivan, Vice President of Small Business Policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “Companies like Amazon are helping pave the way to a broad-based economic recovery.” “Partnering with Amazon has changed everything for us,” said Jerry Wade, Regional Sales Manager at CTM Labeling Systems, a labeling applications and machinery company in Salem, Ohio. “They called us a few years ago and wanted to use our labeling machines in their fulfillment centers. Since then, we have nearly doubled the size of our facility, invested in more high-tech manufacturing equipment to meet the growing demand, and hired more people to build them.” Amazon is now the largest job creator in the U.S. In 2020 alone, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company hired over 400,000 employees. On top of the company’s 950,000 U.S. employees, there are more than 2 million businesses, content creators, developers, and delivery providers in the U.S. using Amazon products and services to start or grow their careers. Small and medium-sized businesses selling their products on Amazon.com have created more than 1.1 million jobs. In addition, more than 700,000 developers are building skills for Alexa, more than 95,000 drivers are employed by last mile and middle-mile delivery partners, and hundreds of thousands of authors from around the world are self-publishing millions of books through Kindle Direct Publishing.
