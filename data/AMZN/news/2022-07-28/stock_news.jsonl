Diese Gruppen wurden mit dem Ziel eingerichtet, Personen zu rekrutieren, die bereit sind, gekaufte und irreführende Rezensionen in Amazons Stores in den USA, im Vereinigten Königreich, Deutschland, Frankreich, Italien, Spanien und Japan zu veröffentlichen. Amazon wird die im Rahmen dieser Klage erlangten Informationen nutzen, um Akteure mit schlechten Absichten zu identifizieren und die von ihnen in Auftrag gegebenen gefälschten Bewertungen zu entfernen, sofern diese nicht bereits von Amazons fortschrittlicher Technologie, den erfahrenen Prüfteams und im Rahmen der kontinuierlichen Untersuchungen entdeckt wurden. “Unsere Teams stoppen Millionen verdächtiger Bewertungen, bevor sie jemals von Kund:innen gesehen werden. Und diese Klage geht noch einen Schritt weiter, um Täter in den sozialen Medien zu enttarnen“, sagte Dharmesh Mehta, Amazons Vice President Selling Partner Services. „Proaktives rechtliches Vorgehen ist eine von vielen unserer Maßnahmen, um Kund:innen zu schützen und Akteure mit schlechten Absichten zur Verantwortung zu ziehen.“ Die für solche Gruppen verantwortlichen Drahtzieher werben um gefälschte Bewertungen für Hunderte von Produkten, die bei Amazon zum Verkauf stehen. Darunter etwa Autoradios und Kamerastative. Eine der Gruppen, die in der Klage genannt werden, ist „Amazon Product Review“, die über 43.000 Mitglieder hatte, bis Meta die Gruppe Anfang des Jahres löschte. Die Untersuchungen von Amazon haben ergeben, dass die Gruppenadministratoren versuchten, ihre Aktivitäten zu verbergen und der Erkennung durch Facebook zu entgehen, indem sie zum Teil Buchstaben aus problematischen Sätzen verschleiern. Amazon verbietet gefälschte Rezensionen strikt und beschäftigt mehr als 12.000 Mitarbeiter:innen auf der ganzen Welt, die sich dem Schutz der Stores vor Betrug und Missbrauch widmen – einschließlich gefälschter Rezensionen. Ein spezialisiertes Team untersucht Machenschaften in Bezug auf gefälschte Rezensionen bei Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter und anderen Social Media-Seiten und meldet die missbräuchlichen Gruppen regelmäßig an diese Unternehmen. Seit 2020 hat Amazon mehr als 10.000 Gruppen für gefälschte Bewertungen an Meta gemeldet. Mehr als die Hälfte von diesen hat Meta wegen Verstößen gegen die Richtlinien entfernt, andere werden weiter untersucht. Amazon war ein Pionier in Sachen Produktrezensionen und führte sie 1995 ein, um den Kund:innen zu helfen, fundiertere Kaufentscheidungen zu treffen. Das Unternehmen möchte sicherstellen, dass jede Bewertung, die in den Stores erscheint, vertrauenswürdig ist und eine tatsächliche Erfahrung von Kund:innen widerspiegelt. Amazons Expert:innen verwenden branchenführende Tools, um gefälschte Rezensionen zu erkennen und zu blockieren. So konnte Amazon allein im Jahr 2020 mehr als 200 Millionen mutmaßlich gefälschte Rezensionen proaktiv stoppen. Die heutigen rechtlichen Schritte sind die jüngsten Bemühungen von Amazon, betrügerische Versuche zu stoppen, gefälschte Bewertungen in Amazons Stores zu veröffentlichen. Im vergangenen Jahr hat Amazon das Geschäft mehrerer großer Anbieter gefälschter Rezensionen durch rechtliche Schritte unterbunden – sie hatten es auf Kund:innen in den USA, im Vereinigten Königreich, Deutschland, Frankreich, Italien und Spanien abgesehen. Das dreiste Geschäft mit der Vermittlung gefälschter Rezensionen ist jedoch nach wie vor ein branchenweites Problem und Zivilklagen sind nur ein Schritt von vielen. Um gefälschte Bewertungen im Einzelhandel, in der Reisebranche und in anderen Industriezweigen dauerhaft aus der Welt zu schaffen, bedarf es einer intensiveren Partnerschaft von privatem und öffentlichem Sektor, einschließlich der Zusammenarbeit betroffener Unternehmen, Social-Media-Seiten und Strafverfolgungsbehörden, die alle das Ziel eint, Verbraucher:innen besser zu schützen. Amazon bleibt weiterhin darauf erpicht, mit allen relevanten Interessengruppen zusammenzuarbeiten, um dieses gemeinsame Ziel zu erreichen. Über Amazon Amazon wird von vier Grundprinzipien geleitet: Fokus auf Kund:innen statt auf den Wettbewerb, Leidenschaft fürs Erfinden, Verpflichtung zu operativer Exzellenz und langfristiges Denken. Amazon strebt danach, das kundenorientierteste Unternehmen, der beste Arbeitgeber und der sicherste Arbeitsplatz der Welt zu sein. Kundenrezensionen, 1-Click-Shopping, personalisierte Empfehlungen, Prime, Versand durch Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire Tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, Alexa, Just-Walk-Out-Technologie, Amazon Studios und The Climate Pledge sind nur einige Beispiele, für die Amazon Pionierarbeit geleistet hat.

Ces groupes sont créés pour recruter des personnes prêtes à publier des avis monnayés et trompeurs sur les boutiques d’Amazon aux États-Unis, au Royaume-Uni, en Allemagne, en France, en Italie, en Espagne et au Japon. Amazon exploitera les informations récoltées dans le cadre de cette action en justice pour identifier les acteurs malveillants et supprimer les faux avis commandités par ces acteurs qui n’auraient pas déjà été détectés par les technologies de pointe, les enquêteurs experts et la surveillance continue d’Amazon. « Nos équipes bloquent plusieurs millions d’avis douteux avant même qu’ils ne soient vus par les clients et cette action en justice est une étape supplémentaire pour démasquer les auteurs de ces méfaits sur les réseaux sociaux », déclare Dharmesh Mehta, Vice-président des Selling Partner Services d’Amazon. « Engager une action en justice contre des acteurs malveillants pour qu’ils répondent de leurs actes est l’un des nombreux moyens que nous mettons en œuvre pour protéger nos clients. » Les administrateurs à la tête de tels groupes sollicitent de faux avis concernant plusieurs centaines d’articles en vente sur Amazon, dont des autoradios et des trépieds photo. L’un des groupes visés par cette action est dénommé « Amazon Product Review » et comptait plus de 43 000 membres avant d’être fermé en début d’année par Meta. Les enquêtes menées par Amazon ont révélé que les administrateurs du groupe tentaient de dissimuler leur activité et de contourner les systèmes de détection de Facebook, notamment en masquant certaines lettres d’expressions problématiques. Amazon interdit formellement les faux avis et mobilise plus de 12 000 collaborateurs dans le monde pour protéger ses boutiques de la fraude et des abus, y compris des faux avis. Une équipe dédiée enquête sur les systèmes de faux avis sur les réseaux sociaux, notamment Facebook, Instagram, TikTok et Twitter, et signale régulièrement les groupes en infraction à ces entreprises. Depuis 2020, Amazon a signalé plus de 10 000 groupes de faux avis à Meta. Plus de la moitié de ces groupes ont depuis été fermés pour infraction aux conditions générales par Meta, qui continue d’examiner les autres groupes signalés. Amazon a été pionnière des avis sur les produits, en les introduisant en 1995 pour aider les clients à prendre des décisions d’achat plus éclairées. L’entreprise vise à ce que chaque avis publié dans ses boutiques soit fiable et le reflet de l’expérience réelle d’un client. Les enquêteurs experts d’Amazon s’appuient sur des outils de pointe pour repérer et bloquer les faux avis. Ainsi, Amazon a empêché la publication de plus de 200 millions d’avis soupçonnés d’être de faux avis, sur la seule année 2020. L’action en justice engagée ce jour est l’initiative la plus récente prise par Amazon pour mettre un terme aux agissements de ces courtiers qui tentent de publier de faux avis dans les boutiques Amazon. Au cours de l’année écoulée, les actions en justice engagées par Amazon ont permis de faire cesser l’activité d’importants courtiers de faux avis visant des clients aux États-Unis, au Royaume-Uni, en Allemagne, en France, en Italie et en Espagne. Cependant, l’activité malfaisante des courtiers de faux avis demeure un véritable problème pour l’ensemble du secteur et le fait d’engager une procédure en justice au civil n’est qu’une étape de ce combat. Débarrasser définitivement l’e-commerce, le tourisme et d’autres secteurs des faux avis nécessitera davantage de partenariats public-privé, et notamment des collaborations entre les entreprises touchées, les réseaux sociaux et les autorités compétentes, au service d’un même objectif : la protection des consommateurs. Amazon reste disposée à continuer de collaborer avec d’autres parties prenantes pour atteindre cet objectif commun. À propos d’Amazon Amazon est guidée par quatre principes : l’obsession client plutôt que l’attention portée à la concurrence, la passion pour l’invention, l’engagement en faveur de l’excellence opérationnelle et la réflexion à long terme. Amazon s’efforce d’être l’entreprise la plus centrée sur le client, le meilleur employeur et l’endroit le plus sûr où travailler dans le monde.

These groups are set up to recruit individuals willing to post incentivized and misleading reviews on Amazon’s stores in the U.S., the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Japan. Amazon will use information discovered in this legal action to identify bad actors and remove fake reviews commissioned by these fraudsters that haven’t already been detected by Amazon’s advanced technology, expert investigators, and continuous monitoring. “Our teams stop millions of suspicious reviews before they’re ever seen by customers, and this lawsuit goes a step further to uncover perpetrators operating on social media,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon’s vice president of Selling Partner Services. “Proactive legal action targeting bad actors is one of many ways we protect customers by holding bad actors accountable.” The fraudsters behind such groups solicit fake reviews for hundreds of products available for sale on Amazon, including car stereos and camera tripods. One of the groups identified in the lawsuit is “Amazon Product Review,” which had more than 43,000 members until Meta took down the group earlier this year. Amazon’s investigations revealed that the group’s administrators attempted to hide their activity and evade Facebook’s detection, in part by obfuscating letters from problematic phrases. Amazon strictly prohibits fake reviews and has more than 12,000 employees around the world dedicated to protecting its stores from fraud and abuse, including fake reviews. A dedicated team investigates fake review schemes on social media sites, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter, and regularly reports the abusive groups to those companies. Since 2020, Amazon has reported more than 10,000 fake review groups to Meta. Of these, Meta has taken down more than half of the groups for policy violations and continues to investigate others. Amazon was a pioneer of product reviews, having introduced them in 1995 to help customers make more informed shopping decisions. The company aims to ensure every review that appears in its stores is trustworthy and reflects an actual customer experience. Amazon’s expert investigators use industry-leading tools to detect and block fake reviews. As a result, Amazon proactively stopped more than 200 million suspected fake reviews in 2020 alone. Today’s legal action is the latest step by Amazon aimed at stopping fraudsters who attempt to post fake reviews in Amazon’s stores. In the past year, legal action from Amazon has shut down multiple major review brokers targeting customers in the U.S., the UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. However, the nefarious business of brokering fake reviews remains an industry-wide problem, and civil litigation is only one step. Permanently ridding fake reviews across retail, travel, and other sectors will require greater public-private partnership, including collaboration between the affected companies, social media sites, and law enforcement, all focused on a goal of greater consumer protection. Amazon remains eager to continue to partner with all the relevant stakeholders to achieve that mutual goal. About Amazon Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth’s Best Employer, and Earth’s Safest Place to Work.

Se trata de grupos creados con la finalidad de reclutar personas dispuestas a publicar reseñas incentivadas o engañosas en las webs de Amazon en Estados Unidos, el Reino Unido, Alemania, Francia, Italia, España y Japón. Amazon utilizará la información recabada en el curso de esta acción legal para identificar a posibles infractores y para eliminar aquellas reseñas falsas que hayan sido encargadas por estos presuntos estafadores y que no hubiesen sido detectadas por la avanzada tecnología de la que dispone la compañía o por los investigadores que monitorizan, de manera permanente, sus tiendas. “Nuestros equipos bloquean millones de reseñas de producto sospechosas antes de que lleguen a ser vistas por nuestros clientes. Con esta demanda, vamos un paso más allá para descubrir a los infractores que operan a través de las redes sociales”, declaró Darmesh Metha, Vicepresidente de Servicios a los Colaboradores Comerciales de Amazon. “Las acciones legales proactivas contra estos infractores es una de las múltiples vías que tenemos de proteger a nuestros clientes y de hacer que dichos infractores respondan por sus actos”. Los infractores detrás de estos grupos gestionaban reseñas falsas de cientos de productos disponibles en Amazon, incluyendo equipos de sonido para el automóvil o trípodes de cámaras de fotos. Uno de los grupos identificados es “Amazon Product Review”, que contaba con más de 43 000 miembros hasta que, a petición de Amazon, fue eliminado por Meta a principios de este año. Las investigaciones llevadas a cabo por Amazon, revelaron que los administradores del grupo intentaban camuflar su actividad y eludir los controles de Facebook cambiando los caracteres de términos sospechosos como ““R**fund Aftr R**vew.” (término que podría traducirse como “R**mbolso Tr4s R**ña”). Amazon prohíbe de manera explícita las reseñas falsas y cuenta con más de 12 000 empleados en todo el mundo dedicados a proteger su web de fraudes y comportamientos abusivos, entre los que se cuenta la publicación de reseñas engañosas. Además, cuenta con un equipo especialmente dedicado a investigar grupos de compraventa de reseñas en páginas de redes sociales incluyendo Facebook, Instagram, TikTok y Twitter e informa de manera regular de la actividad de dichos grupos a estas compañías. Desde 2020, Amazon ha informado a Meta sobre la actividad de más de 10 000 grupos dedicados a la compraventa de reseñas falsas. Meta ha cerrado más de la mitad de ellos por violación de sus términos y condiciones de uso y mantiene abiertas investigaciones sobre el resto. Amazon fue pionera en incorporar las reseñas de producto en 1995 a su web con la finalidad de que los clientes pudiesen tomar decisiones de compra más informadas. La compañía tiene como objetivo garantizar que cada una de las reseñas que aparecen en su tienda es fiable y refleja la experiencia real del cliente. Los investigadores y expertos de Amazon utilizan sofisticadas herramientas, líderes en el sector, para detectar e impedir la publicación de reseñas falsas. Como resultado de estas acciones, sólo en 2020, Amazon bloqueó, de manera proactiva, más de 200 millones de reseñas sospechosas de ser falsas. Esta acción legal es la última medida adoptada por Amazon para lograr su objetivo de detener a los infractores que intentan publicar reseñas falsas en su tienda. A lo largo del pasado año, las acciones legales de Amazon han servido para cerrar múltiples páginas de compra-venta de reseñas que tenían como objetivo clientes en Estados Unidos, el Reino Unido, Alemania, Francia, Italia y España. No obstante, el detestable negocio de la compra-venta de reseñas falsas sigue siendo un problema para toda la industria y los litigios civiles son sólo una vía para luchar contra él. Acabar, de manera permanente, con las reseñas falsas en el sector de la distribución minorista, el turismo y otros sectores requiere de una mayor colaboración público-privada entre las compañías afectadas, las empresas de redes sociales y las fuerzas del orden, de manera que se garantice una mayor protección de los consumidores. Amazon sigue abierta a colaborar con todas las partes implicadas para lograr este objetivo común. Sobre Amazon Amazon se guía por cuatro principios: enfoque en el consumidor por encima de la competencia, pasión por la invención, compromiso con la excelencia operativa y visión a largo plazo.

{"symbol": "AMZN", "publishedDate": "2022-07-19 00:00:00", "publisher": "Business Wire", "title": "Amazon contro i truffatori di recensioni false sui social media", "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/amazon-contro-i-truffatori-di-recensioni-false-sui-social-20220719.jpg", "site": "businesswire.com", "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) ha avviato oggi un'azione legale contro gli amministratori di oltre 10.000 gruppi Facebook che tentano di orchestrare false recensioni su Amazon in cambio di denaro o prodotti gratuiti. Questi gruppi sono stati creati per reclutare persone disposte a pubblicare, dietro ricompensa, recensioni fuorvianti sugli store di Amazon negli Stati Uniti, nel Regno Unito, in Germania, Francia, Italia, Spagna e Giappone. Amazon utilizzerà le informazioni emerse da questa azione legale per identificare i malintenzionati e rimuovere le recensioni false commissionate da questi truffatori e non ancora rilevate dalla tecnologia avanzata di Amazon, dai suoi investigatori esperti e dal monitoraggio continuo. “I nostri team bloccano milioni di recensioni sospette prima che vengano viste dai clienti e questa azione legale rappresenta un ulteriore passo avanti per smascherare i colpevoli che operano sui social media”, ha dichiarato Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon’s vice president of Selling Partner Services. “L'azione legale proattiva contro i malintenzionati è uno dei tanti modi in cui proteggiamo i clienti, individuando questi soggetti come responsabili di attività illecite”. I truffatori che si celano dietro questi gruppi chiedono recensioni false per centinaia di prodotti in vendita su Amazon, come ad esempio autoradio e treppiedi per macchine fotografiche. Uno dei gruppi identificati nella causa è “Amazon Product Review”, che contava oltre 43.000 membri fino a quando, su richiesta di Amazon, all'inizio di quest'anno Meta ha eliminato il gruppo. Le indagini di Amazon hanno rivelato che gli amministratori dei gruppi tentavano di nascondere la loro attività e di eludere il rilevamento di Facebook, in parte offuscando le lettere nelle frasi problematiche. Amazon vieta rigorosamente le recensioni false e impiega più di 12.000 persone dedicate in tutto il mondo alla protezione dei clienti, dei marchi, dei partner di vendita e dello store da contraffazioni, frodi e altre forme di abuso, comprese le recensioni false. Un team dedicato indaga sugli schemi di recensioni false sui social media, tra cui Facebook, Instagram, TikTok e Twitter, e segnala regolarmente a queste società i gruppi abusivi. Dal 2020, Amazon ha segnalato a Meta più di 10.000 gruppi di recensioni false. Di questi, Meta ha eliminato più della metà dei gruppi per violazioni della policy e continua a indagare su altri. Amazon è stata pioniera nel campo delle recensioni dei prodotti, introdotte nel 1995 per aiutare i clienti a prendere decisioni di acquisto più informate. L'azienda mira a garantire che ogni recensione che appare nei suoi store sia affidabile e rifletta un'esperienza reale del cliente. Gli investigatori qualificati di Amazon utilizzano strumenti leader nel settore per individuare e bloccare le recensioni false. Pertanto, Amazon ha proattivamente bloccato oltre 200 milioni di sospette recensioni false nel solo 2020. L'azione legale intrapresa oggi è il passo più recente compiuto da Amazon per fermare i truffatori che tentano di pubblicare recensioni false negli store Amazon. Nell'ultimo anno, l'azione legale di Amazon ha fatto chiudere diversi importanti “broker di recensioni” che hanno preso di mira i clienti di Stati Uniti, Regno Unito, Germania, Francia, Italia e Spagna. Tuttavia, la dannosa attività di “brokeraggio di recensioni false” rimane un problema di tutto il settore e il contenzioso civile è solo un passo. Per eliminare definitivamente le recensioni false nei settori della vendita al dettaglio, dei viaggi e in altri settori sarà necessaria una maggiore collaborazione tra pubblico e privato, tra cui le aziende interessate, i siti di social media e le forze dell'ordine, tutti impegnati verso l'obiettivo di una maggiore tutela dei consumatori. Amazon è pronta a continuare a collaborare con tutte le parti interessate per raggiungere questo fine comune. Amazon Amazon è guidata da quattro principi: ossessione per il cliente piuttosto che attenzione verso la concorrenza, passione per l’innovazione, impegno per l’eccellenza operativa e visione a lungo termine. Amazon punta ad essere l’azienda più attenta al cliente al mondo, il miglior datore di lavoro al mondo e il luogo di lavoro più sicuro al mondo. Le recensioni dei clienti, lo shopping 1-Click, le raccomandazioni personalizzate, Prime, Logistica di Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Career Choice, i tablet Fire, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, Alexa, la tecnologia Just Walk Out, Amazon Studios e il Climate Pledge sono alcune delle innovazioni introdotte da Amazon.

Included in this year’s cohort are 10 first-time grant recipient organizations. For the fourth time, the Amazon Literary Partnership has also awarded grants of $140,000 each to the Academy of American Poets and to the Community of Literary Magazines and Presses (CLMP), to be used to fund dozens of literary organizations supporting poetry groups and literary magazines. The Academy of American Poets and CLMP will announce the recipients of the Poetry Fund and Literary Magazine Fund grants at a later date. “We’re extremely grateful to work with the Amazon Literary Partnership to support a diverse community of poetry organizations and publishers whose work sparks compassion and helps us imagine new ways forward,” said Jennifer Benka, president and executive director of the Academy of American Poets. \"CLMP is extremely grateful to the Amazon Literary Partnership for providing support to literary magazines, which, like all publishers, continue to face the ongoing challenges of supply chain disruptions and rising production costs, but with fewer resources,\" said CLMP Executive Director Mary Gannon. \"Essential to the publishing ecosystem, literary magazines have shown resilience and innovation, fueled by their commitment to writers and the transformative power of literature. They deserve all the support they can get.\" Guided by the mission of having a lasting impact on the literary community, the Amazon Literary Partnership grants have supported more than 160 organizations with $15 million in grant funding since 2009. The grants have assisted tens of thousands of writers in telling their stories, amplifying their work, and finding their audiences. “It’s an honor to support these vital institutions that ceaselessly champion writers and their work,” said Al Woodworth, manager of the Amazon Literary Partnership. “At Amazon, we believe in the power of the written word to expand our thinking, advance our empathy, and change our world. We are grateful for the incredible work that these organizations do for writers and their readers, today and every day.” The Amazon Literary Partnership 2022 grant recipients, including the Poetry Fund and Literary Magazine Fund recipients, represent 30 states and support more than 20 new organizations that help writers throughout the lifecycle of their publishing career—from youth writing programs and publishing opportunities to residency programs, festivals, and workshops to speaking events and award programs. Organizations like the Asian American Writers’ Workshop, Empowering Latino Futures, Hurston/Wright Foundation, Lambda Literary, and Torch Literary Arts are explicitly focused on supporting underrepresented, underserved, and marginalized literary voices. “I cannot tell you what wonderful feedback we received from the Amazon Writers cohort/participants,” said Angela Flowers, executive director of Writers in the Schools (WITS) for Houston. “The work invigorated my staff members in a challenging year, and the authors who coached and led workshops were so open to mentoring these young creatives. We love this program so very much and appreciate the Amazon Literary Partnership for supporting this essential creative work.” \"We are thrilled to again be awarded funding for The SpeakEasy Bookmobile through the Amazon Literary Partnership and are grateful for the opportunity this award presents to expand this initiative in the year ahead,” said Paul Morris, executive director of House of SpeakEasy. “For the last four years, this grant has provided critical support for our bookmobile operations, allowing us to give away new books regularly in book deserts throughout the five boroughs of New York and in the 18 cities we visited in 2019. During the height of the pandemic, increased funding from Amazon Literary Partnership helped us put free books, book bags, and school supplies into the hands of students and families hardest hit by COVID-19.” For more than a decade, the Amazon Literary Partnership has been the sole funder of the National Book Foundation’s 5 Under 35 program. “We are so grateful for the generous support of the Amazon Literary Partnership, which allows us to celebrate five authors each year whose debut titles provide a first look at their exceptional talent as fiction writers,” said Ruth Dickey, executive director at the National Book Foundation. “It’s a joy to welcome the 5 Under 35 authors into the National Book Foundation family, champion their debuts, and connect readers everywhere with these wonderful new voices.” “We are very thankful for the support received from the Amazon Literacy Partnership, as it represents a big step for our organization toward uplifting Latino author voices in literature,” said Kirk Whisler, president of Empowering Latino Futures. \"For a long time, we lacked the resources to support in more meaningful ways our community of Latino authors, but now they are thankful for finally seeing their books displayed and being promoted in a directory that represents them.\" 2022 Amazon Literary Partnership grants (*denotes new recipients) 826 New Orleans* (LA) 826 Valencia (CA) 826DC (DC) 826NYC (NY) Academy of American Poets (NY) Archipelago Books (NY) Art Omi (NY) Arte Publico Press* (TX) Asian American Writers’ Workshop (NY) ASJA, American Society of Journalists and Authors (NY) Aspen Words (CO) Association of Writers & Writing Programs (AWP) (MD) Brooklyn Book Festival (NY) Center for the Art of Translation (CA) Centrum (WA) CHARM: Voices of Baltimore Youth*(MD) Chicago Humanities Festival (IL) City of Asylum (PA) CityLit Project (MD) Clarion West (WA) Coffee House Press (MN) Community of Literary Magazine and Presses (CLMP) (NY) Community-Word Project (NY) Creative Writing Program, University of Washington (WA) Deep Vellum (TX) Empowering Latino Futures (CA) Georgia Writers Association* (GA) Girls Write Now (NY) Graywolf Press (MN) Hedgebrook (WA) Heyday (CA) Highlights Foundation, Inc.* (PA) House of SpeakEasy Foundation (NY) Hub City Press (SC) Hugo House (WA) Humanities Washington (WA) Hurston/Wright Foundation (DC) Indiana Writers Center (IN) Kundiman (NY) Lambda Literary (NY) Lighthouse Writers Workshop (CO) Literary Freedom Project* (NY) LitNet (NY) The Loft Literary Center (MN) MacDowell (NY) Milkweed Editions (MN) Narrative 4 (N4) (NY) National Book Foundation (NY) National Novel Writing Month (CA) PEN American (NY) Poets & Writers, Inc.

One Medical is a human-centered, technology-powered national primary care organization on a mission to make quality care more affordable, accessible, and enjoyable through a seamless combination of in-person, digital, and virtual care services that are convenient to where people work, shop, and live. “We think health care is high on the list of experiences that need reinvention. Booking an appointment, waiting weeks or even months to be seen, taking time off work, driving to a clinic, finding a parking spot, waiting in the waiting room then the exam room for what is too often a rushed few minutes with a doctor, then making another trip to a pharmacy – we see lots of opportunity to both improve the quality of the experience and give people back valuable time in their days,” said Neil Lindsay, SVP of Amazon Health Services. “We love inventing to make what should be easy easier and we want to be one of the companies that helps dramatically improve the healthcare experience over the next several years. Together with One Medical’s human-centered and technology-powered approach to health care, we believe we can and will help more people get better care, when and how they need it. We look forward to delivering on that long-term mission.” “The opportunity to transform health care and improve outcomes by combining One Medical’s human-centered and technology-powered model and exceptional team with Amazon’s customer obsession, history of invention, and willingness to invest in the long-term is so exciting,” said Amir Dan Rubin, One Medical CEO. “There is an immense opportunity to make the health care experience more accessible, affordable, and even enjoyable for patients, providers, and payers. We look forward to innovating and expanding access to quality healthcare services, together.” Amazon will acquire One Medical for $18 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $3.9 billion, including One Medical’s net debt. Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by One Medical's shareholders and regulatory approval. On completion, Amir Dan Rubin will remain as CEO of One Medical.

This rollout is just the beginning of what is expected to be thousands of Amazon’s custom electric delivery vehicles in more than 100 cities by the end of this year—and 100,000 across the U.S. by 2030. The vehicles are designed from the ground-up with safety, sustainability, and comfort in mind, and have been thoroughly tested by drivers across the country. They are the product of Amazon’s partnership with Rivian, which the companies announced in 2019 when Amazon co-founded, and became the first signatory of The Climate Pledge—a commitment to reach net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040. As part of the Pledge, Amazon is creating a more sustainable delivery fleet, and its work with Rivian is an important part of decarbonizing its last mile logistics as well as accelerating innovation that can help others reach net-zero carbon. With its commitment to have all 100,000 electric delivery vehicles on the road by 2030, Amazon will save millions of metric tons of carbon per year. “Fighting the effects of climate change requires constant innovation and action, and Amazon is partnering with companies who share our passion for inventing new ways to minimize our impact on the environment. Rivian has been an excellent partner in that mission, and we’re excited to see our first custom electric delivery vehicles on the road,” said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon. “Today marks a significant milestone in our Climate Pledge commitment. Rivian was one of the first companies Amazon invested in through the Climate Pledge Fund, and we’re just getting started on our journey to have 100,000 of Rivian’s vehicles on the road by 2030. And, in addition to being sustainable, these new vehicles are also great for drivers—they were designed with driver input and feedback along the way, and they’re among the safest and most comfortable delivery vehicles on the road today.” “Today represents an important step, not just for Amazon and Rivian as partners, but also for transportation and the environment,” said RJ Scaringe, CEO of Rivian. “In 2019, Rivian and Amazon committed to fast-tracking a new type of delivery vehicle that would result in a significant reduction of carbon emissions. Thanks to our teams’ dedication, hard work and collaboration, and a shared commitment to make the world a better place for our kids’ kids, that vision is now being realized. To say this is an exciting moment is an understatement—we’re thrilled to see this partnership has kickstarted decarbonization projects across the logistics delivery industry.” Amazon has been testing deliveries with Rivian preproduction vehicles since 2021, delivering over 430,000 packages and accumulating over 90,000 miles. This significant testing has allowed Rivian to continuously improve the vehicle’s performance, safety and durability in various climates and geographies as well as its state-of-the-art features to ensure driver satisfaction, and overall functionality. Rivian has also completed certifications with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, California Air Resources Board, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The custom vehicles are made at Rivian’s factory in Illinois, and include innovative technology and features such as: A safety-first design focused on superior 360-degree visibility, and vehicle features that protect drivers and pedestrians. A suite of innovative safety features including sensor detection, highway, and traffic assist technology, a large windshield to enhance driver visibility, automatic emergency breaking, adaptive cruise control, and collision warnings. First-of-its-kind embedded technology that fully integrates the delivery workflow with the vehicle, enabling seamless access to routing, navigation, driver support and more. Features to enhance the driver experience, and create ease on the road such as automatic door locking/unlocking as the driver approaches or leaves the vehicle, and a powered bulkhead door that opens when drivers reach their delivery location. A strengthened door on the driver’s side for additional protection, and an ergonomically designed driver’s cabin and cargo area for safe, and easy movement inside the van. Batteries that are light, resilient, and low cost in addition to lasting the lifetime of the vehicle. Amazon has added thousands of charging stations at its delivery stations across the country, and will continue to invest in building an infrastructure to support a more sustainable delivery fleet. Amazon has also partnered with the nonprofit CERES, and several other fleet operators to launch the Corporate Electric Vehicle Alliance, bringing together companies to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles.

Cruz announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: AMZN) common stock between July 30, 2021 and April 28, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Amazon investors have until September 6, 2022 to file a lead plaintiff motion. If you are a shareholder who suffered a loss, click here to participate. On April 28, 2022, Amazon reported a $3.8 billion net quarterly loss. The Company disclosed $6 billion of “incremental costs,” including $2 billion due to “overcapacity” in its “fulfillment and transportation network.” Amazon also disclosed that it expected the impacts of this to “persist for the next several quarters.” On this news, Amazon’s stock fell $406.30, or 14%, to close at $2,485.63 per share on April 29, 2022, thereby injuring investors. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) rather than necessary to meet short-term and long-term customer demand, Amazon’s rapid expansion resulted in substantial overcapacity that drove massive losses and would substantially deplete the Company’s earnings moving forward; (2) Amazon’s capacity for growth far outpaced demand and, in response, Defendants made a series of intensifying cutbacks to warehouse and fulfillment capacity; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. Follow us for updates on Twitter: twitter.com/FRC_LAW. If you purchased Amazon common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 6, 2022 to ask the Court to appoint you as lead plaintiff. To be a member of the Class you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the Class. If you purchased Amazon common stock, have information or would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Frank R.

Smith Announces the Filing of a Securities Class Action on Behalf of Amazon.com, Inc.

Smith announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: AMZN) common stock between July 30, 2021 and April 28, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Amazon investors have until September 6, 2022 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors suffering losses on their Amazon investments are encouraged to contact the Law Offices of Howard G. Smith to discuss their legal rights in this class action at 888-638-4847 or by email to howardsmith@howardsmithlaw.com. On April 28, 2022, Amazon reported a $3.8 billion net quarterly loss. The Company disclosed $6 billion of “incremental costs,” including $2 billion due to “overcapacity” in its “fulfillment and transportation network.” Amazon also disclosed that it expected the impacts of this to “persist for the next several quarters.” On this news, Amazon’s stock fell $406.30, or 14%, to close at $2,485.63 per share on April 29, 2022, thereby injuring investors. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) rather than necessary to meet short-term and long-term customer demand, Amazon’s rapid expansion resulted in substantial overcapacity that drove massive losses and would substantially deplete the Company’s earnings moving forward; (2) Amazon’s capacity for growth far outpaced demand and, in response, Defendants made a series of intensifying cutbacks to warehouse and fulfillment capacity; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased Amazon common stock, have information or would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Howard G.

Amazon investors have until September 6, 2022 to file a lead plaintiff motion.

On April 28, 2022, Amazon reported a $3.8 billion net quarterly loss. The Company disclosed $6 billion of “incremental costs,” including $2 billion due to “overcapacity” in its “fulfillment and transportation network.” Amazon also disclosed that it expected the impacts of this to “persist for the next several quarters.” On this news, Amazon’s stock fell $406.30, or 14%, to close at $2,485.63 per share on April 29, 2022, thereby injuring investors. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) rather than necessary to meet short-term and long-term customer demand, Amazon’s rapid expansion resulted in substantial overcapacity that drove massive losses and would substantially deplete the Company’s earnings moving forward; (2) Amazon’s capacity for growth far outpaced demand and, in response, Defendants made a series of intensifying cutbacks to warehouse and fulfillment capacity; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. Follow us for updates on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Amazon common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 6, 2022 to ask the Court to appoint you as lead plaintiff.

Smith Reminds Investors of Looming Deadline in the Class Action Lawsuit Against Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)", "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/deadline-reminder-law-offices-of-howard-g-smith-reminds-20220725.png", "site": "businesswire.com", "text": "BENSALEM, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Law Offices of Howard G. Smith reminds investors of the upcoming September 6, 2022 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the case filed on behalf of investors who purchased Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: AMZN) common stock between July 30, 2021 and April 28, 2022, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors suffering losses on their Amazon investments are encouraged to contact the Law Offices of Howard G. Smith to discuss their legal rights in this class action at 888-638-4847 or by email to howardsmith@howardsmithlaw.com. On April 28, 2022, Amazon reported a $3.8 billion net quarterly loss. The Company disclosed $6 billion of “incremental costs,” including $2 billion due to “overcapacity” in its “fulfillment and transportation network.” Amazon also disclosed that it expected the impacts of this to “persist for the next several quarters.” On this news, Amazon’s stock fell $406.30, or 14%, to close at $2,485.63 per share on April 29, 2022, thereby injuring investors. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) rather than necessary to meet short-term and long-term customer demand, Amazon’s rapid expansion resulted in substantial overcapacity that drove massive losses and would substantially deplete the Company’s earnings moving forward; (2) Amazon’s capacity for growth far outpaced demand and, in response, Defendants made a series of intensifying cutbacks to warehouse and fulfillment capacity; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Amazon common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 6, 2022 to ask the Court to appoint you as lead plaintiff if you meet certain legal requirements. To be a member of the class action you need not take any action at this time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain an absent member of the class action. If you wish to learn more about this class action, or if you have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Howard G. Smith, Esquire, of Law Offices of Howard G. Smith, 3070 Bristol Pike, Suite 112, Bensalem, Pennsylvania 19020, by telephone at (215) 638-4847, toll-free at (888) 638-4847, or by email to howardsmith@howardsmithlaw.com, or visit our website at www.howardsmithlaw.com.

On July 12 and July 13, Prime members worldwide purchased more than 100,000 items per minute, and some of the best-selling categories were Amazon Devices, Consumer Electronics, and Home. Amazon Devices had a record-breaking Prime Day, selling more devices than any other Prime Day event. Prime continued to provide even more value to members around the world. In the U.S., Amazon introduced new offers for Prime members, including a free one-year Grubhub+ membership, a new year-round 20% discount on select everyday essentials at Amazon Fresh stores, and exclusive deals on home entertainment items and merchandise to help prepare for NFL Thursday Night Football. Additionally, Prime Student members get six months free of a LinkedIn Premium subscription. Amazon introduced new ways for customers to support and discover small businesses selling in Amazon’s store, including the Small Business Badge, which helps customers find and shop products from small business brands and artisans, and This Is Small Business, a new podcast dedicated to sharing stories from small business owners about pivotal moments in starting, building, and scaling their businesses. This year was also the biggest Prime Day event for Amazon’s selling partners, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses, whose sales growth in Amazon’s store outpaced Amazon’s first-party sales. Customers spent over $3 billion on more than 100 million small business items included in the Support Small Businesses to Win Big sweepstakes, which offered customers the chance to win prizes when shopping from small businesses leading up to Prime Day. Amazon continues to invent new fashion shopping experiences for customers, launching Virtual Try-On for Shoes, where shoppers can virtually try on thousands of sneaker styles, and Luxury Stores at Amazon in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK, where customers can shop established and emerging luxury fashion brands online. Amazon Style, Amazon’s first-ever physical store for apparel, opened in Glendale, California, to help customers discover new looks through a personalized shopping experience. Amazon Style uses machine learning algorithms to produce tailored recommendations for customers as they shop. In the fitting room, customers can use touchscreens to browse more options and request additional styles and sizes. Amazon also expanded its selection of size-inclusive fashion to include a collection from designer Jonathan Cohen and a new co-brand between Amazon and Making The Cut Season Two winner Andrea Pitter called TEREA. Amazon announced that later this year, Amazon customers in Lockeford, California, and College Station, Texas, will be among the first to receive Prime Air drone deliveries in the U.S. Customers will have the option to receive free and fast drone delivery on thousands of everyday items—the largest selection of items ever to be available for drone delivery. Amazon continues to collaborate with leading retailers and stadiums to equip third-party locations with Just Walk Out technology for checkout-free shopping and Amazon One for palm recognition and payment service. Recent store openings include the Walk-Off Market food and beverage store at T-Mobile Park in Seattle and the Hudson Nonstop store in Nashville International Airport. Additionally, three stores will open at Texas A&M’s Kyle Field later this year.

Once inside, shoppers can take what they want and leave without stopping to check out. Amazon continued to expand its grocery store footprint by opening 12 Amazon Fresh stores across the U.S. and the UK, and introduced new innovations to improve the shopping experience for customers, including the next generation Amazon Dash Cart. Amazon Dash Cart is a smart shopping cart that uses computer vision algorithms and sensor fusion to help identify items placed in a cart, so customers can skip the checkout line when they are done shopping. With the new Dash Cart, which is also expanding to its first Whole Foods Market store, shoppers can fit more items into their cart, bring the cart to their car, and easily search for specific items on the cart’s screen. Amazon announced Store Analytics, a new service that provides brands with aggregated and anonymized insights about the performance of their products, promotions, and ad campaigns in applicable stores. Store Analytics is available at Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh stores in the U.S. that are enabled with Just Walk Out technology and Amazon Dash Carts. Amazon continues to improve its shopping experience for U.S. customers who use SNAP EBT, the federal program that helps families purchase groceries. The company expanded the program so that beneficiaries in 48 states and Washington, D.C.—covering more than 99% of SNAP households—can now use their SNAP benefits to shop for groceries at Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh, and Whole Foods Market. Amazon released its second Brand Protection Report, which details how the company safeguards customers, brands, and selling partners from counterfeit products. Amazon identified, seized, and appropriately disposed of more than 3 million counterfeit products, preventing them from harming customers or being resold elsewhere in the retail supply chain. In 2021, the company employed more than 12,000 people and invested more than $900 million to protect its store from counterfeit, fraud, and other forms of abuse so customers can continue to shop with confidence. Amazon filed legal action against the administrators of more than 10,000 Facebook groups that attempt to orchestrate fake reviews on Amazon in exchange for money or free products. These groups are set up to recruit individuals willing to post incentivized and misleading reviews on Amazon’s stores in the U.S., the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Japan. Amazon will use information discovered from this legal action to identify bad actors and remove fake reviews commissioned by these fraudsters that haven’t already been detected by Amazon’s advanced technology, expert investigators, and continuous monitoring. Amazon Ads launched Amazon Marketing Stream (Beta), a product that automatically delivers hourly Sponsored Products campaign metrics to advertisers or agencies through the Amazon Ads API. The Stream provides near real-time performance insights to enable more effective campaign optimization, more agility in responding to campaign changes, and increased operational efficiency to help drive business growth for advertisers.

Amazon was named No. 1 on LinkedIn’s Top Companies in Retail, a new list that ranks the industry’s 25 best U.S. companies to grow a career in, based on LinkedIn’s data. LinkedIn highlighted Amazon’s benefits, such as up to 20 weeks of fully paid leave for new and expectant parents, weekly pay, and various apprenticeship and certification opportunities. For the fifth year in a row, Amazon was included on the Disability Equality Index’s Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion. Throughout the month of June, Amazon celebrated “Pride Out Loud” by amplifying the stories and lives of LGBTQIA+ employees, customers, and communities across the business. From operations to entertainment, the company supported more than 95 employee events around the world, sponsored local Pride celebrations in cities across the U.S., and donated to organizations that impact the lives of LGBTQIA+ youth. In celebration of Juneteenth, Amazon launched a comprehensive inclusive learning campaign for Amazon employees worldwide, featuring diversity, equity, and inclusion resources, programs and events, and interactive learning experiences, including a sit-down with Dr. Russell Wigginton, the president of the National Civil Rights Museum. Amazon launched its latest employee learning and development program, Day 1 Manager Onboarding, to accelerate new people-managers’ growth and development. The personalized learning program helps managers strengthen their understanding of Amazon’s culture, support employee career growth, and build high-performing teams through coursework on topics such as how to use leadership principles when making decisions and in common management scenarios. Supporting Communities, Selling Partners, and the Economy Amazon continues to support individuals and organizations impacted by the war in Ukraine. AWS is helping Ukraine build up cybersecurity defenses and has already migrated 10 petabytes (10 million gigabytes) of essential data to the cloud from 27 Ukrainian ministries, 18 Ukrainian universities, the country’s largest remote learning K–12 school, and dozens of private-sector companies like PrivatBank, which serves 40% of the Ukrainian population and worked with AWS to securely migrate all its operations to the cloud in less than 45 days. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded AWS the Ukraine Peace Prize for preserving the country’s digital infrastructure by migrating state registries and critical databases to AWS. Since the start of the war, Amazon has donated more than 2 million products to over 45 organizations supporting refugees, including 200,000 hygiene kits packed by Amazon employees around the world. In partnership with Welcome.US and resettlement agencies across the U.S., Amazon created the Welcome Essentials initiative using Amazon’s logistics expertise and product selection to offer refugee families free delivery of essential products, like furniture and household items, to help more than 1,000 families resettling in more than 40 cities in the U.S. this year. On top of this logistics support, Amazon has committed $2 million in donations of essential products to supporting partners. Amazon doubled the capacity of its Humanitarian Relief Hub in Atlanta to 1 million critical relief supplies that are ready to ship to communities in the Gulf Coast, the Caribbean, and Central America that have been affected by natural disasters. The facility has 20,000 cubic feet of storage space dedicated to relief items, and Amazon works with humanitarian partners around the world to deploy essential supplies when a disaster strikes, using Amazon’s global logistics network. Since 2017, Amazon has provided more than 18 million items to support relief partners worldwide during 81 natural disasters. With $96 million in cash donations to more than 180 organizations, Amazon was recognized by the Puget Sound Business Journal as the top corporate philanthropist in its home state of Washington. These contributions were part of Amazon’s total global donations of more than $360 million last year. Amazon was awarded the Defender of Innocence Award by the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project. This award recognized Amazon’s legal department for its pro bono work to prevent and correct the conviction of innocent people in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Over the past few years, 120 Amazon lawyers in more than 14 countries have spent hundreds of hours screening, evaluating, and litigating cases for the organization—more time, people, and resources than any other company or law firm. Amazon announced additional investments in affordable housing projects in its hometown communities through the Amazon Housing Equity Fund’s $2 billion commitment. The Fund invested more than $30 million to create and preserve 705 affordable homes in Nashville, Tennessee, and in Seattle. The projects are in neighborhoods facing increasing rents and displacement pressures, and five out of the six investments are with local minority-led organizations. Since the launch of the Fund in 2021, Amazon has created or preserved over 8,000 affordable homes, increasing the affordable housing inventory in Bellevue, Washington, and Arlington, Virginia, by at least 20% in one year. In India, Amazon raised its pledge to now enable $20 billion in cumulative exports by 2025. Since launching in 2015, Amazon’s Global Selling program has grown to more than 100,000 exporters that are showcasing millions of Made in India products to customers worldwide through Amazon’s store. Indian exporters are on track to surpass $5 billion in cumulative exports. In Italy, Amazon announced a new pledge to help the more than 18,000 small and medium-sized businesses selling on Amazon reach €1.2 billion in annual export sales by 2025. This pledge will support the objectives of the Italian government’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan while ensuring a wider availability of original Italian products to customers worldwide. In India, Amazon launched Smart Commerce, a new initiative to further digitize local retail stores by enabling them to create customized online storefronts and provide an enhanced in-store shopping experience. Stores of any size will now take advantage of Amazon’s shopping innovations, logistics, and digital payments to provide a reliable and trustworthy experience for customers in store, directly through their dedicated online storefronts or on Amazon.in. There are more than 150,000 local stores already selling on Amazon.in, and Amazon is committed to digitizing 10 million small businesses, including local stores, by 2025. AWS announced that it selected 34 startups to receive funding and guidance across three accelerators in Sustainable Cities, Space, and Clean Energy. Each startup is eligible to receive technical guidance, business development and strategy support, collaboration opportunities with AWS customers and members of the AWS Partner Network, and up to $100,000 in AWS promotional credits. Protecting the Planet In the U.S., Amazon started making customer deliveries with its custom Rivian electric delivery vehicles (EDVs). This rollout is the start of what Amazon plans to be thousands of EDVs in more than 100 cities by the end of 2022—and 100,000 EDVs across the U.S. by 2030. In India, Amazon signed an agreement with Tata Motors to include the new Tata Ace electric vehicle as part of Amazon’s delivery fleet. The new EDV was co-developed with Amazon and will contribute to the company’s goal of having 10,000 EDVs on the road in India by 2025. In the UK, Amazon announced the launch of its first micromobility hub for more sustainable deliveries in central London. E-cargo bikes and walkers from the new hub, along with Amazon’s electric fleet already on London’s roads, will make over 5 million deliveries a year across more than 10% of London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone. Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund made new investments in Electric Hydrogen and Sunfire, two developers of electrolyzer technologies. Electrolyzer technology makes green hydrogen using water and renewable electricity. The Fund has announced investments in 18 companies to date as part of its mission to invest in visionary companies whose products and solutions will facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. The Climate Pledge announced a collaboration with the National Geographic Society to fund 15 National Geographic Explorers as they document the global climate crisis as part of the Society’s Global Storytellers Fund. The collaboration will advance early career and established storytellers—including photographers, writers, and filmmakers—with the funding, training, and exposure necessary to help inspire global audiences and drive urgent action against the climate crisis. Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of July 28, 2022, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our estimates as of July 28, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as the effect of other factors discussed above. Third Quarter 2022 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $125.0 billion and $130.0 billion, or to grow between 13% and 17% compared with third quarter 2021. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 390 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $0 and $3.5 billion, compared with $4.9 billion in third quarter 2021. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results. These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic conditions and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Career Choice already offers pre-paid college tuition to its more than 750,000 hourly employees. With these new partnerships, employees will have access to career coaching, college advising, and specialized career services free of cost. Through the expanded benefits program, employees will receive virtual one-on-one coaching to help them identify the academic programs that best fit their skills and long-term goals, as well as continuous support throughout their higher education experience. Studies consistently show that expanding access to higher education is a proven way to create social and economic mobility for Americans. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, individuals with some college but no degree earn 18% more than their peers with just a high school diploma, while those with a bachelor’s degree earn 62% more. However, numerous studies show that access to higher education is only the start, and that all too often students with the best intentions don’t finish their programs. Harvard University studies found that fewer than 40% of community college students earn a certificate or degree within six years of enrollment, and completion rates are even lower for minorities, older students, and part-time students. In fact, the Pell Institute found that only 9% of students with lower incomes earn a bachelor’s degree by their mid 20s, compared with 77% of their higher-earning peers. That’s why Amazon is investing in programs to help employees get the guidance and coaching they need to be successful students free of cost. While financial constraints are undoubtedly a barrier for students, high-quality academic advising and career coaching improves academic outcomes—especially for lower-income or first-generation postsecondary students. “While Career Choice has always been complemented by advisement services, feedback from participants has shown that more comprehensive and ongoing coaching would help employees choose programs better aligned to their career goals. We want Amazon team members to successfully navigate the challenges of going to school while working and ultimately use their new skills to find incredible opportunities,” said Tammy Thieman, Global Director for Career Choice at Amazon. “These partnerships with Beyond 12 and Kaplan are a game-changing enhancement to our program and the careers of Amazon’s employees.” With these new partnerships, Amazon is envisioning an expansion of the Career Choice program—which has more than 80,000 total participants—that will encourage other employees to take the next step in skills training. Career Choice is designed to put employees on a path toward well-paying, in-demand professions with a coaching framework that empowers them along the way. “Participating in Amazon’s Career Choice Coaching program has been a valuable experience,” said Cicero Vieira, an Amazon fulfillment center employee in Baltimore. “To know I have a personal coach I can rely on, build a rapport with, and who is committed to helping me advance my career goals has been reassuring.” Beyond 12 is a national technology-based nonprofit whose mission is to improve the outcomes of students from under-resourced communities. The organization supplements live virtual coaching with a mobile app that guides students through activities, deadlines, and behaviors that lead to success throughout their education. “Eliminating the barrier of tuition is a tremendous benefit for Amazon employees, but postsecondary education completion gaps can’t be ignored,” said Alexandra Bernadotte, founder and CEO of Beyond 12. “Our coaching program helps identify and address the systemic and structural barriers students face before those challenges lead them to drop out. We’re pleased to partner with Amazon to go beyond getting students ‘into’ college and focus on getting students ‘through’ college.” Kaplan helps prepare students for higher education by offering test prep, including for license and certification exams, while also offering degree programs, English learning, and pathway programs. Kaplan’s program with Amazon will connect employees to career services, such as networking, resume development, job interview preparation, and online brand building services, to enhance job placement. “Kaplan is committed to helping people succeed, and this exciting new partnership with Amazon builds on our proud legacy of changing lives and building stronger futures. We’re thrilled to be empowering so many thousands of hardworking employees at Amazon and look forward to being at their side until they’ve reached their educational and professional objectives,” said Greg Marino, CEO of Kaplan’s North America division.", "url": "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220801005858/en/Amazon-adds-academic-and-career-coaching-to-employee-benefits", "ticker": "AMZN", "event_date": "2022-07-28", "window_start": "2022-07-14", "window_end": "2022-08-11", "publishedDateET": "2022-08-02T09:15:00-04:00", "date_et": "2022-08-02"}

(NASDAQ: VERI), creator of aiWARE, a hyper-expansive enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) platform, has announced an extension of its work with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to support its Media & Entertainment (M&E) customers. Last year, Veritone joined the AWS for Media & Entertainment initiative that helped content creators, rights holders, producers and distributors easily identify industry-specific AWS capabilities and accelerate transformation across five key industry innovation centers. By continuing to support the AWS for Media & Entertainment initiative, Veritone reaffirms its commitment to modernizing how IP owners of all sizes produce, distribute and ultimately monetize their content. Veritone brings a portfolio of content-enabling technologies and services that, when running on AWS, allows for end-to-end production in the cloud. With aiWARE as the enterprise platform, companies can build and deploy AI-powered workflows while seamlessly integrating with their current datasets, applications and processes. “Working in lockstep with AWS allows us to deliver the most current content production, management and monetization tools, which help M&E customers to overcome the challenges of processing digital content at greater speeds and depth with metaverse and Web3 activations,” said Ryan Steelberg, president and co-founder of Veritone. “Combining the power and scale of AWS along with our aiWARE technology, applications and services ensure that IP owners and content creators have a complete arsenal to create and maximize revenue opportunities regardless of where they exist or appear.” “With Veritone, we can combine our skill sets and capabilities to offer a revolutionized way to create and monetize content no matter where creative workforces are located,” said Chris Blandy, global leader of strategy and business development for media & entertainment, AWS. “Leveraging Veritone’s AI platform on AWS, content creators and distributors are unlocking new ways to monetize existing libraries and create more engaging programming. The demand for content is not slowing down, and having the ability to identify and access the right asset immediately is essential for meeting the demanding pace of production.” Veritone and AWS magnify benefits for Media & Entertainment organizations With aiWARE serving as a foundation to incorporate AI and intelligent workflow capabilities into a content production environment, M&E brands can leverage aiWARE-based applications on AWS, such as Veritone Digital Media Hub, to streamline the management of unstructured data to activate the monetization of their vast media archives. By automating metadata tagging and creating intelligent and actionable media data lakes, content creators can efficiently uncover valuable content and ensure new assets do not become lost, allowing brands like the San Francisco Giants and CBS News to activate decades worth of content. “Leveraging AI to structure our digitized archive of 80-plus years of Giants baseball history, aiWARE and Digital Media Hub have accelerated and expanded our content projects,” said Paul Hodges, vice president of content and entertainment, San Francisco Giants. “As part of the Veritone ecosystem, we like how we can incorporate more tools and capabilities as needed, future-proofing our content production for omnichannel fan engagement including Web3.” As the next phase of content creation becomes more immersive and driven by “phygital” experiences, creators need tools to extend the content lifecycle to reach and access customers wherever they are consuming media. Veriverse, a portfolio of metaverse-ready solutions for the Enterprise, provides that much-needed bridge M&E brands are trying to cross to capitalize on the Web3 opportunity. Winner of back-to-back NAB Product of the Year awards for Veritone Voice and Veritone Avatar, Veriverse adds another layer of capability that is positioned to become industry standard. “Veritone Voice and the rest of the Veriverse portfolio change how brands engage with their customers. With the ability to deploy internationally, including in the U.K., Veritone accelerates international product and service implementations while also taking into account GDPR standards,” said James Poulter, CEO, and co-founder, Vixen Labs. “From conversational AI applications to human-driven digital personas in immersive environments, we can truly make the digital experience feel human and authentic anywhere.” In addition to Digital Media Hub and Veriverse, the Veritone portfolio of applications on AWS includes Attribute and Discovery, broadcast solutions designed to track and search content and provide proof-of-performance metrics.

Customers love iRobot products—and I’m excited to work with the iRobot team to invent in ways that make customers’ lives easier and more enjoyable.” “Since we started iRobot, our team has been on a mission to create innovative, practical products that make customers’ lives easier, leading to inventions like the Roomba and iRobot OS,” said Colin Angle, chairman and CEO of iRobot. “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” Amazon will acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion, including iRobot’s net debt.

Actual results could differ materially from those projected or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following: the conditions to the completion of the transaction may not be satisfied, or the regulatory approvals required for the transaction may not be obtained on the terms expected, on the anticipated schedule, or at all; closing of the transaction may not occur or may be delayed, either as a result of litigation related to the transaction or otherwise; Amazon may be unable to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction; revenues following the transaction may be lower than expected; the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any recurrence, may affect the results of operations; operating costs, customer loss, and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, partners, and commercial counterparties) may be greater than expected; Amazon may assume unexpected risks and liabilities; completing the transaction may distract Amazon’s management from other important matters; and the other factors discussed in “Risk Factors” in Amazon’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and in Amazon’s other filings with the SEC, which are available at http://www.sec.gov.

Cautionary Statements Regarding iRobot Forward-Looking Statements This communication contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are based on iRobot’s current expectations, estimates and projections about the expected date of closing of the proposed transaction and the potential benefits thereof, its business and industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by iRobot and Amazon, all of which are subject to change. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “could,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “may,” “would,” “might,” “potentially,” “estimate,” “continue,” “expect,” “target,” similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond iRobot’s control, and are not guarantees of future results, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-looking statements, including the failure to consummate the proposed transaction or to make or take any filing or other action required to consummate the transaction on a timely matter or at all, are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the ability of the parties to consummate the proposed transaction in a timely manner or at all; (ii) the satisfaction (or waiver) of closing conditions to the consummation of the proposed transaction, including with respect to the approval of iRobot’s stockholders; (iii) potential delays in consummating the proposed transaction; (iv) the ability of iRobot to timely and successfully achieve the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction; (v) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance or condition that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; (vi) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine on iRobot’s business and general economic conditions; (vii) iRobot’s ability to implement its business strategy; (viii) significant transaction costs associated with the proposed transaction; (ix) potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction; (x) the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm iRobot’s business, including current plans and operations; (xi) the ability of iRobot to retain and hire key personnel; (xii) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed transaction; (xiii) legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting iRobot’s business; (xiv) general economic and market developments and conditions; (xv) the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which iRobot operates; (xvi) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the merger that could affect iRobot’s financial performance; (xvii) restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact iRobot’s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; and (xviii) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as iRobot’s response to any of the aforementioned factors. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the proposed transaction, will be fully discussed in the Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” in iRobot’s most recent annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and any subsequent reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K filed from time to time and available at www.sec.gov. While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the Proxy Statement will be, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on iRobot’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. The forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof. iRobot does not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.
