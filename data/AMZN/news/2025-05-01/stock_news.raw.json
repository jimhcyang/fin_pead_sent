    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended All&#039;s Well That Ends Green 4:30 pm All three major market indices ended in the green Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up a bare 0.05%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained a more substantial 0.7%, and the Nasdaq closed up 1.2% gain. Despite an inauspicious start on Monday, the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF&#8217;s gain of 0.7% Friday brought its total gain for the week to 4.6%. For the month of April, however, the Voo remains down 1.5%, with just three trading days remaining. Call It &quot;the Trump Effect&quot; 1:23 pm Markets have turned solidly green in afternoon trading, with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.66% and the Voo ETF ticking right along in its footsteps with a 0.64% gain. So what&#8217;s changed? Responding to China&#8217;s demurral yesterday that &#8220;there are absolutely no negotiations on the economy and trade between China and the U.S.,&#8221; which was itself in response to President Trump&#8217;s assertion Tuesday that talks were happening, the President insisted again today that, whatever the Chinese government may want people to believe, &#8220;we&#8217;ve been meeting with China&#8221; to talk about lowering tariffs after all. In this game of he said, Xi said, it&#8217;s honestly hard for an investor to know what&#8217;s really going on. But for now at least, the markets seem to believe Mr. Trump, and are hoping the trade war is nearing an end. S&amp;P 500 Just Turned Into a Horse of a Different Color 11:50 am Uh-oh. We&#8217;re 15 minutes from noonday now, and the S&amp;P 500 has just turned red, down 0.12%. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF, likewise, has lost its pleasant shade of green, and is now down 0.14%. In happier news (for investors), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) just won a ruling in Texas, where an Outsourcing Facilities Association lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the FDA suing them for making Ozempic copycat drugs just got rejected. S&amp;P 500 component Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) previously won a similar ruling, also in Texas. For the big publicly-traded GLP-1 drugmakers, things are finally going their way. S&amp;P Might Not Bounce Back This Time 10:52 am In mid-morning trading, we&#8217;re getting further disturbing news that may weigh on &#8220;the Voo.&#8221; CNBC reports that S&amp;P 500 component Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN), or more precisely third party retailers who sell on Amazon, are raising prices on hundreds of items to help them absorb the cost of new tariffs imposed by President Trump. Amazon&#8217;s stock price doesn&#8217;t seem to be suffering from the report yet. It&#8217;s still slightly in the green. But the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t moving any higher, despite trading having begun nearly an hour and a half ago already. And we&#8217;re off! The stock market opened for trading a bit lower today than it left off last night. But within five minutes of opening, the S&amp;P 500 (Index: SPX) was already, if only barely, in the green with an 0.06% gain. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: VOO), which closely tracks the performance of the index, is up 0.09%. It&#8217;s still a hesitant start, but a logical result in light of comments from President Trump, just published by Time magazine, to the effect that the President is looking to end his trade war with China (and the world) perhaps &#8220;a year from now&#8221; and with tariffs on foreign countries settling at &#8220;20% to 50%.&#8221; The prospect of trade war volatility dragging on for another 12 months, and of tariffs ending up two to five times higher than the 10% &#8220;reciprocal&#8221; tariffs already announced, is clearly not something that investors wanted to hear. Earnings Last night, after the close of trading on a third straight day of gains for &#8220;the Voo,&#8221; index component Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOG) (Nasdaq: GOOGL) reported earnings a staggering 40% better than Wall Street analysts were predicting, which seemed propitious enough news to keep the stock market rally going this morning. Unfortunately, comments from Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) seem to have canceled out Alphabet&#8217;s good news. The chipmaker reported a $0.19 per share loss for its own first quarter, warned that it&#8217;s not going to earn a profit in Q2 either (at best, Intel might break even), and its Q2 sales will be about $1 billion less than analysts had forecast. This mixed messaging on the earnings front, for two of the country&#8217;s biggest tech companies, is also weighing on the market today. Analyst Calls Perhaps unlucky for them, Wall Street analysts seem not to have had an opportunity to review the President&#8217;s comments before issuing their latest round of upgrades this morning. Citigroup for example is starting the day off with an upgrade of Hasbro (Nasdaq: HAS) stock, while KeyBanc is upgrading both Lowes (NYSE: LOW) and La-Z-Boy (NYSE: LZB) &#8212; all three of which companies are highly dependent upon goods imported from abroad. If the trade war keeps rumbling, and tariffs keep climbing, things could turn ugly for all of these stocks, and for the S&amp;P 500 in general.

    "text": "ST. CHARLES, IL — The Whole Foods in St. Charles is inching closer to opening day. But, it's still unclear exactly when that will be. Russell Colby, director of community development for the city of St. Charles, said the city has issued a \"punch list\" of items during a final inspection that must not be completed before a building permit project is considered complete. \"Once the project is complete, the city can issue an occupancy permit to allow the building to be occupied. With an occupancy approval, the store would have the ability to begin stocking the store and bringing in employees,\" Colby said. The store is still planned to open in the spring, but a specific opening date has not been announced, he said. Meanwhile, hiring has gotten underway for a variety of positions at the store. Those interested in working for Whole Foods can apply here.  Fort Union, a regional development commercial specializing in grocery anchors, acquired the property in 2023 and entered into a lease agreement with Whole Foods Market, according to city officials. As part of upgrades to the site, parking lots around the store were reconstructed for future use by Whole Foods, including the city-owned parking lot located at the southwest corner of Illinois and First Streets. The sidewalks and landscaping around the parking lots were updated to add angled street parking, paver bricks, landscape beds and decorative lighting. In recent months, work has been done inside the store. As a part of the project approval, the city approved an incentive agreement to reimburse the developer for the cost of the parking lot and street/sidewalk improvements, according to city officials. In March 2022, the Blue Goose closed its doors for good. The store first opened in 1928.",

    "text": "The Nasdaq traded at 5,048 in March 2000. It took 15 years to regain that level after a collapse. That year&#8217;s drop hammered it to 1,114 in October, a 78% drop. When it peaked that March, it had risen by 800% in the previous five years. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: The stock market could drop by more than half Worry about inflation and AI valuations. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) A similar drop in the value of the Nasdaq today would take it from its 20,0000 peak two months ago to 5,400. It seems impossible, but is it? A few of the largest cap stocks in the world have had huge runups in the last five years. Nvidia has risen 1,433%, and several other Magnificent Seven stocks have almost tripled. The cause of the Nasdaq&#8217;s collapse today would be very different from that of 2000. Hundreds of companies that went public a quarter of a century ago were losing money. When the capital available to them dried up, the shares of most collapsed, and some went out of business. Even companies with strong prospects, like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), took share price beatings. Three factors would cause a deep drop in the market. The first is that the market is considered rich on multiple levels. The S&amp;P 500 PE is 26, which is high unless this year’s earnings are strong across the market. Two other things could crush the market. The first is hyperinflation, which tariffs, the equivalent of a tax on everything from cars to toys, would bring on. American household income will be unable to keep up with double-digit price surges. True hyperinflation occurs when prices go up 50%. Inflation hit the U.S. by 18% in 1980, driven to some extent by energy prices. The Fed raised rates to 19%. The economy was pounded into a recession from 1980 to 1982, and the stock market took a brutal beating. The other significant risk is an AI valuation implosion. Big tech shareholders already worry that the industry has invested more money in AI than it can get as a return on investment in the next few years. Companies have already prepared to invest tens of billions of dollars in server farms to expand because the US does not have that supply today. They have also invested or plan to put billions of dollars into Nvidia&#8217;s (NASDAQ: NVDA) chips. Nvidia&#8217;s value relies on that continuing. The more dangerous and harder-to-forecast problem is that AI could begin to threaten humans. It is not an edge case. Wide-regarded Scientific American recently wrote, “Artificial intelligence algorithms will soon reach a point of rapid self-improvement that threatens our ability to control them and poses great potential risk to humanity.” From an investor’s standpoint, AI could lose most, if not all, of its value, under those circumstances. It is hard to believe that the stock market could lose all of its value, but not that many decades ago, it did.

    "text": "Most of the news about Jeff Bezos in the past few weeks is that his rocket company Blue Moon sent six women into space. This included longtime fiancee Lauren Sanchez. In the meantime, the stock of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), which he co-founded, has risen 8% in the past month while the market has been flat. Bezos’s net worth has recently risen above $200 billion to $203 billion. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Jeff Bezos’s net worth has recently risen above $200 billion. His primary source of wealth is AI and e-commerce colossus Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Amazon’s market cap is $2 trillion. That makes it the fourth most valuable company in the world, behind Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Bezos is the second richest man in the world, which puts him behind Elon Musk at $335. Musk’s net worth has plunged $97 billion this year. Bezos’s is down $29 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. It&#8217;s All About Amazon Bezos’s primary source of wealth is Amazon, of which he owns 9%. He founded it in 1994 with his then-wife MacKenzie Scott. He was CEO from 1994 to 2021. He turned the company from an online bookstore to the largest e-commerce site in the world. In 2022, he started Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is now the world’s biggest cloud computing company. In the most recent quarter, it had operating income of $10.6 billion, compared to a total of $20 billion for the entire company. As is the case with most megatech companies, the future success of Amazon is in artificial intelligence (AI). It recently invested $8 billion into Anthropic, which is one of the world’s largest AI startups. Amazon also said it would invest $100 billion in capital expenditures, most of which will go to AI R&amp;D and server farms. CEO Andy Jassy commented, “I think that both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy, medium to long-term, that we’re pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.” Amazon is in a foot race for AI dominance. Other companies in the race include OpenAI, Musk’s xAI, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. How well Amazon does will affect Bezos’s future net worth as much as anything.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended S&amp;P 500 Extends Its Winning Streak 4:18 pm The S&amp;P 500 closed up 0.6% for Tuesday, extending its winning streak to six straight days. Trade Talks Keep S&amp;P 500 Moving Higher 1:51 pm &#8220;Ask, and ye shall receive.&#8221; Investors for example have been asking a lot lately, for proof that President Trump&#8217;s tariffs threats will result in trade deals that can benefit the U.S. economy. Today, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the conclusion of a trade deal with India is almost set now, with deals with both Japan and South Korea likely to follow in short order. That&#8217;s exactly what investors wanted to hear. The S&amp;P 500 is now up 0.7%, and so is &#8220;the Voo.&#8221; Trump Growls, Amazon Caves 12:13 pm Well, that was quick! No sooner had the White House expressed disapproval of an Amazon plan to inform customers of how much tariffs were raising the cost of goods sold on its site, than Amazon has abandoned the plan. Amazon spokesman Tim Doyle has just tossed the idea under the proverbial bus, admitting he &#8220;considered the idea&#8221; but it &#8220;was never approved and not going to happen.&#8221; Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick (see above) commented: &#8220;Good move,&#8221; Amazon. Tariffs Threaten Supply Chain, Wall Street Shrugs 10:57 am Gene Seroka, the executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, is warning of a &#8220;precipitous drop&#8221; in shipments from China as &#8220;major American retailers stop &#8230; all shipments from China based on the tariffs&#8221; announced by President Trump earlier this month. Despite the warning, investors have resumed buying stocks, and the S&amp;P 500 is now in positive territory, up 0.3%. Stock markets opened lower on Tuesday, threatening to break the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s five-day winning streak, although the market is moving back towards breakeven now. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.3% lower this morning, and the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) likewise opened down 0.3%. T In political news, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt blasted a reported plan by Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN), to display the cost of wares on its site next to the amount the cost was inflated by tariffs cost, as a &#8220;hostile and political act.&#8221; Things could be worse, though. Last night, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick promised to &#8220;reward &#8230; companies who manufacture domestically&#8221; by reducing tariffs on foreign auto parts used to manufacture cars in the U.S. General Motors (NYSE: GM) CEO Mary Barra responded to the news by promising to &#8220;invest even more in the U.S. economy.&#8221; Ford (NYSE: F) CEO agreed that the move &#8220;will help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers.&#8221; Earnings Speaking of General Motors, the automotive giant reported this morning that its Q1 profits came in at $2.78, $0.17 ahead of analyst forecasts. Commercial truckmaker Paccar (Nasdaq: PCAR) on the other hand reported profits $0.14 below forecasts. In housing, we see LGI Homes (Nasdaq: LGIH) miss badly, but paintmaker Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW) beat. In airlines, Jetblue Airways (Nasdaq: JBLU) reported a $0.59 per share loss, but this was $0.02 better than the $0.61 per share loss it was expected to report. Analyst Calls Analyst action is so far muted. Swiss bank UBS upgraded cranemaker Crane (NYSE: CR) to buy. Tariffs war and &#8220;market uncertainty&#8221; notwithstanding, UBS says it&#8217;s &#8220;increasingly confident in the long-term earnings outlook and M&amp;A opportunity&#8221; for the company. Not everyone&#8217;s so confident, however. Already this morning we&#8217;re seeing downgrades outnumber upgrades, with Stifel cutting Builders FirstSource (Nasdaq: BLDR) to neutral, Bank of America lowering ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), also to neutral, and TD Cowen downgrading GLP-1 drugs compounder Hims &amp; Hers (NYSE: HIMS) to hold, citing increased competition from Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), and a lack of near-term catalysts to move the stock higher.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Trade Deals 3:06 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reportedly revealed that the U.S. has secured one trade deal, keeping most of the details close to the vest except to say that the White House is awaiting a green light from some unnamed country. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 300 points in response for a 0.84% gain, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are holding similar gains. Narrow Range 12:34 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets are managing slight gains across the Nasdaq Composite, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average despite the absence of greater details on any global trade deals. Of the S&amp;P 500, Baird investment strategist Ross Mayfield is cited by CNBC as saying, “I think [stocks are] probably trapped in a in a pretty tight range here,&#8221; pointing to a range of 5,100-5,700. “I think we can bounce around there for quite a while in kind of some volatile, choppy trading. Until we get some resolution on the trade front, I don’t think much else matters,&#8221; he added. Consumer Weakness 11:03 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market averages are currently all moving higher despite some weaker than anticipated economic data. The U.S. consumer has long been credited with upholding the economy throughout the one-two punch of inflation and higher interest rates. Now the tariffs could be the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back, as consumer confidence shows signs of waning. The Consumer Confidence Index published by the Conference Board sank to a reading of 86 in April, a drop of nearly 8 points from the prior month and below economist estimates calling for 87.7. A separate index that reflects consumer sentiment over the next six months fell by a steep 12.5 points to a reading of 54.4, its worst level in over a decade. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that March job postings dropped to their lowest level in about six months. Tariffs, Earnings and Tech 10:00 am by Gerelyn Terzo The markets continue to trade mixed this morning on tariff deal ambiguity as Q1 earnings results pour in. Stocks are weighing earnings results and a lack of certainty on the tariff deal front while tensions have emerged between Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and the White House over tariff-related costs. Magnificent Seven stocks are mixed, with Amazon and Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) trading in the red while Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) benefits from a Wall Street endorsement. Hims &amp; Hers HEalth (Nasdaq: HIMS) is soaring by 24% today on news of a deal to sell weight loss drug phenom Wegovy on its e-commerce platform. The markets are holding out for more tariff deal progress, digging in their heels and nearly standing still in the meantime. The three major stock market averages are moving fractionally in either direction, with the Nasdaq Composite posting slight declines alongside the S&amp;P 500 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is eking out modest gains. Sectors of the economy are evenly split between red and green, with real estate moving higher and consumer discretionary stocks headed lower. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) is getting some unwanted attention after the White House took aim at the tech giant, calling its reported plans to list tariff cost impacts on its site as a &#8220;hostile and political act.&#8221; Big 3 automaker General Motors (NYSE: GM) reported better-than-expected quarterly results while reassessing its full-year outlook, sending the stock lower by 1.5%. GM and the auto sector have targets on their backs at the height of the tariff wars, in response to which the former Dow component has suspended all share buyback programs. The White House has affirmed its plans to provide tariff relief to the auto sector. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 138.11 (+0.36%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 67.15 (-0.40%) S&amp;P 500: Down 10.23 (-0.19%) Earnings &amp; Analyst Calls Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) surpassed Q1 expectations on the top and bottom lines and is keeping its full-year guidance intact amid expectations that it will be able to manage any tariff-related fallout, including rising aluminum costs. Rival company PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) recently lowered its earnings forecast due to the tariff impact. Evercore ISI has reiterated its &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock with a $250 price target, suggesting the company&#8217;s strategies should help it to offset any impact from the tariff frenzy. Piper Sandler has reiterated its &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), saying that the China tariff uncertainties notwithstanding, the AI leader&#8217;s strong market relationships give the stock a place in the analyst firm&#8217;s top large cap pick universe. UBS has reiterated its &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) but lowered the price target to $253 from $272, owing to what it described as &#8220;potential demand destruction.&#8221; The post Live Nasdaq Composite: Markets Stand Still on Tariff and Tech Tussle appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Recover 4:05 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Talk about a roller coaster. After spiraling by over 600 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished in the green, while the S&amp;P 500 similarly eked out a modest gain. The Nasdaq Composite finished slightly lower, but far from its worst levels of the day. While recession fears have been stoked now that the economy is officially slowing down, the markets shook it off, perhaps in anticipation of Meta (Nasdaq: META) and Microsoft&#8217;s (Nasdaq: MSFT) earnings this afternoon. Stocks Trim Losses 12:19 pm by Gerelyn Terzo President Trump has attributed the unexpected GDP contraction to the Biden Administration, surmising that economic growth will &#8220;take a while.&#8221; In the meantime, he urges Americans to stay patient as the next economic boom awaits. Stocks have trimmed their losses. NVDA a Sell 12:07 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street firm has turned cautious on the AI boom. Seaport Research has reportedly downgraded shares of AI darling Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) to a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating, owing to worries about AI spending from businesses. Analyst Jay Goldberg believes that while Nvidia was a clear winner in the AI mania, the prospects are already built into the stock. Nvidia stock has shaved off 20% of its value year-to-date. The stock market has come off its lows of the day, with the Nasdaq Composite trimming its declines from approximately 3% to 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are down fractionally. Today&#8217;s sell-off was sparked by an economic contraction in Q1, thrusting the possibility of a recession further into the spotlight. Markets Off Worst Levels 10:53 am by Gerelyn Terzo In what is shaping up to be an historic market sell-off, stocks have come off their worst levels of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses from over 600 points to about 400 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are down by barely 2% each. In addition to the GDP shocker, the markets received more economic data to process from the labor market. Private payrolls rose by 62,000 in April, falling short of Dow Jones expectations for nearly double that growth. March saw a gain of 147,000 private payrolls, making the sting even worse. Companies are placing hiring on hold as they await the full impact of the Trump administration&#8217;s tariffs. Stock Market Drawdown 10:08 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Goldman Sachs, if the economy were to slip into a recession, the stock market selling would intensify. Goldman Sachs Micro Strategist Vicky Chang warned that unlike past market cycles, this time around, headline risk signals the market bottom, not the economic trough, saying, &#8220;We still think there is significant vulnerability in a recession scenario, even if the worst of the underlying ‘shock’ has passed.&#8221; The economic slowdown is real. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% during Q1 2025 after corporate America rushed to receive imports before the tariffs kicked in. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. GDP declined at an annual rate of 0.3%, adjusted for inflation, the worst drop the economy has suffered in in three years. By way of comparison, economists were predicting an economic expansion of 0.4% in the first quarter, a far cry from the results as the tariff wars took hold. Stocks went into freefall mode in response, including a 600-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite spiraled by 2.7% and the S&amp;P 5oo lost 2.0%. Every single sector of the economy is trading lower as fears of an economic recession grip the markets. Each of the Magnificent Seven stocks are under pressure, including a steep 6% drop in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and declines of close to 4% for Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). What a day for Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) to be reporting quarterly earnings after the closing bell today. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 646.83 (-1.6%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 454.57 (-2.6%) S&amp;P 500: Down 111.05 (-1.9%) Market Movers Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) is losing 8% on the day and has been downgraded by Goldman Sachs to a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating from &#8220;&#8216;buy&#8221; with a $85 price target attached, down from a previous target of over $100 per share. Starbucks reported Q1 results and missed Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Social media platform Snap (NYSE: SNAP) is falling by over 15% this morning in the market sell-off after choosing to forego earnings guidance due to uncertainty from tariffs. First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR) is losing 10% on the day after missing Q1 estimates and revealing the toll that tariffs will take on its revenue in 2025.

    "text": "Strategically, the Blockchain As A Service (BaaS) market presents strong growth potential, especially in regions like North America with mature digital infrastructure and regulatory support.

Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) provides strong cryptographic security and audit capabilities, minimizing fraud and illegal access. Entities within the BFSI, legal, and healthcare sectors are implementing BaaS to enhance verification procedures, mitigate operational risks, and bolster trust among stakeholders. Increasing Adoption in Supply Chain and Logistics: Blockchain facilitates real-time asset monitoring, provenance verification, and immutable recording—essential requirements for contemporary supply chains. Logistics firms, manufacturers, and retailers are integrating BaaS platforms to assure compliance, mitigate counterfeit concerns, and improve supplier transparency. Due to increasing ESG and traceability demands, companies are investing in BaaS to digitally transform their comprehensive supply networks. Growth of Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (dApps): Smart contracts are transforming enterprise automation by eliminating the necessity for third-party validation in contractual processes. Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) solutions empower enterprises to construct, implement, and oversee smart contracts on scalable blockchain networks without necessitating internal blockchain infrastructure. Industries such as insurance, finance, and energy are adopting BaaS to mitigate delays, enforce contractual commitments, and diminish disputes through self-executing protocols. To Purchase a Comprehensive Report Analysis: https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/select-licence?rid=10565 Market Restraint Regulatory Uncertainty and Compliance Challenges: The international blockchain regulatory framework is disjointed and continues to develop. Businesses encounter uncertainty around the alignment of blockchain transactions, smart contracts, and digital identities with local compliance regulations, including GDPR, HIPAA, and financial reporting standards. The intricate regulatory landscape, especially for cross-border operations, obstructs comprehensive BaaS implementations and introduces legal and reputational risks. High Implementation and Integration Costs: While BaaS diminishes the price associated with constructing blockchain infrastructure from the ground up, overall implementation costs might be considerable. Organizations must allocate resources for customisation, user training, legacy system integration, and post-deployment maintenance. For SMEs, the initial and recurring expenses remain high, deterring adoption despite the technology's promise for long-term ROI. Limited Availability of Blockchain Expertise: Blockchain continues to be a specialized competency inside the global labor market. Many firms lack the internal technical expertise necessary to efficiently implement, scale, and secure BaaS infrastructures. The learning curve related to distributed ledger technologies, consensus processes, and smart contract programming hinders implementation deadlines. This skills deficit increases dependence on external consultants and impedes innovation cycles. Geographical Dominance North America possesses the predominant stake in the Blockchain As A Service (BaaS) industry, propelled by early adoption in financial services, healthcare, and logistics. The existence of influential major actors, along with robust regulatory support for digital transformation, drives regional growth. U.S. companies are utilizing BaaS to improve data security, optimize operations, and maintain competitiveness, establishing the area as a global center for blockchain innovation.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. Buy the Rumor 1:41 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America has issued a report advising investors to buy the trade deal anticipation but sell the news. BofA Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett wrote, &#8220;Oversold equities have correctly front-run Q2 trade deals/lower tariffs. We expect ‘buy the expectation, sell the fact,’ stocks fade into the trade deals.&#8221; The White House is expected to meet with China officials on potentially reaching a trade agreement over the weekend. Stocks remain lower out of caution. Markets Hold Back 12:09 pm by Gerelyn Terzo China&#8217;s government officials have come out swinging against the White House, saying they strongly opposes what they described as &#8220;U.S. abuse&#8221; of reciprocal tariffs. Earlier today, President Trump revealed that he was willing to reduce tariffs on China imports to 80% from a triple-digit percentage level. Washington, D.C. and Beijing officials are set to come to the negotiating table this weekend. Stocks are lower on the trade deal uncertainty. Markets Reverse Course 10:52 am by Gerelyn Terzo The stock market has reversed course, leaving all three of the major stock market averages in the red after coming out of the gate higher on China trade deal hopes. Traders and investors appear to be playing it cautiously until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. Market declines are modest, including a 0.07% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. At this rate, stocks are likely to continue meandering between positive and negative ground for now. Weekly Performance 9:44 am by Gerelyn Terzo The Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a fractional gain today and has advanced a more impressive 7.9% over the past month. Year-to-date, the tech-heavy index is still lower by 6%. Over the past five trading sessions, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) has gained 5% while Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) has lost 7.4%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are looking to end the week on a positive note after getting some good news on the trade war. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from a triple-digit percentage to 80%, saying that level seems appropriate as the White House gears up for talks with Beijing. Stocks appear to be cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning. While China has been the wildcard, the Trump administration suggested that multiple agreements are being reached with U.S. trade partners, injecting further optimism into these markets. Most sectors of the economy are seeing green, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are lifting the Nasdaq Composite higher, including a 1% gain in Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) and 2.5% jump in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA). The Dow Jones Industrial Average is also getting a pop from Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock on a strong Dreamliners jet order from the British Airways parent company. BA stock is up 1.4%. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 114.55 (+0.26%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 102.00 (+0.57%) S&amp;P 500: Up 24.36 (+0.41%) Market Movers Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) might be a volatile play, but that is what it takes to trade as one of the leading tech stocks. As of yesterday, Palantir has muscled its way into the top 10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, boasting a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. By way of comparison, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers at a lesser $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is down 1% today on profit taking. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is soaring 22.8% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue ballooned by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%. Lyft (Nasdaq: LYFT) stock is rising today after lifting its Q2 forecast and initiating a $750 million share buyback program. Most Wall Street analysts have a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock. Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) is taking a breather after announcing a blockbuster deal to acquire options trading platform Deribit in a $2.9 billion deal, thrusting it into the crypto derivatives realm.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Updates appear automatically as they are published. BofA: Buy the Rumor, Sell the News 1:50 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Bank of America has published a report urging investors to buy the trade deal anticipation but sell the news. BofA Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett warned that the trade deal details could revert back to Liberation Day levels, writing, &#8220;Oversold equities have correctly front-run Q2 trade deals/lower tariffs. We expect ‘buy the expectation, sell the fact,’ stocks fade into the trade deals.&#8221; The White House is expected to meet with China officials on potentially reaching a trade agreement over the weekend. Stocks remain under pressure as the markets err on the side of caution. Trade Deal Uncertainty 12:11 pm by Gerelyn Terzo China&#8217;s commerce minister has come out swinging against the White House, saying the nation strongly opposes what he described as &#8220;U.S. abuse&#8221; of reciprocal tariffs. Earlier today, President Trump proved that he was willing to lower tariffs on China imports to 80% from a triple-digit percentage level. Washington, D.C. and Beijing officials are expected to come to the negotiating table over the weekend. Stocks are under pressure on the trade deal uncertainty. Aimless Markets 11:07 am by Gerelyn Terzo Today&#8217;s gains have faded as traders hold out for closure on a trade agreement between the U.S. and China. The three major indices are now trading mixed, including a 0.06% gain in the S&amp;P 500, 0.13% gain in the Nasdaq Composite and 0.13% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Markets are likely to continue trading aimlessly until the White House and Beijing sign on the dotted line. S&amp;P 500 This Week 10:15 am by Gerelyn Terzo Despite today&#8217;s gains, the S&amp;P 500 remains modestly lower for the week, with a 0.06% decline as of Friday morning. There&#8217;s still time for the index to push even higher, especially if the White House announces further tariff agreements with international trade partners. CNBC reported that the broader market index remains mired below a key resistance level, making it difficult for it to break out higher. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Tariffs are having a live by the sword, die by the sword effect, and today that is translating to gains. President Trump revealed that he is willing to slash tariffs on China imports from over 100% to 80%, saying that level seems reasonable as Washington, D.C. gears up for negotiations with Beijing. Stocks are rightfully cautiously optimistic on the development, with all three of the major stock market averages headed higher this morning but keeping it modest. The SPX ETF is gaining 0.25% as of morning trading. China could be the first of many tariff deals in the works with U.S. trade partners, according to the White House, further lifting market sentiment. Most sectors of the economy are moving higher, led by the energy, consumer discretionary and technology sectors. Magnificent Seven stocks are participating in the gains, with Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) rising 1% while Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is adding 6.8%. TSLA stock is on its way to reclaiming a $1 trillion market cap. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is being lifted in part by Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock on a desirable Dreamliners jet order from the British Airways parent company. BA stock is up 1.4%. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 82.49 (+0.20%) Nasdaq Composite: Up 114.14 (+0.63%) S&amp;P 500: Up 22.51 (+0.40%) Market Movers Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) might be a volatile play, but it&#8217;s also one of the leading tech stocks. As of Thursday, Palantir was added to the top-10 most valuable technology plays in the U.S. market, with a market capitalization of $281.1 billion. Comparatively, Salesforce&#8217;s (NYSE: CRM) market cap currently hovers below that level at $268.4 billion. PLTR stock is taking it on the chin today, down fractionally. Ad-tech platform The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD) is skyrocketing by over 20% today after reporting strong Q1 results. Revenue soared by 25% to $616 million. Earlier this month, RBC maintained a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $85 per share, reflecting upside potential of 41%. Lyft (Nasdaq: LYFT) stock is climbing 20.3% higher today after lifting its Q2 forecast and initiating a $750 million share buyback program. Most Wall Street analysts have a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the stock. Expedia Group (Nasdaq: EXPE) is down 7.3% on the day on a Wall Street downgrade to &#8220;underweight&#8221; by Piper Sandler analysts.

    "site": "https://247wallst.com",
    "text": "The stock market had a 20% reset in April, which lasted only a few days, if even that. Recently, it has traded down only 7% for the year. It has only been a quarter of a century since the last market wipeout. The Nasdaq dropped 75% from March 2000 to October 2002. Most of the reason was the .com companies had raised too much money as their losses mounted, and the value of their business models was viewed as unsustainable. Key Points The Market Could Drop 50% Trillions Of Dollars Would Disappear Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The most notable part of the market crash was that it destroyed company stocks with strong business models that are today&#8217;s market titans, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). When the market imploded, Microsoft’s market cap dropped 65%. If the market dropped 75% today, the Nasdaq would collapse from 17,100 to 4,475, and its market value would collapse by $23 trillion, hammering the wealth of many Americans. It is worth noting that the 2000 to 2022 Nasdaq market collapse was not accompanied by a significant recession. GDP fell only .3% in that period, and unemployment rose to 5.5%. That is hardly a recession at all. One of the first signs of a new, sharp market drop is that stocks in the AI craze have started to crater. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), considered the No. 2 AI chip maker, traded at $227 in March last year. A few weeks ago, it dropped to $88 and has since recovered to $102. Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) reached $125 in February last year. It dropped to $74 early last month, a 40% drop. It recently moved up to $117. What is critical about Palantir and AMD is that they are remarkably healthy companies with growing revenue and what appear to be successful models, unlike the .com companies of 2000 and 2002. Nevertheless, their shares collapsed. If there is a massive market sell-off, it would happen for one of two reasons. The first is that the huge bet on AI falters. It could. Companies could get “out over their skis.” Meta (NASDAQ: META) says it will invest $50 billion to $75 billion in AI this year. Microsoft has pegged its investment at $80 billion for the same period. AI is supposed to change the world. Many public companies with prospects driven by AI investments are supposed to have tremendous revenue growth unless they don’t. The other threat to the market is hyperinflation. Inflation rose to 14% in 1979. If there is a similar problem this year, it will be because of tariffs, which could be as high as 100% on Chinese goods. The inflationary problem would ripple across the US economy in months. Sixty percent of US adults own stocks. That statistic says everything. The post The Stock Market Crash That Could Ruin Everything appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Wall Street&#039;s Tariff Warning 2:29 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Goldman Sachs has published a note, warning that there is still another shoe yet to drop in the trade wars. The Wall Street firm still predicts the fallout from the tariff wars to be significant despite the progress made between the U.S. and Beijing. The firm wrote: “The large reduction in the U.S. tariff rate on China should only have a limited impact on the overall U.S. effective tariff rate. After accounting for a reduction of that magnitude, the full set of U.S. tariffs would still be considerably higher and broader than expected by markets at the start of the year.” Economic Data 11:29 am by Gerelyn Terzo A bevy of economic data is also due out this week, which could influence the direction of stocks, especially after the Q1 GDP slowdown. On Tuesday, the latest CPI data will be released, a key inflation gauge for the economy. In March, the CPI index fell by a surprising 0.1%. Additionally, retail sales are due out on Thursday. Winners &amp; Losers 10:03 am by Gerelyn Terzo NRG Energy (NYSE: NRG) is gaining 14% today after surpassing Q1 earnings estimates. In a bullish sign for natural gas, NRG also announced it would acquire the LS Power Portfolio in a whopping $12 billion transaction. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) is losing 5% on a falling gold price as investors flee the precious metal for equities in response to the U.S. and China trade talk success. J.B. Hunt Transport (Nasdaq: JBHT) is rising 10.2% today. Transportation stocks are often viewed as a barometer for economic activity. Dividend stock Altria Group (NYSE: MO) is off 3.2% on the day. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. A China-U.S. trade agreement has unleashed the stock market bulls, leading to a 1,000-point advance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Technology stocks are among the top performers, sending the Nasdaq Composite soaring by 3.8% and the S&amp;P 500 higher by 2.7%. Magnificent Seven stocks are joining in on today&#8217;s rally, while nearly all sectors of the economy are flashing green. The SPY ETF is adding 2.5% today as the broader market narrows its year-to-date decline to 1.3%. After concluding delicate negotiations over the weekend, the White House and Beijing officials have reached a temporary deal to lower the lofty tariffs, giving the markets enough details for a risk-on rally. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described a strategic decoupling from basic items made by China, agreeing to suspend tariffs for 90 days with the nation except for a wider-based 10% levy threshold.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Goldman&#039;s Warning 2:30 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs believes there&#8217;s still another shoe yet to drop in the trade wars despite progress made between the White House and Beijing. The analyst firm wrote: “The large reduction in the U.S. tariff rate on China should only have a limited impact on the overall U.S. effective tariff rate. After accounting for a reduction of that magnitude, the full set of U.S. tariffs would still be considerably higher and broader than expected by markets at the start of the year.” Winners &amp; Losers 12:12 pm by Gerelyn Terzo With today&#8217;s market rally, the S&amp;P 500 has narrowed its year-to-date declines to 1.3%. Within the S&amp;P 500, today&#8217;s biggest gainers include NRG Energy (NYSE: NRG), up 23%, Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE: SWK), up 14.4%, and Microchip Tech (Nasdaq: MCHP), up 11.2%. Among the biggest losers of today&#8217;s session include Cigna Group (NYSE: CI), down 6.7%, Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM), down 6.2%), and CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), down 4.6%. Stock Market Movers 10:30 am by Gerelyn Terzo NRG Energy (NYSE: NRG) is climbing higher by 14% today after reporting better-than-anticipated Q1 earnings results. In a bullish sign for natural gas, NRG also revealed it would buy the LS Power Portfolio in a whopping $12 billion deal. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) is shaving 5% off its value on a declining gold price as investors exit the precious metal for equities in response to the U.S. and China trade talk success. J.B. Hunt Transport (Nasdaq: JBHT) is up by a strong 10.2% today. Transportation stocks are often viewed as a gauge of economic activity. Dividend stock Altria Group (NYSE: MO) is down 3.2% on the day. Dollar General (NYSE: DG) is losing 5%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Risk is back on in the stock market after U.S. and China officials were able to clinch a trade deal over the weekend, agreeing to lower tariffs from staggeringly high levels. President Trump has been dropping further details, calling the discussions a &#8220;total reset&#8221; with China, pointing to further business with the nation and the removal of trade barriers as a result. Tariff relief has ignited a 1,000-point rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Technology stocks are among the top performers, sending the Nasdaq Composite soaring by 3.8% and the S&amp;P 500 higher by 2.7%. The SPX index is tacking on 2.5% in today&#8217;s buying action. The S&amp;P 500 index is now hovering back above the 5,800 level. Magnificent Seven stocks have been at the crosshairs of the China trade tensions and are rallying on the tariff relief. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the U.S. is targeting a strategic decoupling from necessities made by China, agreeing to suspend tariffs for 90 days with the nation except for a wider-based 10% levy threshold. Merger Monday is back.

    "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended The Magnificent 7 Could See Even More Upside 11:38 am While today’s 1,000-point Dow rally has been impressive, similar days may be ahead. When the U.S. and China meet again in the next few weeks, they’ll work out a bigger agreement on trade. While nothing has been set in stone with that just yet, markets are still celebrating today’s trade breakthrough. Here’s where that currently stands. Under the 90-day pause, both countries lowered tariffs by 115 percentage points to 10%. The 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remains in place, so most Chinese goods face a 30% rate in total, down from 145% previously, as noted by CNBC. The Magnificent 7 Are Just Starting to Rally Back 10:50 am As of May, the Magnificent 7 lost about $6 trillion in value since their peak in late 2024. Also, at its trough, the Roundhill BIG Tech ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS) – which tracks the Magnificent 7 plummeted from about $56 to a low of $39. However, thanks to the latest U.S.-China news, the ETF is quickly rebounding higher. Making the Mag 7 even more attractive, analysts believe they can easily beat the S&amp;P 500 in earnings this year. Plus, with valuations off their 2024 peaks, investors are coming back to the table to feast. The U.S. and China have finally agreed to a temporary – but significant easing of tariffs. In fact, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. tariffs on China will drop 115 percentage points to 30%. China’s levies on U.S. imports will drop to 10%. More information on specifics can be found in the Joint Statement on U.S. China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva at WhiteHouse.gov. As a result of the agreement, the Dow Jones is up about 1,050 points. The NASDAQ is up 663, as the S&amp;P 500 adds 156 points. Even better, it’s boosting the Magnificent 7 stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is up 5.6%, or $11.25. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up 1%, or by $4.80. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) is up about 3%, or by $4.71. com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is up 7.4% or by $14.55. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up 4%, or by $4.80. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) I up 6.5%, or by $38.73. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is up 7%, or by $21.23.
