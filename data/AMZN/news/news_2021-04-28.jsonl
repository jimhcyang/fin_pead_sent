(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), unveiled that The Walt Disney Company is leveraging AWS for the global rollout of Disney+, one of the largest online streaming video services in the world. The Walt Disney Company relies on AWS as its preferred public cloud infrastructure provider to support the explosive growth of Disney+, which quickly surpassed 100 million subscribers only 16 months after launch in November 2019. Leveraging AWS’s fault-tolerant, highly performant infrastructure, The Walt Disney Company has been able to rapidly expand Disney+ to 59 countries across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. Disney+ is expanding its use of AWS’s industry-leading services to include more than 50 technologies, such as machine learning, database, storage, content delivery, serverless, and analytics. For example, Disney+ uses Amazon Kinesis (a service that makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data) and Amazon DynamoDB (AWS’s key-value database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale with built-in encryption and data recovery) to ingest content, metadata, and billions of customer actions each day, which enables viewers to add content to their Watch Lists, and start watching a video and pick it up on a different device, or make recommendations for what to watch next. Disney+ also uses Amazon Timestream (AWS’s serverless, time-series database built for large scale ingestion, storage, and real-time querying of times-series data) to monitor the efficacy of their streaming platform to ensure that users continue to have access to the highest quality video content. After announcing the intent to launch a dedicated streaming service in August of 2017, The Walt Disney Company spent a year laying the foundation for the streaming service. Leveraging a flexible, secured cloud video infrastructure powered by AWS, Disney+ was able to handle more than 10 million new Disney+ sign-ups within 24 hours of its November 12, 2019 launch. In order to meet consumers’ high expectations and handle the enormous global scale required, technologists behind Disney+ collaborated closely with AWS to balance loads and handle usage spikes to manage the huge peaks in demand from viewers for premium content like Hamilton, Mulan, and The Mandalorian. “Disney+ has completely reinvented what’s possible in content delivery by challenging convention and using cloud technology to build a streaming product from scratch that had never been launched and marketed before on such a global scale,” said Joe Inzerillo, executive vice president & CTO, direct-to-consumer, The Walt Disney Company. “AWS has been our preferred cloud provider for years, and its proven global infrastructure and expansive suite of services has contributed meaningfully to the incredible success of Disney+.” “Disney+ brings beloved characters and timeless stories to a global audience through world-class direct-to-consumer video services,” said Carla Stratfold, vice president of AWS global and strategic accounts at Amazon Web Services, Inc. “Only AWS’s proven global infrastructure and unparalleled set of capabilities deliver the reliability, scalability, and breadth of functionality to power one of the world’s most exciting streaming services and its expansion around the world. We look forward to continuing to provide comprehensive cloud capabilities and expertise to The Walt Disney Company to help them reinvent streaming entertainment for Disney fans globally.” About Amazon Web Services For over 15 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced the general availability of Amazon Nimble Studio, a new service that enables customers to set up a content production studio in hours instead of weeks, with elasticity that gives them near limitless scale and access to rendering on demand. With Amazon Nimble Studio, customers can rapidly onboard and collaborate with artists from anywhere in the world, and produce content faster and more cost effectively. Artists will have access to accelerated virtual workstations, high-speed storage, and scalable rendering across AWS’s global infrastructure so they can create content faster. There are no upfront fees or commitments to use Amazon Nimble Studio, and customers pay only for the underlying AWS services used. To get started, visit: https://aws.amazon.com/nimble-studio/ To bring high-quality visual effects, animation, and creative content to life, studios historically have relied on local high-performance workstations connected to shared file storage systems over low-latency, on-premises networks. Increased consumer appetite for premium content and experiences has driven greater demand for compute-intensive rendering of visual effects and animations. This ever-growing demand causes content production studios to over-provision their compute, networking, and storage infrastructure for peak capacity, which proves expensive, difficult to manage, and hard to scale. For example, a typical animated feature film now generates 730 terabytes of data and up to half a billion files, requiring more than 150 million core compute hours and coordination from hundreds of artists and engineers. Consumer demand for more content has also required studios to onboard talent from around the world, who then require high-powered workstations, specialized software, and high-speed storage and networking. All of these constraints can result in production delays, increased expenses, and lost opportunity for content production studios. Using Amazon Nimble Studio, customers can create a new content production studio in just a few hours. The creative talent then has immediate access to high performance workstations powered by Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) G4dn instances with NVIDIA Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), shared file storage from Amazon FSx, and ultra low-latency streaming via the AWS global network. Amazon Nimble Studio gives content production studios the ability to start with as few resources as needed, scale up those resources when rendering demands peak, and spin them back down once projects are completed. Content production studios can onboard remote teams from around the world and provide them access to just the right amount of high performance infrastructure for only as long as needed—all without having to procure, set up, and manage local workstations, file systems, and low-latency networking. Amazon Nimble Studio supports both the Windows and Linux operating systems so that artists can work with their preferred third-party creative applications. Additionally, studios can use custom software applications and bring them into Amazon Nimble Studio via Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), ensuring a seamless migration from on-premises to cloud infrastructure. Amazon Nimble Studio is the latest AWS solution for media and entertainment customers, joining the AWS Thinkbox Deadline render management application as a core capability supporting content production. Media and entertainment leaders like Discovery, Disney, EuroSport, Formula 1, FOX, HBO Max, Peacock and Weta Digital use purpose-built AWS solutions that help content creators, rights holders, producers, and distributors accelerate reinvention across five key industry business areas: content production, direct-to-consumer and over-the-top (OTT) streaming, broadcast, media supply chain and archive, and data science and analytics. “Amazon Nimble Studio is going to change the way customers produce content using a cloud-based production pipeline,” said Kyle Roche, Head of Content Production Tech, AWS. “To date, studios struggle to keep up with the ever-increasing demand for creative content, which has driven an exponential increase in the computing power required to produce content—hastening obsolescence of workstations and straining on-premises storage and rendering capacity. We are excited to announce Amazon Nimble Studio, a transformational new service for the creative community built for the cloud to make it much faster, easier, and less expensive to produce the content that consumers want to watch.” Amazon Nimble Studio is available today in six AWS Regions and AWS Local Zones: US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon) Region, Canada (Central) Region, Europe (London) Region, Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region, and US Local Zone (Los Angeles), with additional region support coming soon. Anjekumi connects gamers and enables them to play games from anywhere in the world using next generation devices. “Amazon Nimble Studio allows us to concentrate on the creative result rather than the technical journey as it solves some key issues in our production pipeline,” said Kurt Rauer, CEO, Anjekumi. “Our business is a global one and with Amazon Nimble Studio we are able to engage creative people globally without the associated friction.” The California State University is a public university system in California with 23 campuses. “As the largest public higher education system in the nation, the California State University system pride ourselves on having an innovative mindset in Media & Entertainment education, empowering a majority-minority, diverse student population,” said Dina Ibrahim, Executive Director, San Francisco State University. “AWS is a perfect partner to represent a path forward for our creative programs, as we look to moving more of our education experience to the cloud in the near future, and solutions like Amazon Nimble Studio provide our students with easier, hands-on access to the latest tools in content creation technology, which better positions them for success in their careers.” Evil Eye Pictures is an Oscar and Emmy award-winning animation, visual effects, and design studio based in San Francisco, CA. “We like to go beyond the traditional and embrace emerging technologies that support innovative storytelling,” said Dan Rosen, Co-founder and Executive Creative Director, Evil Eye Pictures. “Adding Amazon Nimble Studio to our arsenal will allow us to more easily scale up and down with projects, and collaborate with the best talent, regardless of where they are located.\" Shomen Productions is a virtual animation and VFX studio that taps a global talent pool to create branded content. “We believe the future of production is dispersed teams and agile studios. Geographical access to a ready pool of talent is no longer an obstacle to creativity,” said James Bennett, Founder and Director of VFX & Animation, Shomen Productions. “A production solution like Amazon Nimble Studio allows your team to scale production resources at will and collaborate efficiently across vast distances. There is tremendous power in the ability to collaborate remotely with creatives who are spread across the world as easily as if they where sitting next to you. We believe Amazon Nimble Studio will be as impactful to creative production as iTunes was to the music industry.” Sinking Ship Entertainment is an Emmy award-winning production and new media company based in Toronto. “We’ve been eagerly following the development of Amazon Nimble Studio and look forward to adding it to our workflow,” said Shervin Shahidi, Director of Digital Transformation, Sinking Ship Entertainment. “It will bring dynamic elasticity to our capabilities and allow us to expand our talent pool to include artists worldwide.” Spire Animation Studios is a new feature animation studio. “Spire Animation was formed to empower world-class creative and technical talent to develop diverse, high-end animated entertainment for global audiences,” said Brad Lewis, Co-Founder and Chief Creative Officer, Spire Animation Studios. “By harnessing next-gen technology, like Amazon Nimble Studio and real-time game engines, we’re reimagining the content production process, even if our artists aren’t based in the same location.” Today, AWS also announced AWS for Media & Entertainment, an initiative that makes it easier for industry customers to discover, implement, and deploy purpose-built AWS capabilities and partner solutions for their highest priority workloads—enabling them to create compelling content faster, invent new customer experiences, expand direct-to-consumer offerings, and improve media supply chain efficiency. AWS for Media & Entertainment aligns the broadest and deepest set of industry-specific cloud capabilities, including purpose-built media and creative services, hardware, solutions, tools, and partners. AWS for Media & Entertainment also establishes dedicated resources across each industry solution area to help customers accelerate time to value, aligning AWS internal resources, AWS Professional Services, and 400+ industry-specific Independent Software Vendor (ISVs) Partners and 100+ System Integrators (SIs).

Amazon ranked first on LinkedIn’s Top Companies list, an annual list that identifies the most sought-after places to work. Using data from LinkedIn’s 740 million members, LinkedIn’s Top Companies list is designed to help professionals identify the best companies to grow their careers. LinkedIn’s methodology evaluates how companies attract and retain the best talent, including through promotions, funding opportunities for employees to learn new skills, gender diversity, and hiring people from all backgrounds and levels of education. LinkedIn also looked at how much recruiters from other companies search for employees currently working at Amazon. “Being Earth’s Most Customer-Centric company and Earth’s Best Employer are two sides of the same coin—we’re able to obsess over customers because we’ve created a great work environment for our employees. I believe one of the biggest reasons that people want to work at Amazon is our culture of innovation. We are inventors at heart and provide our employees with an opportunity to think big and try things that have never been done before,” said Beth Galetti, Amazon’s Senior Vice President of People eXperience and Technology at Amazon. “A huge thanks to our teams around the world for playing their part in making Amazon a great place to work.” In 2020, Amazon created more than 400,000 jobs in the U.S. and 500,000 globally. Here are some figures on our job-creation efforts and the innovative and safe work environment that we strive to create for our employees: We received more than 30 million job applications for roles at Amazon in 2020, almost double the number from 2019. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve done more than 240,000 virtual interviews with candidates for corporate and tech roles. Of the 400,000 people we hired in 2020 across our U.S. operations network, 45% were previously unemployed. Nearly 30,000 joined Amazon from the manufacturing sector, another 19,000 from traditional retail, and 16,500 from education and healthcare. More than 60% of the people who joined Amazon’s customer fulfillment network in 2020 are now paid more than they were paid in their previous job. Every Amazon job comes with a starting pay of at least $15 an hour, more than twice the federal minimum wage. In 2020, we promoted more than 68,000 employees globally, and 93% of Amazon new hires last year cited our company-funded skills training programs as a reason to stay at Amazon. Amazon is investing $700 million in upskilling 100,000 employees in the U.S. by 2025 so they can access in-demand and higher-paying jobs. Amazon currently employs more than 950,000 people in the U.S. at its headquarters in the Puget Sound region in Washington state and in Arlington, Virginia; the Amazon campus in Nashville, Tennessee; its 18 Tech Hubs; and the company’s growing network of logistics, retail, and data center facilities across more than 40 states. Amazon currently has more than 30,000 positions open in the U.S. For four consecutive years, LinkedIn has ranked Amazon among the top three companies in the U.S. where Americans want to work. Additionally, Amazon currently ranks No. 2 on the World’s Best Employers list from Forbes and on Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies list. Amazon was also selected by Fast Company as one of the Best Workplaces for Innovators. Amazon was awarded a top score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index, which recognizes the best workplaces for the LGBTQ+ community, and awarded the Lee Anderson Veteran and Military Spouse Employment Award for excellence in hiring, training, and retaining veterans, transitioning service members, and military spouses. Amazon was also named as a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion by the Disability Equality Index. For more information about LinkedIn’s ranking and their methodology, see here.
