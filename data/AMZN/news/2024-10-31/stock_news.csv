Microsoft’s 10-Year Market Smashing Results Here’s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2018. Share Price Revenues Net Income 2014 $46.16 $86.83 $22.07 2015 $46.70 $93.58 $12.19 2016 $56.21 $91.15 $20.54 2017 $72.26 $96.57 $25.49 2018 $108.04 $110.36 $16.57 2019 $138.06 $125.84 $39.24 2020 $205.01 $143.02 $44.28 2021 $286.50 $168.09 $61.27 2022 $276.41 $198.27 $72.74 2023 $330.72 $211.92 $72.36 TTM $465.39 $279.99 $86.18 Revenue and net income in $billions In the last decade, Microsoft’s revenue grew 222% while its net income went from $22.07 billion to over $86 billion (in the trailing 12 months). A big driver of profits over the past decade was Microsoft’s Intelligence cloud business, which grew 18% annually and drove operating profits of $37.88 billion in 2023 from $8.44 billion in 2014. As Microsoft looks to the second of the decade, a few key areas will determine its performance. Key Drivers of Microsoft’s Stock Performance Productivity and Business Processes: Microsoft’s Office and Dynamics 365 solutions and its LinkedIn products currently make up around one-third of the company’s revenue. Office in particular holds a near monopoly in office productivity software and most 3rd party applications have embeds, making switching costs high for this business line. LinkedIn also does not have a solid competitor in the professional networking space. High growth rates in this segment, but Microsoft has the advantage of controlling its price on its high market share products. Intelligence Cloud: Microsoft’s Azure, OpenAI, GitHub, and SQL, among other cloud businesses, make up close to half of the company’s revenue. But the crown jewel is Azure which only makes up close to 30% of Microsoft’s revenue and grew 30% over the past year alone. The future of Microsoft will depend on Azure and its competition with Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS will determine which company will dominate the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and reward shareholders handsomely in the process. Personal Computing: Windows, gaming, search, and devices are currently 25% of Microsoft’s business and this segment is the most open to competitors eroding market share. Outside of Windows, which has a solidified market share (and is not likely to dwindle), Microsoft search and devices will be facing a steep uphill battle over the coming years. Its acquisition of Activision is a positive for its gaming line but personal computing will play an ancillary part in Microsoft’s future. Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus 1-year price target for Microsoft stock is $500.00, which is a 19.62% upside from today’s stock price of $417.98. Of all the analysts covering Microsoft, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.39 “Buy” rating. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month forecast projects Microsoft’s stock price to be $495. We see Azure continuing its 20+% growth and earnings per share coming in right at $11.80.

We expect the stock to still trade at a similar multiple next year, putting our estimate for the stock price for Microsoft at $548.00 in 2025, which is 31.11% higher than the stock is trading today. Going into 2026, we estimate the price to be $633.00, with small revenue gains but margins expanding and an EPS of $18.10. We expect to see Microsoft’s P/E ratio steep down slowly each year through 2030. The stock price estimate would represent a 51.44% gain over today’s share price of $417.98. Heading into 2027, we expect the stock price increase not to be as pronounced and earnings estimates of $20.40 per share, the stock price target for the year is $652.00. That is a 3% year-over-year gain from the previous year, but still up 55.99% from today’s stock price. When predicting more than 3 years out, we expect Microsoft’s P/E ratio to drop to 30x in 2028 but grow its top line 14%. In 2028, we have Microsoft’s revenue coming in around $420 billion and an EPS of $22.62 suggesting a stock price estimate at $678.00 or a gain of 62.21% over the current stock price. 24/7 Wall Street expects Microsoft to continue its 10% revenue growth again and to generate $12.30 per share of earnings.

The cash infusion was a much-needed lifeline for Rivian, with $3.7 billion in operating expenses in 2021 and only delivering 920 vehicles. The company also had backers in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Ford (NYSE:F), who held 260 million shares of Rivian collectively at IPO. But as the COVID lockdown investing frenzy died out, it left an SUV-sized hole in Rivian’s stock price, currently trading for $10.95 per share, down 85.96% since its IPO 3 years earlier. 24/7 Wall Street aims to provide readers with our assumptions about the stock prospects going forward, what growth we see in Rivian for the next several years, and what our best estimates are for Rivian’s stock price each year through 2030. Key Points in this Article: Key growth drivers include cost reduction in EV components and increased production capacity, targeting profitability by 2027. Rivian aims to cut material costs by 45% with the introduction of its Gen 2 platform by 2026.

Recent Rivian Stock Updates and News 11/11/2024 Investment firm Stifel has adjusted its price target for Rivian from $18.00 to $16.00 today. However, the firm maintains a “Buy” rating on the stock. Rivian’s stock price rose 1.9% today, trading as high as $10.80. 11/8/2024 Rivian suffered through a tough third quarter due to supply chain issues, as seen in the company’s recent Q3 earnings report. Even though Rivian managed to produce and deliver a significant number of vehicles, the high costs and low revenue led to a loss of nearly $30,000 per vehicle. 11/7/2024 Rivian is scheduled to report its Q3 earnings today after market close. With its recent supply chain issues impacting production, investors are concerned that the company may experience its first revenue decline since going public. 11/6/2024 Guggenheim’s equities researchers have decreased Rivian’s target price from $21.00 to $18.00 with a “buy” rating on the stock. 11/5/2024 Rivian is set to release its third-quarter financial results on November 7th. During the same quarter last year, Rivian reported a significant loss of $1.37 billion, equivalent to $1.44 per share. However, the company generated $1.34 billion in revenue and produced 16,304 vehicles. In the second quarter of this year, Rivian exceeded Wall Street’s expectations by posting a loss of $1.13 per share and automotive revenue or $1.16 billion. 10/29/2024 David Hasselhoff is back as Michael Knight in a new YouTube ad for Rivian. This special Halloween update from Rivian allows owners to dress up their electric vehicles in fun “costumes”, including a Knight Rider-inspired look, until November 4th. 10/25/2024 Rivian is introducing a new pre-owned sales program for its R1T and R1S models, offering consumers a more affordable entry point into owning an electric vehicle. 10/24/2024 Rivian’s stock price is rising because of positive news about Tesla’s recent performance, as investors are more optimistic about the electric vehicle market. 10/23/2024 Rivian’s stock is plummeting today following a Bloomberg report that highlighted 16 serious OSHA violations at the company’s Normal, Illinois factory over the past 21 months. These incidents included severe injuries like a cracked skull and an amputated finger, as well as employees experiencing adverse health effects from exposure to paint without adequate protection. 10/21/2024 RBC Capital has lowered its price target for Rivian from $15 to $14, but has maintained its “Sector Perform” rating for the company’s shares. Life and Business are Not Easy For an Automotive Start-Up The following is a table of Rivian’s revenues, operating income, and share price for the first few years as a public company. Here’s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2018. Share Price (End of Year) Revenues Operating Income 2021 $50.24 $55.0 ($4,220.0) 2022 $19.30 $1,658.0 ($6,856.0) 2023 $10.70 $4,434.0 ($5,739.0) TTM $15.35 $4,997.0 (5,790.0) Revenue and net income in $millions Now let’s take a look at Tesla in the first few years it manufactured and sold the Model S (the official launch of the Model S was June 22, 2012). Share Price (End of Year) Revenues Operating Income 2011 $2.24 $204.2 ($251.5) 2012 $2.25 $413.3 ($394.3) 2013 $16.87 $2,013.5 ($61.3) 2014 $13.81 $3,198.4 ($186.7) While revenue growth for both firms after launching their first mass-market vehicles is similar, Tesla’s operating expenses were much more favorable, particularly around SG&amp;A and R&amp;D expenses. Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, has always been a proponent of word-of-mouth marketing and a hawkish approach to minimizing product costs, allowing his company to stay afloat while moving to new lines of automobiles. The biggest question facing Rivian investors today is, can they lower costs, and when will positive net income be realized? Key Drivers of Rivian’s Future Stock Performance EV Technology and Cost Curves: Rivian’s next generation (G2) R1 vehicles are designed for performance upgrades while at the same time reducing component costs. For example, the number of electronic components will be reduced by 60%, over 60 parts will be eliminated, the compact motor will be redesigned, and close to 2000 connections or welds will be removed. These changes alone are expected to drop materials costs by 20% and speed up the assembly line by 30%. Looking into the back half of 2026, Rivian sees a material cost reduction of 45% for the R2 line of vehicles. Rivian is also investing in enhanced advanced driver assistance systems with improved cameras, radar, and NVIDIA-powered computing power, creating highway assist and 360-degree visibility. Electric Vehicle Demand and Incentives: Rivian is currently delivering around 13 thousand vehicles per quarter, which is above analyst estimates, and producing 9 thousand new G2 vehicles per quarter, which keeps it on pace to produce 57,000 units in 2024. The total plant capacity is 215,000 vehicles with expansion plans of 400,000 additional vehicles in Georgia. Management’s Path to Profits: Rivian also expects profitability from the R1 platform through premium configurations and scale benefits. The company targets positive adjusted EBITDA by 2027, with long-term goals of 25% gross margin, high teens adjusted EBITDA margin, and 10% FCF margin Material cost Reduction: The introduction of the Gen 2 platform and commercial cost downs are expected to reduce material costs by ~20%. Fixed Cost Reduction: Improved labor and overhead costs, reduced depreciation, and lower LCNRV charges due to a 30% increase in production line rate and design changes. Increased Revenue from Credits: Strong demand for regulatory credits, with over $200 million contracted for FY24. Rivian (RIVN) Stock vs. Tesla Stock: Why Rivian Receives Different Treatment Taking a historic look at pricing Rivian stock would start by comparing the sales multiples Tesla received in 2012 to 2015 when the Model S scaled. Tesla was feeling the weight of expansion and keeping its debt load manageable and the market-priced Tesla stock was close to 10x sales. While Rivian is in a similar situation, albeit with more debt and higher expanses, the market is only valuing the stock at under 3 times sales. Let’s take a look at why that is the case. Market Position and Brand Recognition: Tesla: By 2011-2015, Tesla had already established itself as a leading innovator in the electric vehicle (EV) market, with significant brand recognition and a first-mover advantage. Rivian: Rivian is relatively new to the market and still building its brand and market position. Production and Sales Volumes: Tesla: From 2011-2015, Tesla ramped up production and sales, particularly with the Model S, which was gaining popularity and market traction. Rivian: Rivian is still in the early stages of production, with limited sales volumes compared to Tesla’s growth phase. Investor Expectations and Sentiment: Tesla: Investors had high expectations for Tesla’s future growth and disruptive potential in the auto industry, leading to higher valuation multiples. Rivian: While Rivian has potential, it has not yet demonstrated the same level of market disruption or growth trajectory that Tesla did during its comparable early years. Competitive Landscape: Tesla: Had fewer direct competitors in the EV space during its early years, allowing for a larger market share and higher investor confidence. Rivian: Faces more competition from established automakers entering the EV market and other new entrants, impacting its relative valuation.

Of the 28 analysts covering the stock, the consensus recommendation is a 2.1 ‘Outperform’ Score. We expect to see strong revenue growth of 60% for the year and a price to sales multiple of 2x, which puts our price target at $21.82. Going into 2026, we estimate the price to be $33.72, with another strong 50%+ revenue bump. However, with EBITDA still well in the negative, we see the market not rewarding the stock as much and giving it a lower valuation multiple. Heading into 2027, we expect the stock price increase to leap forward to $64.30 with another strong 50%+ revenue growth year-over-year. That is a 97% year-over-year gain and up 487.21% from today’s stock price. When predicting more than 3 years out, we expect Rivian’s P/S ratio in 2028 to be 2.5x and top line growth of 50%. In 2028, we have Rivian’s revenue coming in around $25 billion, suggesting a stock price estimate at $95.00 or a gain of 767.58% over the current stock price. 24/7 Wall Street expects Rivian’s stock to continue its revenue growth and to generate $37 billion in revenue. The stock price in 2029 is estimated at $127.00, or a gain of 1059.82% over today’s price. Rivian Stocks Price Target for 2030 We estimate Rivian’s stock price to be $140.00 per share.

Today, Amazon stock trades for $206.35, which means that stock is up over 211324.18% since May 1997, turning every $1000 invested into $2.114 million today. The only thing that matters from this point on is what the stock will do for the next 1, 5, and 10 years and beyond. Let’s crunch the numbers and give you our best guest on Amazon’s future share price. No one has a crystal ball and even the Wall Street “experts” are often wrong more than they are right in predicting future stock prices. We will walk through our assumptions and provide you with the story around the numbers (other sites just pick a share price without explaining why they suggest the price they do). Key Points in this Article: Future stock performance hinges on Amazon’s growth in e-commerce, AWS, and advertising amidst increasing competition.

Recent Amazon Stock Updates and News 11/12/2024- Amazon confirmed that a recent cyberattack has exposed sensitive data from its employees. The breach was facilitated through a third-party property management vendor. The threat actor, known as “Nam3L3ss”, is a prominent figure in the cybercrime world. They leaked over 2.8 lines of Amazon employee data on BreachForums, alongside data from 25 other major organizations. 11/11/2024- Amazon is in the process of developing a new tool for its delivery drivers: smart eyeglasses. These glasses are intended to help drivers with turn-by-turn navigation to hopefully shave time off deliveries. 11/8/2024- Amazon’s stock price dipped slightly today, falling 0.8% during midday trading, reaching as low as $208.29. Trading volume was much lower than usual, with only about 7.8 million shares changing hands compared to the average daily volume of over 41 million shares. 11/7/2024- Amazon’s recently approved delivery drone service has begun in the Phoenix metro area. The MK30 drones can deliver packages weighing 5 pounds or less, but only during daylight hours. 11/6/2024- Recent speculation has suggested that Amazon’s new five-day in-office mandate is a veiled attempt to downsize its workforce or fulfill a deal with local governments. However, CEO Andy Jassy has emphasized that the company’s decision is unrelated to either theory. 11/5/2024- The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved Amazon’s new delivery drones. These new drones are smaller and can fly beyond the visual line of sight of pilots. 11/4/2024- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) denied Amazon’s request to draw more power from a nearby Pennsylvania nuclear plant. This decision could hinder efforts by Amazon and other tech giants to secure additional energy from nuclear sources to fuel their growing AI operations. 10/31/2024- Amazon released its third-quarter financial report today, reporting numbers beyond Wall Street expectations. The company reported a revenue of $158.9 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $157.2 billion. Earnings per share came in at $1.43 compared to the $1.16 anticipated by Bloomberg analysts. 10/28/2024- Tom Hoggett, the driving force behind Amazon’s rapid grocery expansion, has left the company to become the Chief Operating Officer of Wonder, a food hall startup. 10/25/2024- Amazon’s third-quarter earnings report is scheduled for release next Thursday (October 31st). Investors are eager to see if the company can deliver results that meet their expectations this time around, especially after a mixed performance in the second quarter. Amazon’s Recent Stock Success Here’s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2017. Share Price Revenues* Net Income* 2014 $19.94 $89.0 ($.241) 2015 $15.63 $107.0 $.596 2016 $32.81 $136.0 $2.371 2017 $37.90 $177.9 $3.03 2018 $58.60 $232.9 $10.07 2019 $73.26 $280.5 $11.59 2020 $93.75 $386.1 $21.33 2021 $163.50 $469.8 $33.36 2022 $167.55 $514.0 ($2.72) 2023 $85.46 $574.78 $30.42 *Revenue and Net Income in Billions In the last decade, Amazon’s revenue grew about 540% while its net income moved from losing money to 30.42 billion in profits this past year. The ride up wasn’t always smooth, however. For example, in 2020, sales jumped 38%, and net income nearly doubled. 2021 saw a continued boom as people moved to e-commerce shopping during Covid. However, all those sales being “pulled forward” led to challenges in 2022, and the company swung to a surprise loss. As Amazon embarks into the back half of the decade, a few different key areas will determine its performance. 3 Key Drivers of Amazon’s Stock Performance E-Commerce Success: While Covid brought record sales to Amazon, it also led to many competitors investing heavily to compete with Amazon online. While e-commerce is still just 15% of retail sales, putting up huge growth rates in online sales won’t be as easy in the coming years as it was a decade ago. Amazon Web Services: Amazon Web Services 1st quarter 2024 revenue was $25.04 billion and the unit should break $100 billion in total sales this year. However, the unit’s 13% year-over-year growth isn’t as fast as competing cloud services like Microsoft’s (Nasdaq: MSFT) Azure and Google’s (Nasdaq: GOOGL) Cloud. Amazon is at risk of falling behind Microsoft before 2030 if it can’t stop market share losses. Advertising: Amazon exits 2023 with a $47 billion advertising business that grew 24% in 2023. Advertising has the ability to be another high-margin business line – Amazon currently gets most of its profits from its AWS cloud business – which has led the company past $100 billion in annual profits. Amazon (AMZN) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus 1-year price target for Amazon stock is $220.00, which is a 6.61% upside from today’s stock price of $206.35. Of all the analysts covering Amazon, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.37 “Buy” rating. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month forecast projects Amazon’s stock price to be $225. We see AWS continue its current 12% growth rate but see Amazon’s advertising business outperforming analyst expectations, particularly in the 4th quarter of 2024 with more streaming ad impressions being sold. Amazon (AMZN) Stock Forecast Through 2030 AWS: Assuming AWS stems its market share loss and investments in AI to counterbalance the threat from Microsoft and Google. E-Commerce: Amazon continues to pour investments into e-commerce, forgoing added profits to maintain market share. Our case model assumes growth in new logistics and efficiencies from robotics in warehouses leads to this unit finally delivering strong operating profits. Advertising: Amazon’s advertising continued to grow and the now $47 billion business unit and we see a high teens growth rate compounded annually. Add all these numbers up and take out some amount for “new bets” the company will surely be investing in (and a potential dividend boost)and we see revenue in 2030 at $1.15 trillion and $131 billion in net income. Today, the company trades for about 50X earnings, which we’ll take down to 35 times as the company matures (but continues showing growth). In our analysis, Amazon is worth $2.6 trillion in 2030. Here are our revenue, net income, and company size estimates through 2030: Revenue Net Income Total Enterprise Value 2024 $638 $48.56 $1.93 2025 $710 $62.13 $2.12 2026 $788 $79.68 $2.19 2027 $867 $96.53 $2.29 2028 $957 $114.17 $2.39 2029 $1,049 $136.69 $2.5 2030 $1,149 $131.39 $2.6 *Revenue and net income reported in billions and TEV in trillions Amazon’s Share Price Estimates 2025-2030 How Amazon’s Next 5 Years Could Play Out We expect to see revenue growth of just over 11% and EPS of $5.74 for 2025. We expect the stock to still trade at a similar multiple next year, putting our estimate for the stock price for Amazon at $287 in 2025, which is 39.08% higher than the stock is trading today. Going into 2026, we estimate the price to be $371, after revenue estimates to come in around 10% higher year-over-year. With an EPS of $7.42 and in our opinion the last year Amazon trades near its current P/E of 50, 2026 could mark the year Amazon starts trading at a more mature valuation closer to 35 times earnings. That would represent a 79.79% gain over today’s share price of $206.35. Heading into 2027, we expect the stock price increase not to be as pronounced as more tempered growth is expected from Amazon and even with earnings estimates of $8.80 per share, the stock price target for the year is $308.00. That is a 17% year hit from the previous year, but still up 49.26% from today’s stock price. When predicting more than 3 years out, we expect Amazon to continue growing its top line at 10% but be more efficient and operating margins to grow. In 2028, we have Amazon’s revenue coming in around $957 billion and an EPS of $10.34 suggesting a stock price estimate at $361.90 or a gain of 75.38% over the current stock price. 24/7 Wall Street expects Amazon to continue its 10% revenue growth again and to generate $12.30 per share of earnings. With a price-to-earnings multiple of 35, the stock price in 2029 is estimated at $430.50, or a gain of 108.63% over today’s price. Amazon Stocks Price Target for 2030 We estimate Amazon’s stock price to be $370 per share with 10% year-over-year revenue growth but compressed margins from more competition in its AWS unit. Our estimated stock price for Amazon will be 79.62% higher than the current stock price, marking a double in Amazon’s stock price today of 206.35. Year Price Target % Change From Current Price 2024 $226.50 Upside of 9.76% 2025 $287.00 Upside of 39.08% 2026 $371.00 Upside of 79.79% 2027 $308.00 Upside of 49.26% 2028 $361.90 Upside of 75.38% 2029 $430.50 Upside of 108.63% 2030 $370.65 Upside of 79.62% Sponsored: Attention Savvy Investors: Speak to 3 Financial Experts – FREE Ever wanted an extra set of eyes on an investment you’re considering?

Today, Amazon stock trades for $214.30, which means that stock is up over 219469.67% since May 1997, turning every $1000 invested into $2.196 million today. The only thing that matters from this point on is what the stock will do for the next 1, 5, and 10 years and beyond. Let’s crunch the numbers and give you our best guest on Amazon’s future share price. No one has a crystal ball and even the Wall Street “experts” are often wrong more than they are right in predicting future stock prices. We will walk through our assumptions and provide you with the story around the numbers (other sites just pick a share price without explaining why they suggest the price they do). Key Points in this Article: Future stock performance hinges on Amazon’s growth in e-commerce, AWS, and advertising amidst increasing competition. Amazon’s revenue grew 540% in the last decade, with net income rising to $30.42 billion in 2023 and projections over the next 5 years at 4.5x.

Recent Amazon Stock Updates and News 11/14/2024- Amazon has introduced a new mobile-only store, Amazon Haul, which is designed to appeal to shoppers seeking budget-friendly products. This new store offers a wide range of products priced under $20. 11/13/2024- Amazon is closing down its free video streaming service, Freevee. The content previously with the service will migrate over to Amazon Prime Video. 11/12/2024- Amazon confirmed that a recent cyberattack has exposed sensitive data from its employees. The breach was facilitated through a third-party property management vendor. The threat actor, known as “Nam3L3ss”, is a prominent figure in the cybercrime world. They leaked over 2.8 lines of Amazon employee data on BreachForums, alongside data from 25 other major organizations. 11/11/2024- Amazon is in the process of developing a new tool for its delivery drivers: smart eyeglasses. These glasses are intended to help drivers with turn-by-turn navigation to hopefully shave time off deliveries. 11/8/2024- Amazon’s stock price dipped slightly today, falling 0.8% during midday trading, reaching as low as $208.29. Trading volume was much lower than usual, with only about 7.8 million shares changing hands compared to the average daily volume of over 41 million shares. 11/7/2024- Amazon’s recently approved delivery drone service has begun in the Phoenix metro area. The MK30 drones can deliver packages weighing 5 pounds or less, but only during daylight hours. 11/6/2024- Recent speculation has suggested that Amazon’s new five-day in-office mandate is a veiled attempt to downsize its workforce or fulfill a deal with local governments. However, CEO Andy Jassy has emphasized that the company’s decision is unrelated to either theory. 11/5/2024- The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved Amazon’s new delivery drones. These new drones are smaller and can fly beyond the visual line of sight of pilots. 11/4/2024- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) denied Amazon’s request to draw more power from a nearby Pennsylvania nuclear plant. This decision could hinder efforts by Amazon and other tech giants to secure additional energy from nuclear sources to fuel their growing AI operations. 10/31/2024- Amazon released its third-quarter financial report today, reporting numbers beyond Wall Street expectations. The company reported a revenue of $158.9 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $157.2 billion. Earnings per share came in at $1.43 compared to the $1.16 anticipated by Bloomberg analysts. Amazon’s Recent Stock Success Here’s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2017. Share Price Revenues* Net Income* 2014 $19.94 $89.0 ($.241) 2015 $15.63 $107.0 $.596 2016 $32.81 $136.0 $2.371 2017 $37.90 $177.9 $3.03 2018 $58.60 $232.9 $10.07 2019 $73.26 $280.5 $11.59 2020 $93.75 $386.1 $21.33 2021 $163.50 $469.8 $33.36 2022 $167.55 $514.0 ($2.72) 2023 $85.46 $574.78 $30.42 *Revenue and Net Income in Billions In the last decade, Amazon’s revenue grew about 540% while its net income moved from losing money to 30.42 billion in profits this past year. The ride up wasn’t always smooth, however. For example, in 2020, sales jumped 38%, and net income nearly doubled. 2021 saw a continued boom as people moved to e-commerce shopping during Covid. However, all those sales being “pulled forward” led to challenges in 2022, and the company swung to a surprise loss. As Amazon embarks into the back half of the decade, a few different key areas will determine its performance. 3 Key Drivers of Amazon’s Stock Performance E-Commerce Success: While Covid brought record sales to Amazon, it also led to many competitors investing heavily to compete with Amazon online. While e-commerce is still just 15% of retail sales, putting up huge growth rates in online sales won’t be as easy in the coming years as it was a decade ago. Amazon Web Services: Amazon Web Services 1st quarter 2024 revenue was $25.04 billion and the unit should break $100 billion in total sales this year. However, the unit’s 13% year-over-year growth isn’t as fast as competing cloud services like Microsoft’s (Nasdaq: MSFT) Azure and Google’s (Nasdaq: GOOGL) Cloud. Amazon is at risk of falling behind Microsoft before 2030 if it can’t stop market share losses. Advertising: Amazon exits 2023 with a $47 billion advertising business that grew 24% in 2023. Advertising has the ability to be another high-margin business line – Amazon currently gets most of its profits from its AWS cloud business – which has led the company past $100 billion in annual profits. Amazon (AMZN) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus 1-year price target for Amazon stock is $220.00, which is a 2.66% upside from today’s stock price of $214.30. Of all the analysts covering Amazon, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.37 “Buy” rating. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month forecast projects Amazon’s stock price to be $225. We see AWS continue its current 12% growth rate but see Amazon’s advertising business outperforming analyst expectations, particularly in the 4th quarter of 2024 with more streaming ad impressions being sold. Amazon (AMZN) Stock Forecast Through 2030 AWS: Assuming AWS stems its market share loss and investments in AI to counterbalance the threat from Microsoft and Google. E-Commerce: Amazon continues to pour investments into e-commerce, forgoing added profits to maintain market share. Our case model assumes growth in new logistics and efficiencies from robotics in warehouses leads to this unit finally delivering strong operating profits. Advertising: Amazon’s advertising continued to grow and the now $47 billion business unit and we see a high teens growth rate compounded annually. Add all these numbers up and take out some amount for “new bets” the company will surely be investing in (and a potential dividend boost)and we see revenue in 2030 at $1.15 trillion and $131 billion in net income. Today, the company trades for about 50X earnings, which we’ll take down to 35 times as the company matures (but continues showing growth). In our analysis, Amazon is worth $2.6 trillion in 2030. Here are our revenue, net income, and company size estimates through 2030: Revenue Net Income Total Enterprise Value 2024 $638 $48.56 $1.93 2025 $710 $62.13 $2.12 2026 $788 $79.68 $2.19 2027 $867 $96.53 $2.29 2028 $957 $114.17 $2.39 2029 $1,049 $136.69 $2.5 2030 $1,149 $131.39 $2.6 *Revenue and net income reported in billions and TEV in trillions Amazon’s Share Price Estimates 2025-2030 How Amazon’s Next 5 Years Could Play Out We expect to see revenue growth of just over 11% and EPS of $5.74 for 2025. We expect the stock to still trade at a similar multiple next year, putting our estimate for the stock price for Amazon at $287 in 2025, which is 33.92% higher than the stock is trading today. Going into 2026, we estimate the price to be $371, after revenue estimates to come in around 10% higher year-over-year. With an EPS of $7.42 and in our opinion the last year Amazon trades near its current P/E of 50, 2026 could mark the year Amazon starts trading at a more mature valuation closer to 35 times earnings. That would represent a 73.12% gain over today’s share price of $214.30. Heading into 2027, we expect the stock price increase not to be as pronounced as more tempered growth is expected from Amazon and even with earnings estimates of $8.80 per share, the stock price target for the year is $308.00. That is a 17% year hit from the previous year, but still up 43.72% from today’s stock price. When predicting more than 3 years out, we expect Amazon to continue growing its top line at 10% but be more efficient and operating margins to grow. In 2028, we have Amazon’s revenue coming in around $957 billion and an EPS of $10.34 suggesting a stock price estimate at $361.90 or a gain of 68.88% over the current stock price. 24/7 Wall Street expects Amazon to continue its 10% revenue growth again and to generate $12.30 per share of earnings. With a price-to-earnings multiple of 35, the stock price in 2029 is estimated at $430.50, or a gain of 100.89% over today’s price. Amazon Stocks Price Target for 2030 We estimate Amazon’s stock price to be $370 per share with 10% year-over-year revenue growth but compressed margins from more competition in its AWS unit. Our estimated stock price for Amazon will be 72.96% higher than the current stock price, marking a double in Amazon’s stock price today of $214.30. Year Price Target % Change From Current Price 2024 $226.50 Upside of 5.69% 2025 $287.00 Upside of 33.92% 2026 $371.00 Upside of 73.12% 2027 $308.00 Upside of 43.72% 2028 $361.90 Upside of 68.88% 2029 $430.50 Upside of 100.89% 2030 $370.65 Upside of 72.96% Is Your Money Earning the Best Possible Rate?

Microsoft stock has been a millionaire maker for decades, with a stock split-adjusted IPO price of $0.14, which means at today’s stock price of $425.35, the stock is up 437053.13%. That would have turned a $1000 investment at Microsoft’s IPO into $4.37 million today. As one of the most valuable companies in the world, the only thing investors focus on is what the stock will do over the coming years. Wall Street analysts only go as far as 1 year out when giving a stock prediction. But long-term investors want to know where Microsoft might be several years down the road. 24/7 Wall Street aims to give you our assumptions on the stock and provide our insights around the numbers coming from Microsoft and which markets the company is operating in that are most exciting to us.

Recent Microsoft Stock Updates and News 11/14/2024 Microsoft is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for potential anti-competitive behavior in its cloud computing business. The FTC is concerned that Microsoft might be using its dominant position in productivity software to unfairly limit customers’ choices, particularly with the company’s cloud services making it difficult for customers to switch to other cloud providers. 11/12/2024 Despite a broader market downturn today, Microsoft rose 1.20% to $423.03. 11/11/2024 Isabell Sheang has rejoined Microsoft as a group product marketing and go-to product manager.

CLT is a fire-resistant wood material that can greatly lower carbon emissions compared to traditional materials like steel and concrete. By using CLT, Microsoft aims to cut carbon emissions by 35% and reduce greenhouse emissions by 65%. 11/7/2024 Released three years ago, Windows II now accounts for 35.55% of the market.

Microsoft’s 10-Year Market Smashing Results Here’s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2018. Share Price Revenues Net Income 2014 $46.16 $86.83 $22.07 2015 $46.70 $93.58 $12.19 2016 $56.21 $91.15 $20.54 2017 $72.26 $96.57 $25.49 2018 $108.04 $110.36 $16.57 2019 $138.06 $125.84 $39.24 2020 $205.01 $143.02 $44.28 2021 $286.50 $168.09 $61.27 2022 $276.41 $198.27 $72.74 2023 $330.72 $211.92 $72.36 TTM $465.39 $279.99 $86.18 Revenue and net income in $billions In the last decade, Microsoft’s revenue grew 222% while its net income went from $22.07 billion to over $86 billion (in the trailing 12 months). A big driver of profits over the past decade was Microsoft’s Intelligence cloud business, which grew 18% annually and drove operating profits of $37.88 billion in 2023 from $8.44 billion in 2014. As Microsoft looks to the second of the decade, a few key areas will determine its performance. Key Drivers of Microsoft’s Stock Performance Productivity and Business Processes: Microsoft’s Office and Dynamics 365 solutions and its LinkedIn products currently make up around one-third of the company’s revenue. Office in particular holds a near monopoly in office productivity software and most 3rd party applications have embeds, making switching costs high for this business line. LinkedIn also does not have a solid competitor in the professional networking space. High growth rates in this segment, but Microsoft has the advantage of controlling its price on its high market share products. Intelligence Cloud: Microsoft’s Azure, OpenAI, GitHub, and SQL, among other cloud businesses, make up close to half of the company’s revenue. But the crown jewel is Azure which only makes up close to 30% of Microsoft’s revenue and grew 30% over the past year alone. The future of Microsoft will depend on Azure and its competition with Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS will determine which company will dominate the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and reward shareholders handsomely in the process. Personal Computing: Windows, gaming, search, and devices are currently 25% of Microsoft’s business and this segment is the most open to competitors eroding market share. Outside of Windows, which has a solidified market share (and is not likely to dwindle), Microsoft search and devices will be facing a steep uphill battle over the coming years. Its acquisition of Activision is a positive for its gaming line but personal computing will play an ancillary part in Microsoft’s future.
