    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and FORMULA 1 (F1) (NASDAQ: FWONA, FWONK) are introducing six new F1 Insights powered by AWS that will roll out through the 2021 racing season. The new additions mean a total of 18 AWS-powered stats will be available to fans by the end of the season. F1 Insights powered by AWS are real-time racing statistics, displayed as on-screen graphics, that transform the fan experience before, during, and after each race by providing the data and analysis fans need to interpret driver and team race strategy and performance. The first new stat, Braking Performance, will debut at the GRAND PRIX in Italy, April 16-18. The new set of statistics for 2021 will use a range of AWS technologies, including machine learning, to help fans better understand and highlight potential race outcomes and compare their favorite drivers and cars. For more information about AWS and its involvement with F1, including the 12 previously released F1 Insights, please visit: https://aws.amazon.com/f1/. F1 racing is a data-driven sport where much of the thrill for fans comes from poring over statistics before and after a race to gain a deeper understanding of driver and team decisions and cars’ performance on the track. F1 Insights powered by AWS add a new real-time dimension to statistics and place context around race data to help fans better appreciate key moments on the track. More than 300 sensors on each race car generate over 1.1 million data points per second that F1 transmits from the cars to the pit and onto AWS for processing. F1 relies on the breadth and depth of AWS services to stream and analyze that flood of data as it’s generated, and then present it in a meaningful way for TV and online viewers around the world through the F1 Insights. The first F1 Insight to be introduced this season, Braking Performance, shows how a driver’s braking style during a cornering maneuver can deliver an advantage coming out of the corner. When executed well, braking optimizes a car’s speed through the phases of cornering and enables the driver to gain a better position on the track. This stat displays and compares drivers’ braking styles and performance by measuring how closely they approach the apex of a corner before braking. In addition, it will show the key performance metrics that lead to how the car and driver perform together when cornering, such as top speed on approach, speed decrease through braking, the braking power (KWH) utilized, and the immense G-forces drivers undergo while cornering. Braking Performance builds on the existing Corner Analysis statistic, which shows how cars physically perform while cornering. Braking Performance and the other five new F1 Insights powered by AWS (detailed below) will debut as on-screen graphics from April through December this season. Each new stat offers fans more visibility into the split-second action on the track and the decision-making behind the pit wall. Car Exploitation shows fans when F1 drivers are pushing their cars to performance limits in areas like tire traction, braking, acceleration, and maneuvering during key points in a race. The stat reveals the data in real-time by displaying a car’s current performance during a race compared to a theoretical performance limit, and then calculates the time gained or lost per lap as a result. The stat debuts June 11-13 at the FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN GRAND PRIX DU CANADA 2021. Energy Usage provides insights into how the high-tech engines powering F1 cars utilize energy during a race, including when teams unleash energy to overtake another car. The stat demonstrates energy flows through each component of the advanced F1 engine, known as the Power Unit, and shows how much battery energy is left at any given moment in a race. The F1 engine propels a vehicle by using a combination of internal combustion and hybrid systems that recover energy from braking and from the turbo charger. However, there are limits to the Power Unit’s energy storage capacity and the amount of energy that can move through it during each race lap. Race teams track this data to help maximize their car’s performance at key moments in a race, determining when to deploy energy in steady streams to achieve the best lap times or unleash it in focused moments to gain or maintain position when battling another driver. Energy Usage allows fans to see those decisions in real time. The stat debuts July 16-18 at the FORMULA 1 PIRELLI BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2021. Start Analysis displays which driver was the quickest on the pedal and picked the perfect line, as well as which drivers struggled off the starting grid and why. Achieving the perfect start is a core driver skill, and Start Analysis will help fans understand how a driver’s decisions earn or sacrifice an early advantage in the race. The stat debuts September 10-12 at the FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN GRAN PREMIO D’ITALIA 2021. Pitlane Performance analyzes pit stop performance, adding excitement to the portion of the race that takes place behind the pit wall. Pit stops are an essential and precisely coordinated, but time-draining element of an F1 race. Pitlane Performance offers insights beyond a car’s stationary stop time, like unpacking how the driver and team perform during each step of a pit stop in the pitlane and highlighting total pitlane time lost or gained due to how efficiently the team works. The stat debuts October 8-10 at the FORMULA 1 JAPANESE GRAND PRIX 2021. Undercut Threat helps fans anticipate which cars are at risk of being overtaken as the result of an “undercut.” The undercut is an F1 race strategy where a chasing driver enters the pit for fresh tires with the expectation that improved lap time resulting from the new tires will allow the driver to overtake the car in front once that car has pitted. F1 introduced a similar stat, Pit Strategy Battle, in June 2020 to highlight an undercut battle as it happens and help fans assess in real time how successful each driver’s strategy will be. Undercut Threat adds a new layer of predictive insight by analyzing race performance before either car has pitted, adding to fan excitement and the sense of jeopardy around potential action to come. It visualizes data on gaps between cars, average pit loss time, and tire performance to help identify which cars are at risk. The stat debuts November 19-21 at the FORMULA 1 ROLEX AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX 2021. To create the new insights, F1 uses historical race data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and combines it with live data streamed from F1 race cars and trackside sensors to AWS through Amazon Kinesis, a service for real-time data collection, processing, and analysis. F1 engineers and scientists will use this data to leverage machine learning models with Amazon SageMaker, AWS’s service that helps developers and data scientists build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly in the cloud and at the edge. F1 is able to analyze race performance metrics in real-time by deploying those machine learning models on AWS Lambda, which is a serverless compute service that can run code without the need to provision or manage servers. All of the insights will be integrated into the races’ international broadcast feeds around the globe, including F1’s digital platform, F1TV, helping fans to understand the split-second decisions and race strategies made by drivers or teams that can dramatically affect a race outcome. “F1 Insights Powered by AWS give fans an insider’s view of how car, driver, and team function together so that they can better appreciate the action on the track,” said Rob Smedley, chief engineer of FORMULA 1. “With this new set of racing statistics for 2021, we are going deeper than ever before. New Insights like Braking Performance and Undercut Threat peel back additional layers of race strategies and performance and use advanced visualizations to make the sport of racing even more understandable and exciting. Race car technology improves all the time, and thanks to AWS, our fans can appreciate how that technology impacts race outcomes.” “Data has become a critical piece of the story for modern sports, and for F1—where literally each second on the track produces more than a million data points—they require a partner that can translate that raw data into meaning in real time. AWS enables F1 to analyze its troves of data at scale, make better and more informed decisions, and bring fans closer to every phase of action on the track, from the starting grid, to cornering, to pitting,” said Darren Mowry, director of business development at AWS EMEA SARL. “The world’s premier sports organizations are using AWS to build data-driven solutions and reinvent the way sports are watched, played, and managed. Our work with F1 demonstrates how advanced stats can elevate the fan experience by revealing the tactics and strategies behind even the most seemingly straightforward elements of a race.” For news on how AWS is helping F1 develop the next-generation race car, visit: https://aws.amazon.com/f1/news/.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aujourd’hui, Amazon Web Services (AWS), société d’Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ : AMZN), et FORMULA 1 (F1) (NASDAQ : FWONA, FWONK) lancent six nouveaux Renseignements F1 alimentés par AWS, qui seront déployés tout au long de la saison de course 2021. Ces nouveaux ajouts permettront de rendre disponibles 18 statistiques alimentées par AWS pour les fans de F1 d’ici la fin de la saison. Les Renseignements F1 alimentés par AWS sont des statistiques de course en temps réel, affichées sur des graphiques à l’écran, qui transforment l’expérience des fans avant, pendant et après chaque course, en fournissant les données et analyses dont les fans ont besoin pour interpréter la stratégie ainsi que les performances de course des pilotes et des équipes. La première nouvelle statistique, Performance de freinage, sera lancée à l’occasion du GRAND PRIX d’Italie, du 16 au 18 avril. Le nouvel ensemble de statistiques pour 2021 s’appuiera sur un éventail de technologies AWS, notamment l’apprentissage machine, afin d’aider les fans à mieux comprendre et mettre en valeur les éventuels résultats de course, ainsi qu’à comparer leurs véhicules et pilotes favoris. Pour en savoir plus sur AWS et son implication aux côtés de F1, notamment sur les 12 Renseignements F1 précédemment lancés, rendez-vous sur : https://aws.amazon.com/f1/. La course de F1 est un sport basé sur les données, dans le cadre duquel les fans éprouvent beaucoup de plaisir à étudier de près les statistiques avant et après la course, afin de mieux comprendre les décisions des équipes et des pilotes, ainsi que les performances des véhicules sur la piste. Les Renseignements F1 alimentés par AWS ajoutent une nouvelle dimension en temps réel aux statistiques, et fournissent un contexte autour des données de course afin d’aider les fans à mieux apprécier les moments clés sur la piste. Plus de 300 capteurs sur chaque véhicule de course génèrent plus de 1,1 million de points de données par seconde, que F1 transmet depuis les véhicules vers le stand et sur AWS pour traitement. F1 s’appuie sur la portée et l’étendue des services AWS pour diffuser et analyser ces flux de données au moment où ils sont générés, puis les présente de manière utile aux téléspectateurs et spectateurs en ligne à travers le monde via les Renseignements F1. Le premier Renseignement F1 présenté cette saison, la Performance de freinage, révèle comment le style de freinage d’un pilote lors d’une négociation de virage peut générer un avantage à la sortie du virage. Lorsque le freinage est bien exécuté, il optimise la vitesse du véhicule pendant les phases de virage, et permet au pilote d’obtenir une meilleure position sur la piste. Cette statistique présente et compare les styles et performances de freinage des pilotes, en mesurant la distance à laquelle ils s’approchent du sommet du virage avant de freiner. En outre, cette statistique révélera des indicateurs de performance clés permettant de connaître les performances conjointes du véhicule et du pilote dans les virages, telles que la vitesse maximale en approche, la diminution de vitesse au freinage, la puissance de freinage (KWH) utilisée, et l’immense force G subie par les pilotes dans les virages. La Performance de freinage s’appuie sur la statistique existante d’Analyse des virages, qui révèle la performance physique des véhicules dans les virages. La Performance de freinage et les cinq autres nouveaux Renseignements F1 alimentés par AWS (détaillés ci-dessous) seront lancés en tant que graphiques à l’écran entre le mois d’avril et le mois de décembre cette saison. Chaque nouvelle statistique offre aux fans davantage de visibilité sur les actions effectuées en une fraction de seconde sur la piste, ainsi que sur les décisions prises dans les coulisses des stands. L’Exploitation du véhicule révèle aux fans le moment auquel les pilotes de F1 repoussent les limites de performance de leur véhicule dans des domaines tels que la traction des pneus, le freinage, l’accélération et le pilotage aux étapes clés de la course. La statistique fournit des données en temps réel, en affichant la performance actuelle d’un véhicule pendant la course en comparaison avec une limite de performance théorique, puis calcule le temps gagné ou perdu par tour qui en résulte. La statistique sera lancée du 11 au 13 juin à l’occasion du FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN GRAND PRIX DU CANADA 2021. L’Utilisation énergétique fournit des renseignements sur la manière dont les moteurs de haute technologie alimentant les véhicules de F1 utilisent l’énergie pendant une course, notamment lorsque les équipes libèrent de l’énergie pour doubler un autre véhicule. La statistique indique les flux énergétiques de chaque composant du moteur F1 avancé, connu sous le nom de groupe motopropulseur, et révèle la quantité d’énergie restante dans la batterie à tout moment pendant la course. Le moteur F1 propulse le véhicule en utilisant une combinaison de systèmes de combustion interne et de systèmes hybrides qui récupèrent de l’énergie au freinage ainsi qu’à partir du turbocompresseur. La capacité de stockage énergétique du groupe motopropulseur présente néanmoins des limites, tout comme la quantité d’énergie qui peut y circuler à chaque tour de course. Les équipes de course suivent ces données afin de maximiser la performance de leur véhicule aux étapes clés de la course, en déterminant à quel moment déployer de l’énergie en flux continu afin d’atteindre les meilleurs temps de tour, ou libérer de l’énergie dans des moments clés afin de gagner ou maintenir une place lors d’une lutte avec un autre pilote. L’Utilisation énergétique permet aux fans de découvrir ces décisions en temps réel. La statistique sera lancée du 16 au 18 juillet à l’occasion du FORMULA 1 PIRELLI BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2021. L’Analyse au départ révèle le pilote qui a été le plus rapide sur la pédale et qui a choisi la ligne parfaite, ainsi que le pilote qui a rencontré des difficultés sur la grille de départ, et en explique les raisons. L’exécution d’un départ parfait constitue une compétence clé pour un pilote, et la statistique Analyse au départ aidera les fans à comprendre comment les décisions d’un pilote permettent d’obtenir ou de sacrifier un avantage précoce dans la course. La statistique sera lancée du 10 au 12 septembre à l’occasion du FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN GRAN PREMIO D’ITALIA 2021. La Performance sur la voie des stands analyse la performance à l’arrêt au stand, ce qui ajoute du piment à la portion de la course qui a lieu dans les coulisses des stands. Bien que les arrêts au stand soient indispensables et coordonnés avec précision, ils constituent une perte de temps dans une course de F1. La Performance sur la voie des stands offre des renseignements en plus de la durée d’arrêt stationnaire du véhicule, tels que les performances du pilote et de l’équipe à chaque étape d’un arrêt au stand sur la voie des stands, ainsi que le temps total perdu ou gagné sur la voie des stands en fonction de l’efficacité du travail de l’équipe. La statistique sera lancée du 8 au 10 octobre à l’occasion du FORMULA 1 JAPANESE GRAND PRIX 2021. La Menace d’undercut aide les fans à anticiper quels véhicules risquent d’être doublés suite à un « undercut ». L’undercut est une stratégie de course de F1 qui consiste pour un pilote en poursuivant un autre à faire un arrêt au stand pour profiter de pneus neufs, en espérant que l’amélioration du temps de tour obtenue grâce à ses nouveaux pneus lui permettra de doubler le véhicule devant lui lorsque ce dernier s’arrêtera au stand. F1 a lancé une statistique similaire, la Bataille stratégique sur le stand, en juin 2020 afin de mettre en valeur immédiatement les batailles d’undercut, et d’aider les fans à évaluer en temps réel la réussite de la stratégie de chaque pilote. La Menace d’undercut offre un nouveau degré de renseignements prédictifs, en analysant la performance de course avant que les véhicules ne se soient arrêtés au stand, ajoutant pour les fans du piment et ce sentiment de risque autour des éventuelles actions à venir. La statistique permet de visualiser les données sur les écarts entre les véhicules, le temps moyen perdu au stand et la performance des pneus, afin d’identifier les véhicules en danger. La statistique sera lancée du 19 au 21 novembre à l’occasion du FORMULA 1 ROLEX AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX 2021. Afin de créer ces nouveaux renseignements, F1 utilise les données de course historiques stockées dans Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), et les combine aux données en temps réel qui sont transmises à partir des véhicules de course F1 et des capteurs de bords de piste vers AWS via Amazon Kinesis, service de collecte, de traitement et d’analyse de données en temps réel. Les ingénieurs et scientifiques de F1 utiliseront ces données pour exploiter des modèles d’apprentissage machine avec Amazon SageMaker, service d’AWS qui aide les développeurs et scientifiques de données à concevoir, entraîner et déployer rapidement des modèles d’apprentissage machine dans le cloud et en périphérie. F1 est capable d’analyser des indicateurs de performance de course en temps réel en déployant ces modèles d’apprentissage machine sur AWS Lambda, service de calcul sans serveur qui peut exécuter des codes sans avoir à fournir ou à gérer des serveurs. Tous les renseignements seront intégrés aux flux de diffusion internationaux des courses à travers le monde, notamment la plateforme numérique de F1, F1TV, afin de permettre aux fans de comprendre les décisions instantanées et les stratégies de course prises par les pilotes ou les équipes, qui influent sensiblement sur les résultats de la course. « Les Renseignements F1 alimentés par AWS offrent aux fans une vision de l’intérieur sur la manière dont le véhicule, le pilote et l’équipe fonctionnent ensemble, afin qu’ils puissent mieux apprécier l’action sur la piste », a déclaré Rob Smedley, ingénieur en chef chez FORMULA 1. « Grâce à ce nouvel ensemble de statistiques de course pour la saison 2021, nous approfondissons les choses plus que jamais auparavant. Les nouveaux Renseignements tels que la Performance de freinage et la Menace d’undercut dévoilent davantage les stratégies et performances de course, et utilisent des visualisations avancées afin de rendre le sport automobile encore plus compréhensible et passionnant. La technologie des véhicules de course s’améliore en permanence, et grâce à AWS, nos fans peuvent découvrir à quel point la technologie influe sur les résultats des courses. » « Les données sont devenues un élément crucial dans l’histoire des sports modernes, et la F1 — où littéralement chaque seconde sur la piste produit plus d’un million de points de données — nécessite un partenaire capable de transformer en temps réel ces données brutes en informations utiles. AWS permet à F1 d’analyser sa multitude de données à grande échelle, de prendre des décisions plus pertinentes et plus informées, et de rapprocher les fans de chaque phase d’action sur la piste, de la grille de départ aux phases de virage, en passant par les arrêts au stand », a déclaré Darren Mowry, directeur du développement commercial chez AWS EMEA SARL. « Les principales organisations sportives mondiales utilisent AWS pour élaborer des solutions basées sur les données, et réinventer la manière dont les sports sont visionnés, pratiqués et gérés. Notre travail aux côtés de F1 prouve à quel point les statistiques avancées peuvent enrichir l’expérience des fans, en révélant les tactiques et stratégies qui se cachent derrière les éléments de la course les plus simples en apparence. » Pour découvrir les actualités sur la manière dont AWS aide F1 à concevoir le véhicule de course de nouvelle génération, rendez-vous sur : https://aws.amazon.com/f1/news/.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hoy, Amazon Web Services (AWS), una empresa de Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), y FÓRMULA 1 (F1) (NASDAQ: FWONA, FWONK) presentan seis análisis nuevos de F1 con tecnología de AWS que se darán a conocer en la temporada de carreras de 2021. Las nuevas incorporaciones suman un total de 18 estadísticas con tecnología de AWS, que estarán disponibles para los seguidores al final de la temporada. Los análisis de F1 con tecnología de AWS consisten en estadísticas de carreras en tiempo real, que se muestran como gráficos en pantalla y transforman la experiencia de los seguidores antes, durante y después de cada carrera al proporcionar datos y análisis necesarios para interpretar la estrategia y el desempeño del piloto y del equipo. La primera estadística nueva, Desempeño de frenado, debutará en el GRAN PREMIO en Italia, del 16 al 18 de abril. El nuevo conjunto de estadísticas para 2021 utilizará una gama de tecnologías de AWS, entre ellas aprendizaje automático, para ayudar a los seguidores a comprender mejor y señalar los posibles resultados de carreras, además de comparar a sus pilotos y autos favoritos. Para obtener más información sobre AWS y su trabajo con Fórmula 1, incluidos los 12 análisis de F1 lanzados anteriormente, visite https://aws.amazon.com/f1/. Las carreras de F1 son un deporte basado en datos, en el que gran parte de la emoción de los seguidores proviene de estudiar las estadísticas antes y después de una carrera para comprender mejor las decisiones del piloto y del equipo, además del desempeño del auto en la pista. Los análisis de F1 con tecnología de AWS añaden una nueva dimensión en tiempo real a las estadísticas y contextualizan los datos de la carrera para ayudar a los seguidores a entender mejor los momentos clave en la pista. Más de 300 sensores en cada auto de carrera generan más de 1,1 millón de puntos de datos por segundo que F1 transmite desde los autos a los boxes y a AWS para su procesamiento. F1 depende del ancho y la profundidad de los servicios de AWS para transmitir y analizar el torrente de datos a medida que se genera y luego presentarlo de manera que tenga sentido para el público de televisión y en línea de todo el mundo a través de los análisis de F1. El primer análisis de F1 que se presentará esta temporada, Desempeño de frenado, muestra el modo en que el estilo de frenado de un piloto durante una maniobra de curva puede darle ventaja al salir de la curva. Cuando se ejecuta bien, el frenado optimiza la velocidad del auto en todas las fases de la curva y permite que el piloto obtenga una mejor posición en la pista. Esta estadística muestra y compara los estilos y el desempeño de frenado de los pilotos al medir cuánto se aproximan al ápice de una esquina antes de frenar. Además, mostrará las métricas clave de desempeño que permiten analizar el modo en que el auto y el piloto se desempeñan juntos al tomar una curva, como la velocidad máxima al aproximarse, la disminución de la velocidad en el frenado, la energía de frenado utilizada (KWH) y las enormes fuerzas de gravedad a las que los pilotos son sometidos en las curvas. La estadística de Desempeño de frenado se construye sobre el actual Análisis de curva, que muestra el desempeño físico de los autos al tomar curvas. El Desempeño de frenado y los cinco análisis de F1 con tecnología de AWS restantes (que se indican a continuación) debutarán como gráficos en pantalla de abril a diciembre esta temporada. Cada estadística nueva ofrece a los seguidores mayor visibilidad de la acción que ocurre en fracciones de segundo en las pistas y de la toma de decisiones detrás del muro de boxes. La Explotación del auto muestra a los seguidores cuando los pilotos de F1 llevan sus autos al límite de desempeño en áreas como tracción de neumático, frenado, aceleración y maniobras durante los puntos clave de una carrera. La estadística revela los datos en tiempo real mostrando el desempeño actual de un auto durante una carrera en comparación con un límite teórico de desempeño, y luego calcula el tiempo obtenido o perdido por vuelta como resultado. La estadística debuta del 11 al 13 de junio en el FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN GRAND PRIX DU CANADA 2021. El Consumo energético analiza el modo en que los motores de alta tecnología que impulsan a los autos de F1 consumen energía durante una carrera, incluido el momento en que los pilotos despliegan energía para adelantarse a otro auto. La estadística demuestra los flujos de energía en cada componente del motor de avanzada de F1, llamado unidad de potencia, y muestra cuánta energía queda en la batería en un momento dado de la carrera. El motor de F1 propulsa al vehículo utilizando una combinación de combustión interna y sistemas híbridos que recuperan energía del frenado y del turbocompresor. No obstante, existen límites en la capacidad de almacenamiento de energía de la unidad de potencia y la cantidad de energía que puede pasar por ella en cada vuelta de la carrera. Los equipos de automovilismo hacen seguimiento de estos datos para ayudar a maximizar el desempeño del auto en los momentos clave de una carrera, y determinan cuándo se debe utilizar energía en flujos estables para lograr la mejor marca de vuelta o desplegarla en momentos específicos para adelantar o mantener la posición en la contienda con otro piloto. El Consumo energético permite que los seguidores vean estas decisiones en tiempo real. La estadística debuta del 16 al 18 de julio en el FORMULA 1 PIRELLI BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2021. El Análisis de salida muestra qué piloto fue el más rápido con el acelerador y eligió la línea perfecta, y cuáles lucharon para dejar la parrilla de salida y por qué. Lograr una salida perfecta es una destreza central del piloto, y el Análisis de salida ayudará a los seguidores a entender de qué manera las decisiones de un piloto le dan o quitan ventaja tempranamente en la carrera. La estadística debuta del 10 al 12 de septiembre en el FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN GRAN PREMIO D’ITALIA 2021. El Desempeño en la calle de boxes analiza el desempeño de la parada en boxes y añade emoción a la parte de la carrera que se desarrolla detrás del muro de boxes. Las paradas en boxes son un factor fundamental y minuciosamente coordinado en una carrera de F1, pero requieren mucho tiempo. El Desempeño en la calle de boxes ofrece perspectivas que van más allá del tiempo de parada de un auto, como el análisis del desempeño del piloto y del equipo durante cada etapa de una parada en la calle de boxes, y la observación del tiempo total obtenido o perdido en la calle de boxes debido al nivel de eficiencia con que el equipo trabaja. La estadística debuta del 8 al 10 de octubre en el FORMULA 1 JAPANESE GRAND PRIX 2021. La Amenaza de undercut ayuda a los seguidores a prever qué autos corren riesgo de ser adelantados como resultado de un “undercut”. El undercut es una estrategia de F1 en la que un piloto que va detrás entra en boxes para cambiar sus neumáticos, con la expectativa de que los neumáticos nuevos le permitirán mejorar su marca por vuelta y así adelantarse al auto que le llevaba ventaja una vez que este haya entrado en boxes. F1 presentó una estadística similar, Batalla de estrategia en boxes, en junio de 2020, para señalar una batalla de undercut a medida que ocurre y ayudar a los seguidores a evaluar en tiempo real cuál será el éxito de la estrategia de cada piloto. La Amenaza de undercut añade una nueva capa de perspectiva predictiva al analizar el desempeño de la carrera antes de que ambos autos entren en boxes, aumentando la emoción de los seguidores y el sentido del riesgo en torno al posible desarrollo de una acción. Visualiza datos sobre los espacios de separación entre autos, el promedio de tiempo perdido en boxes y el desempeño de los neumáticos para ayudar a identificar qué autos corren riesgo. La estadística debuta del 19 al 21 de noviembre en el FORMULA 1 ROLEX AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX 2021. Para crear los análisis nuevos, F1 utiliza datos históricos de carreras almacenados en el servicio de almacenamiento simple de Amazon (Amazon Simple Storage Service, Amazon S3) y los combina con datos en vivo transmitidos a AWS desde sensores que se encuentran en los autos de carreras de F1 y junto a la pista mediante Amazon Kinesis, un servicio para recopilación, procesamiento y análisis de datos en tiempo real. Los ingenieros y científicos de F1 utilizarán estos datos para aplicar modelos de aprendizaje automático con Amazon SageMaker, el servicio de AWS que ayuda a desarrolladores y analistas de datos a crear, entrenar e implementar rápidamente modelos de aprendizaje automático en la nube y en el extremo. F1 puede analizar parámetros de desempeño de las carreras en tiempo real al implementar dichos modelos de aprendizaje automático en AWS Lambda, un servicio de computación sin servidores que puede ejecutar el código sin necesidad de abastecer ni administrar servidores. Todos los análisis se integrarán a la señal de entrada internacional de las carreras en todo el mundo, incluida la plataforma digital de F1, F1TV, que ayuda a los seguidores a entender las estrategias y las decisiones que toman los pilotos o los equipos en fracciones de segundo y que pueden afectar drásticamente el resultado de la carrera. “Los análisis de F1 con tecnología de AWS brindan a los seguidores una perspectiva íntima del funcionamiento conjunto del auto, el piloto y el equipo para poder comprender mejor la acción en la pista”, dijo Rob Smedley, ingeniero en jefe de FÓRMULA 1. “Con este conjunto nuevo de estadísticas de carreras para 2021, llegamos más lejos que nunca. Los análisis nuevos, como el Desempeño de frenado y la Amenaza de undercut, desmenuzan capas adicionales de la estrategia y el desempeño en las carreras y utilizan visualizaciones de avanzada para que el deporte del automovilismo sea aún más fácil de entender y más emocionante. La tecnología de los autos de carrera es cada vez mejor, y gracias a AWS nuestros seguidores pueden advertir de qué manera esa tecnología impacta en los resultados de la carrera. “Los datos se han convertido en un aspecto fundamental del deporte moderno, y en el caso de F1, en donde cada segundo en las pistas genera más de un millón de puntos de datos, exigen un socio que pueda traducir los datos sin procesar para obtener significado en tiempo real. AWS hace posible que F1 analice su riqueza de datos a escala, tome mejores decisiones y más basadas en información y acerque más a los seguidores a cada etapa de la acción en la pista, desde la parrilla de salida y la toma de curvas hasta los boxes”, dijo Darren Mowry, director de desarrollo empresarial de AWS EMEA SARL. “Las principales organizaciones deportivas del mundo están utilizando AWS para desarrollar soluciones basadas en datos y reinventar el modo en que miramos, jugamos y gestionamos los deportes. Nuestro trabajo con F1 muestra la manera en que las estadísticas de avanzada pueden exaltar la experiencia de los seguidores al revelar las tácticas y estrategias que están detrás de cada aspecto de una carrera, incluso el que parece más sencillo”.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services (AWS), ein Unternehmen von Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), und FORMEL 1 (F1) (NASDAQ: FWONA, FWONK) präsentieren heute sechs neue F1 Insights powered by AWS, die bis zur Rennsaison 2021 eingeführt werden. Mit den neuen Ergänzungen werden den Fans bis zum Ende der Saison insgesamt 18 AWS-gestützte Statistiken zur Verfügung stehen. F1 Insights powered by AWS sind Echtzeit-Rennstatistiken, die in Form von Grafiken auf dem Bildschirm angezeigt werden und das Erlebnis der Fans vor, während und nach jedem Rennen verändern, indem sie die Daten und Analysen zur Verfügung stellen, die die Fans zur Auslegung der Rennstrategie und Leistung von Fahrern und Teams brauchen. Die erste neue Statistik, Braking Performance, wird beim GRAND PRIX in Italien vom 16. bis 18. April neu auf den Markt kommen. Der neue Satz von Statistiken für 2021 wird eine Reihe von AWS-Technologien, darunter Machine Learning, verwenden, um den Fans zu helfen, mögliche Rennergebnisse besser zu verstehen und hervorzuheben und ihre Lieblingsfahrer und -autos zu vergleichen. Nähere Informationen über AWS und seine Beteiligung an der Formel 1, einschließlich der 12 zuvor veröffentlichten F1 Insights, finden Sie unter: https://aws.amazon.com/f1/. Die Formel 1 ist ein datengesteuerter Sport, bei dem es für die Fans besonders spannend ist, vor und nach einem Rennen Statistiken durchzugehen, um ein tieferes Verständnis der Entscheidungen von Fahrern und Teams sowie der Leistung der Autos auf der Strecke zu erlangen. F1 Insights powered by AWS verleiht den Statistiken eine neue Echtzeitdimension und bringt die Renndaten in den richtigen Kontext, um den Fans zu helfen, Schlüsselmomente auf der Rennstrecke besser zu verstehen. An jedem Rennwagen erzeugen über 300 Sensoren mehr als 1,1 Millionen Datenpunkte pro Sekunde, die F1 von den Autos an die Box und zur Verarbeitung an AWS überträgt. Die Formel 1 vertraut auf die Breite und Tiefe der Dienstleistungen von AWS, um diese Datenflut zu streamen und zu analysieren, während sie erzeugt wird, und sie dann für Fernseh- und Online-Zuschauer auf der ganzen Welt durch die F1 Insights auf sinnvolle Weise zu präsentieren. Das erste F1 Insight, das in dieser Saison eingeführt wird, Braking Performance, verdeutlicht, wie der Bremsstil eines Fahrers während eines Kurvenmanövers beim Verlassen einer Kurve von Vorteil sein kann. Bei guter Ausführung optimiert das Bremsen die Geschwindigkeit des Autos in den Phasen der Kurvenfahrt und erlaubt es dem Fahrer, eine bessere Position auf der Strecke zu erlangen. Indem die Statistik anzeigt und vergleicht, wie nah sich die Fahrer dem Scheitelpunkt einer Kurve nähern, bevor sie bremsen, werden die Bremsstile und die Leistung der Fahrer dargestellt. Außerdem werden die wichtigsten Leistungsmetriken gezeigt, die das Zusammenspiel von Auto und Fahrer bei der Kurvenfahrt bestimmen, wie z. B. die Höchstgeschwindigkeit bei der Annäherung, die Geschwindigkeitsabnahme beim Bremsen, die eingesetzte Bremsleistung (KWH) und die immensen G-Kräfte, denen der Fahrer bei der Kurvenfahrt ausgesetzt ist. Braking Performance stützt sich auf die bestehende Statistik Corner Analysis, die das physikalische Verhalten von Autos bei Kurvenfahrten darstellt. Braking Performance und die anderen fünf neuen F1 Insights powered by AWS (siehe unten) werden in dieser Saison von April bis Dezember als Grafiken auf dem Bildschirm eingeführt. Jede neue Statistik gewährt den Fans einen größeren Einblick in die sekundenschnelle Action auf der Strecke und die Entscheidungsfindung hinter der Boxenmauer. Car Exploitation zeigt den Fans, wann die F1-Fahrer ihre Autos während der Schlüsselpunkte eines Rennens in Bereichen wie Reifentraktion, Bremsen, Beschleunigung und Manövrieren an die Leistungsgrenze bringen. Die Statistik stellt die Daten in Echtzeit dar, indem sie die aktuelle Leistung eines Autos während eines Rennens verglichen mit einem theoretischen Leistungslimit aufzeigt und dann die dadurch gewonnene oder verlorene Zeit pro Runde berechnet. Die Statistik debütiert vom 11. bis 13. Juni beim FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN GRAND PRIX DU CANADA 2021. Energy Usage gibt Aufschluss darüber, wie die Hightech-Motoren der F1-Autos während eines Rennens Energie verbrauchen, auch dann, wenn die Teams Energie freisetzen, um ein anderes Auto zu überholen. Die Statistik zeigt die Energieflüsse durch jede Komponente des fortschrittlichen F1-Motors, der so genannten Power Unit, und gibt an, wie viel Batterieenergie zu jedem beliebigen Zeitpunkt eines Rennens noch vorhanden ist. Der F1-Motor betreibt ein Fahrzeug mit einer Kombination aus interner Verbrennung und Hybridsystemen, die Energie vom Bremsen und vom Turbolader zurückgewinnen. Allerdings gibt es Grenzen für die Energiespeicherkapazität der Power Unit und die Energiemenge, die während einer Rennrunde durch sie fließen kann. Rennteams erfassen diese Daten, damit sie die Leistung ihres Autos in Schlüsselmomenten eines Rennens maximieren können, und entscheiden, wann sie die Energie in gleichmäßigen Strömen einsetzen, um die besten Rundenzeiten zu erzielen, oder sie in konzentrierten Momenten freisetzen, um die Position zu gewinnen oder zu halten, wenn sie sich mit einem anderen Fahrer anlegen. Energy Usage erlaubt es den Fans, diese Entscheidungen in Echtzeit zu sehen. Die Statistik kommt erstmals vom 16. bis 18. Juli beim FORMULA 1 PIRELLI BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2021 zum Einsatz. Die Startanalyse zeigt an, welcher Fahrer auf dem Pedal am schnellsten war und die perfekte Linie gewählt hat, sowie welche Fahrer in der Startaufstellung zu kämpfen hatten und weshalb. Den perfekten Start zu schaffen, ist eine der Kernfähigkeiten eines Fahrers, und die Startanalyse wird den Fans dabei helfen, zu verstehen, wie die Entscheidungen eines Fahrers einen frühen Vorteil im Rennen verdienen oder opfern. Die Statistik wird vom 10. bis 12. September beim FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN GRAN PREMIO D'ITALIA 2021 erstmals vorgestellt. Pitlane Performance analysiert die Performance im Boxenstopp und sorgt so für zusätzliche Spannung in dem Teil des Rennens, der sich hinter der Boxenmauer abspielt. Boxenstopps sind ein essenzielles und präzise koordiniertes, aber auch ein zeitintensives Element eines F1-Rennens. Pitlane Performance liefert Einblicke jenseits der stationären Stoppzeit eines Autos, wie z. B. die Leistung des Fahrers und des Teams während jedes Schrittes eines Boxenstopps in der Boxengasse, und beleuchtet die insgesamt verlorene oder gewonnene Zeit in der Boxengasse, je nachdem, wie effizient das Team arbeitet. Die Statistik wird erstmals vom 8. bis 10. Oktober beim FORMULA 1 JAPANESE GRAND PRIX 2021 vorgestellt. Undercut Threat unterstützt die Fans dabei, vorauszusehen, welche Autos in Gefahr sind, als Ergebnis eines „Undercuts“ überholt zu werden. Der Undercut ist eine F1-Rennstrategie, bei der ein Fahrer, der auf der Verfolgung ist, in die Box einfährt, um frische Reifen zu holen, in der Erwartung, dass die verbesserte Rundenzeit, die sich aus den neuen Reifen ergibt, es dem Fahrer ermöglicht, das Auto vor ihm zu überholen, sobald dieses Auto in der Box ist. Im Juni 2020 führte die Formel 1 eine ähnliche Statistik, Pit Strategy Battle, ein, um ein Undercut Ballte zu markieren, während sie stattfindet, und den Fans dabei zu helfen, in Echtzeit einschätzen zu können, wie erfolgreich die Strategie der einzelnen Fahrer sein wird. Undercut Threat bringt eine neue Ebene der Vorhersage ins Spiel, indem es die Rennleistung analysiert, bevor eines der beiden Autos in die Box kommt, und so die Spannung der Fans und das Gefühl der Gefährdung durch mögliche kommende Geschehnisse erhöht. Es stellt Daten über die Abstände zwischen den Autos, die durchschnittliche Boxenausfallzeit und die Reifenleistung visuell dar, sodass man erkennen kann, welche Autos gefährdet sind. Die Statistik wird erstmals vom 19. bis 21. November beim FORMULA 1 ROLEX AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX 2021 eingesetzt. Um diese neuen Erkenntnisse zu gewinnen, wird die Formel 1 historische Renndaten nutzen, die auf dem Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) gespeichert sind, kombiniert mit Live-Daten, die von Sensoren an F1-Rennwagen und von der Rennstrecke über Amazon Kinesis, einem Dienst zur Echtzeit-Datenerfassung, -verarbeitung und -analyse, gestreamt werden. F1-Ingenieure und -Wissenschaftler werden diese Daten dazu nutzen, Modelle für Machine Learning mit Amazon SageMaker zu nutzen, einer Dienstleistung von AWS, die Entwickler und Datenwissenschaftler dabei unterstützt, Modelle für Machine Learning schnell in der Cloud und am Edge zu erstellen, zu trainieren und bereitzustellen. F1 ist in der Lage, Renn-Performance-Metriken in Echtzeit zu analysieren, indem es diese ML-Modelle auf AWS Lambda einsetzt, was eine serverlose Dienstleistung ist, auf der Code ohne die Notwendigkeit der Bereitstellung oder des Managements von Servern ausgeführt werden kann. Alle Erkenntnisse werden in die internationale Übertragung der Rennen rund um den Globus, einschließlich der digitalen Plattform von F1, F1TV, integriert und helfen den Fans, die sekundenschnellen Entscheidungen und Rennstrategien von Fahrern oder Teamstrategen zu verstehen, die den Ausgang eines Rennens dramatisch beeinflussen können. „F1 Insights Powered by AWS ermöglicht den Fans einen Einblick darüber, wie Auto, Fahrer und Team zusammenspielen, damit sie das Geschehen auf der Strecke besser einschätzen können“, sagt Rob Smedley, Chief Engineer von FORMEL 1. „Mit diesem neuen Satz von Rennstatistiken für 2021 tauchen wir tiefer ein als je zuvor. Neue Einblicke wie Braking Performance und Undercut Threat legen zusätzliche Schichten von Rennstrategien und Performance frei und nutzen fortschrittliche Visualisierungen, um den Rennsport noch verständlicher und spannender zu machen. Die Technologie der Rennwagen verbessert sich kontinuierlich, und dank AWS können unsere Fans verstehen, wie sich diese Technologie auf die Ergebnisse der Rennen auswirkt.“ „Daten sind zu einem wesentlichen Teil der Geschichte des modernen Sports geworden, und für die Formel 1 – wo wortwörtlich jede Sekunde auf der Strecke mehr als eine Million Datenpunkte erzeugt – brauchen wir einen Partner, der diese Rohdaten in Echtzeit in Bedeutung übersetzen kann. AWS macht es der Formel 1 möglich, ihre Datenmengen in großem Umfang zu analysieren, bessere und besser informierte Entscheidungen zu fällen und die Fans näher an jede Phase des Geschehens auf der Strecke heranzubringen, von der Startaufstellung über die Kurvenfahrt bis zum Boxenstopp“, sagt Darren Mowry, Director of Business Development bei AWS EMEA SARL. „Die führenden Sportunternehmen der Welt verwenden AWS, um datengesteuerte Lösungen zu entwickeln und die Art neu zu erfinden, wie Sport beobachtet, gespielt und verwaltet wird. Unsere Arbeit mit der Formel 1 demonstriert, wie fortschrittliche Statistiken das Erlebnis der Fans verbessern können, indem sie die Taktiken und Strategien hinter den scheinbar einfachsten Elementen eines Rennens aufdecken.“ Nachrichten darüber, wie AWS die Formel 1 bei der Entwicklung des Rennwagens der nächsten Generation unterstützt, finden Sie unter: https://aws.amazon.com/f1/news/.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hoje, Amazon Web Services (AWS), uma empresa Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), e FORMULA 1 (F1) (NASDAQ: FWONA, FWONK) estão apresentando seis nnova análises de F1 Insights com tecnologia AWS que serão lançados durante a temporada de corridas de 2021. As novas adições significam que um total de 18 estatísticas baseadas na AWS estarão disponíveis para os fãs até o final da temporada. F1 Insights com tecnologia AWS são estatísticas de corrida em tempo real, exibidas como gráficos na tela, que transformam a experiência dos fãs antes, durante e depois de cada corrida, fornecendo os dados e análises de que os fãs precisam para interpretar a estratégia e o desempenho do piloto e da equipe. A primeira nova estatística, Braking Performance (Desempenho de frenagem), vai estrear no GRAND PRIX na Itália, de 16 a 18 de abril. O novo conjunto de estatísticas para 2021 usará uma variedade de tecnologias da AWS, incluindo aprendizado de máquina, para ajudar os fãs a entender melhor e destacar os resultados potenciais da corrida e comparar seus pilotos e carros favoritos. Para obter mais informações sobre a AWS e seu envolvimento com a Fórmula 1, incluindo os 12 F1 Insights lançados anteriormente, visite: https://aws.amazon.com/f1/. A corrida de F1 é um esporte baseado em dados em que grande parte da emoção dos fãs vem de estudar as estatísticas antes e depois de uma corrida para obter uma compreensão mais profunda das decisões do piloto e da equipe e do desempenho dos carros na pista. As análises de F1 com tecnologia da AWS adiciona uma nova dimensão em tempo real às estatísticas e contextualiza os dados da corrida para ajudar os fãs a apreciar melhor os momentos-chave na pista. Mais de 300 sensores em cada carro de corrida geram mais de 1,1 milhão de pontos de dados por segundo que a F1 transmite dos carros para o box e para a AWS para processamento. A F1 depende da amplitude e da profundidade dos serviços da AWS para transmitir e analisar essa enxurrada de dados conforme são gerados e, em seguida, apresentá-los de uma forma significativa para os telespectadores online e de TV em todo o mundo por meio do F1 Insights. O primeiro F1 Insight a ser apresentado nesta temporada, Braking Performance, mostra como o estilo de frenagem de um motorista durante uma manobra em curva pode oferecer uma vantagem saindo da curva. Quando bem executada, a frenagem otimiza a velocidade do carro ao longo das fases das curvas e permite que o piloto obtenha uma melhor posição na pista. Esta estatística exibe e compara os estilos de frenagem e desempenho dos motoristas, medindo o quão perto eles se aproximam do ápice de uma curva antes de frear. Além disso, ela mostrará as principais métricas de desempenho que levam ao desempenho do carro e do motorista juntos nas curvas, como velocidade máxima na abordagem, diminuição da velocidade durante a frenagem, a potência de frenagem (KWH) utilizada e os imensos pilotos da força G sofrer durante as curvas. O Desempenho de Frenagem se baseia na estatística existente de Corner Analysys, que mostra como os carros se comportam fisicamente nas curvas. O desempenho de frenagem e os outras novas cinco análises de F1 da AWS (detalhados abaixo) estrearão como gráficos na tela de abril a dezembro desta temporada. Cada nova estatística oferece aos fãs mais visibilidade sobre a ação em frações de segundo na pista e a tomada de decisões por trás da parede do pit. Car Exploitation (Explorando o automóvel) mostra aos fãs quando os pilotos de F1 estão levando seus carros aos limites de desempenho em áreas como tração dos pneus, frenagem, aceleração e manobra durante os pontos-chave de uma corrida. A estatística revela os dados em tempo real exibindo o desempenho atual de um carro durante uma corrida em comparação com um limite de desempenho teórico e, em seguida, calcula o tempo ganho ou perdido por volta como resultado. A estatística estreia de 11 a 13 de junho na FÓRMULA 1 HEINEKEN GRAND PRIX DU CANADA 2021. Energy Usage (uso de energia) fornece insights sobre como os motores de alta tecnologia que movem os carros de F1 utilizam energia durante uma corrida, incluindo quando as equipes liberam energia para ultrapassar outro carro. A estatística demonstra que a energia flui através de cada componente do motor avançado de F1, conhecido como Power Unit, e mostra quanta energia resta da bateria em qualquer momento da corrida. O motor F1 impulsiona um veículo usando uma combinação de sistemas de combustão interna e híbridos que recuperam energia da frenagem e do turboalimentador. No entanto, existem limites para a capacidade de armazenamento de energia da Unidade de Potência e a quantidade de energia que pode se mover através dela durante cada volta da corrida. As equipes de corrida rastreiam esses dados para ajudar a maximizar o desempenho de seus carros em momentos-chave em uma corrida, determinando quando implantar energia em fluxos estáveis ​​para alcançar os melhores tempos de volta ou liberá-la em momentos focados para ganhar ou manter a posição ao lutar contra outro piloto. O uso de energia permite que os fãs vejam essas decisões em tempo real. A estatística estreia de 16 a 18 de julho no FORMULA 1 PIRELLI BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2021. Start Analysis (Análise inicial) exibe qual piloto foi o mais rápido no pedal e escolheu a linha perfeita, bem como quais pilotos lutaram para sair do grid de largada e por quê. Conseguir a largada perfeita é uma habilidade fundamental do piloto, e a Análise de Partida ajudará os fãs a entender como as decisões de um piloto ganham ou sacrificam uma vantagem inicial na corrida. A estatística estreia de 10 a 12 de setembro na FÓRMULA 1 HEINEKEN GRAN PREMIO D'ITALIA 2021. Pitlane performance (desempenho pitlane) analisa o desempenho do pit stop, adicionando emoção à parte da corrida que ocorre atrás da parede do pit. Os pit stops são essenciais e coordenados com precisão, mas consomem muito tempo em uma corrida de F1. Pitlane Performance oferece análises além do tempo de parada estacionária de um carro, como descompactar como o piloto e a equipe atuam durante cada etapa de uma parada no pitlane e destacando o tempo total perdido ou ganho devido à eficiência do trabalho da equipe. A estatística estreia de 8 a 10 de outubro no FORMULA 1 GRAND PRIX 2021 do Japão. Undercut Threat (Ameaça de rebaixamento) ajuda os fãs a prever quais carros correm o risco de ser ultrapassados ​​como resultado de um \"rebaixamento\". O undercut é uma estratégia de corrida de F1 em que um piloto em perseguição entra no box para obter pneus novos com a expectativa de que o tempo de volta melhorado com os novos pneus permita que o piloto ultrapasse o carro da frente assim que o carro sair do box. A F1 introduziu uma estatística semelhante, Pit Strategy Battle, em junho de 2020 para destacar uma batalha que acontece e ajudar os fãs a avaliar em tempo real o sucesso da estratégia de cada piloto. Undercut Threat adiciona uma nova camada de visão preditiva ao analisar o desempenho da corrida antes de qualquer carro entrar na box, aumentando a empolgação dos fãs e a sensação de perigo em torno da ação potencial que está por vir. Visualiza dados sobre lacunas entre carros, tempo médio de perda de box e desempenho dos pneus para ajudar a identificar quais carros estão em risco. A estatística estreia de 19 a 21 de novembro no FORMULA 1 ROLEX AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX 2021. Para criar as novas análises, F1 usa dados históricos de corrida armazenados no Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) e os combina com dados ao vivo transmitidos de carros de corrida F1 e sensores de pista para AWS por meio do Amazon Kinesis, um serviço para coleta de dados em tempo real, processamento e análise. Os engenheiros e cientistas de F1 usarão esses dados para aproveitar os modelos de aprendizado de máquina com o Amazon SageMaker, o serviço da AWS que ajuda desenvolvedores e cientistas de dados a construir, treinar e implantar modelos de aprendizado de máquina rapidamente na nuvem e no perímetro. A F1 é capaz de analisar as métricas de desempenho da corrida em tempo real aplicando esses modelos de Aprendizado de Máquina no AWS Lambda, que executa um código sem a necessidade de serviços de gerenciamento ou provisão. Todas as análises serão integradas aos feeds de transmissão internacional das corridas em todo o mundo, incluindo a plataforma digital da F1, F1TV, ajudando os fãs a entender as decisões em frações de segundo e estratégias de corrida feitas por pilotos ou equipes que podem afetar drasticamente o resultado da corrida. “Análises F1 com tecnologia AWS dá aos fãs uma visão privilegiada de como o carro, o piloto e a equipe funcionam juntos para que possam apreciar melhor a ação na pista”, disse Rob Smedley, engenheiro-chefe da FÓRMULA 1. “Com este novo conjunto de estatísticas de corrida para 2021, estamos indo mais fundo do que nunca. Novas percepções, como desempenho de frenagem e ameaça de rebaixo, recuperam camadas adicionais de estratégias e desempenho de corrida e usam visualizações avançadas para tornar o esporte de corrida ainda mais compreensível e emocionante.

    "text": "シアトル--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- アマゾン・ドット・コム（NASDAQ：AMZN）傘下のアマゾン ウェブ サービス（AWS）とフォーミュラワン（F1）（NASDAQ：FWONA、FWONK）は本日、2021年のレースシーズンを通じて展開されるAWSを利用した6つの新しいF1インサイトを導入します。この新しい追加により、シーズン終了までに合計18種類のAWSを利用した統計が、ファンに提供されることになります。AWSを利用したF1インサイトは、画面上のグラフィックとして表示されるリアルタイムのレーシング統計であり、ドライバーとチームのレース戦略とパフォーマンスを解釈するためにファンが必要とするデータと分析を提供することで、各レースの前、最中、後のファン体験を一変させます。最初の新統計であるブレーキング・パフォーマンスは、4月16～18日のイタリアでのグランプリで登場します。2021年の一連の新しい統計は、機械学習を含むさまざまなAWSテクノロジーを利用して、ファンがレース結果の可能性を理解・明確化し、お気に入りのドライバーと車を比較できるようにします。AWSと、以前に発表された12種類のF1インサイトを含むF1との関与の詳細情報ついては、https://aws.amazon.com/f1/をご覧ください。 F1レースはデータ主導型のスポーツであり、ファンにとってのスリルの多くが、レースの前後に統計を吟味して、コース上でのドライバーやチームの意思決定と車のパフォーマンスをさらに深く理解することから生まれます。AWSを利用したF1インサイトは、統計に新しいリアルタイムの側面を加え、レースデータに文脈を添えて、ファンがトラック上の主要な瞬間の理解を高めることに寄与します。各レースカーに搭載された300個以上のセンサーが毎秒110万個を超えるデータポイントを生成し、F1はこれを車両からピットへ、そしてAWSへと伝送して処理します。F1は幅広く奥深いAWSサービスを頼りに、生成される膨大なデータをストリーミングおよび分析し、F1インサイトを通じて世界中のテレビやオンラインの視聴者に有意義な方法で提示します。 今シーズン導入される最初のF1インサイトであるブレーキング・パフォーマンスは、コーナリング操作中のドライバーのブレーキング・スタイルがいかに、コーナーから出てくる際に優位性をもたらしうるかを示します。うまく実行された場合、ブレーキングによってコーナリングの段階を通じて車両の速度が最適化され、ドライバーはコース上でより良いポジションを獲得することができます。この統計は、ブレーキングの前にドライバーがコーナーのエイペックスにどれだけ接近しているかを測定することによって、ドライバーのブレーキング・スタイルとパフォーマンスを表示し、比較します。さらに、アプローチ時の最高速度や、ブレーキングによる速度低下、用いられる制動力（KWH）、コーナリング中にドライバーが受ける巨大なGフォースなど、コーナリングの際にいかに車両とドライバーが連携して機能するかにつながる主要なパフォーマンス測定基準を示します。ブレーキング・パフォーマンスは、コーナリング中に車がどのように物理的に機能するかを表す既存のコーナー分析統計を基盤としています。 ブレーキング・パフォーマンスとその他の5つの新しいAWSを利用したF1インサイト（詳細は以下）は、今シーズンの4月から12月にかけて、画面上のグラフィックとして登場します。それぞれの新しい統計により、ファンは、トラック上のコンマ何秒のアクションとピットウォールの裏側での意思決定を、より明確に把握することができます。 カー・エクスプロイテーションはファンに対し、F1ドライバーがレースの重要なポイントで、タイヤのトラクションやブレーキング、加速、操縦といった領域で車をパフォーマンスの限界まで追い込んだ時を示します。この統計は、理論上の性能の限界と比較したレース中の車両の現時点のパフォーマンスを表示することによって、リアルタイムでデータを明らかにし、その結果として生じた1ラップあたりのタイムゲインやタイムロスを計算します。この統計は、6月11～13日にFORMULA 1 HEINEKEN GRAND PRIX DU CANADA 2021で登場します。 エネルギー使用は、チームが他の車を追い抜くためにエネルギーを放出する際など、F1車に搭載されたハイテク・エンジンがレース中にどのようにエネルギーを使用するかに関する洞察を提供します。この統計は、パワーユニットと呼ばれる高度なF1エンジンの各コンポーネントを通るエネルギーの流れを示し、レースのあらゆる瞬間のバッテリー・エネルギーの残量を表示します。F1エンジンは、内燃システムと、ブレーキングおよびターボチャージャーからエネルギーを回収するハイブリッド・システムを組み合わせて使用して車を前進させます。一方で、パワーユニットのエネルギー貯蔵容量と、各レースラップ中にパワーユニット内を通ることができるエネルギー量には限りがあります。レースチームはこのデータを追跡し、最高のラップタイムを実現するためにエネルギーを一定の流れで使用するべきか、他のドライバーとの攻防の中で、ポジションを獲得または維持するために的を絞った瞬間にエネルギーを放出するべきかを決定しながら、レースの主要な瞬間に車のパフォーマンスを最大化するサポートをします。この統計は、7月16～18日にFORMULA 1 PIRELLI BRITISH GRAND PRIX 2021で導入されます。 スタート分析は、どのドライバーが最も素早くペダルを踏んで、完璧なラインを選んだか、また、どのドライバーがスターティング・グリッドから苦戦したかを、その理由と共に表示します。完璧なスタートを達成することはドライバーの中核的スキルであり、スタート分析は、ドライバーの決定がいかにレースの序盤に優位性をもたらしたり犠牲にしたりするかをファンが理解するために役立ちます。この統計は、9月10～12日にFORMULA 1 HEINEKEN GRAN PREMIO D’ITALIA 2021で登場します。 ピットレーン・パフォーマンスは、ピット・ストップのパフォーマンスを分析し、ピットウォールの裏側で行われるレースの一部分に刺激を加えます。ピット・ストップは、F1レースに不可欠で正確に調整されながらも、時間を取る要素です。ピットレーン・パフォーマンスは、ピットレーンでのピット・ストップの各ステップでのドライバーとチームのパフォーマンスを明らかにし、チームによる作業の効率性に起因するピットレーンのタイムロスまたはタイムゲインの合計にスポットを当てるなど、車が静止したストップ・タイムを超えた洞察を提供します。この統計は、10月8～10日にFORMULA 1 JAPANESE GRAND PRIX 2021で登場します。 アンダーカットの脅威は、どの車に「アンダーカット」の結果として追い抜かれるリスクがあるかをファンが予想するために役立ちます。アンダーカットとは、追走するドライバーが、新しいタイヤによるラップタイムの向上によって、前走の車がピットインした際に追い抜くことを期待してタイヤ交換のためにピットに入るF1レース戦略です。F1は2020年6月に、アンダーカットの攻防が起きた際にそれにスポットを当て、各ドライバーの戦略がどれだけ成功するかをファンがリアルタイムで評価できるようにする同様の統計であるピット戦略バトルを導入しました。アンダーカットの脅威は、いずれかの車がピットインする前にレースのパフォーマンスを分析することによって新たな予測的洞察を加え、ファンの興奮と、可能性のある以後の行動に対する切迫感を高めます。車間の差やピット・ロスタイムの平均、タイヤ性能に係るデータを視覚化し、どの車が危険にさらされているかを特定できるようになります。この統計は、11月19～21日にFORMULA 1 ROLEX AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX 2021で導入されます。 新しいインサイトを創り出すために、F1はアマゾン シンプル ストレージ サービス（アマゾンS3）に保存された過去のレースデータを使用し、リアルタイムのデータ収集・処理・分析のサービスであるアマゾン キネシスを通じてF1レースカーとトラックサイドのセンサーからAWSへとストリーミングされるライブデータと組み合わせます。F1のエンジニアと科学者はこのデータを使用して、ディベロッパーやデータ科学者がクラウドとエッジで迅速に機械学習モデルを構築・トレーニング・展開するサポートをするAWSのサービスであるアマゾン セージメーカーで、機械学習モデルを活用します。F1は、サーバーのプロビジョニングや管理の必要なしにコードを実行できるサーバーレス・コンピューティング・サービスであるAWSラムダでこれらの機械学習モデルを展開することで、レース・パフォーマンス指標をリアルタイムで分析することができます。インサイトはすべて、F1のデジタル・プラットフォームF1TVを含む世界各地のレースの国際放送フィードに統合され、レースの結果に劇的な影響を及ぼし得るドライバーとチームによるコンマ何秒の意思決定やレース戦略をファンが理解するサポートをします。 フォーミュラワンの主任エンジニアのロブ・スメドレーは、次のように述べています。「AWSを利用したF1インサイトは、車、ドライバー、チームがいかに連携して機能するかについてファンに部内者の視点を提供し、コース上でのアクションの理解を高めることに役立ちます。2021年のこの一連の新しいレーシング統計により、私たちはこれまで以上に深いところへと進みつつあります。ブレーキング・パフォーマンスやアンダーカットの脅威などの新しいインサイトは、レース戦略とパフォーマンスをさらに詳しく提示し、高度な視覚化を用いてレースというスポーツをこれまで以上に理解しやすく刺激的なものにします。レースカーのテクノロジーは常に向上しており、AWSのおかげでファンは、テクノロジーがいかにレース結果に影響を及ぼすかを理解することができます。」 AWS EMEAの事業開発ディレクターのダレン・マウリーは、次のように述べています。「データは現代のスポーツのストーリーの非常に重要な要素となっており、文字通りトラック上で毎秒100万個以上のデータポイントが生成されるF1は、生データをリアルタイムで意味あるものに変換できるパートナーを必要としています。AWSによって、F1は大量のデータを大規模に分析し、より適切で情報に基づいた意思決定を行うとともに、スターティング・グリッドからコーナリング、ピッティングまで、コース上のアクションの全段階にファンを近づけることができます。世界の主要スポーツ組織はAWSを使用してデータ駆動型ソリューションを構築し、スポーツの視聴、プレー、管理の方法を新たにしています。私たちのF1との協力は、レースの最も単純に見える要素の背後にある戦術と戦略を明らかにすることによって、高度な統計がいかにファン体験を高めることができるかを実証しています。」

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced nine new utility-scale wind and solar energy projects in the U.S., Canada, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. The company now has 206 renewable energy projects globally, including 71 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 135 solar rooftops on facilities and stores worldwide, which will generate 8.5 GW of electricity production capacity globally. With this latest announcement, Amazon is now the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in Europe, with more than 2.5 GW of renewable energy capacity, enough to power more than two million European homes a year. These projects supply renewable energy to Amazon’s corporate offices, fulfillment centers, Whole Foods Market stores, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers, which power Amazon and millions of AWS customers globally. The renewable energy from these projects also helps Amazon meet its commitment to produce the clean energy equivalent to the electricity used by all consumer Echo devices. All of these projects put Amazon on a path to power 100% of its activities with renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of the original target of 2030. Investing in renewable energy is one of the many actions Amazon is taking as part of The Climate Pledge, a commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. “Amazon continues to scale up its investments in renewable energy as part of its effort to meet The Climate Pledge, our commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2040,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. “With these nine new wind and solar projects, we have announced 206 renewable wind and solar projects worldwide, and we are now the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in Europe and globally. Many parts of our business are already operating on renewable energy, and we expect to power all of Amazon with renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of our original target of 2030.” The nine new wind and solar projects announced today in the U.S., Canada, Spain, Sweden, and the UK include: Our first solar project paired with energy storage: Based in California’s Imperial Valley, Amazon’s first solar project paired with energy storage allows the company to align solar generation with the greatest demand. The project generates 100 megawatts (MW) of solar energy, which is enough to power over 28,000 homes for a year and includes 70 MW of energy storage. The project also allows Amazon to deploy next-generation technologies for energy storage and management while maintaining the reliability and resilience of California’s electricity grid. Our first renewable project in Canada: Amazon is announcing its first renewable energy investment in Canada—an 80 MW solar project in the County of Newell in Alberta. Once complete, it will produce over 195,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) of renewable energy to the grid, or enough energy to power more than 18,000 Canadian homes for a year. The largest corporate renewable energy project in the UK: Amazon’s newest project in the UK is a 350 MW wind farm off the coast of Scotland and is Amazon’s largest in the country. It is also the largest corporate renewable energy deal announced by any company in the UK to date. New projects in the U.S.: Amazon’s first renewable energy project in Oklahoma is a 118 MW wind project located in Murray County. Amazon is also building new solar projects in Ohio’s Allen, Auglaize, and Licking counties. Together, these Ohio projects will account for more than 400 MW of new energy procurement in the state. Additional investments in Spain and Sweden: In Spain, Amazon’s newest solar projects are located in Extremadura and Andalucia, and together add more than 170 MW to the grid. Amazon’s newest project in Sweden is a 258 MW onshore wind project located in Northern Sweden. A map of all of Amazon’s renewable energy projects around the world can be found here. “Amazon is a leader in renewable energy buying and is continuously changing the market through continuous innovation and investments in renewable energy. We are thrilled to see Amazon's latest commitments around the world including in Spain, Sweden, and the UK. Long-term investments like these are crucial to companies moving closer to climate neutrality,” said Hannah Hunt, Impact Director, RE-Source, a corporate renewable energy sourcing platform in Europe. “Amazon continues to play a key role leading the corporate transition to renewable power worldwide and demonstrating that ambitious renewable targets are both achievable and widely beneficial,” said Gregory Wetstone, President and CEO of the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE). “The company’s nine new clean energy projects bring them to an impressive record total of 8.5 gigawatts of global renewable capacity and include Amazon’s first solar plus storage project, using advanced technology to help deliver a clean, reliable grid.” “Leading companies like Amazon know the value that solar can bring to their businesses and the planet,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “We’re thrilled to see that Amazon is following through on its climate commitments and is investing in renewable energy assets across the world. Wall Street, customers, and international businesses are all watching what American companies are doing about climate change, and this type of leadership can have a major impact on the climate crisis.” Amazon and Global Optimism co-founded The Climate Pledge in 2019, a commitment to reach the Paris Agreement 10 years early and be net-zero carbon by 2040. The pledge now has 53 signatories, including IBM, Unilever, Verizon, Siemens, Microsoft, and Best Buy. To reach its goal, Amazon will continue to reduce emissions across its operations by taking real business actions and establishing a path to power its operations with 100% renewable energy, five years ahead of the company’s original target of 2030; delivering its Shipment Zero vision to make all shipments net-zero carbon, with 50% net-zero carbon by 2030; purchasing 100,000 electric delivery vehicles, the largest order ever of electric delivery vehicles; and by investing $2 billion in the development of decarbonizing services and solutions through the Climate Pledge Fund.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) heeft vandaag negen nieuwe wind- en zonne-energieprojecten op utiliteitsschaal aangekondigd in de VS, Canada, Spanje, Zweden en het VK. Het bedrijf heeft nu wereldwijd 206 projecten voor hernieuwbare energie, waaronder 71 wind- en zonne-energieprojecten op utiliteitsschaal en 135 zonnedaken op faciliteiten en winkels over de hele wereld, die wereldwijd 8,5 GW aan elektriciteitsproductiecapaciteit genereren. Met deze laatste aankondiging is Amazon nu de grootste zakelijke koper van hernieuwbare energie in Europa, met meer dan 2,5 GW aan hernieuwbare energiecapaciteit, voldoende om meer dan twee miljoen Europese huishoudens per jaar van stroom te voorzien. Deze projecten leveren hernieuwbare energie aan de hoofdkantoren, fulfilmentcentra, Whole Foods Market-winkels en Amazon Web Services (AWS) datacenters van Amazon, die Amazon en miljoenen AWS-klanten wereldwijd van stroom voorzien. De hernieuwbare energie van deze projecten helpt Amazon ook om zijn toezegging na te komen om de schone energie te produceren die equivalent is aan de elektriciteit die door alle Echo-apparaten voor consumenten wordt gebruikt. Al deze projecten plaatsen Amazon in een positie om tegen 2025 100% van zijn activiteiten te voorzien van hernieuwbare energie, vijf jaar eerder dan de oorspronkelijke doelstelling van 2030. Investeren in hernieuwbare energie is een van de vele acties die Amazon onderneemt als onderdeel van The Climate Pledge, een toezegging om tegen 2040, 10 jaar voor het Akkoord van Parijs, CO2-neutraal te zijn. “Amazon blijft zijn investeringen in hernieuwbare energie opschalen als onderdeel van zijn inspanningen om te voldoen aan The Climate Pledge, onze toezegging om tegen 2040 CO2-neutraal te zijn”, zei Jeff Bezos, oprichter en CEO van Amazon. “Met deze negen nieuwe wind- en zonne-energieprojecten hebben we wereldwijd 206 wind- en zonne-energieprojecten aangekondigd en zijn we nu de grootste zakelijke koper van hernieuwbare energie in Europa en wereldwijd. Veel delen van ons bedrijf werken al met hernieuwbare energie en we verwachten dat we heel Amazon tegen 2025 van hernieuwbare energie zullen voorzien, vijf jaar eerder dan ons oorspronkelijke doel van 2030.” De vandaag aangekondigde negen nieuwe wind- en zonne-energieprojecten op utiliteitsschaal in de VS, Canada, Spanje, Zweden en het VK omvatten: Ons eerste zonne-energieproject gecombineerd met energieopslag: Het eerste zonne-energieproject in combinatie met energieopslag van Amazon, gevestigd in de Imperial Valley in Californië, stelt het bedrijf in staat om de opwekking van zonne-energie af te stemmen op de grootste vraag. Het project genereert 100 megawatt (MW) aan zonne-energie, voldoende om meer dan 28.000 huishoudens een jaar lang van stroom te voorzien en omvat 70 MW aan energieopslag. Het project stelt Amazon ook in staat om technologieën van de volgende generatie in te zetten voor energieopslag en -beheer, terwijl de betrouwbaarheid en veerkracht van het Californische elektriciteitsnet behouden blijft. Ons eerste hernieuwbare project in Canada: Amazon kondigt zijn eerste investering in hernieuwbare energie in Canada aan: een zonne-energieproject van 80 MW in het district van Newell in Alberta. Eenmaal voltooid, produceert en levert het meer dan 195.000 megawattuur (MWh) aan hernieuwbare energie aan het net, oftewel voldoende energie om meer dan 18.000 Canadese huishoudens een jaar lang van stroom te voorzien. Het grootste bedrijfsproject voor hernieuwbare energie in het VK: Het nieuwste project van Amazon in het VK is een windmolenpark van 350 MW voor de kust van Schotland en is het grootste van Amazon in het land. Het is ook de grootste zakelijke deal voor hernieuwbare energie die tot nu toe door een bedrijf in het VK is aangekondigd. Nieuwe projecten in de VS: Het eerste hernieuwbare energieproject van Amazon in Oklahoma is een windenergieproject van 118 MW in Murray County. Amazon bouwt ook nieuwe zonne-energieprojecten in de districten Allen, Auglaize en Licking in Ohio. Samen zijn deze projecten in Ohio goed voor meer dan 400 MW aan nieuwe energie-inkoop in de staat. Extra investeringen in Spanje en Zweden: In Spanje bevinden de nieuwste zonne-energieprojecten van Amazon zich in Extremadura en Andalusië, die samen meer dan 170 MW aan het net toevoegen. Het nieuwste project van Amazon in Zweden is een windenergieproject op het land van 258 MW in Noord-Zweden. Een kaart van alle duurzame energieprojecten van Amazon over de hele wereld is hier te vinden​. “Amazon is een leider in het inkopen van hernieuwbare energie en verandert de markt voortdurend door voortdurende innovatie en investeringen in hernieuwbare energie. We zijn zeer verheugd om de laatste toezeggingen van Amazon over de hele wereld te zien, ook in Spanje, Zweden en het VK. Investeringen op lange termijn zoals deze zijn cruciaal voor bedrijven die dichter bij klimaatneutraliteit komen”, zei Hannah Hunt, Impact Director van RE-Source, een zakelijk inkoopplatform voor hernieuwbare energie in Europa. “Amazon blijft een sleutelrol spelen bij het leiden van de transitie van bedrijven naar hernieuwbare energie wereldwijd en toont aan dat ambitieuze doelstellingen op het gebied van hernieuwbare energie zowel haalbaar als algemeen voordelig zijn”, zei Gregory Wetstone, President en CEO van de American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE). “De negen nieuwe projecten voor schone energie van het bedrijf brengen hen op een indrukwekkend record van in totaal 8,5 gigawatt aan wereldwijde hernieuwbare capaciteit en omvatten het eerste zonne-energie plus opslagproject van Amazon, waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van geavanceerde technologie om een schoon, betrouwbaar net te leveren.” “Toonaangevende bedrijven zoals Amazon kennen de waarde die zonne-energie kan brengen voor hun bedrijven en de aarde”, zei Abigail Ross Hopper, president en CEO van de Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “We zijn zeer verheugd om te zien dat Amazon zijn klimaatverplichtingen nakomt en investeert in hernieuwbare energiebronnen over de hele wereld. Wall Street, klanten en internationale bedrijven kijken allemaal naar wat Amerikaanse bedrijven doen aan klimaatverandering, en dit soort leiderschap kan een grote impact hebben op de klimaatcrisis.” Amazon en Global Optimism waren in 2019 medeoprichters van The Climate Pledge, een toezegging om 10 jaar eerder het Akkoord van Parijs te bereiken en tegen 2040 CO2-neutraal te zijn. The Pledge heeft nu 53 ondertekenaars, waaronder IBM, Unilever, Verizon, Siemens, Microsoft en Best Buy. Om zijn doel te bereiken, zal Amazon de uitstoot van al zijn activiteiten blijven verminderen door echte zakelijke acties te ondernemen en een pad te vinden om zijn activiteiten te voorzien van 100% hernieuwbare energie, vijf jaar eerder dan de oorspronkelijke doelstelling van het bedrijf van 2030; het leveren van de Shipment Zero-visie om alle zendingen CO2-neutraal te maken, met 50% CO-2-neutraal tegen 2030; aankoop van 100.000 elektrische bestelwagens, de grootste order ooit van elektrische bestelwagens; en door $ 2 miljard te investeren in de ontwikkeling van decarbonisatiediensten en oplossingen via het Climate Pledge Fund.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) anunciou hoje nove novos projetos de energia solar e eólica em escala de serviços públicos nos EUA, Canadá, Espanha, Suécia e Reino Unido. A empresa agora possui 206 projetos de energia renovável globalmente, incluindo 71 projetos solares e eólicos em escala de serviços públicos e 135 projetos de telhados solares em instalações em lojas mundialmente, que vão gerar 8,5 GW de capacidade de produção de eletricidade mundialmente. Com este mais recente anúncio, a Amazon agora é o maior comprador de energia renovável na Europa, com mais de 2,5 GW de capacidade de energia renovável, suficiente para abastecer mais de dois milhões de residências europeias por ano. Os projetos fornecerão energia renovável aos escritórios corporativos da Amazon, centros de atendimento, lojas Whole Foods Market e data centers da Amazon Web Services (AWS), que atendem a Amazon e milhões de clientes da AWS em todo o mundo. A energia renovável desses projetos também ajuda a Amazon a cumprir seu compromisso de produzir energia limpa equivalente à eletricidade utilizada por todos os dispositivos Echo de consumidores. Todos esses projetos colocam a Amazon em um caminho para abastecer 100% de suas atividades com energia renovável até 2025, cinco anos antes da meta original de 2030. Investir em energia renovável é uma das diversas ações que a Amazon está realizando como parte do The Climate Pledge, um compromisso para alcançar carbono líquido zero até 2040, 10 anos antes do Acordo de Paris. “A Amazon continua a expandir seus investimentos em energia renovável como parte dos seus esforços para atender ao The Climate Pledge, nosso compromisso em alcançar carbono líquido zero até 2040”, afirmou Jeff Bezos, fundador e CEO da Amazon. “Com estes nove novos projetos solares e eólicos, anunciamos 206 projetos renováveis solares e eólicos mundialmente, e agora somos o maior comprador corporativo de energia renovável na Europa e no mundo. Muitas partes dos nossos negócios já estão operando com energia renovável, e esperamos abastecer toda a Amazon com energia renovável até 2025, cinco anos antes da nossa meta inicial de 2030.” São os nove novos projetos eólicos e solares anunciados hoje nos EUA, Canadá, Espanha, Suécia e Reino Unido: Nosso primeiro projeto solar combinado com armazenamento de energia: Baseado no Vale Imperial da Califórnia, o primeiro projeto solar da Amazon combinado com armazenamento de energia permite que a empresa alinhe a geração solar com a mais alta demanda. O projeto gera 100 megawatts (MW) de energia solar, que é suficiente para abastecer mais de 28.000 residências por um ano, e inclui 70 MW de armazenamento de energia. O projeto também permite que a Amazon implante tecnologias de próxima geração para armazenamento e gerenciamento de energia, enquanto mantém a confiabilidade e resiliência da rede elétrica da Califórnia. Nosso primeiro projeto renovável no Canadá: A Amazon está anunciando seu primeiro investimento em energia renovável no Canadá, um projeto solar de 80 MW no condado de Newell, em Alberta. Quando concluído, ele irá produzir mais de 195.000 megawatt-hora (MWh) de energia renovável para a rede, ou energia suficiente para abastecer mais de 18.000 residências canadenses por um ano. O maior projeto corporativo de energia renovável no Reino Unido: O mais novo projeto da Amazon no Reino Unido é um parque eólico de 350 MW na costa da Escócia, e é o maior da Amazon no país. Ele também é o maior acordo corporativo de energia renovável anunciado por alguma empresa no Reino Unido até hoje. Novos projetos nos EUA: O primeiro projeto de energia renovável da Amazon em Oklahoma é um projeto eólico de 118 MW, localizado no condado de Murray. A Amazon também está construindo novos projetos solares nos condados de Allen, Auglaize e Licking, em Ohio. Juntos, estes projetos em Ohio serão responsáveis por mais de 400 MW de nova aquisição de energia no estado. Investimentos adicionais na Espanha e Suécia: Na Espanha, os mais recentes projetos solares da Amazon estão localizados em Extremadura e Andaluzia, e, juntos, adicionam mais de 170 MW à rede. O plano mais recente da Amazon na Suécia é um projeto solar terrestre de 258 MW localizado no norte da Suécia. Um mapa de todos os projetos de energia renovável da Amazon ao redor do mundo pode ser acessado aqui. “A Amazon continua exercendo um papel fundamental ao liderar a transição corporativa para energia renovável mundialmente, e demonstrando que ambiciosas metas renováveis são realizáveis e amplamente benéficas”, disse Gregory Wetstone, presidente e CEO do Conselho Americano de Energia Renovável (American Council on Renewable Energy, ACORE). “Os nove novos projetos de energia limpa da empresa os levam a um total impressionante recorde de 8,5 gigawatts de capacidade renovável global e inclui o primeiro projeto solar da Amazon com armazenamento, utilizando tecnologia avançada para ajudar a entregar uma rede limpa e confiável.” “Empresas líderes como a Amazon conhecem o poder que a energia solar pode trazer aos seus negócios e ao planeta”, disse Abigail Ross Hopper, presidente e CEO da Associação de Indústrias de Energia Solar (Solar Energy Industries Association, SEIA). “Estamos empolgados em ver que a Amazon está seguindo seus compromissos climáticos e investindo em recursos de energia renovável mundialmente. Wall Street, clientes e empresas internacionais estão todos vendo o que empresas americanas estão fazendo sobre a mudança climática, e este tipo de liderança pode ter um importante impacto na crise climática.” A Amazon e o Global Optimism cofundaram o The Climate Pledge em 2019, um compromisso para alcançar o Acordo de Paris 10 anos antes e alcançar carbono líquido zero até 2040. O compromisso agora tem 53 signatários, incluindo IBM, Unilever, Verizon, Siemens, Microsoft e Best Buy. Para atingir sua meta, a Amazon continuará a reduzir as emissões em suas operações realizando ações reais de negócios e estabelecendo um caminho para abastecer suas operações com energia 100% renovável, cinco anos antes da meta inicial da empresa de 2030; entregando sua visão Shipment Zero para fazer todas as remessas de carbono líquido zero, com 50% de carbono líquido zero até 2030; e a compra de 100.000 veículos de entrega elétricos, o maior pedido de veículos de entrega elétricos de todos os tempos, e investindo US$ 2 bilhões no desenvolvimento de serviços e soluções de descarbonização através do Fundo do Climate Pledge.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) gab heute neun neue Projekte in den USA, in Kanada, Spanien, Schweden und dem Vereinigten Königreich für die Nutzung von Wind- und Solarenergie bekannt. Das Unternehmen unterhält nun weltweit 206 Projekte für erneuerbare Energien, darunter 71 Projekte für angewendete Wind- und Solarenergie und 135 Dachsolaranlagen auf Einrichtungen und Geschäften weltweit, die insgesamt auf eine Kapazität von 8,5 GW Stromproduktion kommen. Mit dieser Bekanntgabe ist Amazon nun der größte unternehmerische Abnehmer erneuerbarer Energien in Europa, mit mehr als 2,5 GW Kapazität für erneuerbare Energien, die ausreicht, um mehr als 2 Millionen Haushalte in Europa mit Strom zu versorgen. Diese Projekte werden erneuerbare Energien für die Niederlassungen, Fulfillment-Zentren, Whole Foods Market Niederlassungen und „Amazon Web Services (AWS)“-Rechenzentren liefern, die weltweit Amazon und Millionen von AWS-Kunden unterstützen. Die erneuerbare Energie aus diesen Projekten ermöglicht es Amazon auch, seine Verpflichtung einzugehen, die Menge sauberer Energie für elektrischen Strom zu generieren, der von allen Echo-Geräten für Verbraucher benötigt wird. Mit all diesen Projekte ist Amazon auf einem guten Weg, bis 2025 100 % seiner Aktivitäten mit erneuerbaren Energien zu durchzuführen – fünf Jahre vor dem ursprünglich festgelegten Ziel im Jahr 2030. Die Investition in erneuerbare Energien ist eine der Hauptaktionen, die Amazon aufgrund seines Klimaversprechens (The Climate Pledge) durchführt. Dabei geht es um die Verpflichtung, bis zum Jahr 2040, 10 Jahre vor dem Pariser Klimaabkommen, klimaneutral zu sein. „Amazon setzt seine Investitionen in erneuerbare Energien im Rahmen der Anstrengungen, seinem Versprechen für Klimaneutralität bis zum Jahr 2040 gerecht zu werden, in größerem Umfang fort“, sagte Jeff Bezos, Gründer und CEO von Amazon. „Mit diesen neuen Wind- und Solarprojekten haben wir weltweit 206 erneuerbare Wind- und Solarprojekte angekündigt, sodass wir jetzt der größte unternehmerische Abnehmer erneuerbarer Energien in Europa und weltweit sind. Viele unserer Geschäftsbereiche arbeiten bereits mit erneuerbaren Energien, und wir gehen davon aus, Amazon bis zum Jahr 2025 insgesamt mit Strom aus erneuerbaren Energien zu versorgen – fünf Jahre vor unserem ursprünglichen Zieljahr 2030.“ Die neun neuen Wind- und Solarprojekte, die heute in den USA, in Kanada, Spanien, Schweden und dem Vereinigten Königreich bekannt gegeben wurden, sind folgende: Unser erstes Solarprojekt mit Energiespeicherung: Mit Standort im kalifornischen Imperial Valley ermöglicht es das erste Amazon Solarprojekt zusammen mit Energiespeichern, Strom aus Sonneneinstrahlung mit der größten Nachfrage abzustimmen. Das Projekt generiert 100 Megawatt (MW) Solarenergie, was ausreicht, um mehr als 28.000 Haushalte für ein Jahr zu versorgen. Außerdem verfügt es über einen Energiespeicher von 70 MW. Mit dem Projekt kann Amazon auch Technologien der nächsten Generation für Energiespeicherung und -management nutzen, während die Zuverlässigkeit und Beständigkeit des kalifornischen Stromnetzes erhalten bleibt. Unser erstes Projekt für erneuerbare Energien in Kanada: Amazon gibt seine erste Investition in erneuerbare Energien in Kanada bekannt: ein 80 MW Solarprojekt im County of Newell in Alberta. Nach seinem Abschluss wird es 195.000 Megawattstunden (MWh) erneuerbare Energie in das Stromnetz einspeisen, was ausreicht, um mehr als 18.000 kanadische Haushalte ein Jahr lang zu versorgen. Das größte unternehmerische Projekt für erneuerbare Energien im Vereinigten Königreich: Das neueste Amazon Projekt im Vereinigten Königreich besteht aus einem 350-MW-Windpark vor der schottischen Küste und ist damit das größte im Land. Es ist auch das größte Unternehmensgeschäft für erneuerbare Energien, das bisher von einem Unternehmen im Vereinigten Königreich bekannt gegeben wurde. Neue Projekte in den USA: Das erste Projekt von Amazon für erneuerbare Energien in Oklahoma ist ein 118-MW-Windprojekt in Murray County. Amazon baut auch neue Solarprojekte in den Countys Allen, Auglaize und Licking in Ohio. Insgesamt werden diese Projekte in Ohio mehr als 400 MW der benötigten Energie des Bundesstaates liefern. Zusätzliche Investitionen in Spanien und Schweden: In Spanien befinden sich die neuesten Amazon Solarprojekte in Extremadura und Andalusien. Sie speisen beide insgesamt mehr als 170 MW zusätzlich in das Netz ein. An der Küste Nord-Schwedens betreibt Amazon seit neuestem ein 258-MW-Windprojekt. Hier finden Sie eine Karte aller Amazon Projekte für erneuerbare Energien weltweit. „Amazon ist ein führender Abnehmer erneuerbarer Energien und verändert den Markt kontinuierlich durch fortgesetzte Innovationen und Investments in erneuerbare Energien. Wir sehen mit Begeisterung die neuesten Engagements von Amazon weltweit, unter anderem in Spanien, Schweden und dem Vereinigten Königreich. Langfristige Investitionen wie diese tragen entscheidend dazu bei, dass sich Unternehmen weiter in Richtung Klimaneutralität bewegen“, sagte Hannah Hunt, Impact Director von RE-Source, einer Beschaffungsplattform für erneuerbare Energien in Europa. „Amazon setzt seine tragende Rolle als führende Organisation beim Übergang von Unternehmen zur Stromversorgung aus erneuerbaren Energien weltweit fort und zeigt, dass ehrgeizige Ziele in diesem Bereich sowohl erreichbar als auch weitgehend vorteilhaft sind“, bemerkte Gregory Wetstone, President und CEO des American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE). „Die neun neuen Projekte des Unternehmens für saubere Energie erzeugen einen beeindruckenden Gesamtrekord von 8,5 Gigawatt an weltweiter Kapazität für erneuerbare Energien und umfassen das erste Solar- und Energiespeicherprojekt von Amazon, das ein sauberes, verlässliches Stromnetz mit fortschrittlichen Technologien bereitstellt. „Führende Unternehmen wie Amazon wissen vom Wert, den Solarenergie für Ihre Geschäfte und die Erde erzeugt“, sagte Abigail Ross Hopper, President und CEO der Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). „Wir sehen mit Begeisterung, dass Amazon sich durchgehend an seine Klimaversprechen hält und weltweit in Vermögenswerte für erneuerbare Energien investiert. Die Börse an der Wall Street, Kunden und internationale Geschäfte beobachten, was amerikanische Unternehmen hinsichtlich des Klimawandels unternehmen. Diese Art von Leadership kann sich bedeutend auf die Klimakrise auswirken.“ Im Jahr 2019 riefen Amazon und Global Optimism gemeinsam das Klimaschutzversprechen „The Climate Pledge“ ins Leben, eine Verpflichtung, die Vorgaben des Pariser Abkommens zehn Jahre früher zu erreichen und bis 2040 klimaneutral zu sein. Das Klimaversprechen hat inzwischen 53 Unterzeichner, darunter IBM, Unilever, Verizon, Siemens, Microsoft und Best Buy. Um sein Ziel zu erreichen, wird Amazon die Emissionen in allen Bereichen seiner Geschäftstätigkeit weiter reduzieren, indem es echte Geschäftsmaßnahmen ergreift. Zu diesem Zweck wird das Unternehmen einen Weg finden, seinen Betrieb zu 100 % mit erneuerbaren Energien zu versorgen, fünf Jahre vor dem ursprünglichen Ziel des Unternehmens bis 2030; es wird seine „Shipment Zero“-Vision verwirklichen, wonach alle Lieferungen bis 2030 zu 50 % netto und letztlich ganz kohlenstofffrei sein sollen; und es wird 100.000 elektrische Lieferfahrzeuge kaufen, die bisher größte Bestellung von elektrischen Lieferfahrzeugen. Weiterhin sollen über den Klimafonds (Climate Pledge Fund) 2 Mrd. US-Dollar in die Entwicklung von Diensten und Lösungen zur Kohlenstoffreduktion investiert werden.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) ha annunciato oggi l’avvio di nove nuovi progetti per impianti di energia solare ed eolica finalizzati a servizi di utilità pubblica in Stati Uniti, Canada, Spagna, Svezia e Regno Unito. La società conta attualmente 206 impianti di energia rinnovabile a livello globale, tra cui 71 impianti di energia solare ed eolica per servizi di utilità pubblica e 135 installazioni di pannelli solari su tetti e magazzini in varie parti del mondo, in grado di generare complessivamente 8,5 GW di elettricità. Con quest’ultimo annuncio, Amazon diventa oggi il maggior acquirente di energia rinnovabile in Europa, con una capacità di oltre 2,5 GW da fonti rinnovabili, sufficiente ad alimentare più di due milioni di utenze domestiche europee all’anno. Gli impianti in questione forniscono energia rinnovabile agli uffici aziendali e ai centri di evasione ordini di Amazon, alla catena di supermercati Whole Foods Market e ai centri dati di Amazon Web Services (AWS) al servizio di Amazon e dei milioni di clienti AWS di tutto il mondo. L’energia rinnovabile prodotta da questi impianti aiuta inoltre Amazon a onorare il proprio impegno di produrre una quantità di energia pulita equivalente all’elettricità usata da tutti gli utenti dei dispositivi Echo. L’insieme degli impianti in questione consentirà ad Amazon di alimentare con energie rinnovabili il 100% delle proprie attività entro il 2025, con cinque anni di anticipo rispetto all’obiettivo originale previsto per il 2030. Gli investimenti in energie rinnovabili sono una delle tante azioni intraprese da Amazon nell’ambito del Climate Pledge, l’iniziativa che prevede l’azzeramento delle emissioni di carbonio entro il 2040 con 10 anni di anticipo rispetto all’Accordo di Parigi. “Amazon continua a intensificare i propri investimenti in energie rinnovabili nel contesto dell’impegno assunto con il Climate Pledge di azzerare le emissioni aziendali di carbonio entro il 2040”, ha dichiarato Jeff Bezos, fondatore e amministratore delegato di Amazon. “Con questi nove nuovi progetti per impianti di energia eolica e solare, arriviamo a ben 206 impianti di energia rinnovabile di origine eolica e solare in varie parti del mondo e siamo attualmente il maggior acquirente aziendale di energia rinnovabile in Europa e su scala globale. Diverse unità aziendali della nostra società sono già alimentate con energie rinnovabili e prevediamo di riuscire ad alimentare l’intera Amazon con energie rinnovabili entro il 2025, con cinque anni di anticipo rispetto all’obiettivo originale previsto per il 2030.” I nove nuovi progetti di energia eolica e solare annunciati oggi per Stati Uniti, Canada, Spagna, Svezia e Regno Unito comprendono: Il nostro primo progetto di impianto solare con capacità di stoccaggio dell’energia: Ubicato nell’Imperial Valley, in California, il primo impianto solare di Amazon con stoccaggio dell’energia consentirà alla società di allineare la produzione di energia solare alla fortissima domanda. L’impianto genererà 100 megawatt (MW) di energia solare, sufficienti ad alimentare oltre 28.000 utenze domestiche per un anno, e avrà una capacità di stoccaggio di 70 MW di energia. Il progetto consentirà inoltre ad Amazon di implementare tecnologie di ultima generazione per lo stoccaggio e la gestione dell’energia, garantendo al contempo l’affidabilità e la resilienza della rete elettrica californiana. Il nostro primo impianto di energia rinnovabile in Canada: Amazon ha annunciato la realizzazione del primo investimento in energie rinnovabili in Canada per la realizzazione di un impianto solare da 80 MW nella Contea di Newell, in Alberta. Una volta terminato, produrrà oltre 195.000 megawatt/ora (MWh) di energia per la rete o abbastanza energia da alimentare oltre 18.000 utenze domestiche canadesi per un anno. Il più grande impianto aziendale di energia rinnovabile del Regno Unito: Il nuovo progetto per il Regno Unito, che prevede un parco eolico da 350 MW al largo delle coste della Scozia, rappresenterà il più grande impianto realizzato da Amazon nel Paese nonché il più corposo accordo aziendale in materia di energie rinnovabili annunciato a oggi da un’azienda nel Regno Unito. Nuovi progetti negli Stati Uniti: Il primo progetto per energie rinnovabili in Oklahoma prevede la realizzazione di un impianto eolico da 118 MW nella Contea di Murray. Amazon è inoltre intenzionata a realizzare altri impianti solari in Ohio nelle contee di Allen, Auglaize e Licking. Complessivamente, gli impianti in questione consentiranno all’Ohio un approvvigionamento di oltre 400 MW di energia. Altri investimenti in Spagna e Svezia: In Spagna, i recentissimi impianti solari di Amazon, ubicati in Estremadura e Andalusia, aggiungono congiuntamente oltre 170 MW alla rete. Il nuovo progetto di Amazon in Svezia è un parco eolico onshore da 258 MW ubicato nel nord del Paese. Una mappa di tutti gli impianti di energia rinnovabile di Amazon nel mondo può essere reperita qui. “Amazon detiene il primato come acquirente di energie rinnovabili e rivoluziona continuamente il mercato attraverso l’innovazione e ripetuti investimenti nel campo delle energie rinnovabili. Siamo entusiasti di vedere gli ultimi impegni di Amazon in vari Paesi del mondo tra cui Spagna, Svezia e Regno Unito. Investimenti a lungo termine come questi sono fondamentali per le aziende che cercano di raggiungere la neutralità climatica”, ha dichiarato Hannah Hunt, responsabile della divisione Impatto di RE-Source, piattaforma europea per l’approvvigionamento di energie rinnovabili da parte delle aziende. “Amazon continua a svolgere un ruolo determinante nel guidare la transizione delle imprese di tutto il mondo verso le energie rinnovabili e nel dimostrare che il raggiungimento di ambiziosi obiettivi in tal senso non è solo possibile, ma anche decisamente vantaggioso”, ha affermato Gregory Wetstone, presidente e amministratore delegato del Consiglio americano sulle energie rinnovabili (American Council on Renewable Energy, ACORE). “I nove nuovi progetti di energia pulita sanciscono per la società l’impressionante record di 8,5 gigawatt in capacità complessiva di produzione di energia rinnovabile. Tra questi, figura il primo impianto solare con stoccaggio dell’energia di Amazon, che utilizza tecnologie avanzate per contribuire a rendere più pulita e affidabile la rete elettrica.” “Aziende prestigiose come Amazon conoscono il valore che l’energia solare può apportare alla propria attività e al pianeta”, ha dichiarato Abigail Ross Hopper, presidente e amministratore delegato dell’Associazione delle industrie dell’energia solare (Solar Energy Industries Association, SEIA). “Siamo lieti di vedere che Amazon stia proseguendo nel proprio impegno a favore del clima e investendo in attività del settore delle energie rinnovabili in varie parti del mondo. Wall Street, i clienti e le aziende internazionali stanno tutti osservando ciò che le società americane stanno facendo per contrastare i cambiamenti climatici e questo tipo di leadership può avere un impatto decisivo sulla crisi climatica.” Nel 2019 Amazon e Global Optimism hanno istituito congiuntamente il Climate Pledge, un impegno per il raggiungimento degli obiettivi dell’Accordo di Parigi con 10 anni di anticipo e l’azzeramento delle emissioni di carbonio entro il 2040. L’iniziativa conta attualmente 53 firmatari tra cui IBM, Unilever, Verizon, Siemens, Microsoft e Best Buy. Per raggiungere questo obiettivo, Amazon continuerà a ridurre le emissioni delle proprie attività adottando misure concrete e definendo un percorso che porterà all’uso della sola energia rinnovabile in ogni operazione con cinque anni di anticipo rispetto all’obiettivo originale previsto per il 2030, diffondendo la propria visione “Shipment Zero” finalizzata all’azzeramento delle emissioni di carbonio per tutte le spedizioni aziendali con un primo traguardo di dimezzamento entro il 2030, acquistando 100.000 veicoli elettrici per le consegne con il più cospicuo ordine di veicoli elettrici mai registrato finora e investendo 2 miliardi di dollari nello sviluppo di servizi e soluzioni di decarbonizzazione attraverso il Climate Pledge Fund.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ : AMZN) a annoncé aujourd’hui neuf nouveaux projets d’énergie éolienne et solaire à grande échelle aux États-Unis, au Canada, en Espagne, en Suède et au Royaume-Uni. La société compte désormais 206 projets d’énergie renouvelable dans le monde, dont 71 projets éoliens et solaires à grande échelle et 135 toits solaires sur des installations et magasins à travers le monde, qui vont générer une capacité de production de 8,5 GW d’électricité à travers le monde. Avec cette récente annonce, Amazon devient la plus importante société acquéreuse d’énergie renouvelable en Europe, avec plus de 2,5 GW de capacité d’énergie renouvelable, soit suffisamment pour alimenter plus de deux millions de foyers européens par an. Ces projets fourniront des énergies renouvelables aux sièges sociaux, centres de traitement des commandes, enseignes Whole Foods Market et centres de données Amazon Web Services (AWS) d’Amazon. Cet apport vient renforcer Amazon et ses millions de clients AWS à travers le monde. L’énergie renouvelable de ces projets aide également Amazon à répondre à son engagement à produire de l’énergie propre à hauteur de l’électricité utilisée par tous les appareils grand public Echo. Tous ces projets mettent Amazon en bonne voie d’alimenter 100 % de ses activités avec des énergies renouvelables d’ici 2025, soit cinq ans avant son objectif initial de 2030. Investir dans les énergies renouvelables est l’une des nombreuses actions menées par Amazon dans le cadre de l’Engagement Climat (The Climate Pledge), un engagement qui vise à atteindre la neutralité carbone d’ici 2040, soit avec 10 années d’avance sur les objectifs de l’Accord de Paris sur le climat. « Amazon continue d’intensifier ses investissements dans les énergies renouvelables dans le cadre de son effort pour répondre aux exigences de l’Engagement Climat, l’engagement qui nous avons pris pour arriver à la neutralité carbone d’ici 2040 », a déclaré Jeff Bezos, fondateur et PDG d’Amazon. « Avec ces neuf nouveaux projets éoliens et solaires, nous avons maintenant annoncés 206 projets éoliens et solaires renouvelables à travers le monde, et nous sommes désormais la plus importante société acquéreuse d’énergie renouvelable en Europe et dans le monde. De nombreux secteurs de notre entreprise fonctionnent déjà aux énergies renouvelables et nous prévoyons d’alimenter tout Amazon avec des énergies renouvelables d’ici 2025, soit cinq ans en avance par rapport à notre objectif initial de 2030. » Parmi les neuf nouveaux projets éoliens et solaires annoncés aujourd’hui aux États-Unis, au Canada, en Espagne, en Suède et au Royaume-Uni, figurent : Notre premier projet d’énergie solaire associée au stockage d’énergie : Basé dans la Vallée impériale de Californie, le premier projet solaire d’Amazon associé au stockage d’énergie permet à l’entreprise d’aligner sa production d’énergie solaire sur la demande la plus forte. Le projet génère 100 mégawatts (MW) d’énergie solaire, ce qui est suffisant pour alimenter plus de 28 000 foyers pendant un an, et comprend un stockage d’énergie de 70 MW. Le projet permet également à Amazon de déployer des technologies de prochaine génération pour le stockage et la gestion de l’énergie tout en assurant le maintien de la fiabilité et de la résilience du réseau électrique californien. Notre premier projet d’énergie renouvelable au Canada : Amazon vient d’annoncer son premier investissement dans les énergies renouvelables au Canada avec un projet solaire de 80 MW dans le comté de Newell en province d’Alberta. Une fois terminé, il produira plus de 195 000 mégawattheures (MWh) d’énergie renouvelable vers le réseau, soit suffisamment d’énergie pour alimenter plus de 18 000 foyers canadiens pendant un an. Le plus grand projet d’entreprise d’énergie renouvelable au Royaume-Uni : Le plus récent projet d’Amazon au Royaume-Uni, un parc éolien de 350 MW au large des côtes écossaises, est aussi le plus grand projet d’Amazon dans le pays. Il s’agit également du plus grand accord d’entreprise sur les énergies renouvelables annoncé à ce jour par toute entreprise au Royaume-Uni. Nouveaux projets aux États-Unis : Le premier projet d’énergie renouvelable d’Amazon dans l’Oklahoma est un projet éolien de 118 MW dans le comté de Murray. Amazon construit également de nouveaux projets d’énergie solaire dans les comtés d’Allen, d’Auglaize et de Licking dans l’Ohio. Ensemble, ces projets de l’Ohio représenteront plus de 400 MW d’apport énergétique pour l’État. Investissements supplémentaires en Espagne et en Suède : Situés en Estrémadure et en Andalousie, les plus récents projets solaires d’Amazon en Espagne ajoutent, ensemble, plus de 170 MW au réseau. Le tout dernier projet d’Amazon en Suède est un projet éolien terrestre de 258 MW situé dans le nord de la Suède. Une carte de tous les projets d’énergie renouvelable d’Amazon à travers le monde est disponible ici. « Amazon est un leader dans l’achat d’énergie renouvelable et change continuellement le marché grâce à ses innovations continues et à ses investissements dans les énergies renouvelables. Nous sommes ravis des derniers engagements d’Amazon à travers le monde, notamment en Espagne, en Suède et au Royaume-Uni. Les investissements à long terme comme ceux-ci sont essentiels pour que les entreprises se rapprochent de la neutralité climatique », a ajouté Hannah Hunt, directrice de l’impact chez RE-Source, une plateforme d’entreprise d’approvisionnement en énergie renouvelable en Europe. « Amazon continue de jouer un rôle clé dans la transition des entreprises vers les énergies renouvelables à l’échelle mondiale et apporte la preuve que des objectifs ambitieux en matière d’énergie renouvelable sont à la fois réalisables et largement bénéfiques », a confié par ailleurs Gregory Wetstone, président et chef de la direction de l’American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE). « Les neuf nouveaux projets d’énergie propre de la société portent sa capacité d’énergie renouvelable mondiale à un impressionnant total record de 8,5 gigawatts et incluent le premier projet solaire avec stockage d’Amazon, qui fait appel à une technologie de pointe pour aider à fournir un réseau propre et fiable. » « Les grandes entreprises comme Amazon reconnaissent la valeur que l’énergie solaire peut apporter à leurs activités et à la planète », a ajouté Abigail Ross Hopper, présidente et cheffe de la direction de la Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). « Nous sommes ravis de constater qu’Amazon respecte ses engagements climatiques et investit dans des actifs d’énergie renouvelable à travers le monde. Wall Street, clients et entreprises internationales observent tous ce que font les entreprises américaines face au changement climatique, et ce type de leadership peut avoir un impact majeur sur la crise climatique. » En 2019, Amazon et Global Optimism ont cofondé l’Engagement Climat (The Climate Pledge), qui vise à honorer l’Accord de Paris sur le climat avec 10 années d’avance sur les objectifs, et à atteindre la neutralité carbone d’ici 2040. Cet engagement compte aujourd’hui 53 signataires, parmi lesquels figurent IBM, Unilever, Verizon, Siemens, Microsoft et Best Buy. Pour atteindre cet objectif, Amazon va continuer de réduire ses émissions dans l’ensemble de ses opérations et aussi établir un moyen d’alimenter en électricité ses opérations à partir de 100 % d’énergies renouvelables, avec cinq ans d’avance sur l’objectif initial de 2030 que s’était fixé la société ; en concrétisant sa vision « Shipment Zero » qui consiste à atteindre la neutralité carbone pour toutes ses expéditions, et une neutralité carbone à hauteur de 50 % d’ici 2030 ; en procédant à l’achat de 100 000 véhicules de livraison électriques, soit la plus grande commande de véhicules de cette sorte jamais passée ; et en investissant, via le Climate Pledge Fund, 2 milliards USD dans le développement de services et de solutions de décarbonisation.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon and Global Optimism announced that more than 100 companies have now signed The Climate Pledge. Among the 52 new signatories joining The Climate Pledge today are well-known brands including Alaska Airlines, Colgate-Palmolive, HEINEKEN, PepsiCo, Telefónica, and Visa. Pledge signatories in total generate more than $1.4 trillion in global annual sales and have more than 5 million employees across 25 industries in 16 countries—demonstrating the collective impact The Climate Pledge can have in addressing climate change. Signatories to The Climate Pledge agree to: Measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis. Implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through real business changes and innovations, including efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon emission elimination strategies. Neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets to achieve net-zero annual carbon emissions by 2040—a decade ahead of the Paris Agreement’s goal of 2050. All signatories are taking science-based, high-impact actions to tackle climate change by innovating in supply chain efficiency, sustainable transportation, circular economy, clean energy solutions, and more. Many organizations are also meaningfully involving customers in their journey to net-zero with initiatives focused on innovative packaging and sustainable product design and development, while delivering solutions to empower customers to reduce their own emissions with educational campaigns and sustainable shopping experiences. “Less than two years ago, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge and called on other companies to reach the Paris Agreement 10 years early—today, more than 100 companies with over $1.4 trillion in global annual revenues and more than 5 million employees have signed the pledge,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. “We are proud to stand with other signatories to use our scale to decarbonize the economy through real business change and innovation.” “We helped to initiate The Climate Pledge to prove a model that accelerates decarbonization with the most ambitious companies,” said Christiana Figueres, the UN’s former climate chief and now founding partner of Global Optimism. “Today over 100 companies, including household brands and companies from all industry sectors, have joined The Climate Pledge with its goal of net-zero by 2040. They are demonstrating that moving faster toward decarbonizing their businesses is a pathway to competitive advantage. There is no doubt we’re at a tipping point to establish the low carbon economy envisioned in the Paris Agreement. I commend the leadership of the companies that have joined The Climate Pledge already and look forward to welcoming the next 100.” Amazon and Global Optimism welcome the new signatories that have committed to The Climate Pledge. Information about all 52 new signatories that have committed to The Climate Pledge is available at the About Amazon blog, with new signatories including: Alaska Airlines Alaska Airlines serves more than 120 destinations across the United States, Mexico, Canada and Costa Rica, and reaches destinations around the globe through the Oneworld Alliance. The company has a longstanding commitment to care for people and the environment, and is setting out on a bold path to reduce climate impact near and long term to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. This includes continued improvements in efficiency of its fleet; standardizing and expanding the use of first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to plan optimized routes, reduce fuel burn, and carbon emissions; working with government and industry to expand the availability and use of sustainable aviation fuels, which have up to 80% less carbon emissions on a lifecycle basis; exploring and advancing novel propulsion approaches that support electrification technologies for regional flying; and investing in credible carbon offsets to close any gaps to target. The company is already reducing emissions through fleet optimization, saving fuel with its aircrafts’ uniquely designed winglets, and navigation technology that sources the most efficient route. Through its broader social and environmental sustainability program, LIFT, Alaska Airlines invites customers to donate their miles to support nonprofits such as the Nature Conservancy and UNCF, to purchase carbon offsets with The Good Traveler, and to reduce waste through in-flight recycling (temporarily paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic), and traveling with reusable water bottles through the company’s #FillBeforeYouFly initiative. “At Alaska Airlines, we know that travel can make a big difference in people’s lives, and we’re committed to operating in a socially and environmentally responsible way,” said Ben Minicucci, Alaska Airlines CEO. “We’re on a journey to ensure that sustainability is a core part of our culture, and we are grateful for partners within the aviation industry and beyond who are working with us to make the path to net-zero a reality. It will truly take a village to get there and joining the other sustainability-minded companies as part of The Climate Pledge is an important step.” Colgate-Palmolive Around the world, Colgate-Palmolive is reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets, and our planet. The company is committed to preserving the environment by accelerating action on climate change. One critical priority is achieving renewable energy across all operations by 2030 through solar installations and power purchase agreements. With household brands including Colgate, Palmolive, Tom’s of Maine, Hill’s, and more, Colgate-Palmolive serves billions of people across the globe. The company is committed to growth and to operating responsibly and sustainably for the people, customers, and the communities it serves. It continually looks for better and more sustainable ways to make its products and packaging, and seeks opportunities to use less plastic, water, and energy while minimizing waste. In 2019, Colgate introduced a first-of-its-kind recyclable toothpaste tube, with the goal of transitioning its global portfolio by 2025. Colgate is now sharing its technology with third parties, including competitors, to support transformation of all tubes. The company is also leading the charge on promoting water conservation through its Save Water initiative, which encourages customers to \"turn off the tap\" while brushing, helping people save 155 billion gallons of water and 8.3 million metric tons of greenhouse gas since 2016. “Colgate is proud to join The Climate Pledge, understanding that accountability, partnership, and collaboration are essential to producing the sustainable environmental improvements we all want,\" said Prabha Parameswaran, Colgate-Palmolive, Global President. \"With the Colgate brand found in more homes than any other, we’ve embraced our extraordinary opportunity—and responsibility—to reduce our environmental footprint and accelerate action on climate change. We are proud of the progress we’ve made and committed to doing more as our company works hard to reimagine a healthier future for all people, their pets, and our planet.” HEINEKEN Serving consumers across the globe, HEINEKEN recognizes the importance of running not only a profitable business, but also a sustainable one. The company’s decade long sustainable development ambition, Brew a Better World, demonstrates its commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, building a roadmap against these goals and their specified targets to ensure meaningful and transparent contributions to protecting the planet, ensuring prosperity, and ending poverty. As a part of this ambition, HEINEKEN has already achieved a 51% decrease in carbon emissions and a 33% decrease in water consumption across its operations since 2008. The company’s sustainability efforts span the entire value chain “from Barley to Bar” by supporting sustainable agriculture, brewing, packaging, and distribution, and advocating for responsible consumption of alcohol. “For over 150 years, we’ve been passionate about making a positive impact on the world around us. We know that we can only thrive if our people, the planet, and the communities around us thrive,” said Dolf van den Brink, HEINEKEN chairman and CEO. “This means looking at Brew a Better World in every one of our activities. We know actions speak louder than words and that achieving real and lasting change is only possible through collective effort. We must think and act holistically when considering how Brew a Better World positively impacts the entire HEINEKEN ecosystem— including our employees, partners and suppliers, NGOs, governments, local communities, and other stakeholders. By joining The Climate Pledge, we are reinforcing our commitment to sustainability, and are pleased to join a community that will share knowledge, ideas, and best practices.” PepsiCo With a portfolio of iconic brands—including Quaker, Walkers, Gatorade, Doritos, and SodaStream—and a wide range of food and beverage products that are enjoyed by customers across the world, PepsiCo is committed to using its scale, reach, and expertise to help build a more sustainable food system. PepsiCo envisions a food system that can provide nutrition and enjoyment, and continue to drive economic and social development, all without exceeding the natural boundaries of the planet. The company is focused on promoting sustainable agriculture, addressing water insecurity, eliminating plastic waste, developing more nutritious and sustainable products, and reducing GHG emissions across its value chain. As part of this effort, PepsiCo is working to build a world where packaging doesn’t become waste. Currently, 88% of the company’s packaging is recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable, with a goal to reach 100% by 2025. PepsiCo also continues to expand its Sustainable from the Start program, an initiative that considers environmental impact at each stage of product development. In January 2021, PepsiCo announced a new science-based goal to cut its carbon emissions by more than 40% by 2030 (against a 2015 baseline)—more than doubling its previous climate commitment, and aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040. “PepsiCo is delighted to join The Climate Pledge as we continue our work to help build a more sustainable and regenerative food system,” said Ramon Laguarta, PepsiCo chairman and CEO. “At a time when the world is struggling to recover from the shock of a global pandemic, shared solutions to shared challenges are essential. We all must do our parts individually, but also come together to tackle climate change and reach net-zero emissions by 2040.” Telefónica As one of the largest telephone operators and mobile network providers in the world, Telefónica is committed to reducing its own carbon footprint, as well as delivering solutions to empower customers to reduce their own emissions. Telefónica is already committed to reducing the emissions of its entire value chain in line with the 1.5 degrees Celsius scenario. This includes a commitment to having net-zero emissions by 2025 across its operations in key markets (Spain, UK, Germany, and Brazil), with operations in Latin America and its broader value chain net-zero by 2040. The company is also committed to helping its customers reduce emissions through connectivity and its Eco Smart services, a product seal that helps shoppers easily incorporate sustainability criteria into their purchasing decisions. Last year, Eco Smart helped customers avoid more than 9.5 million tons of CO2, the carbon equivalent to planting 158 million trees. “Our energy and climate change strategy centers on mitigating our impact, leveraging new opportunities, and evolving to address climate risks,” said Elena Valderrábano, Telefónica global director for corporate ethics and sustainability. “By joining The Climate Pledge, we are reinforcing our commitment to sustainability, and we’re pleased to join a community of other leading companies putting sustainability first.” Visa As a leading global payments technology company, Visa is committed to contributing to a more sustainable and inclusive world, including playing an industry leadership role in the global transition to a low-carbon economy. Visa’s sustainability track record includes achieving its goal in 2020 to fully transition to 100% renewable electricity, improving the sustainability of our offices and data centers through energy and water efficiency, landfill waste diversions, and a global Green Teams program for employees. In 2020, Visa issued a $500 million green bond, believed to be the first of its kind by a digital payments network, in support of these efforts. Visa also continues to inspire and empower sustainable commerce with strategic partnerships and programs focused on embedding sustainability in payment cards and accounts, and enabling sustainable behaviors through its work in transit, electric vehicle charging, travel, and tourism. “At Visa, we’re committed to sustainability and to creating a more sustainable future,” said Alfred F. Kelly Jr., Visa chairman and CEO. “We’re proud to join The Climate Pledge as part of our pledge to net-zero emissions by 2040, and we look forward to collaborating with signatories to advance this important work.” About The Climate Pledge In 2019, Amazon and Global Optimism co-founded The Climate Pledge, a commitment to reach the Paris Agreement 10 years early and be net-zero carbon by 2040. Now 105 organizations have signed The Climate Pledge, sending an important signal that there will be rapid growth in demand for products and services that help reduce carbon emissions.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that DISH Network Corporation (DISH) (NASDAQ: DISH) selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider and will construct its 5G network on AWS, part of a strategic collaboration agreement under which both companies will work to transform how organizations and customers, including AWS and Amazon, order and consume 5G services or create their own private 5G networks. DISH is deploying the first standalone, cloud-based 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) in the United States, beginning with Las Vegas later this year. DISH will connect all of its hardware and network management resources through the world’s leading cloud to enable secure, rapid scaling and innovation as well as on-demand responsiveness to customers’ wireless needs. Given this marks the first time that a 5G network will be run in the cloud, DISH will achieve agile and cost-effective operations while seeking to redefine the practical applications of 5G. As DISH deploys its network, the company is partnering exclusively with vendors offering cloud-native technology, bringing them together on AWS to provide DISH customers greater flexibility and control of their 5G-enabled solutions. DISH will leverage AWS’s proven infrastructure and breadth of services to deploy a cloud-native 5G network that incorporates O-RAN – the antennas and base stations that link phones and other wireless devices to the network – and the 5G Core – the logical architecture that directs traffic flow within the network. AWS will also power DISH’s fully automated Operation and Business Support Systems (OSS and BSS) that will enable the company to provision and operate its customers’ 5G workloads and monetize its network. By building its network on AWS, DISH is also simplifying the process for developers to create new 5G applications. DISH developers and customers, as well as the AWS developer community, will be able to create innovative 5G solutions across a variety of industries by leveraging standardized application programming interfaces (APIs) to engage with data on DISH network attributes such as user equipment latency, bit rate, quality of service, and equipment location. Developers can then leverage AWS services and partner capabilities in machine learning, analytics, security, and more to create responsive solutions that use that data. For instance, they could offer low-latency augmented reality gaming experiences optimized for the user’s device, serve contextual advertising, or orchestrate the movements of a robot at a disaster site. “Through this collaboration with AWS, we will operate not just as a communications services provider, but as a digital services provider harnessing the combined power of 5G connectivity and the cloud. Together, we will enable our customers to take full advantage of the potential of 5G. Our approach will revolutionize wireless connectivity by giving customers the ability to customize and scale their network experience on-demand,” said Charlie Ergen, DISH co-founder and chairman. “As a new carrier, leveraging AWS and its extensive network of partners enables us to differentiate ourselves by operating our 5G network with a high degree of automation, utilizing the talent of AWS-trained developers and helping our customers bring new 5G applications to market faster than ever before.” “DISH’s cloud-native and truly virtualized 5G network is a clear example of how AWS customers can use our proven infrastructure and unparalleled portfolio of services to reinvent industries,” said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Inc. “This collaboration means DISH and its customers can bring new consumer- and enterprise-centric services to the market as quickly as they’re created to deliver on the promise of 5G. Together, we’re opening the door to new technologies that will transform factories, workplaces, entertainment, and transportation in ways people have only dreamed.” 5G wireless is rapidly emerging as an enabling technology for industry use cases such as smart factories, personalized healthcare, self-driving vehicles, and immersive gaming that require extreme low latency, connectivity and data processing. DISH will use its 5G network to connect mobile and IoT devices like smartphones, robots, factory equipment, wearables, and other physical sensors to AWS to offload compute, analytics, machine learning, and related workloads, enabling systems to act on device data in real time. DISH can also leverage AWS to tailor performance for individual customer use cases on demand, by optimizing network attributes such as transmission speed or network availability through a process known as “network slicing.” For instance, if an enterprise wanted to set consistent performance standards for when its customers stream videos, they could request a dedicated network slice that is tailored for high-data-rate video distribution. DISH will tap into AWS’s extensive roster of telecommunications partners, as well as AWS Professional Services, to automate deployment of 5G network slices and deliver results at unparalleled speeds instead of the months it currently takes with existing manual processes. Running on AWS, DISH’s 5G network will also significantly outpace legacy networks in the speed with which it can facilitate hardware and software upgrades. To support real-time workloads at the network edge and quickly process inbound and outbound data from its O-RAN infrastructure, DISH will leverage AWS Local Zones and AWS Outposts. AWS Local Zones are an infrastructure deployment that places AWS compute, storage, database, and other select services close to large population, industry, and IT centers for applications requiring single-digit millisecond latency, while AWS Outposts extend AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to virtually any on-premises facility, such as the factory floor or a 5G base station. With this combination of AWS infrastructure, DISH can push its 5G Core to the edge and achieve consistently high performance across its service area, while also enabling developers to take full advantage of 5G speeds when building new applications and services. In addition, DISH will use AWS capabilities such as compute, containers, IoT, machine learning, and security to process 5G data and run its 5G Core, BSS, and OSS at scale while optimizing costs. DISH will use AWS Graviton2-based instances to power its compute workloads (AWS’s custom-designed Graviton2 processors with 64-bit Arm Neoverse cores provide up to 40% better price-performance over comparable current-generation x86-based instances) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) to run containerized workloads, helping it deliver high availability during periods of peak network use. Running its 5G network over AWS will allow DISH to further reduce costs by bypassing the capital expenditure investments typically associated with building and operating network infrastructure hardware. DISH will also apply AWS machine learning capabilities at the network edge to help improve service by predicting network congestion at specific locations, as well as recognizing anomalies in network function, and then automatically taking corrective actions to optimize performance. About Amazon Web Services For over 15 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any cloud workload, and it now has more than 200 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 80 Availability Zones (AZs) within 25 geographic regions, with announced plans for 15 more Availability Zones and five more AWS Regions in Australia, India, Indonesia, Spain, and Switzerland.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hoje, a Amazon e a Global Optimism anunciaram que mais de 100 empresas já assinaram o The Climate Pledge. Entre os 52 novos signatários que se juntam ao The Climate Pledge hoje estão marcas bem conhecidas, incluindo Alaska Airlines, Colgate-Palmolive, HEINEKEN, PepsiCo, Telefónica e Visa. Os signatários do Pledge no total geram mais de US$ 1,4 trilhão em vendas anuais globais e têm mais de 5 milhões de funcionários em 25 setores em 16 países - demonstrando o impacto coletivo que o The Climate Pledge pode ter na abordagem das mudanças climáticas. Os signatários do The Climate Pledge concordam em: Medir e informar regularmente as emissões de gases de efeito estufa. Implementar estratégias de descarbonização alinhadas ao Acordo de Paris por meio de mudanças e inovações reais nos negócios, incluindo melhorias de eficiência, energia renovável, redução de materiais e outras estratégias de eliminação de emissões de carbono. Neutralizar as emissões restantes com compensações adicionais, quantificáveis, reais, permanentes e socialmente benéficas para atingir emissão anuais zero de carbono até 2040—uma década antes do objetivo para 2050 do Acordo de Paris. Todos os signatários estão tomando ações de alto impacto baseadas na ciência para enfrentar as mudanças climáticas, inovando na eficiência da cadeia de suprimentos, transporte sustentável, economia circular, soluções de energia limpa e muito mais. Muitas organizações também estão envolvendo significativamente os clientes em sua jornada para chegar a zero com iniciativas focadas em embalagens inovadoras e design e desenvolvimento de produtos sustentáveis, enquanto fornecem soluções para capacitar os clientes a reduzir suas próprias emissões com campanhas educacionais e experiências de compra sustentáveis. “Menos de dois anos atrás, a Amazon cofundou o The Climate Pledge e convocou outras empresas para chegar ao Acordo de Paris 10 anos antes - hoje, mais de 100 empresas com mais de US$ 1,4 trilhão em receitas anuais globais e mais de 5 milhões de funcionários assinaram a promessa”, disse Jeff Bezos, fundador e diretor executivo da Amazon. “Estamos orgulhosos de estar ao lado de outros signatários para usar nossa escala para descarbonizar a economia por meio de mudanças e inovações reais nos negócios.” “Ajudamos a iniciar o The Climate Pledge para provar um modelo que acelera a descarbonização com as empresas mais ambiciosas”, disse Christiana Figueres, ex-chefe do clima da ONU e agora sócia fundadora da Global Optimism. “Hoje, mais de 100 empresas, incluindo marcas domésticas e empresas de todos os setores da indústria, aderiram ao The Climate Pledge com sua meta de zero líquido até 2040. Eles estão demonstrando que avançar mais rapidamente para a descarbonização de seus negócios é um caminho para obter vantagem competitiva. Não há dúvida de que estamos em um ponto crítico para estabelecer a economia de baixo carbono prevista no Acordo de Paris. Elogio a liderança das empresas que já aderiram ao The Climate Pledge e estou ansioso para dar as boas-vindas às próximas 100”. A Amazon e o Global Optimism dão as boas-vindas aos novos signatários que se comprometeram com o The Climate Pledge. Informações sobre todos os 52 novos signatários que se comprometeram com o The Climate Pledge estão disponíveis no blog Sobre a Amazon, com novos signatários, incluindo: Alaska Airlines A Alaska Airlines atende a mais de 120 destinos nos Estados Unidos, México, Canadá e Costa Rica, e atinge destinos em todo o mundo por meio da Oneworld Alliance. A empresa tem um compromisso de longa data com o cuidado com as pessoas e o meio ambiente e está se preparando para um caminho ousado para reduzir o impacto climático a curto e longo prazo para atingir as emissão líquida zero até 2040. Isso inclui melhorias contínuas na eficiência de sua frota; padronizar e expandir o uso da inteligência artificial inédita e tecnologia de aprendizado de máquina para planejar rotas otimizadas, reduzir a queima de combustível e as emissões de carbono; trabalhar com o governo e a indústria para expandir a disponibilidade e o uso de combustíveis de aviação sustentáveis, que têm até 80% menos emissões de carbono em um ciclo de vida; explorar e avançar novas abordagens de propulsão que suportam tecnologias de eletrificação para voos regionais; e investir em compensações de carbono confiáveis ​​para fechar quaisquer lacunas para o objetivo. A empresa já está reduzindo as emissões por meio da otimização da frota, economizando combustível com os winglets de design exclusivo de suas aeronaves e tecnologia de navegação que fornece a rota mais eficiente. Por meio de seu programa de sustentabilidade social e ambiental mais amplo, LIFT, Alaska Airlines convida os clientes a doar suas milhas para apoiar organizações sem fins lucrativos como a Nature Conservancy e UNCF, comprar compensações de carbono com The Good Traveller e reduzir o desperdício por meio da reciclagem em voo (temporariamente pausado devido à pandemia COVID-19), e viajando com garrafas de água reutilizáveis ​​por meio da iniciativa #FillBeforeYouFly da empresa. “Na Alaska Airlines, sabemos que as viagens podem fazer uma grande diferença na vida das pessoas e temos o compromisso de operar de forma social e ambientalmente responsável”, disse Ben Minicucci, diretor executivo da Alaska Airlines. “Estamos em uma jornada para garantir que a sustentabilidade seja uma parte essencial de nossa cultura e somos gratos aos parceiros dentro da indústria da aviação e além que estão trabalhando conosco para tornar o caminho para a rede zero uma realidade. Será preciso muito esforço para chegar lá e juntar-se a outras empresas preocupadas com a sustentabilidade como parte do The Climate Pledge é um passo importante.” Colgate-Palmolive Em todo o mundo, a Colgate-Palmolive está reimaginando um futuro mais saudável para todas as pessoas, seus animais de estimação e nosso planeta. A empresa está comprometida com a preservação do meio ambiente, acelerando as ações contra as mudanças climáticas. Uma prioridade crítica é conseguir energia renovável em todas as operações até 2030 por meio de instalações solares e contratos de compra de energia. Com marcas domésticas, incluindo Colgate, Palmolive, Tom’s of Maine, Hill’s e muito mais, a Colgate-Palmolive atende bilhões de pessoas em todo o mundo. A empresa está comprometida com o crescimento e com a operação responsável e sustentável pelas pessoas, clientes e comunidades que atende. Ela busca continuamente maneiras melhores e mais sustentáveis ​​de fazer seus produtos e embalagens e busca oportunidades de usar menos plástico, água e energia, minimizando o desperdício. Em 2019, a Colgate lançou um tubo de pasta de dente reciclável, o primeiro de seu tipo, com o objetivo de fazer a transição de seu portfólio global até 2025. A Colgate agora está compartilhando sua tecnologia com terceiros, incluindo concorrentes, para apoiar a transformação de todos os tubos. A empresa também está liderando a promoção da conservação da água por meio de sua iniciativa Save Water, que incentiva os clientes a “fecharem a torneira” durante a escovação, ajudando as pessoas a economizar 155 bilhões de galões de água e 8,3 milhões de toneladas métricas de gases de efeito estufa desde 2016. “A Colgate tem orgulho de se juntar ao The Climate Pledge, entendendo que responsabilidade, parceria e colaboração são essenciais para produzir as melhorias ambientais sustentáveis ​​que todos desejamos”, disse Prabha Parameswaran, presidente global da Colgate-Palmolive. “Com a marca Colgate encontrada em mais residências do que qualquer outra, abraçamos nossa extraordinária oportunidade - e responsabilidade - de reduzir nossa pegada ambiental e acelerar a ação contra as mudanças climáticas. Estamos orgulhosos do progresso que fizemos e nos comprometemos a fazer mais à medida que nossa empresa trabalha duro para reimaginar um futuro mais saudável para todas as pessoas, seus animais de estimação e nosso planeta.” HEINEKEN Atendendo consumidores em todo o mundo, a HEINEKEN reconhece a importância de administrar não apenas um negócio lucrativo, mas também sustentável. A ambição de desenvolvimento sustentável de uma década da empresa, ‘Construir um Mundo Melhor’ (Brew a Better World), demonstra seu compromisso com os Objetivos de Desenvolvimento Sustentável da ONU, construindo um roteiro contra esses objetivos e suas metas específicas para garantir contribuições significativas e transparentes para proteger o planeta, garantindo a prosperidade e acabando com a pobreza. Como parte dessa ambição, a HEINEKEN já alcançou uma redução de 51% nas emissões de carbono e uma redução de 33% no consumo de água em todas as suas operações desde 2008. Os esforços de sustentabilidade da empresa abrangem toda a cadeia de valor “da cevada ao bar”, apoiando a agricultura, produção da cerveja, embalagem e distribuição sustentáveis ​​e defendendo o consumo responsável de álcool. “Por mais de 150 anos, temos sido apaixonados por causar um impacto positivo no mundo ao nosso redor. Sabemos que só podemos prosperar se nosso povo, o planeta e as comunidades ao nosso redor prosperarem”, disse Dolf van den Brink, presidente e diretor executivo da HEINEKEN. “Isso significa olhar para ‘Construir um Mundo Melhor’ em cada uma de nossas atividades. Sabemos que as ações falam mais alto que as palavras e que alcançar mudanças reais e duradouras só é possível por meio do esforço coletivo. Devemos pensar e agir holisticamente ao considerar como ‘Construir um Mundo Melhor’ impacta positivamente todo o ecossistema da HEINEKEN - incluindo nossos funcionários, parceiros e fornecedores, ONGs, governos, comunidades locais e outras partes interessadas. Ao aderir ao The Climate Pledge, reforçamos nosso compromisso com a sustentabilidade e temos o prazer de fazer parte de uma comunidade que compartilhará conhecimento, ideias e melhores práticas”. PepsiCo Com um portfólio de marcas icônicas - incluindo Quaker, Walkers, Gatorade, Doritos e SodaStream - e uma ampla variedade de produtos alimentícios e de bebidas apreciados por clientes em todo o mundo, a PepsiCo está comprometida em usar sua escala, alcance e experiência para ajudar a construir um sistema alimentar mais sustentável. A PepsiCo prevê um sistema alimentar que pode fornecer nutrição e prazer e continuar a impulsionar o desenvolvimento econômico e social, tudo sem exceder os limites naturais do planeta. A empresa está focada em promover uma agricultura sustentável, abordando a insegurança hídrica, eliminando resíduos de plástico, desenvolvendo produtos mais nutritivos e sustentáveis ​​e reduzindo as emissões de GEE em sua cadeia de valor. Como parte desse esforço, a PepsiCo está trabalhando para construir um mundo onde a embalagem não se torne lixo. Atualmente, 88% das embalagens da empresa são recicláveis, compostáveis ​​ou biodegradáveis, com meta de atingir 100% até 2025. A PepsiCo também continua a expandir seu programa Sustentável desde o Início, uma iniciativa que considera o impacto ambiental em cada estágio de desenvolvimento do produto. Em janeiro de 2021, a PepsiCo anunciou uma nova meta baseada na ciência para cortar suas emissões de carbono em mais de 40% até 2030 (em comparação com a linha de base de 2015) - mais do que dobrando seu compromisso climático anterior e com o objetivo de atingir emissões líquidas zero até 2040. “A PepsiCo tem o prazer de se juntar ao The Climate Pledge enquanto continuamos nosso trabalho para ajudar a construir um sistema alimentar mais sustentável e regenerativo”, disse Ramon Laguarta, presidente e presidente executivo da PepsiCo. “Em um momento em que o mundo está lutando para se recuperar do choque de uma pandemia global, soluções compartilhadas para desafios compartilhados são essenciais. Todos nós devemos fazer nossas partes individualmente, mas também nos unir para enfrentar as mudanças climáticas e atingir as emissões líquidas zero até 2040.” Telefónica Como uma das maiores operadoras de telefonia e provedores de rede móvel do mundo, a Telefónica está empenhada em reduzir sua própria pegada de carbono, bem como fornecer soluções para capacitar os clientes a reduzir suas próprias emissões. A Telefónica já está comprometida com a redução das emissões de toda a sua cadeia de valor em linha com o cenário de 1,5 graus Celsius. Isso inclui o compromisso de ter emissões líquidas zero até 2025 em todas as suas operações nos principais mercados (Espanha, Reino Unido, Alemanha e Brasil), com operações na América Latina e sua cadeia de valor líquida zero mais ampla até 2040. A empresa também está empenhada em ajudar seus clientes a reduzir as emissões por meio da conectividade e de seus serviços Eco Smart, um selo de produto que ajuda os compradores a incorporar facilmente os critérios de sustentabilidade em suas decisões de compra. No ano passado, o Eco Smart ajudou os clientes a evitar mais de 9,5 milhões de toneladas de CO2, o carbono equivalente ao plantio de 158 milhões de árvores. “Nossa estratégia de energia e mudança climática se concentra em minimizar nosso impacto, aproveitar novas oportunidades e evoluir para enfrentar os riscos climáticos”, disse Elena Valderrábano, diretora global de ética corporativa e sustentabilidade da Telefónica. “Ao aderir ao The Climate Pledge, estamos reforçando nosso compromisso com a sustentabilidade e temos o prazer de nos associar a uma comunidade de outras empresas líderes que colocam a sustentabilidade em primeiro lugar.” Visa Como empresa líder global em tecnologia de pagamentos, a Visa está comprometida em contribuir para um mundo mais sustentável e inclusivo, incluindo um papel de liderança do setor na transição global para uma economia de baixo carbono. O histórico de sustentabilidade da Visa inclui atingir sua meta em 2020 de fazer uma transição completa para 100% de eletricidade renovável, melhorando a sustentabilidade de nossos escritórios e data centers por meio da eficiência de energia e água, desvios de resíduos de aterros e um programa global de equipes verdes para funcionários. Em 2020, a Visa emitiu um título verde de US$ 500 milhões, considerado o primeiro de seu tipo por uma rede de pagamentos digitais, em apoio a esses esforços. A Visa também continua a inspirar e capacitar o comércio sustentável com parcerias estratégicas e programas focados na incorporação da sustentabilidade em cartões de pagamento e contas, e permitindo comportamentos sustentáveis ​​por meio de seu trabalho em trânsito, carregamento de veículos elétricos, viagens e turismo. “Na Visa, estamos comprometidos com a sustentabilidade e com a criação de um futuro mais sustentável”, disse Alfred F. Kelly Jr., presidente e diretor executivo da Visa. “Estamos orgulhosos de aderir ao The Climate Pledge como parte de nossa promessa de emissões líquidas zero até 2040, e esperamos colaborar com os signatários para o avanço deste importante trabalho.” Sobre The Climate Pledge Em 2019, a Amazon e o Global Optimism cofundaram o The Climate Pledge, um compromisso para alcançar o Acordo de Paris 10 anos antes e eliminar a emissão de carbono até 2040. Agora 105 organizações assinaram o The Climate Pledge, enviando um sinal importante de que haverá um rápido crescimento na demanda por produtos e serviços que ajudem a reduzir as emissões de carbono.

UST Lime Visa 承诺加入《气候宣言》的全部52家新签约组织的信息，可参考亚马逊博客，新签约的知名组织包括： 阿拉斯加航空公司(Alaska Airlines) 阿拉斯加航空公司在美国、墨西哥、加拿大和哥斯达黎加的120多个目的地开展运营，并通过寰宇一家(Oneworld Alliance)通达全球各地。公司长期致力于关爱人类和环境，制定了极具魄力的路线图计划，通过降低近期和长期气候影响达到2040年净零排放的目标。其计划包括持续提升机队效率；标准化和扩大使用最先进的人工智能和机器学习技术，以规划最优路线、减少燃料燃烧和碳排放；与政府和工业部门合作，扩大可持续航空燃料的供应和使用，此类燃料在生命周期内的碳排放量可减少多达80%；探索和促进有助于支持支线航班电气化技术的新型推进系统；投资于可信的碳抵消，以弥补与目标的差距。公司已通过机队优化来减少排放量，通过独特设计的飞机小翼以及提供最有效路线的导航技术来节省燃料。阿拉斯加航空公司还通过其更广泛的社会和环境可持续发展项目“LIFT”邀请乘客捐赠自己的里程，以支持大自然保护协会(Nature Conservancy)和联合国儿童基金(UNCF)等非营利组织，公司还鼓励乘客向The Good Traveler购买碳抵消量，通过机上回收减少废物（由于新冠肺炎疫情临时暂停），并响应公司的#FillBeforeYouFly倡议在旅行途中携带可重复使用的水壶。 阿拉斯加航空公司首席执行官Ben Minicucci表示：“阿拉斯加航空公司深知，旅行能够大幅改变人们的生活，我们致力于以对社会和环境负责的方式开展运营，正努力确保将可持续发展作为我们公司文化的核心组成部分，感谢航空业和其他领域的伙伴与我们开展合作，使走向净零碳的道路成为现实。人类的确需要同心协力才能达成这一目标，加入《气候宣言》承诺，与其他注重可持续发展的公司共同努力，是其中的重要一步。” 高露洁棕榄 高露洁棕榄正在世界各地为所有人、他们的宠物和我们的地球重新构想一个更健康的未来。公司致力于通过加快应对气候变化的行动来保护环境。其中一个关键优先事项是，通过太阳能装置和电力购买协议，到2030年在所有运营中实现使用可再生能源的目标。高露洁棕榄旗下拥有高露洁、棕榄、Tom’s of Maine、Hill’s等家喻户晓的品牌，为全球数十亿人服务。公司致力于增长，并为其服务的顾客、客户和社区实现负责任且可持续的运营。公司不断寻找更好、更可持续的方法来生产产品和包装，并寻求机会减少使用塑料、水和能源，并尽可能减少产生的废物。2019年，高露洁推出了首款可回收牙膏管，并希望到2025年升级其全球产品组合。高露洁现正与包括竞争对手在内的第三方分享其技术，以支持所有牙膏管的升级。公司还通过“节约用水”(Save Water)倡议引领并促进节水行动，该倡议鼓励顾客在刷牙时“关掉水龙头”，自2016年以来，已帮助人们节省了1,550亿加仑水，并减少了830万吨温室气体排放。 高露洁棕榄全球总裁Prabha Parameswaran表示：“高露洁为能够加入《气候宣言》而倍感自豪，并深知问责制、伙伴关系和协作对于实现人们期待的可持续环境改善至关重要。高露洁品牌覆盖的家庭超过其他任何品牌，我们充分利用这种独一无二的机会和责任，来减少我们的环境足迹，加速应对气候变化的行动。我们为我们所取得的进步而感到自豪，并致力于继续做出更多贡献，我们公司也在努力为所有人、他们的宠物和我们的地球重新构想一个更健康的未来。” 喜力 喜力服务于全球消费者，公司深知不仅要盈利，更重要的是还要具备可持续性。公司十年来的可持续发展宏愿——“酿造更美好的世界” (Brewing a Better World)——彰显出其对联合国可持续发展目标的承诺，公司还针对这些目标及其特定指标制定了路线图，确保为保护地球、确保繁荣和终结贫困做出有意义且透明的贡献。为实现这一宏愿，自2008年以来，喜力的碳排放已减少51%，用水量也减少了33%。公司的可持续发展努力贯穿“从大麦到酒吧”的整个价值链，支持可持续农业、酿造、包装和分销，并倡导负责任的饮酒行为。 喜力董事长兼首席执行官Dolf van den Brink表示：“150多年来，我们一直致力于对我们周围的世界产生积极影响。我们深知，只有我们的员工、地球和周围的社区都充满活力，我们才能蓬勃发展。这意味着在我们的每项活动中都要秉持‘酿造更美好的世界’的原则。我们知道，行动胜于空谈，只有通过集体努力才能实现真正且持久的改变。在考虑如何通过‘酿造更美好的世界’来对整个喜力生态系统（包括我们的员工、合作伙伴和供应商、非政府组织、政府、地方社区和其他利益相关方）产生积极影响时，我们必须全面思考和行动。通过加入《气候宣言》，我们加强了对可持续发展的承诺，也非常高兴加入这个共享知识、想法和最佳实践的社区。” 百事可乐 百事可乐有限公司旗下拥有桂格(Quaker)、Walkers、佳得乐(Gatorade)、多力多滋(Doritos)和SodaStream等标志性品牌组合，以及广受世界各国顾客喜爱的多种食品和饮料产品，致力于利用其规模、影响力和专长来帮助建立一个更可持续的食品系统。百事可乐所设想的食品系统能提供营养和美味，并能够持续推动经济和社会发展，但所有这些都不超过地球所能承受的自然边界。公司致力于促进可持续农业，解决水资源不安全问题，消除塑料废物，开发更有营养和可持续的产品，减少整个价值链的温室气体排放。作为其相关工作的一部分，百事可乐正致力于建立一个不会因包装材料而产生废物的世界。目前，公司88%的包装材料可回收、可堆肥或可生物降解，并希望到2025年达到100%。百事可乐还继续拓展其“从源头实现可持续性”(Sustainable from the Start)倡议，该倡议在产品开发的每个阶段都会考虑环境影响。2021年1月，百事可乐宣布了其基于科学的新目标，即到2030年（与2015年基线相比）减少碳排放40%以上——比公司之前的气候承诺指标增加了一倍以上，并努力在2040年实现净零排放。 百事可乐董事长兼首席执行官Ramon Laguarta表示：“百事可乐很高兴加入《气候宣言》，我们将继续致力于帮助建立更可持续和再生的食品系统。在全世界努力从疫情冲击中恢复之际，以协同解决方案应对共同挑战至关重要。我们都必须做好各自的工作，同时还必须共同应对气候变化并在2040年达到净零碳排放。” 西班牙电信 作为世界上最大的电话运营商和移动网络提供商之一，西班牙电信致力于减少自身碳足迹，并提供解决方案帮助减少客户的排放量。西班牙电信已经致力于按照1.5度温控目标减少其整个价值链的排放量。具体行动包括承诺到2025年在业务运营关键市场（西班牙、英国、德国和巴西）达到净零排放，到2040年在拉丁美洲的业务运营和更广泛的价值链上达到净零排放。公司还致力于通过联网和“生态智能”(Eco Smart)服务帮助客户减排，这是一种产品封条，可帮助购物者轻松将可持续性标准纳入其购买决策中。去年，“生态智能”服务帮助顾客避免了950万吨的二氧化碳排放量，相当于种植1.58亿棵树。 西班牙电信企业道德和可持续发展全球总监Elena Valderrábano表示：“我们的能源和气候变化战略主要侧重于减轻我们对环境的影响，利用新机会，并不断发展以应对气候风险。通过加入《气候宣言》，我们进一步加强了对可持续发展的承诺，很高兴加入其他将可持续发展放在首位的知名公司行列。” Visa 作为全球领先的支付技术公司，Visa致力于为一个更可持续、更包容的世界做出贡献，包括在全球向低碳经济过渡的过程中发挥行业领导作用。Visa在可持续发展领域的往绩包括2020年实现完全过渡到100%可再生电力的目标，通过提升能源和水资源效率、填埋垃圾转移以及针对员工的全球“绿色团队”(Green Teams)项目，来提高我们办公室和数据中心的可持续性。2020年，Visa发行了5亿美元绿色债券，以支持这些工作，据信，这是同类数字支付网络公司中发行的首支绿色债券。Visa还继续通过战略合作伙伴关系和项目来激励和赋能可持续商业，重点是在支付卡和账户中嵌入可持续发展功能，并通过其在交通、电动汽车充电和旅游方面的工作实现可持续发展。 Visa董事长兼首席执行官Alfred F. Kelly Jr.表示：“Visa致力于可持续发展和创造更可持续的未来。我们很荣幸加入《气候宣言》，这是我们实现2040年净零排放承诺的一部分，我们期待与各签约组织携手合作，共同推进这项重要工作。” 关于《气候宣言》 2019年，亚马逊和Global Optimism共同发起《气候宣言》(The Climate Pledge)，承诺提前10年达成《巴黎协定》目标，到2040年实现净零碳排放。截止目前，已有105家机构签署《气候宣言》，这也传达出一个重要信号，即市场对有助于减少碳排放的产品和服务的需求将迅速增长。如需了解更多信息，请访问www.theclimatepledge.com。 关于亚马逊 亚马逊(Amazon)遵循四项原则：客户至上、热衷创新、追求卓越运营和长远思考。亚马逊首创推出的产品和服务包括：用户评论、一键购物、个人化推荐、Prime会员、亚马逊物流、AWS（亚马逊网络服务）、Kindle直接出版(Kindle Direct Publishing)、Kindle、Fire平板电脑、Fire TV、Amazon Echo和Alexa等。如需了解更多信息，请访问www.amazon.com/about。 关于Global Optimism Global Optimism致力于促进整个行业的革命性变化。实现零排放未来并不是一个遥远的挑战。它是我们目前必须按计划完成的目标。各项科学研究均显示，欲在2050年之前实现净零排放的目标，全球变暖必须限制在1.5°C以内，我们必须在2020年到2030年之间使排放量减半。只有世界上每一个人肩负起自己的责任，才有可能解决气候危机。我们与各行各业志同道合的组织携手合作，他们愿意投入努力，和我们共同完成这段极富挑战而又鼓舞人心的旅程。如需了解更多信息，请访问https://globaloptimism.com/。 免责声明：本公告之原文版本乃官方授权版本。译文仅供方便了解之用，烦请参照原文，原文版本乃唯一具法律效力之版本。",

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aujourd'hui, Amazon et Global Optimism ont annoncé que plus de 100 entreprises avaient désormais signé l’Engagement Climat. Parmi les 52 nouveaux signataires qui rejoignent aujourd'hui l'Engagement Climat figurent des marques bien connues telles que Alaska Airlines, Colgate-Palmolive, HEINEKEN, PepsiCo, Telefónica et Visa. Au total, les signataires de cet engagement génèrent plus de 1,4 billion USD de ventes annuelles mondiales et emploient plus de 5 millions d'employés dans 25 industries, à travers 16 pays, ce qui démontre l'impact collectif que l'Engagement Climat peut avoir dans la lutte contre le changement climatique. Ces nouveaux signataires de l’Engagement Climat acceptent de : Mesurer et déclarer leurs émissions de gaz à effet de serre, de façon régulière. Mettre en œuvre des stratégies de décarbonation en phase avec l’Accord de Paris, à travers des modifications réelles de leur entreprise et des innovations, notamment en apportant des améliorations en matière d’efficience, d’énergie renouvelable, de réduction des matériaux et autres stratégies d’élimination des émissions de carbone. Neutraliser toutes les émissions restantes au moyen de compensations supplémentaires, quantifiables, réelles, permanentes et socialement bénéfiques, afin d’atteindre la neutralité carbone d’ici 2040 — avec dix ans d’avance sur l’objectif de l’Accord de Paris de 2050. Tous les signataires prennent des mesures à fort impact basées sur la science, pour lutter contre le changement climatique, en innovant dans l'efficacité de la chaîne d'approvisionnement, le transport durable, l'économie circulaire, les solutions d'énergie propre, etc. De nombreuses organisations impliquent également de manière significative leurs clients dans leur parcours vers la neutralité carbone, avec des initiatives axées sur des emballages innovants et sur la conception et le développement de produits durables, tout en proposant des solutions permettant aux clients de réduire leurs propres émissions, grâce à des campagnes éducatives et des expériences d'achat durables. « Il y a moins de deux ans, Amazon a cofondé l'Engagement Climat et a appelé d'autres entreprises à atteindre les objectifs de l'Accord de Paris avec 10 ans d’avance. Aujourd'hui, plus de 100 entreprises affichant plus de 1,4 billion USD de chiffre d'affaires annuel mondial et employant plus de 5 millions de collaborateurs ont signé l’engagement », a déclaré Jeff Bezos, fondateur et PDG d'Amazon. « Nous sommes fiers de nous rallier aux autres signataires et d’utiliser notre dimension pour décarboner l'économie, grâce à de réels changements commerciaux et l'innovation ». « Nous avons aidé à lancer l'Engagement Climat pour établir un modèle qui accélère la décarbonation avec les entreprises les plus ambitieuses », a déclaré Christiana Figueres, ancienne cheffe de la mission climat de l'ONU et désormais partenaire fondatrice de Global Optimism. Aujourd'hui, plus de 100 entreprises, y compris des marques connues et des entreprises de tous les secteurs industriels, ont rejoint l'Engagement Climat avec son objectif de neutralité carbone d'ici 2040. Elles démontrent que passer plus rapidement à la décarbonation de leurs entreprises est un atout pour obtenir un avantage concurrentiel. Il ne fait aucun doute que nous nous trouvons à un tournant pour établir l’économie sobre en carbone envisagée dans l’Accord de Paris. Je salue le leadership des entreprises qui ont déjà rejoint l'Engagement Climat et j'ai hâte d'accueillir les 100 prochaines ». Amazon et Global Optimism accueillent les nouveaux signataires qui ont adopté l'Engagement Climat. Des informations sur les 52 nouveaux signataires qui ont souscrit à l'Engagement Climat sont disponibles sur le blog About Amazon, avec de nouveaux signataires dont : Alaska Airlines Alaska Airlines dessert plus de 120 destinations à travers les États-Unis, le Mexique, le Canada et le Costa Rica, et atteint des destinations dans le monde entier grâce à l'alliance Oneworld. L'entreprise s'est engagée depuis longtemps à prendre soin des personnes et de l'environnement et s'engage sur une voie audacieuse pour réduire l'impact climatique à court et à long terme, afin d’atteindre des émissions nettes nulles d'ici 2040. Cela comprend l'amélioration continue de l'efficacité de sa flotte ; la normalisation et l'utilisation élargie de la première technologie d'intelligence artificielle et d'apprentissage automatique pour planifier des itinéraires optimisés, la réduction de la consommation de carburant et les émissions de carbone ; la collaboration avec le gouvernement et l'industrie pour accroître la disponibilité et l'utilisation de carburants d'aviation durables, qui produisent jusqu'à 80 % d'émissions de carbone en moins sur la base du cycle de vie ; l’exploration et la progression de nouvelles approches de propulsion qui appuient les technologies d'électrification pour le vol régional ; et l’investissement dans des compensations de carbone crédibles pour combler les écarts par rapport à l'objectif. La société réduit déjà ses émissions grâce à l’optimisation de sa flotte, à des économies de carburant grâce aux winglets de conception unique de ses avions et à la technologie de navigation qui fournit l’itinéraire le plus efficace. Grâce à son programme plus large de durabilité sociale et environnementale, LIFT, Alaska Airlines invite ses clients à faire don de leurs miles pour soutenir des organisations à but non lucratif telles que Nature Conservancy et UNCF, à acheter des compensations de carbone avec The Good Traveller et à réduire les déchets grâce au recyclage en vol (temporairement interrompu en raison de la pandémie de COVID-19) et à voyager avec des bouteilles d'eau réutilisables dans le cadre de l'initiative #FillBeforeYouFly de l'entreprise. « Chez Alaska Airlines, nous savons que les voyages peuvent faire une grande différence dans la vie des gens et nous nous engageons à opérer de manière socialement et écologiquement responsable », a déclaré Ben Minicucci, PDG d'Alaska Airlines. « Nous oeuvrons afin de faire en sorte que la durabilité soit au cœur de notre culture, et nous sommes reconnaissants aux partenaires de l’industrie aéronautique et d’autres secteurs, qui travaillent avec nous pour faire de la voie vers la neutralité carbone une réalité. Il faudra vraiment que tout le monde participe pour y arriver, et rejoindre les autres entreprises soucieuses de la durabilité dans le cadre de l'Engagement Climat est une étape importante ». Colgate-Palmolive Partout dans le monde, Colgate-Palmolive réinvente un avenir plus sain pour tous, leurs animaux de compagnie et notre planète. L'entreprise s'engage à préserver l'environnement en accélérant l'action contre le changement climatique. L'une des priorités essentielles est d'implémenter l'énergie renouvelable dans toutes les opérations d'ici 2030, grâce à des installations solaires et à des accords d'achat d'électricité.

Elle recherche continuellement des moyens meilleurs et plus durables de fabriquer ses produits et emballages, et cherche des opportunités d'utiliser moins de plastique, d'eau et d'énergie tout en minimisant les déchets. En 2019, Colgate a lancé un tube de dentifrice recyclable unique en son genre, dans le but de faire évoluer son portefeuille mondial d'ici 2025. Colgate partage désormais sa technologie avec des tiers, y compris des concurrents, pour soutenir la transformation de tous les tubes. La société est également en première ligne de la promotion de la conservation de l'eau, grâce à son initiative Save Water, qui encourage les clients à « fermer le robinet » pendant le brossage, aidant les gens à économiser 155 milliards de gallons d'eau et 8,3 millions de tonnes métriques de gaz à effet de serre depuis 2016. « Colgate est fier de rejoindre l'Engagement Climat, sachant que la responsabilité, le partenariat et la collaboration sont essentiels pour produire les améliorations environnementales durables que nous souhaitons tous », a déclaré Prabha Parameswaran, président mondial de Colgate-Palmolive. « La marque Colgate étant présente dans plus de foyers que toute autre, nous avons saisi notre extraordinaire opportunité, et responsabilité, de réduire notre empreinte environnementale et d’accélérer l’action contre le changement climatique. Nous sommes fiers des progrès que nous avons réalisés et nous nous engageons à en faire plus, alors que notre entreprise travaille d'arrache-pied pour réinventer un avenir plus sain pour tous, leurs animaux de compagnie et notre planète ».

Nous savons que nous ne pouvons prospérer que si notre peuple, la planète et les communautés qui nous entourent prospèrent », a déclaré Dolf van den Brink, président-directeur général de HEINEKEN. « Cela signifie de garder à l’esprit « Brew a Better World » dans chacune de nos activités. Nous savons que les actions sont plus éloquentes que les mots et qu’un changement réel et durable n’est possible que grâce à un effort collectif. Nous devons penser et agir de manière holistique, lorsque nous considérons comment « Brew a Better World » a un impact positif sur l'ensemble de l'écosystème HEINEKEN - y compris nos employés, partenaires et fournisseurs, les ONG, gouvernements, communautés locales et autres parties prenantes. En rejoignant l’Engagement Climat, nous renforçons notre engagement en faveur de la durabilité, et sommes ravis de rejoindre une communauté qui partagera ses connaissances, ses idées et ses bonnes pratiques ». PepsiCo Avec un portefeuille de marques emblématiques - notamment Quaker, Walkers, Gatorade, Doritos et SodaStream - et une large gamme de produits alimentaires et de boissons appréciés par les clients du monde entier, PepsiCo s'engage à utiliser son échelle, sa portée et son expertise pour aider à construire un système alimentaire plus durable. PepsiCo envisage un système alimentaire qui peut fournir nutrition et plaisir, et continuer à stimuler le développement économique et social, le tout sans dépasser les limites naturelles de la planète. L'entreprise se concentre sur la promotion d'une agriculture durable, la lutte contre l'insécurité de l'eau, l'élimination des déchets plastiques, le développement de produits plus nutritifs et durables et la réduction des émissions de GES tout au long de sa chaîne de valeur. Dans le cadre de cet effort, PepsiCo s’emploie à construire un monde où l’emballage ne devient pas un déchet. Actuellement, 88 % des emballages de l'entreprise sont recyclables, compostables ou biodégradables, avec pour objectif d'atteindre 100 % d'ici 2025. PepsiCo continue également d'étendre son programme « Durable dès le départ », une initiative qui prend en compte l'impact environnemental à chaque étape du développement de produit. En janvier 2021, PepsiCo a annoncé un nouvel objectif scientifique consistant à réduire ses émissions de carbone de plus de 40 % d'ici 2030 (par rapport à une référence de 2015) - plus que doublant son engagement climatique précédent et visant à atteindre des émissions nettes nulles d'ici 2040. « PepsiCo est ravi de rejoindre l'Engagement Climat, alors que nous poursuivons notre travail pour aider à construire un système alimentaire plus durable et régénérateur », a déclaré Ramon Laguarta, président-directeur général de PepsiCo. « À un moment où le monde peine à se remettre du choc d'une pandémie mondiale, des solutions partagées à des défis communs sont essentielles. Nous devons tous faire notre part individuellement, mais aussi nous unir pour lutter contre le changement climatique et atteindre des émissions nettes nulles d'ici 2040 ». Telefónica En tant que l'un des plus grands opérateurs de téléphonie et fournisseurs de réseaux mobiles au monde, Telefónica s'engage à réduire sa propre empreinte carbone, ainsi qu'à fournir des solutions permettant aux clients de réduire leurs propres émissions. Telefónica s'est déjà engagée à réduire les émissions de l'ensemble de sa chaîne de valeur conformément au scénario de 1,5 degrés Celsius. Cela comprend un engagement à avoir des émissions nettes nulles d'ici 2025 dans l'ensemble de ses opérations sur des marchés clés (Espagne, Royaume-Uni, Allemagne et Brésil), avec la neutralité carbone des opérations en Amérique latine et de sa chaîne de valeur plus large d'ici 2040. La société s'engage également à aider ses clients à réduire leurs émissions, grâce à la connectivité et à ses services Eco Smart, un sceau sur le produit qui aide les acheteurs à intégrer facilement des critères de durabilité dans leurs décisions d'achat. L'année dernière, Eco Smart a aidé ses clients à éviter plus de 9,5 millions de tonnes de CO2, l'équivalent carbone de planter 158 millions d'arbres. « Notre stratégie en matière d'énergie et de changement climatique se concentre sur l'atténuation de notre impact, l'exploitation de nouvelles opportunités et l'évolution pour faire face aux risques climatiques », a déclaré Elena Valderrábano, directrice mondiale de Telefónica pour l'éthique d'entreprise et la durabilité. « En rejoignant l'Engagement Climat, nous renforçons notre engagement en faveur du développement durable et nous sommes heureux de rejoindre une communauté d’autres entreprises de premier plan qui accordent la priorité au développement durable ». Visa En tant que leader mondial de la technologie des paiements, Visa s'est engagée à contribuer à un monde plus durable et inclusif, notamment en jouant un rôle de leader de l'industrie dans la transition mondiale vers une économie à faibles émissions de carbone. Les antécédents de Visa en matière de développement durable comprennent la réalisation de son objectif en 2020 de transition complète vers une électricité 100 % renouvelable, l'amélioration de la durabilité de nos bureaux et de nos centres de données grâce à l'efficacité énergétique et de l'eau, le réacheminement des déchets de décharge et un programme mondial Green Teams pour les employés. En 2020, Visa a émis une obligation verte de 500 millions USD, considérée comme la première du genre par un réseau de paiements numériques, à l'appui de ces efforts. Visa continue également d'inspirer et de renforcer le commerce durable, grâce à des partenariats et des programmes stratégiques axés sur l'intégration de la durabilité dans les cartes de paiement et les comptes, et à favoriser des comportements durables grâce à son travail dans les transports en commun, la recharge des véhicules électriques, les voyages et le tourisme. « Chez Visa, nous sommes déterminés à assurer la durabilité et à créer un avenir plus durable », a déclaré Alfred F. Kelly Jr., président-directeur général de Visa. « Nous sommes fiers de rejoindre l'Engagement Climat dans le cadre de notre engagement à des émissions nulles d'ici 2040, et nous sommes impatients de collaborer avec les signataires pour faire avancer cet important travail ». À propos de l'Engagement Climat En 2019, Amazon et Global Optimism ont cofondé l’Engagement Climat, qui vise à honorer l’Accord de Paris sur le climat avec 10 ans d’avance sur les objectifs, et à atteindre la neutralité carbone d’ici 2040. À ce jour, 105 organisations ont signé l’Engagement Climat, envoyant ainsi un signal fort : il faut s'attendre à une croissance rapide de la demande en produits et services contribuant à réduire les émissions de carbone.

    "text": "西雅圖--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美國商業資訊)--亞馬遜和Global Optimism今天宣布，超過100家公司已簽署《氣候宣言》(The Climate Pledge)。新加入《氣候宣言》的52家簽約組織包括阿拉斯加航空公司(Alaska Airlines)、高露潔棕欖(Colgate-Palmolive)、喜力(HEINEKEN)、百事可樂(PepsiCo)、西班牙電信(Telefónica)和Visa等知名品牌。《氣候宣言》簽約組織的全球年度總營收超過1.4兆美元，在16個國家的25個行業擁有超過500萬名員工，彰顯出該活動在因應氣候變遷方面的集體影響力。 《氣候宣言》各簽約組織一致同意： 定期測量並報告溫室氣體排放量。 透過切實的業務變革和創新來實現符合《巴黎協定》的低碳化策略，包括提高效率、使用可再生能源、降低原材料消耗，以及其他消除碳排放策略。 透過額外、可量化、真實、永久並對社會有益的補償來中和任何剩餘的碳排放，以便在2040年之前實現年度淨零碳排放——比《巴黎協定》設定的2050年目標提前10年。 所有簽約組織都在採取基於科學的、極具影響力的行動，透過供應鏈效率、永續交通運輸、循環經濟、清潔能源解決方案等方面的創新來因應氣候變遷問題。許多組織也透過強調創新包裝和永續產品設計和開發的各種倡議，有目的地讓顧客參與他們的淨零碳排放過程，同時提供解決方案，讓顧客能夠透過教育活動和永續性購物體驗來減少自己的排放量。 亞馬遜創辦人兼執行長傑夫·貝佐斯(Jeff Bezos)表示：「不到兩年前，亞馬遜聯合創立了《氣候宣言》，並呼籲其他公司提前10年達成《巴黎協定》的目標。如今，已有100多家公司簽署了這項承諾，這些公司全球年度總營收超過1.4兆美元、員工人數合計超過500萬。我們很自豪能與其他簽約組織攜手合作，利用我們的規模，透過真正的商業變革和創新實現經濟脫碳化。」 聯合國氣候問題前負責人、現Global Optimism創始合夥人Christiana Figueres表示：「我們與極具宏大抱負的多家公司共同幫助發起了《氣候宣言》，以證明一種加速脫碳的模式。如今，來自各個行業部門的100多家公司，包括許多家喻戶曉的品牌和公司，都加入了《氣候宣言》，希望到2040年達成實現淨零碳排目標。這些公司的行動表明，加快企業脫碳速度是獲得競爭優勢的一條途徑。毫無疑問，我們正處於建構《巴黎協定》所設想的低碳經濟的轉捩點上。我對已經加入《氣候宣言》的各公司所展現出的領導力表示讚賞，並期待接下來還會有100家公司加入。」 亞馬遜和Global Optimism歡迎以下新簽約加入《氣候宣言》承諾的組織。 AECOM Mace Group Alaska Airlines Morgan Sindall Group Airmee Natural Capital Partners Atlantia Optimus Ride Bellrock Group 百事可樂 Blacklane Pollination 高露潔棕欖 Portland General Electric Convoy Posti Delphis Eco Pregis Direct Healthcare Solutions Ltd. Protector Cellars Edmonton International Airport Quorn Foods Elisa Corporation Rail Delivery Group EV Private Equity Royal Philips FILA Solutions 羅素大學集團(Russell Group) Graebel Sainsbury’s Greencore Group SecuriGroup 喜力 Sonnedix HH Global Springer Nature Group IGS Energy Storegga Geotechnologies IMI STV Group Inn at Laurel Point 西班牙電信 Karma Automotive Teleperformance LeasePlan The Sustainable City LifeStraw Urenco Lil Packaging Ltd. UST Lime Visa 承諾加入《氣候宣言》的全部52家新簽約組織的資訊，可參考亞馬遜部落格，新簽約的知名組織包括： 阿拉斯加航空公司(Alaska Airlines) 阿拉斯加航空公司在美國、墨西哥、加拿大和哥斯大黎加的120多個目的地推展營運，並透過寰宇一家(Oneworld Alliance)通達全球各地。公司長期致力於關愛人類和環境，制定了極具魄力的藍圖計畫，透過降低近期和長期氣候影響達到2040年淨零排放的目標。其計畫包括持續提升機隊效率；標準化和擴大使用最先進的人工智慧和機器學習技術，以規劃最佳路線、減少燃料燃燒和碳排放；與政府和工業部門合作，擴大永續航空燃料的供應和使用，此類燃料在生命週期內的碳排放量可減少多達80%；探索和促進有助於支援支線航班電氣化技術的新型推進系統；投資於可信的碳抵消，以彌補與目標的差距。公司已透過機隊最佳化來減少排放量，透過獨特設計的飛機小翼以及提供最有效路線的導航技術來節省燃料。阿拉斯加航空公司還透過其更廣泛的社會和環境永續發展計畫「LIFT」邀請乘客捐贈自己的里程，以支持大自然保護協會(Nature Conservancy)和聯合國兒童基金(UNCF)等非營利組織，公司還鼓勵乘客向The Good Traveler購買碳抵消量，透過機上回收減少廢物（由於新冠肺炎疫情臨時暫停），並回應公司的#FillBeforeYouFly倡議在旅行途中攜帶可重複使用的水壺。 阿拉斯加航空公司執行長Ben Minicucci表示：「阿拉斯加航空公司深知，旅行能夠大幅改變人們的生活，我們致力於以對社會和環境負責的方式推展營運，正努力確保將永續發展作為本公司文化的核心組成部分，感謝航空業和其他領域的夥伴與我們展開合作，使走向淨零碳的道路成為現實。人類的確需要同心協力才能達成這一目標，加入《氣候宣言》承諾，與其他注重永續發展的公司共同努力，是其中的重要一步。」 高露潔棕欖 高露潔棕欖正在世界各地為所有人、他們的寵物和我們的地球重新構想一個更健康的未來。公司致力於透過加快因應氣候變遷的行動來保護環境。其中一個關鍵優先事項是，透過太陽能裝置和電力購買協議，到2030年在所有營運中實現使用可再生能源的目標。高露潔棕欖旗下擁有高露潔、棕欖、Tom’s of Maine、Hill’s等家喻戶曉的品牌，為全球數十億人服務。公司致力於成長，並為其服務的顧客、客戶和社區實現負責任且永續的營運。公司不斷尋找更好、更永續的方法來生產產品和包裝，並尋求機會減少使用塑膠、水和能源，並盡可能減少產生的廢物。2019年，高露潔推出了首款可回收牙膏管，並希望到2025年升級其全球產品組合。高露潔現正與包括競爭對手在內的協力廠商分享其技術，以支援所有牙膏管的升級。公司還透過「節約用水」(Save Water)倡議引領並促進節水行動，該倡議鼓勵顧客在刷牙時「關掉水龍頭」，自2016年以來，已幫助人們節省了1,550億加侖水，並減少了830萬噸溫室氣體排放。 高露潔棕欖全球總裁Prabha Parameswaran表示：「高露潔為能夠加入《氣候宣言》而倍感自豪，並深知問責制、夥伴關係和協作對於實現人們期待的永續環境改善至關重要。高露潔品牌覆蓋的家庭超過其他任何品牌，我們充分利用這種獨一無二的機會和責任，來減少我們的環境足跡，加速因應氣候變遷的行動。我們為我們所取得的進步而感到自豪，並致力於繼續做出更多貢獻，我們公司也在努力為所有人、他們的寵物和我們的地球重新構想一個更健康的未來。」 喜力 喜力服務與全球消費者，公司深知不僅要獲利，更重要的是還要具備永續性。公司十年來的永續發展宏願——「釀造更美好的世界」 (Brewing a Better World)——彰顯出其對聯合國永續發展目標的承諾，公司還針對這些目標及其特定指標制定了藍圖，確保為保護地球、確保繁榮和終結貧困做出有意義且透明的貢獻。為實現這一宏願，自2008年以來，喜力的碳排放已減少51%，用水量也減少了33%。公司的永續發展努力貫穿「從大麥到酒吧」的整個價值鏈，支持永續農業、釀造、包裝和經銷，並宣導負責任的飲酒行為。 喜力董事長兼執行長Dolf van den Brink表示：「150多年來，我們一直致力於對我們周圍的世界產生積極影響。我們深知，只有我們的員工、地球和周圍的社區都充滿活力，我們才能蓬勃發展。這意味著在我們的每項活動中都要秉持『釀造更美好的世界』的原則。我們知道，行動勝於空談，只有透過集體努力才能實現真正且持久的改變。在考慮如何透過『釀造更美好的世界』來對整個喜力生態系統（包括我們的員工、合作夥伴和供應商、非政府組織、政府、地方社區和其他利害關係人）產生積極影響時，我們必須全面思考和行動。透過加入《氣候宣言》，我們加強了對永續發展的承諾，也非常高興加入這個分享知識、想法和最佳實務的社群。」 百事可樂 百事可樂有限公司旗下擁有桂格(Quaker)、Walkers、佳得樂(Gatorade)、多力多滋(Doritos)和SodaStream等代表性品牌組合，以及廣受世界各國顧客喜愛的多種食品和飲料產品，致力於利用其規模、影響力和專長來幫助建立一個更永續的食品系統。百事可樂所設想的食品系統能提供營養和美味，並能夠持續推動經濟和社會發展，但所有這些都不超過地球所能承受的自然邊界。公司致力於促進永續農業，解決水資源不安全問題，消除塑膠廢棄物，開發更有營養和永續的產品，減少整個價值鏈的溫室氣體排放。作為其相關工作的一部分，百事可樂正致力於建立一個不會因包裝材料而產生廢棄物的世界。目前，公司88%的包裝材料可回收、可堆肥或可生物降解，並希望到2025年達到100%。百事可樂還繼續拓展其「從源頭實現永續性」(Sustainable from the Start)倡議，該倡議在產品開發的每個階段都會考慮環境影響。2021年1月，百事可樂宣布了其以科學基礎的新目標，即到2030年（與2015年基線相比）減少碳排放40%以上——比公司之前的氣候承諾指標增加了一倍以上，並努力在2040年實現淨零排放。 百事可樂董事長兼執行長Ramon Laguarta表示：「百事可樂很高興加入《氣候宣言》，我們將繼續致力於幫助建立更永續和再生的食品系統。在全世界努力從疫情衝擊中恢復之際，以協同解決方案因應共同挑戰至關重要。我們都必須做好各自的工作，同時還必須共同應對氣候變遷並在2040年達到淨零碳排放。」 西班牙電信 作為世界上最大的電話營運商和行動網路提供者之一，西班牙電信致力於減少自身碳足跡，並提供解決方案幫助減少客戶的排放量。西班牙電信已經致力於按照1.5度溫控目標減少其整個價值鏈的排放量。具體行動包括承諾到2025年在業務營運關鍵市場（西班牙、英國、德國和巴西）達到淨零排放，到2040年在拉丁美洲的業務營運和更廣泛的價值鏈上達到淨零排放。公司還致力於透過聯網和「生態智慧」(Eco Smart)服務幫助客戶減排，這是一種產品封條，可幫助購物者輕鬆將永續性標準納入其購買決策中。去年，「生態智慧」服務幫助顧客避免了950萬噸的二氧化碳排放量，相當於種植1.58億棵樹。 西班牙電信企業道德和永續發展全球總監Elena Valderrábano表示：「我們的能源和氣候變遷策略主要側重於減輕我們對環境的影響，利用新機會，並不斷發展以因應氣候風險。透過加入《氣候宣言》，我們進一步加強了對永續發展的承諾，很高興加入其他將永續發展放在首位的知名公司行列。」 Visa 作為全球領先的支付技術公司，Visa致力於為一個更永續、更包容的世界做出貢獻，包括在全球向低碳經濟過渡的過程中發揮產業領導作用。Visa在永續發展領域的過往記錄包括2020年實現完全過渡到100%可再生電力的目標，透過提升能源和水資源效率、掩埋垃圾轉移以及針對員工的全球「綠色團隊」(Green Teams)專案，來提高我們辦公室和資料中心的永續性。2020年，Visa發行了5億美元綠色債券，以支持這些工作，據信，這是同類數位支付網路公司中發行的首支綠色債券。Visa還繼續透過策略合作夥伴關係和專案來激勵和賦能永續商業，重點是在支付卡和帳戶中嵌入永續發展功能，並透過其在交通、電動汽車充電和旅遊方面的工作實現永續發展。 Visa董事長兼執行長Alfred F. Kelly Jr.表示：「Visa致力於永續發展和創造更永續的未來。我們很榮幸加入《氣候宣言》，這是我們實現2040年淨零排放承諾的一部分，我們期待與各簽約組織攜手合作，共同推動這項重要工作。」 關於《氣候宣言》 2019年，亞馬遜和Global Optimism共同發起《氣候宣言》(The Climate Pledge)，承諾提前10年達成《巴黎協定》目標，到2040年實現淨零碳排放。截止目前，已有105家機構簽署《氣候宣言》，這也傳達出一個重要信號，即市場對有助於減少碳排放的產品和服務的需求將迅速成長。如需瞭解更多資訊，請造訪www.theclimatepledge.com。 關於亞馬遜 亞馬遜(Amazon)遵循四項原則：客戶至上、熱衷創新、追求卓越營運和長遠思考。亞馬遜首創推出的產品和服務包括：用戶評論、一鍵購物、個人化推薦、Prime會員、亞馬遜物流、AWS（亞馬遜網路服務）、Kindle自出版(Kindle Direct Publishing)、Kindle、Fire平板電腦、Fire TV、Amazon Echo和Alexa等。如需瞭解更多資訊，請造訪www.amazon.com/about。 關於Global Optimism Global Optimism致力於促進整個產業的革命性變化。實現零排放未來並不是一個遙遠的挑戰。它是我們目前必須按計劃完成的目標。各項科學研究均顯示，欲在2050年之前實現淨零排放的目標，全球暖化必須限制在1.5°C以內，我們必須在2020年到2030年之間使排放量減半。只有世界上每一個人肩負起自己的責任，才有可能解決氣候危機。我們與各行各業志同道合的組織攜手合作，他們願意投入努力，和我們共同完成這段極富挑戰而又鼓舞人心的旅程。如需瞭解更多資訊，請造訪https://globaloptimism.com/。 免責聲明：本公告之原文版本乃官方授權版本。譯文僅供方便瞭解之用，煩請參照原文，原文版本乃唯一具法律效力之版本。",

Entre los 52 signatarios nuevos que se incorporan a The Climate Pledge hoy, hay algunas marcas muy conocidas, como Alaska Airlines, Colgate-Palmolive, HEINEKEN, PepsiCo, Telefónica y Visa. Los signatarios del compromiso generan en total más 1,4 billones de USD en ventas anuales globales y emplean a más de 5 millones de personas en 25 industrias y 16 países, lo que demuestra el impacto colectivo que el programa The Climate Pledge puede tener en la lucha contra el cambio climático. Los signatarios de The Climate Pledge aceptan lo siguiente: Medir e informar de las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero de forma regular. Implementar estrategias de descarbonización alineadas con el Acuerdo de París a través de cambios comerciales reales e innovaciones, como mejoras de eficacia, energía renovable, reducción de materiales y otras estrategias de eliminación de las emisiones de carbono. Neutralizar las emisiones restantes con compensaciones adicionales, cuantificables, reales, permanentes y socialmente beneficiosas para lograr cero emisiones anuales netas de carbono para 2040: una década antes que el objetivo de 2050 del Acuerdo de París. Todos los signatarios están tomando medidas de alto impacto con fundamento científico para combatir el cambio climático al innovar en eficiencia de la cadena de suministro, transporte sostenible, economía circular, soluciones de energía limpia y más. Muchas organizaciones también involucran a los clientes de forma positiva en su proyecto de lograr cero emisiones netas mediante iniciativas que se enfocan en embalajes innovadores y diseño y desarrollo de productos sostenibles, a la vez que brindan soluciones que los empoderan para reducir sus propias emisiones con campañas educativas y experiencias de compra sostenibles. “Hace menos de dos años, Amazon cofundó The Climate Pledge y convocó a otras empresas para alcanzar el objetivo del Acuerdo de París 10 años antes. Hoy, más de 100 empresas con ingresos anuales globales por más de 1,4 billones de USD y más de 5 millones de empleados han firmado el compromiso”, dijo Jeff Bezos, fundador y director ejecutivo de Amazon. “Es un orgullo trabajar junto a otros signatarios y utilizar nuestro tamaño para descarbonizar la economía mediante cambios reales en los negocios e innovación”. “Ayudamos a iniciar The Climate Pledge para probar un modelo que acelerara la descarbonización junto a las empresas más ambiciosas”, dijo Christiana Figueres, exdirectora climática de la ONU y actual socia fundadora de Global Optimism. “Hoy, más de 100 empresas, entre marcas famosas y empresas de todos los sectores de la industria, se han unido a The Climate Pledge en su objetivo de lograr cero emisiones netas hacia 2040. Están demostrando que ir más rápidamente hacia la descarbonización de sus negocios es un camino para lograr la ventaja competitiva. No queda duda de que estamos en un momento crítico para establecer la economía de bajo carbono que el Acuerdo de París imaginó. Felicito a los líderes de las empresas que ya se han incorporado a The Climate Pledge y espero con mucha impaciencia dar la bienvenida a las próximas 100”. Amazon y Global Optimism dan la bienvenida a los signatarios nuevos que se han comprometido con The Climate Pledge. La información sobre los 52 signatarios que se han comprometido con The Climate Pledge se puede consultar en el blog Acerca de Amazon. A continuación, señalamos algunos de los signatarios nuevos. Alaska Airlines Alaska Airlines opera en más de 120 destinos en los Estados Unidos, México, Canadá y Costa Rica, y llega a destinos de todo el mundo a través de Oneworld Alliance. La empresa mantiene un compromiso duradero con el cuidado de las personas y del medio ambiente, y está comenzando un plan audaz para reducir el impacto climático a cercano y largo plazo y alcanzar las cero emisiones netas hacia 2040. Algunas de las medidas que esto implica son la mejora continua de la eficiencia de su flota; la estandarización y expansión del uso de la primera inteligencia artificial de este tipo y tecnología de aprendizaje automático para planear rutas optimizadas y reducir el consumo de combustible y las emisiones de carbono; el trabajo junto al gobierno y la industria para expandir la disponibilidad y el consumo de combustibles sostenibles para la aviación, que emiten hasta 80 % menos de carbono según el ciclo de vida; la exploración y el desarrollo de nuevas formas de propulsión que admiten tecnologías de electrificación para vuelos regionales y la inversión en compensaciones de carbono confiables para cerrar las posibles brechas y llegar al objetivo. La empresa ya está reduciendo las emisiones mediante la optimización de su flota, el ahorro de combustible gracias a los winglets de diseño exclusivo de sus aeronaves y el uso de tecnología de navegación que obtiene la ruta más eficiente. A través de su programa de sostenibilidad social y ambiental más amplio, LIFT, Alaska Airlines invita a los clientes a donar sus millas para apoyar a organizaciones sin fines de lucro, como Nature Conservancy y UNCF, con el fin de adquirir compensaciones de carbono con The Good Traveler, además de instarlos a reducir los desechos mediante el reciclaje durante el vuelo (temporalmente en pausa debido a la pandemia de COVID-19) y a viajar con sus propias botellas reutilizables de agua mediante la iniciativa de la empresa, #FillBeforeYouFly (“llénela antes de volar”). “En Alaska Airlines sabemos que viajar puede marcar una gran diferencia en la vida de la gente y nos comprometemos a funcionar de modo social y medioambientalmente responsable”, dijo Ben Minicucci, director ejecutivo de Alaska Airlines. “Nos hemos embarcado en el proyecto de asegurar que la sostenibilidad sea un aspecto principal de nuestra cultura y agradecemos a nuestros socios de la industria de la aviación y demás sectores que trabajan con nosotros para que el objetivo de las cero emisiones se haga realidad. Para lograrlo necesitaremos a toda la comunidad, y unirnos a otras empresas a quienes les interesa la sostenibilidad como parte de The Climate Pledge es un paso importante”. Colgate-Palmolive En todo el mundo, Colgate-Palmolive está reimaginando un futuro más saludable para todas las personas, sus mascotas y el planeta. La empresa se compromete a proteger el medio ambiente al acelerar las medidas contra el cambio climático. Una de las prioridades críticas es utilizar energía renovable en todas las operaciones hacia 2030, mediante instalaciones solares y acuerdos de adquisición de energía. Con marcas famosas como Colgate, Palmolive, Tom’s of Maine y Hill’s, entre otras, Colgate-Palmolive presta servicio a miles de millones de personas en todo el mundo. La empresa se compromete a crecer y a operar de manera responsable y sostenible para las personas, los clientes y las comunidades en las que presta servicio. Busca continuamente maneras mejores y más sostenibles de hacer sus productos y embalajes e investiga oportunidades para utilizar menos plástico, agua y energía a la vez que se reducen al mínimo los desechos. En 2019, Colgate presentó el primer tubo de dentífrico reciclable en su tipo con el objetivo de hacer la transición de toda su cartera global hacia 2025. Colgate comparte ahora su tecnología con terceros, incluso con competidores, para respaldar la transformación de todos los tubos. La empresa también encabeza la lucha para promover la conservación del agua mediante su iniciativa Save Water, que insta a sus clientes a “cerrar la canilla” mientras se lavan los dientes, lo que ayudó a ahorrar 155 000 galones de agua y 8,3 millones de toneladas métricas de gases de efecto invernadero desde 2016. “Es un orgullo para Colgate unirse a The Climate Pledge, con el entendimiento de que ser responsables, asociarse y colaborar es esencial para lograr las mejoras ambientales sostenibles que todos deseamos”, dijo Prabha Parameswaran, presidente global de Colgate-Palmolive. “Con la marca Colgate, que se encuentra en más hogares que ninguna otra, hemos asumido nuestra extraordinaria oportunidad —y responsabilidad— de reducir nuestra huella medioambiental y acelerar la aplicación de medidas contra el cambio climático. Estamos orgullosos de cómo hemos progresado y nos comprometemos a lograr más a medida que nuestra empresa trabaja arduamente para reimaginar un futuro más saludable para todas las personas, sus mascotas y el planeta”. HEINEKEN HEINEKEN, que presta servicio a consumidores de todo el mundo, reconoce la importancia de dirigir un negocio no solamente rentable, sino también sostenible. El objetivo de desarrollo sostenible de la empresa, Brew a Better World, que ya lleva una década, demuestra su compromiso con los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible de la ONU y define una hoja de ruta que compara dichos objetivos con sus metas específicas con el fin de asegurar que las contribuciones para proteger el planeta, garantizar la prosperidad y terminar con la pobreza sean significativas y transparentes. Como parte de este objetivo, HEINEKEN ya ha logrado una reducción del 51 % de las emisiones de carbono y una reducción del 33 % del consumo de agua en todas sus operaciones desde 2008. Los esfuerzos de sostenibilidad de la empresa alcanzan a toda la cadena de valor, “desde la cebada hasta el bar”, al respaldar técnicas sostenibles de agricultura, elaboración, embalaje y distribución, y abogar por el consumo responsable de alcohol. “Durante más de 150 años, generar un impacto positivo en el mundo que nos rodea ha sido nuestra pasión. Sabemos que solo podemos prosperar si nuestra gente, el planeta y las comunidades que nos rodean prosperan”, dijo Dolf van den Brink, presidente y director ejecutivo de HEINEKEN. “Esto significa tener en cuenta la iniciativa Brew a Better World en cada una de nuestras actividades. Sabemos que una acción vale más que mil palabras y que lograr un cambio real y duradero solo es posible con el esfuerzo colectivo. Debemos pensar y actuar holísticamente al considerar el impacto positivo de Brew a Better World en todo el ecosistema de HEINEKEN, incluidos nuestros empleados, socios y proveedores, las ONG, los gobiernos, las comunidades locales y otras partes interesadas. Al unirnos a The Climate Pledge reforzamos nuestro compromiso con la sostenibilidad, y nos complace unirnos a una comunidad que compartirá conocimientos, ideas y mejores prácticas”. PepsiCo Con una cartera de marcas icónicas, que incluye Quaker, Walkers, Gatorade, Doritos y SodaStream, y una amplia variedad de productos de alimentos y bebidas de la que los consumidores de todo el mundo disfrutan, PepsiCo se compromete a utilizar su tamaño, alcance y conocimientos especializados para ayudar a desarrollar un sistema alimentario más sostenible. PepsiCo concibe un sistema alimentario que pueda proveer nutrición y disfrute, además de seguir impulsando el desarrollo económico y social, sin traspasar los límites naturales del planeta. La empresa se concentra en promover la agricultura sostenible, abordar la inseguridad en materia de agua, eliminar los desechos plásticos, desarrollar productos más nutritivos y sostenibles y reducir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero en toda su cadena de valor. Como parte de este esfuerzo, PepsiCo trabaja para construir un mundo en donde el embalaje no se transforma en residuo. Actualmente, el 88 % de los embalajes de la empresa son reciclables, compostables o biodegradables, con el objetivo de llegar al 100 % hacia 2025. PepsiCo también continúa expandiendo su programa Sustainable from the Start, una iniciativa que considera el impacto ambiental en cada etapa del desarrollo de productos. En enero de 2021, PepsiCo anunció una nueva meta con fundamento científico, que consiste en reducir más del 40 % sus emisiones de carbono hacia 2030 (con punto de partida en 2015), con lo que aumenta más del doble su compromiso ambiental anterior y apunta a llegar a cero emisiones netas en 2040. “Es un placer para PepsiCo incorporarse a The Climate Pledge a medida que continuamos nuestro trabajo para ayudar a desarrollar un sistema alimentario más sostenible y regenerativo”, dijo Ramon Laguarta, presidente y director ejecutivo de PepsiCo. “En tiempos en que el mundo lucha por recuperarse de la conmoción de una pandemia mundial, las soluciones compartidas a los desafíos compartidos son fundamentales. Todos debemos cumplir nuestro rol a nivel individual, pero también unirnos para hacer frente al cambio climático y alcanzar cero emisiones netas hacia 2040”. Telefónica Como uno de los operadores de telecomunicaciones y proveedores de red móvil más grandes del mundo, Telefónica se compromete a reducir su propia huella de carbono, además de brindar soluciones que empoderan a los clientes para que logren reducir sus propias emisiones. Telefónica ya se ha comprometido a reducir las emisiones de toda su cadena de valor en línea con el escenario de los 1,5 grados Celsius. Esto incluye el compromiso de alcanzar cero emisiones netas hacia 2025 en todas sus operaciones en mercados clave (España, Reino Unido, Alemania y Brasil) y hacia 2040 en el caso de las operaciones en América Latina y su cadena de valor más amplia. La empresa se compromete además a ayudar a los clientes a reducir sus emisiones a través de la conectividad y de sus servicios Eco Smart, un sello de producto que ayuda a los compradores a incorporar fácilmente criterios de sostenibilidad en sus decisiones de compra. El año pasado, Eco Smart ayudó a los compradores a evitar más de 9,5 millones de toneladas de CO2, el equivalente en carbono de plantar 158 millones de árboles. “Nuestra estrategia energética y para el cambio climático se centra en mitigar nuestro impacto, aprovechar nuevas oportunidades y evolucionar para hacer frente a los riesgos climáticos”, dijo Elena Valderrábano, directora global de Ética corporativa y Sostenibilidad de Telefónica. “Al incorporarnos a The Climate Pledge, reforzamos nuestro compromiso con la sostenibilidad. Es un placer unirnos a una comunidad con otras empresas líderes que tienen la sostenibilidad como prioridad”. Visa Visa, una empresa líder mundial en tecnología de pagos, se compromete a contribuir con un mundo más sostenible e inclusivo, por ejemplo, al cumplir una función de liderazgo en la industria en la transición mundial hacia una economía con bajas emisiones de carbono. La trayectoria de sostenibilidad de Visa incluye el logro de su objetivo de completar la transición al consumo de electricidad renovable en un 100 % en 2020, y la mejora de la sostenibilidad de sus oficinas y centros de datos gracias al consumo eficiente de energía y agua, el desvío de residuos de vertedero y un programa global llamado Green Teams para los empleados. En 2020, Visa emitió un bono ecológico por 500 millones de USD, considerado el primero en su tipo por una red de pagos digitales, para respaldar estos esfuerzos. Visa también continúa inspirando y empoderando el comercio sostenible con asociaciones estratégicas y programas que se enfocan en integrar la sostenibilidad en cuentas y tarjetas de pago y en posibilitar conductas sostenibles mediante su trabajo en los ámbitos de tránsito, carga de vehículos eléctricos, viajes y turismo. “En Visa nos comprometemos con la sostenibilidad y la creación de un futuro más sostenible”, dijo Alfred F. Kelly Jr., presidente y director ejecutivo de Visa. “Es un orgullo incorporarnos a The Climate Pledge como parte de nuestro compromiso de llegar a cero emisiones netas hacia 2040 y esperamos con impaciencia empezar a colaborar con los signatarios para impulsar esta importante tarea”.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Heute gaben Amazon und Global Optimism bekannt, dass mittlerweile mehr als 100 Unternehmen The Climate Pledge unterzeichnet haben. Zu den 52 neuen Unterzeichnern, die sich heute „The Climate Pledge“ angeschlossen haben, gehören bekannte Marken wie Alaska Airlines, Colgate-Palmolive, HEINEKEN, PepsiCo, Telefónica und Visa. Die Unterzeichner der Verpflichtung erwirtschaften insgesamt weltweit einen Jahresumsatz von mehr als 1,4 Billionen US-Dollar und beschäftigen mehr als fünf Millionen Mitarbeiter in 25 Branchen in 16 Ländern – was verdeutlicht, welchen kollektiven Einfluss „The Climate Pledge“ auf den Kampf gegen den Klimawandel haben kann. Die Unterzeichner von „The Climate Pledge“ stimmen zu: Treibhausgasemissionen regelmäßig zu messen und darüber zu berichten. Dekarbonisierungsstrategien im Einklang mit dem Übereinkommen von Paris durch echte geschäftliche Veränderungen und Innovationen umzusetzen, einschließlich Effizienzsteigerungen, erneuerbarer Energien, Materialreduzierungen und anderer Strategien zur Beseitigung von CO2-Emissionen. Alle verbleibenden Emissionen durch zusätzliche, quantifizierbare, reale, dauerhafte und für die Gesellschaft vorteilhafte Kompensationen zu neutralisieren, um bis zum Jahr 2040 einen jährlichen Netto-Kohlenstoffausstoß von Null zu erreichen – ein Jahrzehnt vor dem im Übereinkommen von Paris festgelegten Ziel von 2050. Alle Unterzeichner ergreifen wissenschaftlich fundierte, wirkungsvolle Maßnahmen im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel, indem sie Innovationen u. a. in den Bereichen Effizienz der Lieferkette, nachhaltiger Transport, Kreislaufwirtschaft, saubere Energielösungen entwickeln. Viele Unternehmen binden auch ihre Kunden sinnvoll in ihre Bemühungen um Netto-Null-Emissionen ein – mit Initiativen, die sich auf innovative Verpackungen und nachhaltiges Produktdesign und -entwicklung konzentrieren, während sie gleichzeitig Lösungen anbieten, die die Kunden befähigen, ihre eigenen Emissionen mithilfe von Aufklärungskampagnen und nachhaltigen Einkaufserlebnissen zu reduzieren. „Vor weniger als zwei Jahren war Amazon Mitbegründer von ‚The Climate Pledge‘ und rief andere Unternehmen dazu auf, das Übereinkommen von Paris zehn Jahre früher zu erreichen – mittlerweile haben mehr als 100 Unternehmen mit einem weltweiten Jahresumsatz von über 1,4 Billionen US-Dollar und mehr als 5 Millionen Mitarbeitern die Verpflichtung unterzeichnet“, sagte Jeff Bezos, der Gründer und CEO von Amazon. „Wir sind stolz darauf, mit den anderen Unterzeichnern an einem Strang zu ziehen und unsere Größenvorteile zu nutzen, um die Wirtschaft durch echte wirtschaftliche Veränderungen und Innovationen zu dekarbonisieren.“ „Wir haben bei der Gründung von ‚The Climate Pledge‘ geholfen, um ein Modell zu etablieren, das die Dekarbonisierung bei den ehrgeizigsten Unternehmen beschleunigt“, sagte Christiana Figueres, die frühere UN-Klimachefin und jetzige Gründungsgesellschafterin von Global Optimism. „Heute sind mehr als 100 Unternehmen, darunter bekannte Marken und Unternehmen aus allen Branchen, an ‚The Climate Pledge‘ mit seinem Ziel der Netto-Null-Emissionen bis 2040 beteiligt. Sie zeigen, dass eine schnellere Umsetzung der Dekarbonisierung ihrer Unternehmen ein Weg hin zum Wettbewerbsvorteil ist. Es besteht kein Zweifel, dass wir uns an einem entscheidenden Wendepunkt befinden, um die im Übereinkommen von Paris angestrebte kohlenstoffarme Wirtschaft zu realisieren. Ich spreche den Führungsspitzen der Unternehmen, die ‚The Climate Pledge‘ bereits beigetreten sind, meine Anerkennung aus und freue mich darauf, die nächsten 100 zu begrüßen.“ Amazon und Global Optimism begrüßen die neuen Unterzeichner, die sich „The Climate Pledge“ verpflichtet haben. Informationen über alle 52 neuen Unterzeichner, die sich „The Climate Pledge“ verpflichtet haben, finden Sie auf dem Blog About Amazon. Zu den neuen Unterzeichnern gehören: Alaska Airlines Alaska Airlines fliegt mehr als 120 Ziele in den USA, Mexiko, Kanada und Costa Rica an und erreicht über die Oneworld Alliance Ziele auf der ganzen Welt. Das Unternehmen engagiert sich seit Langem für die Menschen und die Umwelt und ergreift mutige Maßnahmen, um die Auswirkungen auf das Klima kurz- und langfristig zu reduzieren und bis 2040 Netto-Null-Emissionen zu erreichen. Dazu gehören die kontinuierliche Verbesserung der Effizienz der Flotte, die Standardisierung und Ausweitung der Nutzung neuester Technologien aus den Bereichen künstliche Intelligenz und maschinelles Lernen für die Planung optimierter Routen, Reduzierung des Treibstoffverbrauchs und der Kohlendioxidemissionen, die Zusammenarbeit mit der Regierung und der Industrie mit dem Ziel einer Ausweitung der Verfügbarkeit und des Einsatzes nachhaltiger Flugkraftstoffe, die über den gesamten Lebenszyklus hinweg bis zu 80 % weniger Kohlendioxidemissionen verursachen, die Erforschung und Weiterentwicklung neuartiger Antriebskonzepte auf Grundlage von Elektrifizierungstechnologien für den Regionalflugverkehr und die Investition in glaubwürdige CO2-Kompensationen zur Schließung etwaiger Lücken zwischen Ist und Ziel. Das Unternehmen ist bereits dabei, Emissionen durch Flottenoptimierung zu reduzieren, spart Treibstoff durch die einzigartig gestalteten Winglets seiner Flugzeuge und eine Navigationstechnologie, die die effizienteste Route ermittelt. Im Rahmen seines umfangreichen Programms für soziale und ökologische Nachhaltigkeit LIFT lädt Alaska Airlines seine Kunden dazu ein, ihre Meilen zu spenden und gemeinnützige Organisationen wie die Nature Conservancy und UNCF zu unterstützen, mit „The Good Traveler“ CO2-Kompensationen zu erwerben und Abfall durch Recycling an Bord (aufgrund der COVID-19-Pandemie vorübergehend ausgesetzt) und durch Reisen mit wiederverwendbaren Wasserflaschen der #FillBeforeYouFly-Initiative des Unternehmens zu reduzieren. „Wir bei Alaska Airlines wissen, dass Reisen das Leben der Menschen maßgeblich verändern können, und wir haben es uns zur Aufgabe gemacht, sozial und ökologisch verantwortlich zu handeln“, sagte Ben Minicucci, der CEO von Alaska Airlines. „Wir befinden uns auf einer Reise, durch die wir sicherstellen wollen, dass Nachhaltigkeit ein Kernbestandteil unserer Kultur ist, und wir sind dankbar für die Partner in der Luftfahrtbranche und darüber hinaus, die gemeinsam mit uns den Weg hin zur Netto-Null-Realität beschreiten. Wir müssen wirklich zusammenhalten, um das zu erreichen, und die Zusammenarbeit mit den anderen nachhaltigkeitsorientierten Unternehmen im Rahmen von ‚The Climate Pledge‘ ist ein wichtiger Schritt.“ Colgate-Palmolive Auf der ganzen Welt entwickelt Colgate-Palmolive neue Ideen für eine gesündere Zukunft für alle Menschen, ihre Haustiere und unseren Planeten. Das Unternehmen setzt sich für den Umweltschutz ein, indem es Maßnahmen zum Kampf gegen den Klimawandel vorantreibt. Eine wesentliche Priorität ist die flächendeckende Nutzung erneuerbarer Energie in allen Betrieben bis 2030 durch Solaranlagen und Stromabnahmeverträge. Mit bekannten Marken wie u. a. Colgate, Palmolive, Tom's of Maine und Hill's beliefert Colgate-Palmolive Milliarden von Menschen auf der ganzen Welt. Das Unternehmen hat sich dem Wachstum und einer verantwortungsvollen und nachhaltigen Betriebsführung für seine Mitarbeiter, Kunden und die Gemeinden, in denen es tätig ist, verschrieben. Es strebt regelmäßig nach besseren und nachhaltigeren Möglichkeiten zur Herstellung seiner Produkte und Verpackungen und sucht nach Möglichkeiten, weniger Kunststoff, Wasser und Energie bei gleichzeitiger Minimierung des Abfalls zu verbrauchen. Im Jahr 2019 stellte Colgate die erste recycelbare Zahnpastatube vor und verfolgt das Ziel, sein weltweites Produktprogramm bis 2025 umzustellen. Colgate gibt seine Technologie jetzt auch an Dritte, einschließlich Wettbewerbern, weiter, um so für eine Umstellung aller Tuben zu sorgen. Das Unternehmen geht darüber hinaus mit seiner Initiative „Save Water“ beim Wassersparen voran und fordert seine Kunden dazu auf, beim Zähneputzen den Wasserhahn zu schließen. Dadurch wurden seit 2016 bereits 155 Milliarden Gallonen Wasser und 8,3 Millionen Tonnen Treibhausgas eingespart. „Colgate ist stolz darauf, sich ‚The Climate Pledge‘ anzuschließen, da wir wissen, dass Verantwortlichkeit, Partnerschaft und Zusammenarbeit unerlässlich sind, um die nachhaltigen Umweltverbesserungen zu erreichen, die wir uns alle wünschen“, sagte Prabha Parameswaran, Global President von Colgate-Palmolive. „Die Marke Colgate ist in mehr Haushalten zu finden als jede andere. Daher haben wir die außerordentliche Chance – und Verantwortung – angenommen, unseren ökologischen Fußabdruck zu reduzieren und Maßnahmen gegen den Klimawandel voranzutreiben. Wir sind stolz auf die Fortschritte, die wir gemacht haben, und verpflichten uns, noch mehr zu tun, während unser Unternehmen sich intensiv darum bemüht, eine gesündere Zukunft für alle Menschen, ihre Haustiere und unseren Planeten zu gestalten.“ HEINEKEN HEINEKEN beliefert Verbraucher auf der ganzen Welt und weiß, wie wichtig es ist, nicht nur ein profitables, sondern auch ein nachhaltiges Unternehmen zu führen. Mit der über zehn Jahre laufenden Initiative für nachhaltige Entwicklung, „Brew a Better World“, stellt das Unternehmen seine Bindung an die UN-Nachhaltigkeitsziele unter Beweis und erstellt einen Fahrplan zu diesen Zielen und den darin festgelegten Vorgaben, um einen bedeutsamen und transparenten Beitrag zum Schutz des Planeten, zur Sicherung des Wohlstands und zur Bekämpfung der Armut zu leisten. Im Rahmen dieser Initiative hat HEINEKEN in seinen Betrieben seit 2008 bereits eine Senkung der CO2-Emissionen um 51 % und des Wasserverbrauchs um 33 % erzielt. Die Nachhaltigkeitsbemühungen des Unternehmens erstrecken sich über die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette „von der Gerste bis zur Bar“, denn es setzt sich sowohl für nachhaltige Landwirtschaft, Brauerei, Verpackung und Vertrieb als auch für einen verantwortungsvollen Konsum von Alkohol ein. „Seit über 150 Jahren engagieren wir uns mit großer Leidenschaft dafür, einen positiven Einfluss auf die Welt um uns herum zu haben. Wir wissen, dass wir nur dann erfolgreich sein können, wenn es unseren Mitarbeitern, dem Planeten und der Gesellschaft in unserem Umfeld gut geht“, sagte Dolf van den Brink, der Vorsitzende und CEO von HEINEKEN. „Das bedeutet, dass wir bei jeder unserer Aktivitäten auf ‚Brew a Better World‘ fokussiert sind. Wir wissen, dass Taten mehr sagen als Worte und dass eine echte und dauerhafte Veränderung nur durch gemeinsame Anstrengungen möglich ist. Wir müssen ganzheitlich denken und handeln, wenn es um den positiven Einfluss von ‚Brew a Better World‘ auf das gesamte Ökosystem von HEINEKEN geht – einschließlich unserer Mitarbeiter, Partner und Lieferanten, nicht staatlichen Organisationen, Regierungen, lokalen Gemeinden und anderen Interessengruppen. Durch unseren Beitritt zu ‚The Climate Pledge‘ verstärken wir unseren Einsatz für Nachhaltigkeit, und wir freuen uns, einer Gemeinschaft beizutreten, die untereinander Wissen, Ideen und Best Practices austauscht.“ PepsiCo PepsiCo mit seinem Portfolio bekannter Marken – wie u. a. Quaker, Walkers, Gatorade, Doritos und SodaStream – und einer breiten Palette von Lebensmittel- und Getränkeprodukten, die von Kunden auf der ganzen Welt konsumiert werden, hat sich dazu verpflichtet, seine Größe, Reichweite und Kompetenz dafür zu nutzen, ein nachhaltigeres Lebensmittelsystem aufzubauen. PepsiCo stellt sich ein Lebensmittelsystem vor, das Ernährung und Genuss bietet und die wirtschaftliche und soziale Entwicklung weiter vorantreibt, ohne die natürlichen Grenzen des Planeten zu überschreiten. Das Unternehmen konzentriert sich auf die Förderung einer nachhaltigen Landwirtschaft, die Bekämpfung der Wasserunsicherheit, die Vermeidung von Plastikmüll, die Entwicklung nährstoffreicherer und nachhaltigerer Produkte und die Reduzierung der Treibhausgasemissionen in seiner gesamten Wertschöpfungskette. Im Rahmen dieser Maßnahmen bemüht sich PepsiCo darum, eine Welt zu schaffen, in der Verpackungen nicht zu Abfall werden. Derzeit sind 88 % der Verpackungen des Unternehmens recycelbar, kompostierbar oder biologisch abbaubar, und Ziel ist, bis 2025 eine Quote von 100 % zu erreichen. PepsiCo baut darüber hinaus sein Programm „Sustainable from the Start“ weiter aus, eine Initiative, die die Umweltauswirkungen in jeder Phase der Produktentwicklung beleuchtet. Im Januar 2021 kündigte PepsiCo das neue auf wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen basierendes Ziel an, seine Kohlenstoffemissionen bis zum Jahr 2030 um mehr als 40 % zu senken (im Vergleich zum Ausgangsjahr 2015). Damit hat das Unternehmen seine bisherige Klimaschutzverpflichtung mehr als verdoppelt und sich zum Ziel gesetzt, bis 2040 Netto-Null-Emissionen zu erreichen. „PepsiCo freut sich sehr über seinen Beitritt zu ‚The Climate Pledge‘, denn wir werden unsere Arbeit für ein nachhaltigeres und regenerativeres Lebensmittelsystem fortsetzen“, sagte Ramon Laguarta, der Vorsitzende und CEO von PepsiCo. „In einer Zeit, in der sich die Welt darum ringt, sich von dem Schock einer globalen Pandemie zu erholen, sind gemeinschaftliche Lösungen für gemeinsame Herausforderungen unerlässlich. Wir alle müssen unseren jeweiligen Beitrag leisten, aber auch zusammenstehen, um den Klimawandel zu bekämpfen und bis 2040 Netto-Null-Emissionen zu erreichen.“ Telefónica Als einer der größten Telefonanbieter und Mobilfunknetzbetreiber der Welt hat sich Telefónica verpflichtet, seine eigene CO2-Bilanz zu reduzieren und gleichzeitig Lösungen anzubieten, die es den Kunden ermöglichen, ihre eigenen Emissionen zu verringern. Telefónica hat sich bereits dazu verpflichtet, die Emissionen seiner gesamten Wertschöpfungskette in Übereinstimmung mit dem 1,5-Grad-Celsius-Ziel zu reduzieren. Dazu gehört die Verpflichtung, bis zum Jahr 2025 in allen Betrieben an den wichtigsten Märkten (Spanien, Großbritannien, Deutschland und Brasilien) Netto-Null-Emissionen zu erreichen, wobei die Betriebe in Lateinamerika und die übrige Wertschöpfungskette bis zum Jahr 2040 Netto-Null-Emissionen erreichen sollen. Das Unternehmen setzt sich weiterhin dafür ein, seine Kunden bei der Reduzierung ihrer Emissionen durch Konnektivität und seine Eco-Smart-Services zu unterstützen. Dabei handelt es sich um ein Produktsiegel, das Käufern dabei hilft, Nachhaltigkeitskriterien auf einfache Weise in ihre Kaufentscheidungen einfließen zu lassen. Im vergangenen Jahr half Eco Smart den Kunden dabei, mehr als 9,5 Millionen Tonnen CO2 zu vermeiden, was als Kohlenstoffäquivalent der Pflanzung von 158 Millionen Bäumen entspricht. „Unsere Strategie in Bezug auf Energie und Klimawandel konzentriert sich darauf, unsere Auswirkungen zu mindern, neue Chancen zu nutzen und sich weiterzuentwickeln, um Klimarisiken zu bekämpfen“, sagte Elena Valderrábano, Global Director für Unternehmensethik und Nachhaltigkeit von Telefónica. „Durch unseren Beitritt zu ‚The Climate Pledge‘ unterstreichen wir unser Engagement für Nachhaltigkeit und freuen uns, uns einer Gruppe anderer führender Unternehmen anzuschließen, für die Nachhaltigkeit an erster Stelle steht.“ Visa Als führendes internationales Unternehmen für Zahlungstechnologien hat sich Visa verpflichtet, einen Beitrag zu einer nachhaltigeren und integrativeren Welt beizutragen und damit auch eine führende Rolle beim weltweiten Wandel hin zu einer kohlenstoffarmen Wirtschaft zu spielen. Die Nachhaltigkeitsbilanz von Visa umfasst das Erreichen des Ziels, im Jahr 2020 komplett auf vollständig erneuerbaren Strom umzusteigen, die Verbesserung der Nachhaltigkeit unserer Büros und Rechenzentren durch Energie- und Wassereffizienz, Vermeidung von Deponieabfällen und ein weltweites „Green Teams“-Programm für Mitarbeiter. Zur Unterstützung dieser Bemühungen gab Visa im Jahr 2020 eine grüne Anleihe in Höhe von 500 Millionen US-Dollar aus, die vermutlich die erste dieser Art eines digitalen Zahlungsnetzwerks ist. Visa initiiert und fördert auch weiterhin nachhaltigen Handel durch strategische Partnerschaften und Programme, die sich darauf konzentrieren, Nachhaltigkeit in Zahlungskarten und -konten zu verankern und nachhaltiges Verhalten durch seine Arbeit in den Bereichen Verkehr, Laden von Elektrofahrzeugen, Reisen und Tourismus zu unterstützen. „Wir bei Visa haben uns der Nachhaltigkeit und der Schaffung einer nachhaltigeren Zukunft verschrieben“, sagte Alfred F. Kelly Jr., der Vorsitzende und CEO von Visa. „Wir sind stolz darauf, ‚The Climate Pledge‘ im Rahmen unserer Verpflichtung, bis zum Jahr 2040 Netto-Null-Emissionen zu erreichen, beizutreten, und wir freuen uns darauf, gemeinsam mit den Unterzeichnern diese wichtige Arbeit voranzutreiben.“ Über „The Climate Pledge“ Im Jahr 2019 riefen Amazon und Global Optimism gemeinsam das Klimaschutzversprechen „The Climate Pledge“ ins Leben, eine Verpflichtung, die Vorgaben des Pariser Abkommens zehn Jahre früher zu erreichen und bis 2040 netto klimaneutral zu sein. Mittlerweile haben 105 Organisationen „The Climate Pledge“ unterzeichnet und damit ein wichtiges Signal gesendet, dass die Nachfrage nach Produkten und Dienstleistungen, die zur Verringerung der CO2-Emissionen beitragen, schnell wachsen wird.

Jede wissenschaftliche Bewertung zeigt, dass wir unsere Emissionen zwischen 2020 und 2030 halbieren müssen, um das Ziel von Netto-Emissionen von Null bis 2050 zu erreichen und die globale Erwärmung unter 1,5 Grad Celsius zu halten. Die Bewältigung der Klimakrise ist nur möglich, wenn alle überall ihren Beitrag leisten. Wir arbeiten mit gleichgesinnten Kollektiven aus allen Branchen zusammen, die bereit sind, in die erforderlichen Entscheidungen zu investieren, um sich auf diese herausfordernde – lebensbejahende – Reise zu begeben.

    "text": "シアトル--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- アマゾンとグローバル・オプティミズムは本日、クライメート・プレッジの署名者が100社を超えたと発表しました。本日クライメート・プレッジに新しく参加した署名者52社には、アラスカ航空、コルゲート・パーモリーブ、ハイネケン、ペプシコ、テレフォニカ、ビザなどの有名ブランドが含まれます。プレッジ署名者は、合計で世界の年間売上高1兆4000億ドル以上を創出し、16カ国の25の業界で従業員500万人以上を雇用しています。これは、気候変動に取り組む上でクライメート・プレッジが与えられる全体的影響力を示しています。 クライメート・プレッジの署名者は、以下について同意します。 温室効果ガス排出量を定期的に測定して報告する。 効率向上、再生可能エネルギー、原材料削減、その他の炭素排出削減戦略など、実際の事業変革とイノベーションを通じてパリ協定に沿った脱炭素戦略を実施する。 残る排出量は、定量可能な実際の永続的で社会的に有益なオフセットによって中和し、パリ協定の目標である2050年よりも10年早い2040年までに、年間炭素排出のネットゼロを達成する。 全署名者がサプライチェーンの効率改善、持続可能な輸送、循環型経済、クリーン・エネルギー・ソリューションなど、気候変動と闘うための科学に基づいた影響力の大きい行動を実践します。さらに、多くの組織が顧客に対して、革新的なパッケージや持続可能な製品デザインと開発に重点を置くイニシアチブでネットゼロを目指す署名者の歩みに意味のある方法で参加を呼びかけ、また、啓発キャンペーンや持続可能な商品購入方法などを通じて顧客自身も炭素排出を削減するよう促すソリューションを提供します。 アマゾンの創立者で最高経営責任者（CEO）のジェフ・ベゾスは、次のように述べています。「アマゾンがクライメート・プレッジを共同で立ち上げ、パリ協定を10年早く実現しようと他の企業に呼びかけてからまだ2年経っていませんが、今日、世界の年間売上高が1兆4000億ドルを超え、従業員500万人以上を雇用する100社を超える署名者が集まりました。他の署名者と連携し、事業活動における実質的な変化とイノベーションを通じて経済の脱炭素化を図るために、私たちの規模の力を活用できることを誇らしく思います。」 国連の元気候変動責任者でグローバル・オプティミズム創立パートナーのクリスティアナ・フィゲレス氏は、次のように述べています。「意欲的な企業と共に脱炭素化を加速するモデルを証明するためにクライメート・プレッジの発足を支援しました。今日、日用品ブランドや幅広い業種の企業を含む100社を超える企業が、2040年までのネットゼロ実現という目標を持つクライメート・プレッジに参加しています。署名企業は、自社の事業活動の脱炭素化に向けて早く行動することが、競争上の優位を得る道であると実証しています。私たちが、パリ協定で構想された低炭素社会を構築するための転機にいることは疑いありません。クライメート・プレッジに参加した企業のリーダーシップに敬意を表し、次の100社を迎えられる日を楽しみにしています。」 アマゾンとグローバル・オプティミズムは、クライメート・プレッジを誓約した新たな署名者を歓迎します。 AECOM メイス・グループ アラスカ航空 モルガン・シンドール・グループ エアミー ナチュラル・キャピタル・パートナーズ アトランシア オプティマス・ライド ベルロック・グループ ペプシコ ブラックレーン ポリネーション コルゲート・パーモリーブ ポートランド・ゼネラル・エレクトリック コンボイ

新たにクライメート・プレッジに誓約した52の署名者すべてに関する情報は、ブログ「About Amazon」でご覧ください。新たな署名者の一部を以下にご紹介します。 アラスカ航空 アラスカ航空は、米国、メキシコ、カナダ、コスタリカの120以上の目的地への路線を運航し、ワンワールド アライアンスを通じて世界各地にネットワークを広げています。長く人と環境への配慮に力を尽くしてきたアラスカ航空は、気候への影響を短期的・長期的に削減し、2040年までにネットゼロ排出を実現する大胆な道のりを歩み始めました。これには、運用機の効率性の継続的な改善、最適なルート計画では初となる人工知能と機械学習技術の使用の標準化と拡大、燃料消費と炭素排出の削減、ライフサイクル・ベースで炭素排出を最大80%削減する持続可能な航空燃料の利用可能性と使用を拡大するための政府および業界との協働、近距離飛行の電化技術を促進する新しい推進手段の探索と改善、目標に対する不足分を補う信頼性の高いカーボン・オフセットへの投資が含まれます。同社はすでに、運用機の最適化、航空機の独自設計ウイングレットによる省エネ、最も効率の良いルートを検出するナビゲーション技術を通じて、排出の削減を進めています。多様な活動を行う社会的・環境的持続可能性プログラム「リフト」を通じて、アラスカ航空は顧客に対し、ザ・ネイチャー・コンサーバンシーやUNCFなどの非営利団体へのマイルの寄付、「ザ・グッド・トラベラー」によるカーボン・オフセットの購入、機内リサイクル（現在は新型コロナウイルス流行のため一時中止）や再利用可能なウォーターボトルの携帯を推奨する「#FillBeforeYouFly」イニシアチブによるゴミの削減を呼びかけています。 アラスカ航空の最高経営責任者（CEO）のベン・ミニクッチ氏は、次のように述べています。「アラスカ航空では、旅行は人々の生活に大きな違いを生み出せると考えており、社会的、環境的に責任ある方法による事業運営に努力しています。持続可能性を確実に文化の中心に据える道のりを歩み始めた当社は、ネットゼロを実現するために協力してくださる航空業界やその他の業界のパートナーに感謝します。目標を達成するには多方面の協力が必要で、持続可能性を尊重する他の企業と共にクライメート・プレッジの一員に加わることは、重要な一歩です。」 コルゲート・パーモリーブ コルゲート・パーモリーブは世界各地で、すべての人とペット、私たちの地球のためのより健康な未来を再構想しています。同社は、気候変動に対する取り組みの促進を通じた環境保護に取り組んでいます。最も重要な優先事項の一つは、太陽光パネルの設置および電力購入契約を通じた、2030年までのすべての事業運営における再生可能エネルギー目標の達成です。コルゲート、パーモリーブ、トムズ・オブ・メイン、ヒルズなどの日用品ブランドを擁するコルゲート・パーモリーブは、世界の何十億人もの顧客に商品を提供しています。同社は、従業員、顧客、同社が事業を展開する地域社会のための成長、そして責任ある持続可能な事業活動に努力しています。今後も、商品とパッケージのより持続可能な製造方法の検討を続け、プラスチック、水、エネルギー消費を削減して廃棄物を最小限に抑える機会を追求していきます。コルゲートは2019年に、歯磨き剤で初めてリサイクル可能なチューブを導入し、2025年までに世界的ポートフォリオ全体で移行することを目指しています。現在、コルゲートはこうした技術を競合他社を含めた第三者と共有しており、すべてのチューブの変革を支援しています。また同社は、「セーブ・ウォーター」イニシアチブを通じて、水資源の保全を推進する役割も主導しています。歯磨き中に「水を止める」ことを消費者に呼びかけるイニシアチブにより、2016年以来1550億ガロンの節水と、830万メートルトンの温室効果ガス削減を支援しました。 コルゲート・パーモリーブのグローバル・プレジデントのプラバ・パラミシュワラン氏は、次のように述べています。「コルゲートはクライメート・プレッジに参加でき、嬉しく思います。あらゆる人が望む、持続可能な環境のための改善を生み出す上で、責任、連携、協力が重要であることを理解しています。他のどのブランドよりも多くの家庭でご愛用いただいているブランドとして、コルゲートは当社が有する並外れた機会と責任を認識し、環境負荷の削減と気候変動に対する取り組みを推進してきました。これまでに遂げてきた進捗を誇りに思い、すべての人とペット、私たちの地球のためのより健康な未来を再構想するために、さらなる努力を重ねていく所存です。」 ハイネケン 世界の消費者に商品を提供するハイネケンは、収益力のある事業活動だけでなく、持続可能な事業運営が大切であることを認識しています。持続可能な開発に向けた10年に及ぶ同社の「ブリュー・ア・ベター・ワールド」プロジェクトは、国連の持続可能な開発目標に対する同社の注力を示すものです。これらの目標と個別のターゲットに対するロードマップの策定により、地球を保護し、繁栄をもたらし、貧困を根絶するための有意義な透明性の高い貢献の実現を目指しています。このプロジェクトの一環として、ハイネケンは2008年以来、事業活動全体で炭素排出の51%削減と水消費の33%低減を達成しました。同社の持続可能性の取り組みは、持続可能な農業、醸造、パッケージング、販売を支援し、責任あるアルコール消費を提唱することを通じて、「大麦から店舗まで」のバリューチェーン全体に広がっています。 ハイネケンの会長兼最高経営責任者（CEO）のドルフ・ファン・デン・ブリンク氏は、次のように述べています。「ハイネケンは150年以上にわたり、世界に好影響を与えることに情熱を傾けてきました。当社従業員、地球、地域社会が活力を持てなければ、ハイネケンの成功はあり得ないことを理解しています。これは、当社のあらゆる活動において、より良い世界の醸成を目指すことを意味します。ハイネケンは、行動は言葉よりも雄弁であり、長続きする実体のある変化は集団的努力を通じてしか達成できないと考えます。したがって、より良い世界の醸成が、当社の従業員、パートナー、サプライヤー、非政府組織、政府、地域社会、他のステークホルダーを含むハイネケン・エコシステム全体にどのように好影響を与えるかを考える時は、総体として思考し行動しなければなりません。クライメート・プレッジに加わることで、当社は持続可能性に向けた取組みを強化しています。知識、アイデア、最優良事例を共有するコミュニティーに参加できることをうれしく思います。」 ペプシコ クエーカー、ウォーカーズ、ゲータレード、ドリトス、ソーダストリームなどの有名ブランドのポートフォリオと、世界の消費者に楽しまれている幅広い食品・飲料製品を持つペプシコは、同社の展開規模、影響力の大きさ、専門知識を、より持続可能な食料システムの構築の支援に活用する取り組みを行っています。ペプシコが構想しているのは、栄養と食べる喜びを届けられ、経済的・社会的発展の推進を継続でき、こうした活動のすべてが地球の自然の限界を超えることのない食料システムです。同社は、持続可能な農業の促進、水不足対策、プラスチックごみの排除、栄養のある持続可能な製品の開発、バリューチェーン全体での温室効果ガス排出の削減に重点を置いています。こうした取り組みの一環として、ペプシコはパッケージがごみにならない世界の実現に力を注いでいます。現在、同社のパッケージの88%がリサイクルまたは堆肥化が可能であるか、生分解性となっており、目標は2025年までの100%達成です。またペプシコは製品開発の各段階での環境影響を考慮するイニシアチブ「サステナブル・フロム・ザ・スタート」プログラムの拡大も継続しています。2021年1月、ペプシコは炭素排出を2030年までに（2015年を基準として）40%以上削減する、科学に基づいた新たな目標を発表しました。これは、以前の気候誓約の2倍を超える数値であり、さらに、2040年までのネットゼロ排出の達成も目指します。 ペプシコの会長兼最高経営責任者（CEO）のラモン・ラグアルタ氏は、次のように述べています。「ペプシコは、より持続可能で再生力のある食料システムの構築をサポートする取り組みを続ける中で、クライメート・プレッジに参加できることを嬉しく思います。世界的パンデミックのショックからの回復に世界が苦闘している今、共通の課題に対するソリューションの共有が欠かせません。私たちは皆、自分に課された責任をそれぞれ果たす必要がありますが、気候変動との闘いと、2040年までのネットゼロ排出を実現する上では、力を合わせなくてはなりません。」 テレフォニカ 世界有数の電話事業者でモバイル・ネットワーク事業者のテレフォニカは、炭素フットプリントの削減、ならびに顧客自身が排出量削減を行うことを可能にするソリューションの提供に力を注いでいます。テレフォニカはすでに、摂氏1.5度のシナリオに合わせたバリューチェーン全体での排出量削減に取り組んでいます。これには、主要市場（スペイン、英国、ドイツ、ブラジル）における事業活動全体での2025年までのネットゼロ排出の実現、中南米での事業活動とより広範なバリューチェーンでのネットゼロ化の2040年までの実現を目指す取り組みが含まれます。また、接続性を通じて、および購入の意思決定に持続可能性基準を簡単に取り込めるようにする製品シールであるエコ・スマート・サービスにより、顧客が排出を削減するためのサポートも提供しています。昨年、エコ・スマートは、1億5800万本の植樹に相当する950万トン以上のCO2の回避を支援しました。 テレフォニカの企業倫理・持続可能性担当グローバル・ディレクターのエレナ・ヴァルデラバノ氏は、次のように述べています。「当社のエネルギーおよび気候変動戦略は、影響を緩和し、新たな機会を活用し、気候リスクへの取り組みを進化させることを主軸に据えています。クライメート・プレッジに加わることで、当社は持続可能性に向けた取組みを強化していきます。持続可能性を第一に考える他の有力企業のコミュニティーに参加できることをうれしく思います。」 ビザ ビザは世界をリードする決済技術企業として、低炭素経済への世界的な移行で業界を主導する役割を担うなど、より持続可能で包摂的な世界に向けた貢献に注力しています。ビザの持続可能性の実績には、2020年に100%再生可能電力への完全移行の目標達成、およびエネルギーと水の効率化、埋め立てごみの転用、従業員向けの世界的な「グリーン・チームズ」プログラムを通じたオフィスとデータセンターの持続可能性の向上が含まれます。ビザはこうした取り組みを支えるため、2020年にデジタル決済ネットワークによるものとしては初となる5億ドルのグリーンボンドを発行しました。また、ビザは決済カードとアカウントに持続可能性を採用し、移動、電動自動車の充電設備、旅行、観光業での任務を通じた持続可能な行動を可能にすることに焦点を置く戦略的パートナーシップとプログラムにより、持続可能な商取引の触発と推進を継続します。 ビザの会長兼最高経営責任者（CEO）のアルフレッド・F・ケリー・ジュニア氏は、次のように述べています。「ビザでは、持続可能性と、より持続可能な未来の構築に注力しています。2040年までに排出をネットゼロにする誓約の一環として、誇りを持ってクライメート・プレッジに参加し、この重要な取り組みを前進させるために他の署名者と協力できることを楽しみにしています。」 クライメート・プレッジについて 2019年にアマゾンとグローバル・オプティミズムは、パリ協定を10年早く達成して2040年までにネットゼロ・カーボンを達成する誓約であるクライメート・プレッジを共同で立ち上げました。現在53組織がクライメート・プレッジに署名し、炭素排出削減に資する製品やサービスの需要が今後急増するという重要なシグナルを発信しています。詳細情報については、www.theclimatepledge.comをご覧ください。

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) launched the Intellectual Property Accelerator (IP Accelerator) in Canada, making it easier and more cost effective for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to obtain trademarks, protect their brands and tackle infringing goods both in Amazon’s stores and the broader marketplace. Available to any brand selling in Amazon’s stores, IP Accelerator directly connects Canadian SMB owners with a curated network of local law firms charging reduced, pre-negotiated rates on key services, giving SMBs access to expert legal and general IP advice that may otherwise be cost-prohibitive or hard to find. To date, the list of participating firms includes Bereskin & Parr LLP, Brouillette Legal Inc., Chari Prenol Slaney & Turco, Clancy PC, JZC Intellectual Property Law, Kestenberg Siegal Lipkus LLP, Palmer IP, and Ridout & Maybee LLP. “More than 30,000 Canada-based third-party sellers have grown their business with Amazon, reaching millions of customers while grossing more than $2 billion on Amazon’s stores around the world. IP Accelerator allows our SMB selling partners to build on that success by protecting their valuable IP and setting them up for long-term growth. Establishing and protecting IP rights are essential for businesses of every size, and Amazon is pleased to introduce a new tool that provides access to specialized expertise to help protect brands,” said Mary Beth Westmoreland, VP, Brand Protection at Amazon. IP rights are vital for businesses to stop bad actors from copying and infringing on their ideas. However, filing for IP protection can be daunting and time-consuming for SMBs: individual trademark applications to the Canadian Intellectual Property Office can take up to 28 months. IP Accelerator will facilitate the process by connecting SMBs with lawyers who are skilled in drafting trademark applications and can help remove common obstacles that could otherwise further delay the issuance of a registration. IP Accelerator provides SMBs with early access to Amazon’s brand protection tools that help them protect their brand and IP even before their trademark is officially registered. Amazon’s Brand Registry is a free service that provides SMBs with powerful tools that help them manage and protect their brand and IP rights in Amazon stores, with more than 350,000 brands enrolled to date. Participants benefit from Amazon’s automated, data-driven protections that proactively remove suspected infringing or inaccurate content as well as tools that enable brands to report suspected infringement. Enrollment in Brand Registry also provides brands with greater influence over product information displayed on Amazon’s product detail pages to help customers make confident, informed purchasing decisions. IP Accelerator was launched in the United States in 2019, and has since expanded to Europe, Japan, India, and now Canada. Since the launch, more than 6,000 trademark applications from participating brands have been submitted to trademark offices including the US Patent and Trademark Office, the European Union Intellectual Property Office, the UK Intellectual Property Office, the India Trade Marks Registry, the Japan Patent Office and the Canadian Intellectual Property Office. Amazon does not charge selling partners to use IP Accelerator – SMBs pay their law firm directly for the work performed at reduced, pre-negotiated rates. Businesses interested in IP Accelerator can visit http://brandservices.amazon.ca/ipaccelerator. Law firms that are interested in participating in the program should contact IPAcceleratorWaitList@amazon.com. Quotes: Jennifer Pratt, Founder and Owner of Seeding Square, the colour-coded seed spacer for vegetable gardens, said: “For any small business, but particularly for one like mine, whose invention is becoming increasingly popular, there is a significant risk of competitors copying or stealing your hard work and capitalizing on your growth. As a small business owner, I have many urgent day-to-day priorities that can prevent me from pursuing complicated matters like trademark protection. I am encouraged to see initiatives like IP Accelerator, which connects businesses like mine with specialized legal expertise at a reduced cost.” Antonio Turco, Founding Partner of CPST Law LLP, said: “We are excited to be involved with the IP Accelerator and pleased that Amazon places such an emphasis on IP protection. A company’s brand is its most important investment, and trademark registration is a key aspect of protecting that brand. The IP Accelerator elevates the importance of intellectual property and is a significant step in helping small and medium-sized businesses obtain IP rights.” Paula Clancy, Founder and Managing Attorney at Clancy PC, said: “In today’s competitive marketplace, your brand is one of your most valuable assets as it represents your reputation in the eyes of consumers, directing them to your products and services. Brand protection on a store like Amazon, which reaches millions of customers worldwide, is essential, not only to prevent unauthorized use of your marks, but also to protect you from potential claims by third parties. Amazon’s IP Accelerator helps small businesses connect with trusted trademark professionals to protect their brands. Clancy PC is excited to be part of the program and to assist small businesses through the trademark registration and Amazon Brand Registry process.” About Amazon Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

Appendix: Additional Law Firm Quotes Janice Bereskin, Partner at Bereskin & Parr LLP, said: “Trademark protection is important for businesses from start-ups to SMEs to multinationals. Bereskin & Parr welcomes the opportunity to work with Amazon’s IP Accelerator to assist companies with their trademark protection in Canada and facilitate participation with Amazon’s Brand Registry program.” Jerry Chen, Founder, JZC Intellectual Property Law, said: “We are pleased to be selected as a partner firm for the Amazon IP Accelerator Program. The IP Accelerator program directly aligns with our firm's goal of providing clients with quality, practical and cost-effective legal services in the area of brand protection. We firmly believe that the Amazon Brand Registry, in combination with the Canadian trademark system, will provide online merchants, in particular Amazon sellers, with powerful tools to combat counterfeiting and infringement of their rights. In the rapidly developing world of e-commerce, trademark rights are more important than ever, and we are happy to work with Amazon to ensure that these rights are properly protected. We can assist clients in filing Canadian trademark applications and help them get enrolled in the Amazon Brand Registry through the IP Accelerator Program.” David Lipkus Partner at Kestenberg Siegal Lipkus LLP, said: “I have dedicated my career to helping brands enforce their rights, and I look forward to helping educate SMBs about the importance of IP and taking the appropriate steps to protect their brands early on in their growth. With World Intellectual Property Day taking place on April 26th, there is no better time to take the time to understand the importance of trademark protection. I look forward to helping SMBs prioritize IP, and strengthen this valuable asset.” Dean Palmer, Managing Partner of Palmer IP, Canada, said: “Our Canadian team in Vancouver, Ottawa, and Toronto welcomes the Amazon IP Accelerator program to Canada. ​There is now no need to wait years for a trademark registration to access the Amazon Brand Registry enforcement and brand profile tools. Businesses selling in Canada can join the Brand Registry within 14 days through the IPA program, and receive a discounted rate, from vetted firms, to ultimately achieve trademark registrations.” Robert Brouillette, Founding Partner of Brouillette Legal Inc., said: “Amazon’s IP Accelerator will be very beneficial to small businesses to quickly gain access to the Amazon Brand Registry at the filing stage of a trademark application in Canada. Furthermore, the resulting registered trademark will benefit the small businesses by becoming uncontestable after 5 years of the registration, by creating trademark right presumptions across Canada and by facilitating enforcement and preventing infringement. Brouillette Legal is proud to be part of the Amazon’s IP Accelerator to help businesses grow through the creation of IP assets.”",

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced that Key by Amazon In-Garage Grocery Delivery is expanding to everywhere grocery delivery from Amazon is available, providing service to more than 5,000 U.S. cities and towns. Originally launched in five cities last November, Key In-Garage Grocery Delivery can now be used by millions of eligible Prime members to have their Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market groceries delivered securely and conveniently inside their garage. Customers Seek Convenience Customers relied on online grocery delivery services as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it’s clear they’ll continue to use grocery delivery because of the convenience it provides. In a recent survey by Morning Consult commissioned by Amazon, nearly 70% of Americans report that grocery delivery is beneficial when they don’t have time for a trip to the grocery store. Of the 54% of Americans who highlighted convenience as the most important benefit of grocery delivery, 77% reported saving time as a beneficial advantage. “Customers who tried Key In-Garage Grocery Delivery have loved the service, which is why we’re expanding it to everywhere Amazon offers grocery delivery,” said Pete Gerstberger, Head of Key by Amazon. “As customers look for more convenience in their daily lives, we’re excited to deliver another service that not only helps them save time, but provides peace of mind knowing that tonight’s dinner is safe in their garage and out of the weather.” Convenient Shopping with Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market Eligible Prime members can shop online at www.amazon.com/fresh or www.amazon.com/wholefoods and build a cart just like they would for any grocery delivery order. Customers with a compatible garage door opener or myQ Smart Garage Hub can connect the myQ app with Key, then simply select “Key Delivery” at checkout for no additional cost. Once the order is placed, a trained shopper will fill the order, selecting products that meet the high quality standards of Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market. Grocery orders are securely delivered by a delivery service professional, and customers can easily use the Key by Amazon app or the Amazon mobile shopping app to be notified when their groceries arrive. “We’ve worked hard to bring the convenience of grocery delivery from Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market to even more Prime members, now reaching customers in more than 5,000 cities and towns,” said Stephenie Landry, Vice President of Grocery at Amazon. “I’m thrilled to offer customers Key In-Garage Grocery Delivery, and believe this expansion illustrates our commitment to continually innovate to make the experience of ordering groceries online even better for customers.” Pricing and Availability Key In-Garage Grocery Delivery is available everywhere Amazon offers grocery delivery, at no additional cost to eligible Prime members. A myQ connected smart garage door opener is required to enable garage access for secure delivery. To view videos of their delivery, customers can use a compatible Ring smart home camera with their Ring Protect Plan, or LiftMaster Smart Garage Camera powered by myQ with a myQ Video Storage Subscription. To check eligibility, sign up for Key In-Garage Grocery Delivery, and enjoy a limited-time offer of a $20 Amazon credit after the first in-garage grocery order*, customers can visit www.amazon.com/key-grocery.

    "text": "シアトル--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ） -- アマゾン（NASDAQ: AMZN）は本日、米国、カナダ、スペイン、スウェーデン、英国での風力・太陽光エネルギー新規プロジェクト9件について発表しました。当社は現在、世界で再生可能エネルギー・プロジェクト206件を擁し、その中には発電所規模の風力・太陽光プロジェクト71件と、世界各地の施設と店舗での屋上太陽光発電システム135台が含まれ、世界で8.5GWの発電容量を供給します。この最新の発表により、アマゾンは現在、2.5GW以上の再生可能エネルギー容量を持つ欧州最大の再生可能エネルギーの購入企業となりました。これは、欧州の200万戸以上へ1年間電力供給可能な量に相当します。 これらのプロジェクトは、アマゾンの事業所とフルフィルメント・センター、およびホールフーズ・マーケット店舗、世界でアマゾンと何百万人もの顧客にサービスを提供するアマゾン ウェブ サービス（AWS）データセンターへ再生可能エネルギーを供給します。また、これらのプロジェクトの再生可能エネルギーは、消費者向けEchoデバイス全体での消費電力に相当するクリーン・エネルギーを生成するというアマゾンの公約実現も支えます。すべてのプロジェクトにより、アマゾンは当初の目標であった2030年よりも5年早い2025年までに、事業活動を100%再生可能エネルギーで賄う道を進んでいます。再生可能エネルギーへの投資は、パリ協定の目標よりも10年早い2040年までにネットゼロ・カーボンを目指す誓約「クライメート・プレッジ」の一環として、アマゾンが起こしている多数のアクションのうちの1つです。 アマゾンの創業者で最高経営責任者（CEO）のジェフ・ベゾスは、次のように述べています。「アマゾンは、2040年までのネットゼロ・カーボン化を目指す誓約であるクライメート・プレッジを実現する取り組みの一環として、再生可能エネルギーへの投資の拡大を続けています。新しい風力・太陽光プロジェクト9件により、発表された再生可能風力・太陽光プロジェクトは世界で206件に到達し、アマゾンは現在、欧州と世界で最大規模の再生可能エネルギーの購入企業となっています。当社事業の多くの領域はすでに再生可能エネルギーで運営されており、当初の目標である2030年よりも5年早い2025年までに、すべての事業活動の電力を再生可能エネルギーで賄えるようになると見込んでいます。」 本日発表された米国、カナダ、スペイン、スウェーデン、英国の新しい風力・太陽光プロジェクト9件には、以下が含まれます。 当社として初めてエネルギー貯蔵を組み合わせた太陽光プロジェクト：カリフォルニア州のインペリアルバレーを拠点とする太陽光プロジェクトは、アマゾンで初めてエネルギー貯蔵を組み合わせた方式です。これにより、需要が大幅に高まっても、太陽光発電で需要を満たせるようになります。このプロジェクトは100メガワット（MW）の太陽光エネルギーを生成します。これは、2万8000戸以上へ1年間電力供給可能な量に相当し、70MWのエネルギー貯蔵も含みます。またプロジェクトにより、アマゾンはカリフォルニア州の送電網の信頼性と回復力を維持しながら、エネルギーの貯蔵と管理の次世代技術を導入できるようになります。 アマゾンのカナダ初の再生可能プロジェクト：アマゾンは、カナダで初となる再生可能エネルギー投資として、アルバータ州ニューウェル郡での80MWの太陽光プロジェクトを発表します。完了した暁には、19万5000メガワット時（MWh）以上（カナダの1万8000戸以上に電力供給可能な量）の再生可能エネルギー電力を供給します。 企業による英国最大規模の再生可能エネルギー・プロジェクト：英国でのアマゾンの最新プロジェクトであるスコットランド沖の350MWの風力発電所は、当社として英国最大です。また、発表されたものとしては、企業による英国で史上最大規模の再生可能エネルギー取引です。 米国での新しいプロジェクト：オクラホマ州でのアマゾン初の再生可能エネルギー・プロジェクトは、マレー郡を拠点とする118MWの風力プロジェクトです。またアマゾンは、オハイオ州のアレン郡、オーグレイズ郡、リッキング郡でも新しい太陽光プロジェクトを建設します。オハイオ州でのプロジェクトは、同州での新たなエネルギー調達の中の400MW以上を占めることになります。 スペインとスウェーデンでの追加投資：スペインでのアマゾン最新の太陽光プロジェクトは、エストレマドゥーラ州とアンダルシア州を拠点とし、合計で170MW以上の電力を送電網に供給します。スウェーデンでのアマゾンの最新プロジェクトは、スウェーデン北部にある258MWの洋上風力プロジェクトです。 こちらで、世界各地で行われているアマゾンの再生可能エネルギー・プロジェクトすべての地図をご覧いただけます。 アメリカ再生可能エネルギー評議会（ACORE）議長兼最高経営責任者（CEO）のグレゴリー・ウェットストーン氏は、次のように述べています。「アマゾンは世界各地で引き続き、企業の再生可能電力への移行を先導する主要な役割を果たしており、意欲的な再生可能エネルギーの目標は達成可能であること、そして広範な利益をもたらすことを証明しています。アマゾンの新しいクリーン・エネルギー・プロジェクト9件は、世界の再生可能エネルギー容量が合計で8.5ギガワットに達する目覚ましい記録をもたらすもので、また、クリーンで信頼性ある電力供給を推進する先進的な技術を活用したアマゾン初の太陽光と貯蔵の統合プロジェクトも含まれています。」 米国太陽エネルギー産業協会（SEIA）会長兼最高経営責任者（CEO）のアビゲイル・ロス・ホッパー氏は、次のように述べています。「アマゾンのような先進的企業は、太陽光が自社の事業と地球にもたらし得る価値を理解しています。当協会は、アマゾンが気候変動に対する取り組みを徹底して遂行し、世界各地で再生可能エネルギー資産に投資していることを非常に頼もしく思います。米国の金融業界、顧客、世界の企業は皆、米国企業が気候変動に対してどのような取り組みを行っているかを注視しているため、こうしたリーダーシップは気候危機に対して大きな影響をもたらすでしょう。」 アマゾンとグローバル・オプティミズムは2019年に、パリ協定の目標を10年早く達成して2040年までにネットゼロ・カーボンを実現する誓約であるクライメート・プレッジを共同で立ち上げました。誓約には現在、IBM、ユニリーバ、ベライゾン、シーメンス、マイクロソフト、ベスト・バイを含む53の署名者がいます。アマゾンは目標達成のために、事業で実際の行動を起こして、当初の目標の2030年より5年早く当社事業の電力を100%再生可能エネルギーで賄うための道筋を確立し、2030年までに50%をネットゼロ・カーボンにしながら、すべての出荷のネットゼロ・カーボンを目指すシップメント・ゼロのビジョンを実行し、配送用電気自動車の発注では過去最大規模となる10万台を購入し、クライメート・プレッジ・ファンドを通じて脱炭素化を推進するサービスとソリューションの開発に20億ドルを投資することで、事業全体での排出削減を継続していきます。詳しい情報については、https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/をご覧ください。 アマゾンについて アマゾンは、4つの指針として、競争よりも顧客に目を向けること、発明に情熱を傾けること、優れたオペレーションに注力すること、長期的に思考することを拠り所としています。利用者レビュー、ワンクリック・ショッピング、個人に合わせたお勧め、プライム、アマゾン・フルフィルメント、AWS、Kindleダイレクト・パブリッシング、Kindle、Fireタブレット、Fire TV、Amazon Echo、Alexaは、アマゾンが先駆的に開始した商品・サービスの例です。詳細情報については、amazon.com/aboutをご覧いただき、@AmazonNewsをフォローしてください。 アマゾン ウェブ サービスについて 15年以上にわたり、アマゾン ウェブ サービスは世界で最も包括的で広く導入されているクラウド・プラットフォームとなってきました。AWSは、事実上すべてのクラウド・ワークロードをサポートするためにサービスを継続的に拡大しており、現在、演算、保存、データベース、ネットワーキング、アナリティクス、機械学習、人工知能（AI）、モノのインターネット（IoT）、モバイル、セキュリティー、ハイブリッド、仮想現実と拡張現実（VR、AR）、メディア、プリケーション開発、導入、管理のための200個を超えるフル機能のサービスを25個の地域にある80個のアベイラビリティーゾーン（AZ）から提供しています。また、オーストラリア、インド、インドネシア、スペイン、スイスでさらに15個のアベイラビリティーゾーンと5個のAWSリージョンの計画が発表されています。最も急成長している新興企業、大企業、主要政府機関を含む数百万のお客さまが、AWSを信頼してインフラストラクチャーを強化し、即応性を高め、コストを引き下げています。AWSの詳細については、aws.amazon.comをご覧ください。 本記者発表文の公式バージョンはオリジナル言語版です。翻訳言語版は、読者の便宜を図る目的で提供されたものであり、法的効力を持ちません。翻訳言語版を資料としてご利用になる際には、法的効力を有する唯一のバージョンであるオリジナル言語版と照らし合わせて頂くようお願い致します。",

And, Amazon Kids offers flexible parental controls that allow parents to tailor their children’s experience based on their family style—giving parents peace of mind as their kids get older.” “Kids mature at different rates, and it's up to parents to decide which types of content they're comfortable with their kids engaging,\" said Stephen Balkam, CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute. \"The way these products are designed gives families the ability to maintain oversight while building a healthy relationship with technology. Establishing this kind of trust will help with creating positive habits for kids as they become more independent online.” Fire HD 10 Kids The next-generation Fire HD 10 Kids includes a Fire HD 10 tablet that offers up to 12 hours of battery life and USB-C for easy charging, especially for kids.

    "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/linkedin-names-amazon-no-1-company-where-americans-want-to-20210428.jpg",
    "site": "businesswire.com",
    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(NASDAQ: AMZN)—LinkedIn today named Amazon the No. 1 company where Americans want to work in 2021, up from No. 3 in 2019. Amazon ranked first on LinkedIn’s Top Companies list, an annual list that identifies the most sought-after places to work. Using data from LinkedIn’s 740 million members, LinkedIn’s Top Companies list is designed to help professionals identify the best companies to grow their careers. LinkedIn’s methodology evaluates how companies attract and retain the best talent, including through promotions, funding opportunities for employees to learn new skills, gender diversity, and hiring people from all backgrounds and levels of education. LinkedIn also looked at how much recruiters from other companies search for employees currently working at Amazon. “Being Earth’s Most Customer-Centric company and Earth’s Best Employer are two sides of the same coin—we’re able to obsess over customers because we’ve created a great work environment for our employees. I believe one of the biggest reasons that people want to work at Amazon is our culture of innovation. We are inventors at heart and provide our employees with an opportunity to think big and try things that have never been done before,” said Beth Galetti, Amazon’s Senior Vice President of People eXperience and Technology at Amazon. “A huge thanks to our teams around the world for playing their part in making Amazon a great place to work.” In 2020, Amazon created more than 400,000 jobs in the U.S. and 500,000 globally. Here are some figures on our job-creation efforts and the innovative and safe work environment that we strive to create for our employees: We received more than 30 million job applications for roles at Amazon in 2020, almost double the number from 2019. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve done more than 240,000 virtual interviews with candidates for corporate and tech roles. Of the 400,000 people we hired in 2020 across our U.S. operations network, 45% were previously unemployed. Nearly 30,000 joined Amazon from the manufacturing sector, another 19,000 from traditional retail, and 16,500 from education and healthcare. More than 60% of the people who joined Amazon’s customer fulfillment network in 2020 are now paid more than they were paid in their previous job. Every Amazon job comes with a starting pay of at least $15 an hour, more than twice the federal minimum wage. In 2020, we promoted more than 68,000 employees globally, and 93% of Amazon new hires last year cited our company-funded skills training programs as a reason to stay at Amazon. Amazon is investing $700 million in upskilling 100,000 employees in the U.S. by 2025 so they can access in-demand and higher-paying jobs. Amazon currently employs more than 950,000 people in the U.S. at its headquarters in the Puget Sound region in Washington state and in Arlington, Virginia; the Amazon campus in Nashville, Tennessee; its 18 Tech Hubs; and the company’s growing network of logistics, retail, and data center facilities across more than 40 states. Amazon currently has more than 30,000 positions open in the U.S. For four consecutive years, LinkedIn has ranked Amazon among the top three companies in the U.S. where Americans want to work. Additionally, Amazon currently ranks No. 2 on the World’s Best Employers list from Forbes and on Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies list. Amazon was also selected by Fast Company as one of the Best Workplaces for Innovators. Amazon was awarded a top score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index, which recognizes the best workplaces for the LGBTQ+ community, and awarded the Lee Anderson Veteran and Military Spouse Employment Award for excellence in hiring, training, and retaining veterans, transitioning service members, and military spouses. Amazon was also named as a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion by the Disability Equality Index. For more information about LinkedIn’s ranking and their methodology, see here.

    "site": "businesswire.com",
    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced the general availability of Amazon Nimble Studio, a new service that enables customers to set up a content production studio in hours instead of weeks, with elasticity that gives them near limitless scale and access to rendering on demand. With Amazon Nimble Studio, customers can rapidly onboard and collaborate with artists from anywhere in the world, and produce content faster and more cost effectively. Artists will have access to accelerated virtual workstations, high-speed storage, and scalable rendering across AWS’s global infrastructure so they can create content faster. There are no upfront fees or commitments to use Amazon Nimble Studio, and customers pay only for the underlying AWS services used. To get started, visit: https://aws.amazon.com/nimble-studio/ To bring high-quality visual effects, animation, and creative content to life, studios historically have relied on local high-performance workstations connected to shared file storage systems over low-latency, on-premises networks. Increased consumer appetite for premium content and experiences has driven greater demand for compute-intensive rendering of visual effects and animations. This ever-growing demand causes content production studios to over-provision their compute, networking, and storage infrastructure for peak capacity, which proves expensive, difficult to manage, and hard to scale. For example, a typical animated feature film now generates 730 terabytes of data and up to half a billion files, requiring more than 150 million core compute hours and coordination from hundreds of artists and engineers. Consumer demand for more content has also required studios to onboard talent from around the world, who then require high-powered workstations, specialized software, and high-speed storage and networking. All of these constraints can result in production delays, increased expenses, and lost opportunity for content production studios. Using Amazon Nimble Studio, customers can create a new content production studio in just a few hours. The creative talent then has immediate access to high performance workstations powered by Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) G4dn instances with NVIDIA Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), shared file storage from Amazon FSx, and ultra low-latency streaming via the AWS global network. Amazon Nimble Studio gives content production studios the ability to start with as few resources as needed, scale up those resources when rendering demands peak, and spin them back down once projects are completed. Content production studios can onboard remote teams from around the world and provide them access to just the right amount of high performance infrastructure for only as long as needed—all without having to procure, set up, and manage local workstations, file systems, and low-latency networking. Amazon Nimble Studio supports both the Windows and Linux operating systems so that artists can work with their preferred third-party creative applications. Additionally, studios can use custom software applications and bring them into Amazon Nimble Studio via Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), ensuring a seamless migration from on-premises to cloud infrastructure. Amazon Nimble Studio is the latest AWS solution for media and entertainment customers, joining the AWS Thinkbox Deadline render management application as a core capability supporting content production. Media and entertainment leaders like Discovery, Disney, EuroSport, Formula 1, FOX, HBO Max, Peacock and Weta Digital use purpose-built AWS solutions that help content creators, rights holders, producers, and distributors accelerate reinvention across five key industry business areas: content production, direct-to-consumer and over-the-top (OTT) streaming, broadcast, media supply chain and archive, and data science and analytics. “Amazon Nimble Studio is going to change the way customers produce content using a cloud-based production pipeline,” said Kyle Roche, Head of Content Production Tech, AWS. “To date, studios struggle to keep up with the ever-increasing demand for creative content, which has driven an exponential increase in the computing power required to produce content—hastening obsolescence of workstations and straining on-premises storage and rendering capacity. We are excited to announce Amazon Nimble Studio, a transformational new service for the creative community built for the cloud to make it much faster, easier, and less expensive to produce the content that consumers want to watch.” Amazon Nimble Studio is available today in six AWS Regions and AWS Local Zones: US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon) Region, Canada (Central) Region, Europe (London) Region, Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region, and US Local Zone (Los Angeles), with additional region support coming soon. Anjekumi connects gamers and enables them to play games from anywhere in the world using next generation devices. “Amazon Nimble Studio allows us to concentrate on the creative result rather than the technical journey as it solves some key issues in our production pipeline,” said Kurt Rauer, CEO, Anjekumi. “Our business is a global one and with Amazon Nimble Studio we are able to engage creative people globally without the associated friction.” The California State University is a public university system in California with 23 campuses. “As the largest public higher education system in the nation, the California State University system pride ourselves on having an innovative mindset in Media & Entertainment education, empowering a majority-minority, diverse student population,” said Dina Ibrahim, Executive Director, San Francisco State University. “AWS is a perfect partner to represent a path forward for our creative programs, as we look to moving more of our education experience to the cloud in the near future, and solutions like Amazon Nimble Studio provide our students with easier, hands-on access to the latest tools in content creation technology, which better positions them for success in their careers.” Evil Eye Pictures is an Oscar and Emmy award-winning animation, visual effects, and design studio based in San Francisco, CA. “We like to go beyond the traditional and embrace emerging technologies that support innovative storytelling,” said Dan Rosen, Co-founder and Executive Creative Director, Evil Eye Pictures. “Adding Amazon Nimble Studio to our arsenal will allow us to more easily scale up and down with projects, and collaborate with the best talent, regardless of where they are located.\" Shomen Productions is a virtual animation and VFX studio that taps a global talent pool to create branded content. “We believe the future of production is dispersed teams and agile studios. Geographical access to a ready pool of talent is no longer an obstacle to creativity,” said James Bennett, Founder and Director of VFX & Animation, Shomen Productions. “A production solution like Amazon Nimble Studio allows your team to scale production resources at will and collaborate efficiently across vast distances. There is tremendous power in the ability to collaborate remotely with creatives who are spread across the world as easily as if they where sitting next to you. We believe Amazon Nimble Studio will be as impactful to creative production as iTunes was to the music industry.” Sinking Ship Entertainment is an Emmy award-winning production and new media company based in Toronto. “We’ve been eagerly following the development of Amazon Nimble Studio and look forward to adding it to our workflow,” said Shervin Shahidi, Director of Digital Transformation, Sinking Ship Entertainment. “It will bring dynamic elasticity to our capabilities and allow us to expand our talent pool to include artists worldwide.” Spire Animation Studios is a new feature animation studio. “Spire Animation was formed to empower world-class creative and technical talent to develop diverse, high-end animated entertainment for global audiences,” said Brad Lewis, Co-Founder and Chief Creative Officer, Spire Animation Studios. “By harnessing next-gen technology, like Amazon Nimble Studio and real-time game engines, we’re reimagining the content production process, even if our artists aren’t based in the same location.” Today, AWS also announced AWS for Media & Entertainment, an initiative that makes it easier for industry customers to discover, implement, and deploy purpose-built AWS capabilities and partner solutions for their highest priority workloads—enabling them to create compelling content faster, invent new customer experiences, expand direct-to-consumer offerings, and improve media supply chain efficiency. AWS for Media & Entertainment aligns the broadest and deepest set of industry-specific cloud capabilities, including purpose-built media and creative services, hardware, solutions, tools, and partners.

    "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/the-walt-disney-company-uses-aws-to-support-the-global-20210429.jpg",

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), unveiled that The Walt Disney Company is leveraging AWS for the global rollout of Disney+, one of the largest online streaming video services in the world. The Walt Disney Company relies on AWS as its preferred public cloud infrastructure provider to support the explosive growth of Disney+, which quickly surpassed 100 million subscribers only 16 months after launch in November 2019. Leveraging AWS’s fault-tolerant, highly performant infrastructure, The Walt Disney Company has been able to rapidly expand Disney+ to 59 countries across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. Disney+ is expanding its use of AWS’s industry-leading services to include more than 50 technologies, such as machine learning, database, storage, content delivery, serverless, and analytics. For example, Disney+ uses Amazon Kinesis (a service that makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data) and Amazon DynamoDB (AWS’s key-value database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale with built-in encryption and data recovery) to ingest content, metadata, and billions of customer actions each day, which enables viewers to add content to their Watch Lists, and start watching a video and pick it up on a different device, or make recommendations for what to watch next. Disney+ also uses Amazon Timestream (AWS’s serverless, time-series database built for large scale ingestion, storage, and real-time querying of times-series data) to monitor the efficacy of their streaming platform to ensure that users continue to have access to the highest quality video content. After announcing the intent to launch a dedicated streaming service in August of 2017, The Walt Disney Company spent a year laying the foundation for the streaming service. Leveraging a flexible, secured cloud video infrastructure powered by AWS, Disney+ was able to handle more than 10 million new Disney+ sign-ups within 24 hours of its November 12, 2019 launch. In order to meet consumers’ high expectations and handle the enormous global scale required, technologists behind Disney+ collaborated closely with AWS to balance loads and handle usage spikes to manage the huge peaks in demand from viewers for premium content like Hamilton, Mulan, and The Mandalorian. “Disney+ has completely reinvented what’s possible in content delivery by challenging convention and using cloud technology to build a streaming product from scratch that had never been launched and marketed before on such a global scale,” said Joe Inzerillo, executive vice president & CTO, direct-to-consumer, The Walt Disney Company. “AWS has been our preferred cloud provider for years, and its proven global infrastructure and expansive suite of services has contributed meaningfully to the incredible success of Disney+.” “Disney+ brings beloved characters and timeless stories to a global audience through world-class direct-to-consumer video services,” said Carla Stratfold, vice president of AWS global and strategic accounts at Amazon Web Services, Inc. “Only AWS’s proven global infrastructure and unparalleled set of capabilities deliver the reliability, scalability, and breadth of functionality to power one of the world’s most exciting streaming services and its expansion around the world. We look forward to continuing to provide comprehensive cloud capabilities and expertise to The Walt Disney Company to help them reinvent streaming entertainment for Disney fans globally.” About Amazon Web Services For over 15 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2021. Operating cash flow increased 69% to $67.2 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $39.7 billion for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2020. Free cash flow increased to $26.4 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $24.3 billion for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2020. Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations increased to $14.9 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $14.3 billion for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2020.

Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based awards totaled 519 million on March 31, 2021, compared with 513 million one year ago.

Excluding the $2.1 billion favorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 41% compared with first quarter 2020. Operating income increased to $8.9 billion in the first quarter, compared with operating income of $4.0 billion in first quarter 2020. Net income increased to $8.1 billion in the first quarter, or $15.79 per diluted share, compared with net income of $2.5 billion, or $5.01 per diluted share, in first quarter 2020. “Two of our kids are now 10 and 15 years old—and after years of being nurtured, they’re growing up fast and coming into their own,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. “As Prime Video turns 10, over 175 million Prime members have streamed shows and movies in the past year, and streaming hours are up more than 70% year over year. Amazon Studios received a record 12 Academy Award nominations and two wins. Upcoming originals include Tom Clancy’s Without Remorse, The Tomorrow War, The Underground Railroad, and much more. In just 15 years, AWS has become a $54 billion annual sales run rate business competing against the world’s largest technology companies, and its growth is accelerating—up 32% year over year. Companies from Airbnb to McDonald’s to Volkswagen come to AWS because we offer what is by far the broadest set of tools and services available, and we continue to invent relentlessly on their behalf. We love Prime Video and AWS, and we’re proud to have them in the family.” Highlights Our Vision to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work Amazon ranked #1 in the U.S. on LinkedIn’s 2021 Top Companies, an annual list identifying the most sought-after places to work based on their ability to attract and retain the best talent, including promotions, opportunities for employees to learn new skills, hiring people from all backgrounds and levels of education, and gender diversity. In addition, Amazon ranked #2 on the Fortune World’s Most Admired Companies list and #3 on Boston Consulting Group’s Most Innovative Companies list. In partnership with government and public health officials across the globe, Amazon is rapidly expanding on-site COVID-19 vaccination programs for its front-line employees and contractors. In addition to offering COVID-19 testing on-site, Amazon has hosted vaccination events at fulfillment centers, sort centers, delivery stations, and AWS data centers in 29 states, reaching more than 300,000 front-line employees and contractors. In some locations, Amazon opened the vaccination program to employee household members. Given the vaccination program’s progress in the U.S., it will soon expand to front-line employees in other countries. Amazon is committed to leading the way for workplaces around the world to proactively manage—and prevent—work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) by drawing on expertise in innovation and technology, and collaborating with proven thought leaders and scientists. MSDs are common in the type of work done in warehouse operations and are more likely to occur during an employee’s first six months. Amazon’s increased attention to early MSD prevention is already achieving results. From 2019 to 2020, overall MSDs decreased by 32% and MSDs resulting in time away from work decreased by more than half. Amazon is expanding its workplace health and safety program WorkingWell with the aim of cutting recordable incident rates by 50% by 2025. WorkingWell is currently available to 859,000 employees at 350 sites across North America and Europe. Through the program, small groups of employees are coached on body mechanics, proactive wellness, and safety. In addition to reducing workplace injuries, these concepts have a positive impact on regular day-to-day activities and have contributed to reducing MSD recordable incident rates. Since 2020, in partnership with Crossover Health, Amazon opened 17 neighborhood health centers for employees and their families in the areas around Dallas–Fort Worth, Texas; Detroit, Michigan; Louisville, Kentucky; Phoenix, Arizona; and San Bernardino, California. Centers are located next to where employees live and work to provide affordable, convenient, and high quality health care, and patients report a 90% satisfaction score. Amazon is evaluating expansion of the program so that even more employees can access quality care whenever, and wherever, they need it. Amazon is fitting delivery vehicles with camera safety technology and artificial intelligence to capture real-time data (such as following safe distance and road conditions) to identify at-risk driving events. These technologies are used to help keep drivers and the communities where Amazon delivers safe. When this technology was piloted in 2020 on over two million miles of delivery routes, crashes decreased 48%, stop sign violations decreased 20%, driving without a seatbelt decreased 60%, and distracted driving decreased 45%. Amazon shared comprehensive companywide goals related to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts for 2021. Goals include increasing representation of women in tech and science roles, doubling the number of Black directors and VPs for the second year in a row, and having 100% of Amazon employees take inclusion training. In addition, to evaluate progress over time, Amazon increased the amount and specificity of the data shared publicly about its employees. The expanded dataset includes representation by job type, such as front-line associates and corporate employees, and expands historical data to the past three years. Amazon pulled forward its annual fall pay review for its U.S. Customer Fulfillment, Delivery, Package Sortation, and Specialty Fulfillment teams, and will be rolling out increases from mid-May through early June. More than 500,000 people will see an increase between at least 50 cents and $3 an hour, which is an investment of over $1 billion in incremental pay for these employees. In India, Amazon announced it has added nearly 300,000 new direct and indirect jobs since its last announcement in January 2020, putting the company on track to meet its pledge to create an additional one million new jobs in India by 2025. Supporting Communities Amazon donated and delivered relief and emergency aid supplies—including over one million bottles of water and thousands of items such as flashlights, tents, and search and rescue equipment—to communities impacted by the winter storm crisis in Texas and Mississippi in February and severe storms in Tennessee and Alabama in March. Amazon Future Engineer, the company’s computer science education program for students from underserved communities, launched in France and Canada. With this expansion, the program now reaches over one million students globally each year. Amazon Future Engineer also donated $15 million to Code.org to develop a new equity-minded Advanced Placement computer science curriculum, which aims to increase access, participation, and long-term success for high school students from communities underrepresented in tech. Amazon announced a year-long partnership with The King Memorial Foundation, the organization responsible for building and maintaining the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial in Washington, D.C. Over the next year, AWS will support the Memorial Foundation’s Social Justice Fellows Program, which aims to help program participants develop their professional skills by providing them with mentorship opportunities with Amazon employees, as well as free cloud and STEM training and certification. For the partnership kick-off, Amazon joined the Foundation in a Day of Service project, delivering essential, personal care items to shelters in seven D.C. wards. Since January, Amazon has opened its Seattle campus to Virginia Mason Franciscan Health for public COVID-19 vaccinations. As of April 15, nearly 50,000 immunizations have been administered to the public through weekend pop-up clinics staffed by Amazon and community volunteers. Amazon is also providing volunteers and technology to support the Washington State vaccine call center. Since the initiative launched in late March, the system has processed over 100,000 calls and has eliminated wait times. Amazon continued its efforts to support children in need across Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the UK, Amazon donated 10,000 Fire tablets to schools lacking technology and delivered more than four million breakfasts to children in need through charity partner Magic Breakfast. In Italy and Spain, Amazon donated millions of euros to over 35,000 schools through a program that allows customers to choose the schools to which Amazon will donate. Since 2019, Amazon has worked with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and state agencies to ensure customers in nearly all 50 states can shop for groceries on Amazon using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. Amazon remains committed to increasing food access in the U.S.—especially in healthy food priority areas—and is helping raise awareness among residents about the convenient, safe, and affordably priced grocery delivery options Amazon offers their communities. As part of its ongoing work to increase food access, Amazon is establishing partnerships with local anti-hunger organizations to assist communities in need. Amazon added new Alexa features to help provide localized answers to questions on COVID-19 testing and vaccine eligibility, including the ability for customers to find and call nearby vaccine locations for booking appointments. Ring announced a new community program with Kids Off the Block, a Chicago-based nonprofit focused on providing local at-risk youth a care center for personal growth and empowerment. Ring also donated 1,000 Ring Video Doorbells and Ring subscriptions to support families and individuals in Chicago neighborhoods. Amazon introduced the Alexa Hörfilm skill in Germany, providing blind and visually-impaired customers with access to more than 3,500 TV series and movies with audio description. The skill was developed and built together with DBSV, the German association of blind or visually-impaired persons, and participating TV stations ARD, ZDF, and ARTE. The Climate Pledge Amazon continues to make progress toward powering all its businesses with 100% renewable energy by 2025—five years ahead of the original target of 2030. Amazon has announced a total of 206 renewable energy projects globally, including 71 utility-scale wind and solar projects and 135 rooftop solar installations at facilities and stores worldwide. Amazon is now the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally as well as in Europe, where the company is investing in more than 2.5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity—enough to power more than two million homes a year. Amazon welcomed 52 new signatories to The Climate Pledge, a commitment co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement 10 years early and achieve net-zero carbon by 2040. More than 100 companies representing over $1.4 trillion in global annual revenues and over five million employees have now joined the pledge, sending an important signal to the market that there will be rapid growth in demand for products and services that help reduce carbon emissions. New signatories include Alaska Airlines, Colgate-Palmolive, HEINEKEN, PepsiCo, Telefónica, and Visa. The Climate Pledge Fund invested in Infinium, a renewable electrofuels solution provider, and Turntide Technologies, an electric motor company. These investments help Amazon and other companies meet the goals of The Climate Pledge as we all work together to protect the planet. Amazon announced a partnership with Mahindra Electric, a manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs), to deploy nearly 100 Treo Zor electric vehicles in seven Indian cities as part of Amazon India’s plan to include 10,000 EVs in its delivery fleet by 2025.

Examples this quarter include working with the U.S. National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center to prevent counterfeit Super Bowl LV merchandise from reaching consumers and partnering with Pennsylvania-based, family-owned card game maker Dutch Blitz and Italian luxury brand Salvatore Ferragamo to file lawsuits against multiple counterfeiters and hold them accountable to the fullest extent of the law. In March, Amazon launched Amazon.pl, offering Polish customers a selection of more than 100 million products across more than 30 categories, including products from thousands of European and local Polish businesses. Amazon has been operating in Poland since 2014, has created over 18,000 permanent jobs, and will open its tenth fulfillment center in Swiebodzin in 2021, adding more than 1,000 new jobs to Amazon’s existing network in Poland. Amazon opened its first international physical retail stores powered by Just Walk Out technology with the launch of three Amazon Fresh locations in London. These new convenience grocery stores sell a range of products, including the new “by Amazon” private brand, and enable shoppers to enter a store, grab what they want, and leave without stopping to check out. There are now 15 Amazon Fresh physical stores around the world. Amazon Fresh grocery stores expanded into four new communities in the U.S.: Oak Lawn, Illinois; Bloomingdale, Illinois; Fullerton, California; and Long Beach, California, creating hundreds of regular full- and part-time jobs in each community with starting wages of at least $15 per hour and comprehensive benefits.

More than half of unit sales are from third-party sellers, such as women-, minority-, or veteran-owned businesses that have been certified by U.S. diversity-certifying organizations such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and Women’s Business Enterprise National Council. In the U.S., Amazon Business serves 45 states and 80 of the Fortune 100 companies, including Citigroup, Intel, Cisco, and ExxonMobil. Amazon continues to expand its air cargo network to meet growing customer demand. In January, the company announced the purchase of 11 aircraft from Delta and WestJet to expand its Amazon Air fleet to more than 85 aircraft by the end of 2022. Amazon also announced new Amazon Air sites in Toledo, Ohio and Fairbanks, Alaska, and plans to expand existing operations in Canada this summer. Entertainment This quarter marked Amazon Studios’ most successful awards season to date and the first time a streaming service has won a best picture Golden Globe award from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.

Amazon Web Services AWS announced significant customer momentum, with new commitments and migrations from customers spanning many major industries. In telecommunications, DISH is leveraging AWS’s advanced, reliable, and secure infrastructure to build a cloud-based, 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) to deliver consistent, cost-effective performance from the cloud to the edge of the network. The media and entertainment industry continues to move to AWS at a rapid pace with The Walt Disney Company working with AWS on the expansion of Disney+ to more than 100 million subscribers around the world. Some of the world’s most renowned sports leagues are choosing AWS as their technology provider to transform the fan experience. For example, the National Hockey League (NHL) uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other AWS technologies to create new viewing experiences and in-depth stats and analytics, and the PGA TOUR (TOUR) uses AWS cloud and machine learning technologies to transform the way golf content is created, distributed, and experienced. The German Bundesliga, Germany’s top national football league, uses AWS to power three new Bundesliga Match Facts to give fans deeper insights into action on the pitch, while Formula 1 (F1) uses a range of AWS technologies, including machine learning, for six new F1 Insights for the 2021 season that help motor racing fans understand the strategy of their favorite driver. Automotive companies continue to choose AWS to support the development of their next-generation vehicles. Continental, one of the world’s largest automotive parts manufacturers, announced they are collaborating with AWS to develop the Continental Automotive Edge Platform (CAEdge), which will allow automakers to develop, deploy, and manage code to run connected and autonomous vehicles.

And ABB announced a collaboration with AWS to create a cloud-based fleet management system for electric vehicles, helping companies accelerate electrification of their fleets while maintaining business continuity. AWS announced the launch of a second full region in Japan—the AWS Asia Pacific (Osaka) Region—which is an expansion of the existing AWS Osaka Local Region. The new region consists of three Availability Zones (AZs) and joins the existing 25 Availability Zones in eight AWS Regions across Asia Pacific in Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Ningxia, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo. Globally, AWS has 80 Availability Zones across 25 geographic regions, with plans to launch 15 more Availability Zones and five more AWS Regions in Australia, India, Indonesia, Spain, and Switzerland. AWS and Red Hat announced the general availability of Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), a new managed service that makes it easier for Red Hat OpenShift customers to build, scale, and manage containerized applications on AWS. With ROSA, customers can enjoy more simplified Kubernetes cluster creation without the burden of manually scaling and managing the underlying infrastructure. ROSA streamlines moving on-premises Red Hat OpenShift workloads to AWS and offers a tighter integration with other AWS technologies. AWS announced the general availability of AQUA (Advanced Query Accelerator) for Amazon Redshift, an innovative new distributed and hardware-accelerated cache that delivers up to ten times better query performance than other cloud data warehouses. AQUA brings compute to the storage layer, helping customers avoid networking bandwidth limitations by eliminating unnecessary data movement between where data is stored and compute clusters. With AQUA, customers have more up-to-date dashboards, save development time, and their systems are easier to maintain. AWS announced the general availability of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) X2gd instances, the next generation of advanced, memory-optimized instances powered by AWS-designed, Arm-based Graviton2 processors. New X2gd instances deliver up to 55% better price/performance compared to current generation x86-based X1 instances, while also offering increased memory per vCPU compared to other Graviton2-based instances. Together, the higher performance and additional memory of X2gd instances make it possible for customers to more efficiently run memory intensive workloads like in-memory databases, relational databases, electronic design automation (EDA) workloads, real-time analytics, and real-time caching servers. AWS announced Amazon Lookout for Equipment, a new service that uses AWS-developed machine learning models to help customers perform predictive maintenance on the equipment in their facilities. Amazon Lookout for Equipment ingests sensor data from a customer’s industrial equipment (e.g., pressure, flow rate, RPMs, temperature, and power), and then trains a unique machine learning model to accurately predict early warning signs of machine failure or suboptimal performance using real-time data streams from the customer’s equipment. With Amazon Lookout for Equipment, customers can detect abnormalities with speed and precision, quickly diagnose issues, reduce false alerts, and avoid expensive downtime by taking action before machine failures occur. AWS announced the general availability of Amazon Lookout for Vision, a service that analyzes images using computer vision and sophisticated machine learning capabilities to spot product or process defects and anomalies. By employing advanced machine learning techniques, Amazon Lookout for Vision is able to train a model using as few as 30 images, which can help detect manufacturing and production defects (e.g., cracks, dents, incorrect color, irregular shape, etc.) in their products and prevent costly errors from progressing down an operational line and reaching customers. AWS announced the general availability of Amazon Lookout for Metrics, a new fully managed machine learning service that helps customers monitor the most important metrics for their business (e.g., revenue, web page views, active users, transaction volume, and mobile app installations) with greater speed and accuracy. The service also makes it easier to diagnose the root cause of anomalies like unexpected dips in revenue, high rates of abandoned shopping carts, spikes in payment transaction failures, increases in new user sign-ups, and more. AWS announced new Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) One Zone storage classes that reduce storage costs by 47%, compared to existing Amazon EFS storage classes, while delivering the same features and benefits. One Zone storage classes redundantly store data within a single Availability Zone (AZ). These are ideal for customers who want cost-optimized file storage for workloads and applications (e.g., content management, developer applications, etc.) that do not require the level of availability and durability offered by regional Amazon EFS storage classes, which redundantly store data across multiple geographically separated AZs. Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 29, 2021, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our estimates as of April 29, 2021 regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed above, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. This guidance also assumes the impacts on consumer demand and spending patterns, including impacts due to concerns over the current economic outlook, will be in line with those experienced during the second quarter of 2021 to date, and the additional assumptions set forth below. However, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on our operations for the second quarter of 2021, or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations. Second Quarter 2021 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $110.0 billion and $116.0 billion, or to grow between 24% and 30% compared with second quarter 2020. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 200 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $4.5 billion and $8.0 billion, compared with $5.8 billion in second quarter 2020. This guidance assumes approximately $1.5 billion of costs related to COVID-19. This guidance assumes that Prime Day occurs in second quarter 2021. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results. These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Heute hat Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), ein Unternehmen von Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), die allgemeine Verfügbarkeit von Amazon Nimble Studio bekannt gegeben, einem neuen Dienst, mit dem Kunden ein Studio für die Produktion von Inhalten in Stunden statt Wochen einrichten können und dessen Elastizität ihnen eine nahezu unbegrenzte Skalierbarkeit und den Zugriff auf Bildsynthesemöglichkeiten nach Bedarf gewährt. Mit Amazon Nimble Studio können Kunden schnell Künstler von überall auf der Welt einbeziehen und mit ihnen zusammenarbeiten und Inhalte schneller und kostengünstiger produzieren. Künstler haben Zugriff auf beschleunigte virtuelle Workstations, Hochgeschwindigkeitsspeicher und skalierbares Rendering in der globalen Infrastruktur von AWS, damit sie Inhalte schneller erstellen können. Für die Nutzung von Amazon Nimble Studio fallen keine Vorabgebühren oder Verbindlichkeiten an, und Kunden zahlen nur für die zugrunde liegenden verwendeten AWS-Services. Um loszulegen, besuchen Sie bitte die folgende Website: https://aws.amazon.com/nimble-studio/ Um hochwertige visuelle Effekte, Animationen und kreative Inhalte zum Leben zu erwecken, haben sich Studios in der Vergangenheit auf hochleistungsfähige lokale Workstations verlassen, die über lokale Netzwerke mit geringer Latenz mit gemeinsam genutzten Dateispeichersystemen verbunden sind. Der gestiegene Appetit der Verbraucher auf Premium-Inhalte und -Erlebnisse hat zu einer höheren Nachfrage nach rechenintensivem Rendern von visuellen Effekten und Animationen geführt. Diese stetig wachsende Nachfrage führt dazu, dass Content-Produktionsstudios ihre Rechen-, Netzwerk- und Speicherinfrastruktur für Spitzenkapazitäten ausrüsten, was sich als teuer, schwierig zu verwalten und schwer skalierbar erweist. Beispielsweise generiert ein typischer animierter Spielfilm jetzt 730 Terabyte Daten und bis zu einer halben Milliarde Dateien. Dies erfordert mehr als 150 Millionen Rechenstunden und die Koordination von Hunderten von Künstlern und Technikern. Die Nachfrage der Verbraucher nach mehr Inhalten hat auch dazu geführt, dass Studios Talente aus der ganzen Welt einbeziehen müssen, die dann leistungsstarke Workstations, spezielle Software sowie Hochgeschwindigkeitsspeicher und -netzwerke benötigen. All diese Einschränkungen können zu Produktionsverzögerungen, erhöhten Kosten und verpassten Möglichkeiten für Content-Produktionsstudios führen. Mit Amazon Nimble Studio können Kunden in nur wenigen Stunden ein neues Studio für die Produktion von Inhalten erstellen. Kreativschaffende haben dann sofort Zugriff auf hochleistungsfähige Workstations, die von G4dn-Instanzen der Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) von Amazon mit NVIDIA-Grafikprozessoren (GPUs), gemeinsam genutztem Dateispeicher von Amazon FSx und Streaming mit extrem geringer Latenz über das globale AWS-Netzwerk unterstützt werden. Amazon Nimble Studio bietet Content-Produktionsstudios die Möglichkeit, mit so wenig Ressourcen wie nötig zu beginnen, diese Ressourcen zu skalieren, wenn die Anforderungen an die Bildsynthese am höchsten sind, und sie nach Abschluss der Projekte wieder herunterzufahren. Content-Produktionsstudios können Telearbeiter aus der ganzen Welt einbinden und ihnen nur so lange wie nötig Zugriff auf genau die richtige Menge an Hochleistungsinfrastruktur bieten – alles, ohne lokale Workstations, Dateisysteme und Netzwerke mit geringer Latenz beschaffen, einrichten und verwalten zu müssen. Amazon Nimble Studio unterstützt sowohl Windows- als auch Linux-Betriebssysteme, sodass Künstler mit ihren bevorzugten kreativen Anwendungen von Drittanbietern arbeiten können. Darüber hinaus können Studios benutzerdefinierte Softwareanwendungen verwenden und diese über Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) in Amazon Nimble Studio einbinden, um eine nahtlose Migration von der lokalen zur Cloud-Infrastruktur zu gewährleisten. Amazon Nimble Studio ist die neueste AWS-Lösung für Medien- und Unterhaltungskunden. Sie ist Teil der AWS-Anwendung Thinkbox Deadline für Bildsynthese-Management als Kernfunktion zur Unterstützung der Inhaltsproduktion. Führende Medien- und Unterhaltungsunternehmen wie Discovery, Disney, EuroSport, Formel 1, FOX, HBO Max, Peacock und Weta Digital verwenden speziell entwickelte AWS-Lösungen, mit denen Content-Ersteller, Rechteinhaber, Produzenten und Distributoren die Neuerfindung in fünf wichtigen Geschäftsbereichen der Branche beschleunigen können: Content-Produktion, Direct-to-Consumer- und Over-the-Top-Streaming (OTT), Rundfunk, Medienlieferkette und -archiv sowie Datenwissenschaft und Analytik. „Amazon Nimble Studio wird die Art und Weise ändern, wie Kunden Inhalte mithilfe einer cloudbasierten Produktionspipeline produzieren“, sagte Kyle Roche, Head of Content Production Tech bei AWS. „Bis heute haben die Studios Schwierigkeiten, mit der ständig steigenden Nachfrage nach kreativen Inhalten Schritt zu halten, was zu einem exponentiellen Anstieg der für die Erstellung von Inhalten erforderlichen Rechenleistung geführt hat – dies beschleunigt die Veralterung von Workstations und belastet die Speicher- und Rendering-Kapazität vor Ort. Wir freuen uns, Ihnen Amazon Nimble Studio vorstellen zu können, einen revolutionären neuen Service für Kreativschaffende, der für die Cloud entwickelt wurde, um die Produktion der Inhalte, welche die Verbraucher sehen möchten, viel schneller, einfacher und kostengünstiger zu gestalten.“ Amazon Nimble Studio ist ab sofort in sechs AWS-Regionen und lokalen AWS-Zonen verfügbar: Region US-Ost (N. Virginia), Region US-West (Oregon), Region Kanada (Central), Region Europa (London), Region Asien-Pazifik (Sydney) und lokale US-Zone (Los Angeles). Weitere Regionen kommen in Kürze hinzu. Anjekumi verbindet Spieler und ermöglicht ihnen, Spiele von überall auf der Welt mit Geräten der nächsten Generation zu spielen. „Mit Amazon Nimble Studio können wir uns eher auf das kreative Ergebnis als auf den technischen Weg konzentrieren, da es einige wesentliche Probleme in unserer Produktionspipeline löst“, sagte Kurt Rauer, CEO von Anjekumi. „Unser Geschäft ist global, und mit Amazon Nimble Studio können wir kreative Menschen weltweit ohne die damit verbundenen Reibungen einbeziehen.“ Die California State University ist ein staatliches Universitätssystem in Kalifornien mit 23 Standorten. „Als größtes öffentliches Hochschulsystem des Landes ist das System der California State University stolz darauf, eine innovative Denkweise in der Medien- und Unterhaltungsbildung zu haben, die eine vielfältige, aus einer Minderheitsmehrheit bestehende Studentenschaft befähigt“, sagte Dina Ibrahim, Executive Director der San Francisco State University. „AWS ist ein perfekter Partner, um einen Weg nach vorne für unsere kreativen Programme darzustellen, da wir in naher Zukunft mehr von unseren Bildungserlebnissen in die Cloud verlagern möchten. Darüber hinaus bieten Lösungen wie Amazon Nimble Studio unseren Studierenden einen einfacheren, praktischen Zugriff auf die neuesten technischen Instrumente für Content-Creation, wodurch sie sich besser für eine erfolgreiche Karriere aufstellen können.“ Evil Eye Pictures ist ein mit Oscar- und Emmy-Preisen ausgezeichnetes Animations-, Effekt- und Designstudio mit Sitz in der kalifornischen Metropole San Francisco. „Wir gehen gerne über das Traditionelle hinaus und setzen auf neue Technologien, die innovatives Storytelling unterstützen“, sagte Dan Rosen, Mitbegründer und Executive Creative Director von Evil Eye Pictures. „Durch die Aufnahme von Amazon Nimble Studio in unser Arsenal können wir Projekte einfacher skalieren und mit den besten Talenten zusammenarbeiten, unabhängig davon, wo sie sich befinden.“ Shomen Productions ist ein virtuelles Animations- und VFX-Studio, das einen globalen Talentpool nutzt, um Markeninhalte zu erstellen. „Wir glauben, dass die Zukunft der Produktion aus verstreuten Teams und agilen Studios besteht. Der geografische Zugang zu einem bereitgestellten Talentpool ist kein Hindernis mehr für die Kreativität“, sagte James Bennett, Gründer und Direktor von VFX & Animation bei Shomen Productions. „Mit einer Produktionslösung wie Amazon Nimble Studio kann Ihr Team Produktionsressourcen nach Belieben skalieren und über große Entfernungen hinweg effizient zusammenarbeiten. Die Fähigkeit, so einfach aus der Ferne mit Kreativschaffenden zusammenzuarbeiten, die auf der ganzen Welt verteilt sind, als ob sie neben Ihnen sitzen würden, hat enorme Anziehungskraft. Wir glauben, dass Amazon Nimble Studio für die kreative Produktion genauso wichtig sein wird wie iTunes für die Musikindustrie.“ Sinking Ship Entertainment ist ein mit mehreren Emmy-Preisen ausgezeichnetes Produktions- und New-Media-Unternehmen mit Sitz in Toronto. „Wir haben die Entwicklung von Amazon Nimble Studio mit Spannung verfolgt und freuen uns darauf, diese Lösung in unseren Workflow aufzunehmen“, sagte Shervin Shahidi, Direktor des Bereichs Digital Transformation bei Sinking Ship Entertainment. „Sie wird unseren Fähigkeiten dynamische Elastizität verleihen und es uns ermöglichen, unseren Talentpool auf Künstler weltweit auszudehnen.“ Spire Animation Studios ist ein neues Studio für Animationen in Spielfilmlänge. „Spire Animation wurde gegründet, um kreative und technische Talente von Weltklasse in die Lage zu versetzen, vielfältige animierte High-End-Unterhaltung für ein globales Publikum zu entwickeln“, sagte Brad Lewis, Mitbegründer und Chief Creative Officer von Spire Animation Studios. „Durch die Nutzung von Technologien der nächsten Generation wie Amazon Nimble Studio und Echtzeit-Spiel-Engines überdenken wir den Prozess der Inhaltsproduktion, auch wenn unsere Künstler nicht am selben Ort ansässig sind.“ Heute kündigte AWS auch AWS for Media & Entertainment an, eine Initiative, die es Branchenkunden erleichtert, speziell entwickelte AWS-Funktionen und Partnerlösungen für ihre Workloads mit höchster Priorität zu entdecken, zu implementieren und bereitzustellen. Dies ermöglicht es ihnen, überzeugende Inhalte schneller zu erstellen, neue Kundenerlebnisse zu erfinden, Angebote direkt an den Verbraucher zu erweitern und die Effizienz der Medienversorgungskette zu verbessern. AWS for Media & Entertainment richtet die breitesten und tiefsten branchenspezifischen Cloud-Funktionen aus, einschließlich speziell entwickelter Medien- und Kreativdienste, Hardware, Lösungen, Tools und Partner. AWS for Media & Entertainment richtet außerdem dedizierte Ressourcen in jedem Branchenlösungsbereich ein, um Kunden dabei zu helfen, die Wertschöpfungszeit zu verkürzen, indem AWS-interne Ressourcen, AWS Professional Services und mehr als 400 branchenspezifische ISV-Partner (Independent Software Vendor) sowie mehr als 100 Systemintegratoren (SI) aufeinander abgestimmt werden.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hoy, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), compañía de Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), anunció la disponibilidad general de Amazon Nimble Studio, nuevo servicio que permite a los clientes configurar un estudio de producción de contenido en horas en lugar de semanas, con una elasticidad que les da una escala casi ilimitada y acceso a la representación a pedido. Con Amazon Nimble Studio, los clientes pueden incorporarse rápidamente, colaborar con artistas de cualquier parte del mundo, y producir contenido de forma más rápida y rentable. Los artistas tendrán acceso a estaciones de trabajo virtuales aceleradas, almacenamiento de alta velocidad y representación escalable en toda la infraestructura global de AWS para que puedan crear contenido más rápido. No hay tarifas ni compromisos por adelantado para utilizar Amazon Nimble Studio, y los clientes pagan solo por los servicios subyacentes de AWS utilizados. Para comenzar, visite: https://aws.amazon.com/nimble-studio/ Para dar vida a los efectos visuales, la animación y el contenido creativo de alta calidad, los estudios históricamente se han basado en estaciones de trabajo locales de alto rendimiento conectadas a sistemas de almacenamiento de archivos compartidos a través de redes locales de baja latencia. El aumento del interés de los consumidores por el contenido y las experiencias de primer nivel ha impulsado una mayor demanda de generación de efectos visuales y animaciones con un uso intensivo de la informática.. Esta demanda cada vez mayor hace que los estudios de producción de contenido provean en exceso su infraestructura de procesamiento, redes y almacenamiento para la capacidad máxima, lo que resulta costoso, difícil de administrar y difícil de escalar. Por ejemplo, un largometraje animado típico genera ahora 730 terabytes de datos y hasta 500 millones de archivos, lo que requiere más de 150 millones de horas de procesamiento central y la coordinación de cientos de artistas e ingenieros. La demanda de los consumidores de más contenido también ha requerido que los estudios incorporen talentos de todo el mundo, que luego requieren estaciones de trabajo de alta potencia, software especializado y almacenamiento y redes de alta velocidad. Todas estas limitaciones pueden resultar en retrasos en la producción, mayores gastos y pérdida de oportunidades para los estudios de producción de contenido. Con Amazon Nimble Studio, los clientes pueden crear un nuevo estudio de producción de contenido en tan solo unas horas. Luego, el talento creativo tiene acceso inmediato a estaciones de trabajo de alto rendimiento impulsadas por instancias G4dn de Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) con unidades de procesamiento gráfico (Graphical Processing Units, GPU) de NVIDIA, almacenamiento de archivos compartidos de Amazon FSx y transmisión de latencia ultrabaja a través de la red global de AWS. Amazon Nimble Studio brinda a los estudios de producción de contenido la capacidad de comenzar con la menor cantidad de recursos según sea necesario, aumentar esos recursos cuando las demandas de procesamiento alcanzan el máximo y reducirlos una vez que se completan los proyectos. Los estudios de producción de contenido pueden incorporar equipos remotos de todo el mundo y brindarles acceso a la cantidad justa de infraestructura de alto rendimiento durante el tiempo que sea necesario, todo sin tener que adquirir, configurar y administrar estaciones de trabajo locales, sistemas de archivos y redes de baja latencia. Amazon Nimble Studio es compatible con los sistemas operativos Windows y Linux para que los artistas puedan trabajar con sus aplicaciones creativas de terceros preferidas. Además, los estudios pueden usar aplicaciones de software personalizadas y llevarlas a Amazon Nimble Studio a través de Amazon Machine Images (AMI), lo que garantiza una migración perfecta desde la infraestructura local a la nube. Amazon Nimble Studio es la última solución de AWS para clientes de medios y entretenimiento, que se une a la aplicación de gestión de representación AWS Thinkbox Deadline como una capacidad central que respalda la producción de contenido. Líderes de medios y entretenimiento como Discovery, Disney, EuroSport, Formula 1, FOX, HBO Max, Peacock y Weta Digital utilizan soluciones AWS diseñadas específicamente para ayudar a los creadores de contenido, titulares de derechos, productores y distribuidores a acelerar la reinvención en cinco áreas comerciales clave de la industria: producción de contenido, transmisión libre (over-the-top, OTT) y directa al consumidor, difusión, cadena de suministro y archivo de medios, y análisis y ciencia de datos. “Amazon Nimble Studio va a cambiar la forma en que los clientes producen contenido al utilizar una línea de producción basada en la nube”, manifestó Kyle Roche, director de Tecnología de producción de contenido de AWS. “Hasta la fecha, los estudios luchan por mantenerse al día con la demanda cada vez mayor de contenido creativo, lo que ha impulsado un aumento exponencial de la potencia informática necesaria para producir contenido, ha acelerado la obsolescencia de las estaciones de trabajo, y ha agotado la capacidad de almacenamiento y de procesamiento en las instalaciones. Nos complace anunciar Amazon Nimble Studio, nuevo servicio transformador para la comunidad creativa creado para la nube para que sea mucho más rápido, más fácil y menos costoso producir el contenido que los consumidores quieren ver”. Amazon Nimble Studio está disponible hoy en seis regiones de AWS y zonas locales de AWS: este de los EE. UU. (Virginia del Norte), oeste de los EE. UU. (Oregón), Región (central) de Canadá, Región de Europa (Londres), Región de Asia Pacífico (Sídney) y Zona local de los EE. UU. (Los Ángeles). Anjekumi conecta a los jugadores y les permite jugar desde cualquier parte del mundo mediante el uso de dispositivos de próxima generación. “Amazon Nimble Studio nos permite concentrarnos en el resultado creativo en lugar del camino técnico, ya que resuelve algunos problemas clave en nuestra línea de producción”, comentó Kurt Rauer, director ejecutivo de Anjekumi. “Nuestro negocio es global y con Amazon Nimble Studio podemos involucrar a personas creativas a nivel mundial sin la fricción asociada”. La Universidad Estatal de California es un sistema universitario público en California con 23 campus. “Como el sistema de educación superior pública más grande de la nación, el sistema de la Universidad Estatal de California se enorgullece de tener una mentalidad innovadora en la educación de Medios y Entretenimiento, al empoderar a una población estudiantil diversa, mayoritaria y minoritaria”, indicó Dina Ibrahim, directora ejecutiva de la Universidad Estatal de San Francisco. “AWS es un socio perfecto para representar un camino a seguir para nuestros programas creativos, ya que buscamos trasladar más de nuestra experiencia educativa a la nube en un futuro cercano, y soluciones como Amazon Nimble Studio brindan a nuestros estudiantes un acceso más fácil y práctico a las últimas herramientas en tecnología de creación de contenido, lo que los posiciona mejor para el éxito en sus carreras”. Evil Eye Pictures es un estudio de animación, efectos visuales y diseño ganador de premios Óscar y Emmy con sede en San Francisco, CA. “Nos gusta ir más allá de lo tradicional y adoptar tecnologías emergentes que apoyan la narración innovadora”, expresó Dan Rosen, cofundador y director creativo ejecutivo de Evil Eye Pictures. “La incorporación de Amazon Nimble Studio a nuestro arsenal nos permitirá ampliar y reducir más fácilmente los proyectos y colaborar con los mejores talentos, independientemente de dónde se encuentren”. Shomen Productions es un estudio de animación virtual y efectos visuales que aprovecha un grupo de talentos global para crear contenido de marca. “Creemos que el futuro de la producción son equipos dispersos y estudios ágiles. El acceso geográfico a un grupo de talentos preparado ya no es un obstáculo para la creatividad”, afirmó James Bennett, fundador y director de Efectos visuales y Animación de Shomen Productions. “Una solución de producción como Amazon Nimble Studio permite a su equipo aumentar los recursos de producción cuando lo desee y colaborar de manera eficiente a través de grandes distancias. Existe un enorme poder en la capacidad de colaborar de forma remota con creativos que se encuentran repartidos por todo el mundo con tanta facilidad como si estuvieran sentados a su lado. Creemos que Amazon Nimble Studio será tan impactante para la producción creativa como lo fue iTunes para la industria de la música”. Sinking Ship Entertainment es una productora ganadora de un premio Emmy y una compañía de nuevos medios con sede en Toronto. “Hemos seguido con entusiasmo el desarrollo de Amazon Nimble Studio y esperamos agregarlo a nuestro flujo de trabajo”, opinó Shervin Shahidi, director de Transformación Digital de Sinking Ship Entertainment. “Aportará elasticidad dinámica a nuestras capacidades y nos permitirá ampliar nuestro grupo de talentos para incluir artistas de todo el mundo”. Spire Animation Studios es un nuevo estudio de animación. “Spire Animation se formó para capacitar al talento creativo y técnico de clase mundial para desarrollar entretenimiento animado diverso y de alta gama para audiencias globales”, expresó Brad Lewis, cofundador y director creativo de Spire Animation Studios. “Al aprovechar la tecnología de próxima generación, como Amazon Nimble Studio y los motores de juegos en tiempo real, reinventamos el proceso de producción de contenido, incluso si nuestros artistas no se encuentran en la misma ubicación”. Hoy, AWS también anunció AWS para el sector multimedia y de entretenimiento, iniciativa que facilita a los clientes de la industria descubrir, implementar y configurar capacidades de AWS diseñadas específicamente y soluciones de socios para sus cargas de trabajo de mayor prioridad, lo que les permite crear contenido atractivo más rápido, inventar nuevas experiencias para los clientes, ampliar las ofertas directas al consumidor y mejorar la eficiencia de la cadena de suministro de contenido multimedia. AWS para el sector multimedia y de entretenimiento alinea el conjunto más amplio y profundo de capacidades de nube específicas de la industria, incluidos los servicios creativos y de contenido multimedia diseñados específicamente, el hardware, las soluciones, las herramientas y los socios.

    "site": "businesswire.com",
    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aujourd’hui, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), une société d’Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ : AMZN), a annoncé la disponibilité générale d’Amazon Nimble Studio, un nouveau service permettant aux clients de mettre en place un studio de production de contenus en quelques heures plutôt qu’en quelques semaines, avec une élasticité qui leur confère une échelle quasi illimitée et un accès au rendu à la demande. Avec Amazon Nimble Studio, les clients peuvent rapidement intégrer dans leur équipe des artistes de n’importe quelle partie du monde et collaborer avec eux, puis produire du contenu plus rapidement et de manière plus rentable. Les artistes auront accès à des stations de travail virtuelles accélérées, à un stockage haut débit et à un rendu évolutif sur l’ensemble de l’infrastructure mondiale d’AWS afin de pouvoir créer du contenu plus rapidement. Il n’y a pas de frais initiaux ni d’engagements pour utiliser Amazon Nimble Studio, et les clients ne paient que pour les services AWS sous-jacents utilisés. Pour démarrer, visitez : https://aws.amazon.com/nimble-studio/ Pour donner vie à des effets visuels, à des animations et à des contenus créatifs de haute qualité, les studios s’appuyaient jusqu’ici sur des stations de travail locales haute performance, connectées à des systèmes de stockage de fichiers partagés, fonctionnant sur des réseaux locaux à faible latence. Le désir de plus en plus intense des consommateurs pour des contenus et des expériences premium a entraîné une demande accrue pour un rendu intensif en calcul informatique des effets visuels et des animations. Cette demande sans cesse croissante a conduit les studios de production de contenu à surprovisionner leurs infrastructures de calcul, de mise en réseau et de stockage pour une capacité de pointe, ce qui est en général coûteux, difficile à gérer et difficile à mettre à l’échelle. Par exemple, un long métrage d’animation typique génère désormais 730 téraoctets de données et jusqu’à un demi-milliard de fichiers, ce qui nécessite plus de 150 millions d’heures de calcul de base et la coordination de centaines d’artistes et d’ingénieurs. La demande des consommateurs pour davantage de contenus a également contraint les studios à intégrer des talents du monde entier, qui ont besoin de postes de travail à haute puissance, de logiciels spécialisés, ainsi que d’un stockage et d’un réseau à haut débit. Toutes ces contraintes peuvent entraîner des retards de production, une augmentation des dépenses et des opportunités perdues pour les studios de production de contenu. Avec l’aide d’Amazon Nimble Studio, les clients peuvent créer un nouveau studio de production de contenu en quelques heures seulement. Les créateurs bénéficient ensuite d’un accès immédiat à des stations de travail haute performance alimentées par des instances d’Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) G4dn avec des unités de traitement graphique (Graphical Processing Units, GPU) NVIDIA, le stockage de fichiers partagé d’Amazon FSx et un streaming à très faible latence via le réseau mondial AWS. Amazon Nimble Studio donne aux studios de production de contenu la possibilité de démarrer avec aussi peu de ressources que nécessaire, d’augmenter ces ressources lorsque la demande de rendu atteint son niveau maximal et de les réduire une fois les projets terminés. Les studios de production de contenu peuvent intégrer des équipes à distance du monde entier et leur donner accès à l’exacte quantité d’infrastructures haute performance aussi longtemps que nécessaire, le tout sans avoir à acheter, configurer et gérer des postes de travail, des systèmes de fichiers et une mise en réseau à faible latence au niveau local. Amazon Nimble Studio prend en charge les systèmes d’exploitation Windows et Linux afin que les artistes puissent travailler avec leurs applications créatives tierces préférées. De plus, les studios peuvent utiliser des applications logicielles personnalisées et les intégrer dans Amazon Nimble Studio via Amazon Machine Images (AMI), garantissant une migration transparente des infrastructures depuis le site vers le cloud. Amazon Nimble Studio est la dernière solution d’AWS pour les clients travaillant dans les domaines des médias et du divertissement, et la plateforme vient s’ajouter à l’application de gestion de rendu AWS Thinkbox Deadline, en tant que capacité de base prenant en charge la production de contenu. Les chefs de file de l’industrie des médias et du divertissement comme Discovery, Disney, EuroSport, Formula 1, FOX, HBO Max, Peacock et Weta Digital utilisent des solutions d’AWS spécialement adaptées à leurs besoins pour aider les créateurs de contenu, les titulaires de droits, les producteurs et les distributeurs à accélérer la réinvention dans cinq domaines d’activité clés de l’industrie : production de contenu, streaming direct au consommateur et service par contournement (over-the-top, OTT), diffusion, chaîne d’approvisionnement et archives multimédias, et science et analyse des données. « Amazon Nimble Studio va changer la façon dont les clients produisent du contenu à l’aide d’un pipeline de production basé sur le cloud », a déclaré Kyle Roche, responsable de la technologie de production de contenu chez AWS. « Aujourd’hui, les studios ont du mal à répondre à la demande sans cesse croissante pour des contenus créatifs, et cela a entraîné une augmentation exponentielle de la puissance de calcul requise pour produire lesdits contenus, accélérant l’obsolescence des postes de travail et mettant à rude épreuve les capacités de stockage et de rendu sur site. Nous sommes par conséquent ravis d’annoncer Amazon Nimble Studio, un nouveau service transformationnel destiné à la communauté des créateurs et conçu pour le cloud, qui vise à rendre la production des contenus que les consommateurs souhaitent regarder beaucoup plus rapide, plus facile et moins onéreuse. » Amazon Nimble Studio est disponible dès aujourd’hui dans six régions et zones locales d’AWS : Région Est des États-Unis (Virginie du Nord), Région Ouest des États-Unis (Oregon), Région Canada (Centre), Région Europe (Londres), Région Asie-Pacifique (Sydney) et Zone locale États-Unis (Los Angeles), avec un support régional supplémentaire à venir. Anjekumi connecte les gamers et leur permet de jouer à des jeux où qu’ils soient dans le monde en utilisant des appareils de nouvelle génération. « Amazon Nimble Studio résout certains problèmes clés de notre pipeline de production et nous permet par conséquent de nous concentrer sur le résultat créatif plutôt que sur le parcours technique », a déclaré Kurt Rauer, PDG d’Anjekumi. « Nos activités sont internationales et avec Amazon Nimble Studio, nous sommes en mesure d’engager des créateurs du monde entier sans les problèmes que cela implique généralement. » L’université d’État de Californie est un système universitaire public californien qui compte 23 campus. « En tant que plus grand système d’enseignement supérieur public du pays, le système de l’université d’État de Californie est fier de l’état d’esprit novateur dont il fait preuve dans la formation aux médias et au divertissement, offrant une option valorisante à une population estudiantine diversifiée principalement issue des minorités », a déclaré Dina Ibrahim, directrice générale de l’université d’État de San Francisco. « AWS est un partenaire idéal car il nous montre une voie à suivre pour nos programmes créatifs, à l’heure où nous cherchons à déplacer une plus grande partie de notre expérience éducative vers le cloud dans un proche avenir. Des solutions comme Amazon Nimble Studio offrent à nos étudiants un accès plus facile et pratique aux derniers outils de technologie de création de contenu, ce qui leur permet d’être mieux positionnés pour réussir dans leur carrière. » Evil Eye Pictures est un studio d’animation, d’effets visuels et de design primé aux Oscars et aux Emmys basé à San Francisco, en Californie. « Nous aimons aller au-delà des technologies traditionnelles et adopter des technologies émergentes qui permettent un storytelling innovant », a déclaré Dan Rosen, cofondateur et directeur exécutif de la création chez Evil Eye Pictures. « L’ajout d’Amazon Nimble Studio à notre arsenal va nous permettre d’augmenter et de réduire plus facilement l’échelle de nos projets, ainsi que de collaborer avec les meilleurs talents, quel que soit l’endroit où ils se trouvent. » Shomen Productions est un studio spécialisé dans les animations virtuelles et les effets visuels qui fait appel à un bassin mondial de talents pour créer du contenu de marque. « Nous sommes convaincus que l’avenir de la production réside dans des équipes dispersées et des studios agiles. L’accès géographique à un vivier de talents prêts à être engagés n’est plus un obstacle à la créativité », a déclaré James Bennett, fondateur de Shomen Productions et directeur des effets visuels et des animations. « Une solution de production comme Amazon Nimble Studio permet à votre équipe de faire évoluer les ressources de production à volonté et de collaborer efficacement sur de grandes distances. C’est énorme d’avoir la possibilité de collaborer à distance avec des créateurs répartis dans le monde entier, aussi facilement que s’ils étaient assis à côté de vous. Nous pensons qu’Amazon Nimble Studio aura autant d’impact sur la production créative qu’iTunes a pu l’avoir sur l’industrie de la musique. » Sinking Ship Entertainment est une société de production et de nouveaux médias primée aux Emmys et basée à Toronto. « Nous avons suivi avec grand intérêt le développement d’Amazon Nimble Studio et sommes impatients de l’ajouter à notre flux de travail », a déclaré Shervin Shahidi, directeur de la transformation numérique chez Sinking Ship Entertainment. « La plateforme va apporter une élasticité dynamique à nos capacités et nous permettre d’élargir notre vivier de talents pour inclure des artistes du monde entier. » Spire Animation Studios est un nouveau studio d’animation spécialisé dans les longs métrages. « Spire Animation a été créé pour permettre aux talents créatifs et techniques de classe mondiale de développer des divertissements animés diversifiés et haut de gamme pour un public mondial », a déclaré Brad Lewis, cofondateur et directeur de la création de Spire Animation Studios. « En tirant parti de technologies de nouvelle génération, comme Amazon Nimble Studio ou encore des moteurs de jeux en temps réel, nous réinventons le processus de production de contenus, même si nos artistes ne sont pas tous basés au même endroit. » Aujourd’hui, AWS a également annoncé AWS for Media & Entertainment, une initiative permettant aux clients de l’industrie de découvrir, d’implémenter et de déployer plus facilement des capacités spécialement conçues par AWS ainsi que des solutions partenaires pour leurs charges de travail les plus prioritaires - leur permettant de créer des contenus convaincants plus rapidement, d’inventer de nouvelles expériences client, d’étendre les offres directes aux consommateurs et d’améliorer l’efficacité de la chaîne d’approvisionnement médiatique. AWS for Media & Entertainment aligne l’ensemble le plus large et le plus complet de capacités cloud spécifiques à l’industrie, y compris des services multimédias et créatifs spécialement conçus, du matériel, des solutions, des outils et des partenaires. AWS for Media & Entertainment établit également des ressources dédiées dans chaque domaine de solution de l’industrie pour aider les clients à accélérer leurs délais de rentabilisation, en alignant les ressources internes d’AWS, AWS Professional Services, plus de 400 partenaires éditeurs de logiciels indépendants (Independent Software Vendor, ISV) spécifiques à l’industrie et plus de 100 intégrateurs système (System Integrators, SI).

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hoje, a Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), uma empresa Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), anunciou a disponibilidade geral do Amazon Nimble Studio, um novo serviço que permite que clientes criem um estúdio de produção de conteúdo em horas, ao invés de semanas, com elasticidade que permite escala quase ilimitada e acesso a renderização sob demanda. Com o Amazon Nimble Studio, os clientes podem rapidamente integrar e colaborar com artistas de qualquer parte do mundo, e produzir conteúdo mais rapidamente e com mais economia. Artistas terão acesso a estações de trabalho virtuais aceleradas, armazenamento de alta velocidade, e renderização escalável na infraestrutura global da AWS para que possam criar conteúdo mais rapidamente. Não há taxas iniciais ou comprometimentos para utilizar o Amazon Nimble Studio, e os clientes pagam apenas pelos serviços AWS subjacentes utilizados. Para começar, visite: https://aws.amazon.com/nimble-studio/ Para dar vida a efeitos visuais de alta qualidade, animações e conteúdo criativo, os estúdios têm historicamente confiado em estações de trabalho locais de alto desempenho conectadas a sistemas de armazenamento de arquivos compartilhados via redes locais de baixa latência. O apetite aumentado do consumidor por conteúdo e experiências premium tem gerado uma maior demanda por renderização de computação intensiva de efeitos visuais e animações. Essa crescente demanda faz com que estúdios de produção de conteúdo provisionem em excesso sua infraestrutura de computação, rede e armazenamento para capacidades de pico, o que prova ser caro, difícil de administrar e trabalhoso para escalar. Por exemplo, um filme típico de animação atualmente gera 730 terabytes de dados e até meio bilhão de arquivos, requerendo mais de 150 milhões de horas de computação central e coordenação de centenas de artistas e engenheiros. A demanda do consumidor por mais conteúdo também requer que os estúdios integrem talentos de todo o mundo, o que exige estações de trabalho de alta potência, software especializado, e rede e armazenamento de alta velocidade. Todas essas restrições podem resultar em atrasos na produção, aumento de despesas, e perda de oportunidades para estúdios de produção de conteúdo. Utilizando o Amazon Nimble Studio, clientes podem criar um novo estúdio de produção em apenas algumas horas. Assim, o talento criativo tem acesso imediato a estações de trabalho de alto desempenho alimentadas por instâncias da Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) G4dn com unidades de processamento gráfico (Graphical Processing Units, GPUs) NVIDIA, armazenamento compartilhado de arquivo da Amazon FSx, e transmissão de latência ultrabaixa através da rede global AWS. O Amazon Nimble Studio entrega aos estúdios de produção de conteúdo a habilidade de começar com os mínimos recursos necessários, escalar esses recursos ao renderizar picos de demandas, e reduzindo-os quando os projetos forem concluídos. Os estúdios de produção de conteúdo podem integrar equipes remotas ao redor do mundo e fornecer acesso a apenas à quantidade correta de infraestrutura de alto desempenho somente pelo tempo necessário — tudo isso sem precisar adquirir, configurar e gerenciar estações de trabalho, sistemas de arquivos e redes de baixa latência locais. O Amazon Nimble Studio suporta os sistemas operacionais Linux e Windows para que artistas possam trabalhar com seus aplicativos prediletos de criação de terceiros. Além disso, os estúdios podem utilizar aplicativos de softwares personalizados e integrá-los ao Amazon Nimble Studio através do Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), garantindo uma migração ininterrupta de infraestrutura local para a nuvem. O Amazon Nimble Studio é a mais recente solução da AWS para clientes de mídia e entretenimento, juntando-se ao aplicativo de gerenciamento de renderização AWS Thinkbox Deadline como um recurso principal suportando produção de conteúdo. Líderes de mídia e entretenimento como Discovery, Disney, EuroSport, Formula 1, FOX, HBO Max, Peacock e Weta Digital utilizam soluções AWS criadas especialmente e que ajudam criadores de conteúdo, detentores de direitos, produtoras e distribuidoras a acelerar a reinvenção em cinco importantes áreas de negócios do setor: produção de conteúdo, transmissão direta para o consumidor e over-the-top (OTT), difusão, cadeia de suprimento de mídia e arquivo, e ciência de dados e análises. “O Amazon Nimble Studio vai mudar a maneira que os clientes produzem conteúdo utilizando um canal de produção baseado na nuvem”, disse Kyle Roche, chefe de tecnologia de produção de conteúdo na AWS. “Até hoje, os estúdios têm dificuldades para acompanhar a crescente demanda por conteúdo criativo, que tem impulsionado um aumento exponencial no poder computacional necessário para produzir conteúdo — acelerando a obsolescência de estações de trabalho e exigindo capacidade de armazenamento e renderização no local. Estamos entusiasmados em anunciar o Amazon Nimble Studio, um novo serviço transformador para a comunidade criativa, criado para que a nuvem torne muito mais rápida, mais fácil e menos cara a produção do conteúdo que consumidores desejam assistir”. O Amazon Nimble Studio está disponível hoje em seis regiões AWS e zonas locais AWS: Leste dos EUA (Virgínia do Norte), região Oeste dos EUA (Oregon), região do Canadá (Central), região da Europa (Londres), região Ásia-Pacífico (Sydney), e zona local dos EUA (Los Angeles), com suportes regionais adicionais em breve. A Anjekumi conecta jogadores e permite que eles joguem de qualquer parte do mundo utilizando dispositivos de próxima geração. “O Amazon Nimble Studio nos permite concentrar no resultado criativo em vez da jornada técnica, solucionando alguns importantes problemas em nosso canal de produção”, disse Kurt Rauer, diretor executivo da Anjekumi. “Nossa empresa é global e com o Amazon Nimble Studio podemos envolver pessoas criativas globalmente sem o atrito associado”. A Universidade Estadual da Califórnia é um sistema de universidade pública com 23 campi. “Como o maior sistema público de educação superior no país, o sistema da Universidade Estadual da Califórnia se orgulha de ter uma mentalidade inovadora na educação de Mídia e Entretenimento, capacitando uma população estudantil de minoria majoritária diversa”, disse Dina Ibrahim, diretora executiva da Universidade Estadual de São Francisco. “A AWS é uma parceira perfeita para representar um caminho a seguir para nossos programas criativos, no momento que buscamos mover mais da nossa experiência educacional para a nuvem no futuro próximo, e soluções como o Amazon Nimble Studio oferecem aos nossos alunos um acesso mais fácil e prático às mais recentes ferramentas em tecnologia de criação de conteúdo, que melhor os posicionam para o sucesso em suas carreiras”. O Evil Eye Pictures é um estúdio de animação, efeitos visuais e design vencedor do Oscar e do Emmy baseado em São Francisco, Califórnia. “Gostamos de ir além do tradicional e adotar tecnologias emergentes que suportam narrativas inovadoras”, afirmou Dan Rosen, cofundador e diretor executivo de criação da Evil Eye Pictures. “Adicionar o Amazon Nimble Studio ao nosso arsenal nos permitirá escalar e reduzir projetos mais facilmente, e colaborar com o melhor talento, independentemente de onde ele esteja localizado”. A Shomen Productions é um estúdio de animação virtual e VFX que contrata um grupo de talentos globais para criar conteúdo de marca. “Acreditamos que o futuro da produção é de equipes espalhadas e estúdios ágeis. O acesso geográfico a um grupo pronto de talentos não é mais um obstáculo à criatividade”, disse James Bennett, fundador e diretor de VFX e animação da Shomen Productions. “Uma solução de produção como o Amazon Nimble Studio permite que sua equipe escale recursos de produção à vontade e colabore eficientemente entre grandes distâncias. Há um enorme poder na habilidade de colaborar remotamente com criativos que estão espalhados pelo mundo, de maneira tão fácil como se eles estivessem sentados ao seu lado. Acreditamos que o Amazon Nimble Studio será tão impactante para a produção criativa como o iTunes foi para o setor da música”. A Sinking Ship Entertainment é uma empresa de produção e de novas mídias vencedora do Emmy baseada em Toronto. “Estamos seguindo ativamente o desenvolvimento do Amazon Nimble Studio e esperamos adicioná-la ao nosso fluxo de trabalho”, disse Shervin Shahidi, diretor de transformação digital da Sinking Ship Entertainment. “Ele trará elasticidade dinâmica aos nossos recursos e nos permitirá expandir nosso grupo de talentos para incluir artistas mundialmente”. O Spire Animation Studios é um novo estúdio de filmes de animação. “A Spire Animation foi criada para fortalecer talentos criativos e técnicos de classe mundial para desenvolver entretenimento animado diverso e de ponta para audiências globais”, disse Brad Lewis, cofundador e diretor executivo da Spire Animation Studios. “Ao aproveitarmos tecnologia de próxima geração, como o Amazon Nimble Studio e mecanismos de jogos em tempo real, estamos reimaginando o processo de produção de conteúdo, mesmo se nossos artistas não estiverem na mesma localidade”. Hoje, a AWS também anunciou a AWS for Media & Entertainment, uma iniciativa que torna mais fácil para que clientes do setor descubram, implementem e implantem recursos AWS e soluções de parceiras criadas especialmente para suas cargas de trabalho de mais alta prioridade — permitindo que eles criem conteúdos convincentes mais rapidamente, inventem novas experiências de consumidor, expandam ofertas diretas ao consumidor, e aprimorem a eficiência da cadeia de suprimentos de mídia. A AWS for Media & Entertainment alinha os mais amplos e profundos conjuntos de recursos de nuvem específicos do setor, incluindo mídia criada com uma finalidade e serviços criativos, hardware, soluções, ferramentas e parceiros. A AWS for Media & Entertainment também estabelece recursos dedicados entre cada área de solução do setor para ajudar clientes a acelerar o prazo de maturação, alinhando recursos internos da AWS, AWS Professional Services e mais de 400 parceiros fornecedores de softwares independentes (Independent Software Vendor, ISVs) específicos do setor e mais de 100 integradores de sistema (System Integrators, SIs).

    "text": "西雅圖--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(美國商業資訊)--亞馬遜(Amazon, NASDAQ: AMZN)旗下公司Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS)今日宣布全面推出Amazon Nimble Studio，這項新服務能讓客戶在數小時內建立內容製作工作室，不必再等待數周。歸功於自身的靈活性，Amazon Nimble Studio擁有近乎無限的擴展能力，可根據需求進行轉譯。客戶可以透過Amazon Nimble Studio迅速展開工作，與世界各地的藝術家合作，並以更快、更經濟的方式製作內容。藝術家們將有機會在AWS的全球基礎架構中使用加速的虛擬工作站、高速儲存和可擴展的轉譯技術，從而提高創作內容的速度。客戶使用Amazon Nimble Studio無需預先付費或作出承諾，只需要支付所使用的AWS基礎服務費。造訪https://aws.amazon.com/nimble-studio/，立即開始使用。 為了獲得高品質的視覺效果、動畫和創意內容，工作室歷來依賴本機高效能工作站，透過低延遲的內部網路連接到共用檔儲存系統。消費者愈發渴求優質內容和體驗，這也導致視覺效果和動畫的計算密集型轉譯需求日益上升。不斷增長的需求迫使內容製作工作室過度佈建其計算、網路和儲存基礎架構的峰值容量。事實證明，這種方式不僅耗資巨大，而且難以管理和擴展。例如，如今一部典型的動畫長片會產生多達730 TB的資料和5億份檔案，這需要超過1.5億個核心計算小時和數百名藝術家和工程師的協作才能完成。消費者對更多內容的需求還需要工作室廣招世界各地的人才，而這些人才在辦公時同樣需要高功率的工作站、專業軟體和高速儲存與網路。所有這些限制條件都可能會導致製作延誤、費用增加，甚至讓內容製作工作室錯失良機。 而透過Amazon Nimble Studio，客戶可以在短短數小時內建立一個新的內容製作工作室。創意人才可以立即使用由亞馬遜Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) G4dn執行個體支援的高效能工作站，此類執行個體還擁有NVIDIA圖形處理器(GPU)、Amazon FSx的共用檔儲存功能，以及AWS全球網路下的超低延遲串流媒體。透過Amazon Nimble Studio，內容製作工作室能夠根據需求從少量資源開始，在轉譯需求達到頂峰時擴展這些資源，並在專案完成後傳回這些資源。內容製作工作室允許世界各地的遠端團隊入駐，僅在這些團隊需要時向其提供適量的高效能基礎架構，而無需採購、設定和管理本機工作站、檔案系統和低延遲網路。Amazon Nimble Studio同時支援Windows和Linux作業系統，方便藝術家使用自己常用的協力廠商創意應用程式。此外，工作室還可以使用客製化的軟體應用程式，並透過Amazon Machine Image (AMI)將其添加到Amazon Nimble Studio中，確保從企業內部到雲端基礎架構的順暢移轉。Amazon Nimble Studio是適用於媒體和娛樂業客戶的全新AWS解決方案，加入了AWS Thinkbox Deadline轉譯管理應用程式，作為其支援內容製作的一項核心功能。Discovery、迪士尼(Disney)、EuroSport、Formula 1、福斯(FOX)、HBO Max、Peacock和Weta Digital等媒體和娛樂業的領導者使用特定的AWS解決方案，幫助內容創作者、版權所有者、製片人和發行商在五大關鍵產業業務領域加速重塑過程，這些領域包括：內容製作、直接面對消費者與OTT串流媒體、廣播、傳媒供應鏈與檔案，以及資料科學與分析。 AWS內容製作技術主管Kyle Roche表示：「透過使用雲端式的製作流程，Amazon Nimble Studio將改變客戶製作內容的方式。工作室在現階段很難跟上不斷增長的創意內容需求的步伐，這種需求使得製作內容所需的計算能力呈指數級成長，不僅加快工作站的淘汰速度，而且造成企業內部儲存和轉譯能力的緊張。我們欣然宣布推出Amazon Nimble Studio，這是為創意社群打造的全新的變革性雲端服務，旨在更快速、更容易、更經濟地製作出消費者想看的內容。」 Amazon Nimble Studio即日起在六個AWS區域(AWS Region)和AWS本地區域(AWS Local Zone)上線，包括美國東部（維吉尼亞州北部）地區、美國西部（奧勒岡州）地區、加拿大（中部）地區、歐洲（倫敦）地區、亞太（雪梨）地區和美國本地區域（洛杉磯），不久後還將支援更多區域。 Anjekumi將遊戲玩家彙聚在一起，使其能夠在世界任何地方使用下一代設備玩遊戲。Anjekumi執行長Kurt Rauer表示：「Amazon Nimble Studio解決了我們製作流程中的一些關鍵問題，讓我們能夠專注於創意成果而非技術進程。我們的業務遍及全球，現在有了Amazon Nimble Studio，我們能讓全球創意人員參與進來，且不會出現相關摩擦。」 加州州立大學是加州的一個公立大學系統，設有23個校區。舊金山州立大學執行主任Dina Ibrahim表示：「作為全美第一大公立高等教育系統，加州州立大學系統為自己在媒體和娛樂教育方面擁有創新思維、賦予少數族裔占多數的多元化學生群體權力而感到自豪。我們希望在不久的將來把更多的教育經驗轉移到雲端，因此，AWS是我們完美的合作夥伴，代表了我們創意專案的發展方向，像Amazon Nimble Studio這樣的解決方案為我們的學生提供了更方便、親自接觸內容創作技術新工具的機會，能夠幫助他們在職業生涯中更好地取得成功。」 Evil Eye Pictures是一家曾榮獲奧斯卡和艾美獎的動畫、視覺效果和設計工作室，總部位於加州舊金山。Evil Eye Pictures共同創辦人兼執行創意總監Dan Rosen表示：「我們喜歡超越傳統，也願意接受支援創新敘事的新興技術。將Amazon Nimble Studio加入我們的『寶庫』中更便於我們根據專案進行擴展和收縮，並與世界各地的優秀人才合作。」 Shomen Productions是一家虛擬動畫和視覺特效(VFX)工作室，利用全球人才庫創作品牌內容。Shomen Productions創辦人兼視覺特效與動畫總監James Bennett表示：「我們認為，內容創作的未來屬於分散式團隊和營運敏捷的工作室。與現成人才庫之間的地理距離不再是獲取創造力的障礙。像Amazon Nimble Studio這樣的製作解決方案可以讓你的團隊隨意擴展製作資源，並實現高效率的遠距離協作。與身處世界各地的創意人員展開遠端協作，就像他們坐在你身邊一樣容易，這是一種極其強大的功能。我們相信，Amazon Nimble Studio對創意製作的影響力會像iTunes對音樂產業的影響力一樣巨大。」 Sinking Ship Entertainment位於多倫多，是一家曾榮獲艾美獎的製作和新媒體公司。Sinking Ship Entertainment數位化轉型總監Shervin Shahidi表示：「我們一直密切關注Amazon Nimble Studio的發展，並期待著將其加入我們的工作流程中。它能為我們的能力增添活力和靈活性，讓我們與全球的藝術家合作，進而拓展人才庫。」 Spire Animation Studios是一家新成立的專題動畫工作室。Spire Animation Studios共同創辦人兼創意長Brad Lewis表示：「成立Spire Animation的初衷是為了讓世界一流的創意和技術人才為全球觀眾製作多樣化的高端動畫娛樂作品。利用諸如Amazon Nimble Studio和即時遊戲引擎等下一代技術，即使我們的藝術家身處不同的場所，也能重塑內容製作流程。」 AWS今天還宣布了AWS for Media & Entertainment計畫，旨在讓業界客戶更容易發現、實作和部署特定的AWS功能和合作夥伴解決方案，以滿足高優先順序的工作負載要求，從而使他們能夠更快地創作富有吸引力的內容，提供全新的客戶體驗，擴大直接面對消費者的產品組合，並提高傳媒供應鏈效率。AWS for Media & Entertainment將廣泛和深入的行業特定雲端功能整合在一起，這些功能包括特定的媒體和創意服務、硬體、解決方案、工具和合作夥伴。AWS for Media & Entertainment還能為各個行業解決方案領域建立專門的資源，以幫助客戶加速實現價值，並將AWS內部資源、AWS專業服務、400多家行業特定的獨立軟體廠商(ISV)合作夥伴及超過100家系統整合商(SI)連結起來。如需瞭解更多資訊，請造訪：https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/announcing-aws-for-media-and-entertainment/ 關於亞馬遜網路服務 15年來，亞馬遜網路服務(AWS)一直是世界上被全面和廣泛採用的雲端平臺。AWS始終堅持擴展其服務以支援幾乎所有的雲端工作負載，目前在25個地理區域內的80個可用區(Availability Zone, AZ)中擁有200多項功能齊全的服務，包括計算、儲存、資料庫、網路、分析、機器學習和人工智慧(AI)、物聯網(IoT)、行動、安全、混合、虛擬與擴增實境、媒體與應用程式開發、部署和管理，並宣布計畫在澳洲、印度、印尼、西班牙和瑞士增加15個可用區和五個AWS區域。數以百萬計的客戶，包括成長極快的新創企業、頂級規模的企業和領先的政府機構，信賴AWS為他們的基礎架構提供基礎架構支援，幫助他們提高敏捷性、降低成本。如需瞭解關於AWS的更多資訊，請造訪aws.amazon.com。 關於亞馬遜 亞馬遜遵循四項原則：客戶至尚、熱衷創新、追求卓越營運和長遠思考。亞馬遜首創推出的產品和服務包括：用戶評論、一鍵購物、個人化推薦、Prime會員、亞馬遜物流、AWS（亞馬遜網路服務）、Kindle自出版(Kindle Direct Publishing)、Kindle、Fire平板電腦、Fire TV、Amazon Echo和Alexa等。如需瞭解更多資訊，請造訪www.amazon.com/about並關注@AmazonNews。 免責聲明：本公告之原文版本乃官方授權版本。譯文僅供方便瞭解之用，煩請參照原文，原文版本乃唯一具法律效力之版本。",

(AWS)今日宣布全面推出Amazon Nimble Studio，这项新服务能让客户在数小时内建立内容制作工作室，不必再等待数周。得益于自身的灵活性，Amazon Nimble Studio拥有近乎无限的扩展能力，可根据需求进行渲染。客户可以借助Amazon Nimble Studio迅速开展工作，与世界各地的艺术家合作，并以更快、更经济的方式制作内容。艺术家们将有机会在AWS的全球基础设施中使用加速的虚拟工作站、高速存储和可扩展的渲染技术，从而提高创作内容的速度。客户使用Amazon Nimble Studio无需预付费或作出承诺，只需要支付所使用的AWS基础服务费。访问https://aws.amazon.com/nimble-studio/，立即开始使用。 为了获得高质量的视觉效果、动画和创意内容，工作室历来依赖本地高性能工作站，通过低延迟的内部网络连接到共享文件存储系统。消费者愈发渴求优质内容和体验，这也导致视觉效果和动画的计算密集型渲染需求日益上升。不断增长的需求迫使内容制作工作室过度扩大其计算、网络和存储基础设施的峰值容量。事实证明，这种方式不仅耗资巨大，而且难以管理和扩展。例如，如今一部典型的动画长片会产生多达730太字节的数据和5亿份文件，这需要超过1.5亿个核心计算小时和数百名艺术家和工程师的协作才能完成。消费者对更多内容的需求还需要工作室广招世界各地的人才，而这些人才在办公时同样需要高功率的工作站、专业软件和高速存储与网络。所有这些限制条件都可能会导致制作延误、费用增加，甚至让内容制作工作室错失良机。 而借助Amazon Nimble Studio，客户可以在短短数小时内建立一个新的内容制作工作室。创意人才可以立即使用由亚马逊弹性计算云(EC2) G4dn实例支持的高性能工作站，此类实例还拥有英伟达(NVIDIA)图形处理器(GPU)、Amazon FSx的共享文件存储功能，以及AWS全球网络下的超低延迟流媒体。通过Amazon Nimble Studio，内容制作工作室能够根据需求从少量资源开始，在渲染需求达到顶峰时扩展这些资源，并在项目完成后返回这些资源。内容制作工作室允许世界各地的远程团队入驻，仅在这些团队需要时向其提供适量的高性能基础设施，而无需采购、设置和管理本地工作站、文件系统和低延迟网络。Amazon Nimble Studio同时支持Windows和Linux操作系统，方便艺术家使用自己常用的第三方创意应用程序。此外，工作室还可以使用定制的软件应用程序，并通过Amazon Machine Image (AMI)将其添加到Amazon Nimble Studio中，确保从企业内部到云基础设施的无缝迁移。Amazon Nimble Studio是面向媒体和娱乐业客户的全新AWS解决方案，加入了AWS Thinkbox Deadline渲染管理应用，作为其支持内容制作的一项核心功能。Discovery、迪士尼(Disney)、EuroSport、Formula 1、福克斯(FOX)、HBO Max、Peacock和Weta Digital等媒体和娱乐业的领导者使用特定的AWS解决方案，帮助内容创作者、版权所有者、制片人和发行商在五大关键行业业务领域加速重塑进程，这些领域包括：内容制作、直接面向消费者与OTT流媒体、广播、传媒供应链与档案，以及数据科学与分析。 AWS内容制作技术主管Kyle Roche表示：“通过使用基于云的制作流程，Amazon Nimble Studio将改变客户制作内容的方式。工作室在现阶段很难跟上不断增长的创意内容需求的步伐，这种需求使得制作内容所需的计算能力呈指数级增长，不仅加快工作站的淘汰速度，而且造成企业内部存储和渲染能力的紧张。我们欣然宣布推出Amazon Nimble Studio，这是为创意社区打造的全新的变革性云端服务，旨在更快速、更容易、更经济地制作出消费者想看的内容。” Amazon Nimble Studio即日起在六个AWS区域(AWS Region)和AWS本地区域(AWS Local Zone)上线，包括美国东部（弗吉尼亚州北部）地区、美国西部（俄勒冈州）地区、加拿大（中部）地区、欧洲（伦敦）地区、亚太（悉尼）地区和美国本地区域（洛杉矶），不久后还将支持更多区域。 Anjekumi将游戏玩家汇聚在一起，使其能够在世界任何地方使用下一代设备玩游戏。Anjekumi首席执行官Kurt Rauer表示：“Amazon Nimble Studio解决了我们制作流程中的一些关键问题，让我们能够专注于创意成果而非技术进程。我们的业务遍及全球，现在有了Amazon Nimble Studio，我们能让全球创意人员参与进来，且不会出现相关摩擦。” 加利福尼亚州立大学是加州的一个公立大学系统，设有23个校区。旧金山州立大学执行主任Dina Ibrahim表示：“作为全美第一大公立高等教育系统，加利福尼亚州立大学系统为自己在媒体和娱乐教育方面拥有创新思维、赋予少数族裔占多数的多元化学生群体权力而感到自豪。我们希望在不久的将来把更多的教育经验转移到云端，因此，AWS是我们完美的合作伙伴，代表了我们创意项目的发展方向，像Amazon Nimble Studio这样的解决方案为我们的学生提供了更方便、亲自接触内容创作技术新工具的机会，能够帮助他们在职业生涯中更好地取得成功。” Evil Eye Pictures是一家曾荣获奥斯卡和艾美奖的动画、视觉效果和设计工作室，总部位于加州旧金山。Evil Eye Pictures联合创始人兼执行创意总监Dan Rosen表示：“我们喜欢超越传统，也愿意接受支持创新叙事的新兴技术。将Amazon Nimble Studio添加到我们的‘宝库’中更便于我们根据项目进行扩展和收缩，并与世界各地的优秀人才合作。” Shomen Productions是一家虚拟动画和视觉特效(VFX)工作室，利用全球人才库创作品牌内容。Shomen Productions创始人兼视觉特效与动画总监James Bennett表示：“我们认为，内容创作的未来属于分布式团队和运营敏捷的工作室。与现成人才库之间的地理距离不再是获取创造力的障碍。像Amazon Nimble Studio这样的制作解决方案可以让你的团队随意扩展制作资源，并实现高效的远距离协作。与身处世界各地的创意人员开展远程协作，就像他们坐在你身边一样容易，这是一种极其强大的功能。我们相信，Amazon Nimble Studio对创意制作的影响力会像iTunes对音乐产业的影响力一样巨大。” Sinking Ship Entertainment位于多伦多，是一家曾荣获艾美奖的制作和新媒体公司。Sinking Ship Entertainment数字化转型总监Shervin Shahidi表示：“我们一直密切关注Amazon Nimble Studio的发展，并期待着将其添加到我们的工作流程中。它能为我们的能力增添活力和灵活性，让我们与全球的艺术家合作，进而拓展人才库。” Spire Animation Studios是一家新成立的专题动画工作室。Spire Animation Studios联合创始人兼首席创意官Brad Lewis表示：“成立Spire Animation的初衷是为了让世界一流的创意和技术人才为全球观众制作多样化的高端动画娱乐作品。利用诸如Amazon Nimble Studio和实时游戏引擎等下一代技术，即使我们的艺术家身处不同的场所，也能重塑内容制作流程。” AWS今天还宣布了AWS for Media & Entertainment计划，旨在让业内客户更容易发现、实施和部署特定的AWS功能和合作伙伴解决方案，以满足高优先级的工作负载要求，从而使他们能够更快地创作富有吸引力的内容，提供全新的客户体验，扩大直接面向消费者的产品组合，并提高传媒供应链效率。AWS for Media & Entertainment将广泛和深入的行业特定云功能整合在一起，这些功能包括特定的媒体和创意服务、硬件、解决方案、工具和合作伙伴。AWS for Media & Entertainment还能为各个行业解决方案领域创建专门的资源，以帮助客户加速实现价值，并将AWS内部资源、AWS专业服务、400多家行业特定的独立软件供应商(ISV)合作伙伴及超过100家系统集成商(SI)联系起来。如需了解更多信息，请访问：https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/announcing-aws-for-media-and-entertainment/ 关于亚马逊网络服务 15年来，亚马逊网络服务(AWS)一直是世界上被全面和广泛采用的云平台。AWS始终坚持扩展其服务以支持几乎所有的云工作负载，目前在25个地理区域内的80个可用区(Availability Zone, AZ)中拥有200多项功能齐全的服务，包括计算、存储、数据库、网络、分析、机器学习和人工智能(AI)、物联网(IoT)、移动、安全、混合、 虚拟与增强现实、媒体与应用程序开发、部署和管理，并宣布计划在澳大利亚、印度、印度尼西亚、西班牙和瑞士增加15个可用区和五个AWS区域。数以百万计的客户，包括增长极快的初创企业、顶级规模的企业和领先的政府机构，信赖AWS为他们的基础设施助力，帮助他们提高敏捷性、降低成本。如需了解关于AWS的更多信息，请访问aws.amazon.com。 关于亚马逊 亚马逊遵循四项原则：客户至尚、热衷创新、追求卓越运营和长远思考。亚马逊首创推出的产品和服务包括：用户评论、一键购物、个人化推荐、Prime会员、亚马逊物流、AWS（亚马逊网络服务）、Kindle直接出版(Kindle Direct Publishing)、Kindle、Fire平板电脑、Fire TV、Amazon Echo和Alexa等。如需了解更多信息，请访问www.amazon.com/about并关注@AmazonNews。 免责声明：本公告之原文版本乃官方授权版本。译文仅供方便了解之用，烦请参照原文，原文版本乃唯一具法律效力之版本。",

    "text": "シアトル--(BUSINESS WIRE)--（ビジネスワイヤ）-- アマゾン・ドット・コム（NASDAQ：AMZN）傘下のアマゾン ウェブ サービス（AWS）は本日、Amazon Nimble Studio（アマゾン・ニンブル・スタジオ）の一般提供について発表しました。この新サービスは、顧客がコンテンツ制作スタジオを数週間ではなく数時間で開設できるようにするもので、無制限に近い規模と、オンデマンドのレンダリングへのアクセスを実現する融通性を備えています。顧客はAmazon Nimble Studioを利用して、世界中のどこからでもアーティストを速やかに起用してアーティストと協業し、コンテンツをより迅速かつコスト効率良く制作できます。アーティストはAWSの世界的なインフラ上で高速化された仮想ワークステーション、高速ストレージ、拡張可能なレンダリング機能を利用できるので、コンテンツを以前にも増して迅速に制作できます。Amazon Nimble Studioを使用するために初期費用や手数料は不要で、顧客は基盤となるAWSサービスの使用料だけを支払います。利用を開始するには、https://aws.amazon.com/nimble-studio/にアクセスしてください。 スタジオはこれまで、高品質の視覚効果、アニメーション、クリエイティブコンテンツを実現するために、低遅延のオンプレミスネットワークを介して共有ファイルストレージシステムに接続したローカルの高性能ワークステーションに依存していました。しかし、優れたコンテンツや顧客体験を求める消費者の欲求が高まっているため、視覚効果やアニメーションに計算能力を集中的に必要とするレンダリングの需要が増大しています。このように増え続ける需要が原因で、コンテンツ制作スタジオはピーク時容量のために計算、ネットワーク、ストレージのインフラを過剰にプロビジョニングしていますが、それはコストが高くつき、管理と規模拡張が困難です。例えば、現在の典型的な長編アニメ映画の場合、730テラバイトのデータと最大5億個のファイルが生成され、1億5000万時間以上のコアコンピュート時間と、数百人のアーティストとエンジニアの調整が必要です。消費者がより多くのコンテンツを求めるようになったことで、スタジオは世界中から人材を集めなければならず、それぞれが高性能なワークステーション、専用ソフトウエア、高速なストレージとネットワークを必要とします。こうした制約はすべて、コンテンツ制作スタジオにとって、制作の遅延、費用の増加、機会の損失につながります。 Amazon Nimble Studioを使用すれば、顧客はわずか数時間で、新しいコンテンツ制作スタジオを作ることができます。クリエイティブらはその後、すぐにNVIDIAグラフィカル処理ユニット（GPU）を搭載し、Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud（EC2、エラスティックコンピュートクラウド）G4dnインスタンスを活用した高性能ワークステーション、Amazon FSxの共有ファイスストレージ、AWSグローバルネットワークを介した超低遅延ストリーミングを利用できます。Amazon Nimble Studioは、コンテンツ制作スタジオが必要なだけのリソースで開始し、レンダリング需要がピークに達したときにそれらリソースの規模を拡張し、プロジェクト完了時にふたたび縮小できるようにします。コンテンツ制作スタジオは、世界各地のリモートチームを起用し、適切な規模の高性能インフラのみを必要な期間だけ同チームに利用してもらえるので、ローカルでのワークステーション、ファイルシステム、低遅延ネットワーク、低遅延ネットワークの調達、設定、管理が不要です。Amazon Nimble Studioはウィンドウズとリナックスの両オペレーティングシステムに対応しているため、アーティストは自分が選好する他社製クリエイティブアプリケーションを使用できます。さらに、スタジオはカスタムソフトウエアアプリケーションを使用可能で、これらをAmazon Machine Images（AMI、アマゾンマシンイメージ）を介してAmazon Nimble Studioに取り込めるので、オンプレミスからクラウドインフラへのシームレスな移行を確実に行えます。Amazon Nimble Studioは、メディア／エンターテイメント業界の顧客向けに提供する最新のAWSソリューションであり、コンテンツ制作を支援するコア機能として、レンダー管理アプリケーションのAWS Thinkbox Deadlineに加わります。メディアおよびエンターテイメントの分野におけるリーダーであるディスカバリー、ディズニー、ユーロスポーツ、フォーミュラワン、フォックス、HBO Max、ピーコック、Weta Digitalなどが使用する専用のAWSソリューションは、コンテンツ制作者、権利所有者、プロデューサー、ディストリビューターが業界の5つの主要分野、すなわちコンテンツ制作、直接配信（D2C）ストリーミング／オーバーザトップ（OTT）ストリーミング、放送、メディアサプライチェーンおよびアーカイブ、データサイエンスおよびアナリティクスの改革を加速できるよう支えるものです。 AWSのコンテンツ制作技術担当責任者のカイル・ローチは、次のように述べています。「Amazon Nimble Studioは、お客さまがクラウドベースの制作パイプラインを使い、コンテンツ制作の方法を変革しようとするものです。これまでスタジオは、増え続けるクリエイティブコンテンツに対する需要に後れを取らないようにするのに苦労してきました。そのため、コンテンツ制作に必要な計算能力が指数関数的に増加することで、ワークステーションの陳腐化を加速させ、オンプレミスのストレージとレンダリング能力に負担がかかっていました。私たちは、クリエイティブコミュニティーのためにクラウド向けに構築した変革的な新サービスであるAmazon Nimble Studioを発表することで、消費者が見たいと思うコンテンツを以前にも増して迅速かつ容易に低コストで制作できるようになることに感激しています。」 Amazon Nimble Studioは本日より、米国東部（バージニア北部）、米国西部（オレゴン）リージョン、カナダ（中部）リージョン、欧州（ロンドン）リージョン、アジアパシフィック（シドニー）リージョン、米国ローカルゾーン（ロサンゼルス）という、6つのAWSリージョンとAWSローカルゾーンで提供します。近日中に対応リージョンを追加する予定です。

Studioがクリエイティブ制作に影響を与えると確信しています」と述べています。 シンキング・シップ・エンターテインメントはエミー賞を受賞した制作＆ニューメディア企業で、トロントに拠点を置いています。シンキング・シップ・エンターテインメントのデジタル変革担当ディレクターのShervin Shahidi氏は、「私たちはAmazon Nimble Studioの開発を熱心に見守ってきましたが、当社のワークフローに加えるのが楽しみです。当社の能力にダイナミックな融通性をもたらすとともに、世界各地のアーティストを対象に当社の人材プールを拡張できるようになります」と述べています。 Spire Animation Studiosは長編アニメーションを手掛ける新しいスタジオです。Spire Animation Studiosの共同設立者で最高クリエイティブ責任者のブラッド・ルイス氏は、「Spire Animationは、世界クラスのクリエイティブらと技術者らの力を高め、これらが世界の視聴者のために、多様なハイエンドのアニメエンターテイメントを開発できるように設立したものです。Amazon Nimble Studioやリアルタイムゲームエンジンのような次世代技術を活用することで、当社のアーティストが同じ場所にいなくても作業できるように、コンテンツ制作プロセスのあり方を変革しています」と述べています。 AWSは本日、AWS for Media &

    "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/aws-announces-general-availability-of-amazon-finspace-20210503.jpg",
    "site": "businesswire.com",
    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ:AMZN), announced Amazon FinSpace, a purpose-built analytics service that reduces the time it takes FSI organizations to find, prepare, and analyze financial data from months to minutes. Amazon FinSpace aggregates, catalogs, and tags data across an organization’s data silos, making the data easily searchable by the entire organization. The service includes a purpose-built managed Apache Spark analytics engine that contains over 100 data transformations commonly used in the capital markets industry to prepare data for analytics at petabyte scale. To make it easier for FSI organizations to meet their compliance requirements, Amazon FinSpace ensures that data access controls are enforced and usage is tracked at all times. Amazon FinSpace provides an easy-to-use web application that gives analysts at hedge funds, asset management firms, insurance companies, investment banks, and other FSI organizations access to the information they need and the ability to run powerful analytics on demand across all of their data. There are no upfront costs or commitments to use Amazon FinSpace, and customers only pay for the data stored, the users enabled, and the compute used to prepare and analyze data. To learn more about Amazon FinSpace, go to https://aws.amazon.com/finspace. Today’s FSI organizations are generating and collecting hundreds of petabytes of data every day from internal data sources like portfolio management systems, order management systems, and execution management systems—as well as third-party data feeds like high-volume historical equities pricing data, employment figures, and earnings reports. These organizations want to use the petabytes of data they possess to gain insights that help identify new sources of revenue, attract and retain customers, and reduce cost or risk. However, before data can be analyzed, FSI companies typically spend months finding the right data and getting it prepared for analysis. Discovering and preparing data is time-consuming because FSI organizations have data in silos distributed across departments that specialize in particular assets or geographies and generate specialized data (e.g. equities, options, bonds, European mutual funds, Asian currencies, etc.). Furthermore, data access is tightly controlled by regulation and policy, meaning analysts must justify to compliance officers how their access will conform to data use policies before they can access the data. Once they are granted access to the data, analysts must prepare it for analysis by iteratively performing data transformations to discover new insights within the data. For example, capital markets traders often use technical indicators like Bollinger Bands, Exponential Moving Averages, and Average True Range to identify undiscovered trends and patterns. Many of the data analytics tools available to analysts today were built to run on a single computer and were not designed to take advantage of the cloud’s scale and the ability to compute heavy analysis on-demand. As a result, analysts either have to use small representative datasets that limit predictive ability, or the data has to be manually broken up into many subsets, transformed piecemeal, and manually recombined. Neither approach is ideal or effective. Amazon FinSpace solves the challenges FSI organizations face by vastly simplifying the steps needed to find, prepare, and analyze data, reducing the time involved from months to minutes. Customers begin by ingesting data into Amazon FinSpace from internal data silos or third-party data feeds via the service’s Application Programming Interface (API) or a drag-and-drop interface in the web application. To find data, customers simply browse a visual catalog and search for familiar business terms like options trades for the last three years or U.S. automotive bonds from within the web application. Amazon FinSpace includes built-in classification schemas for common FSI data sources (e.g. trades, corporate actions, and economic data) that customers can customize to their needs, so the data can be organized in a way that is easy to find and share. Amazon FinSpace records the daily updates and corrections received for datasets and processes them to create point-in-time views to validate modeling assumptions and to show what data was used to inform past decisions for historical analysis. Customers can use built-in Jupyter Notebooks to access data stored in Amazon FinSpace and can then choose from over 100 built-in functions to prepare their data for analysis (e.g. Bollinger Bands, Exponential Moving Averages, and Average True Range)—or they can build and use their own functions to prepare data for analysis. Amazon FinSpace provides managed Spark clusters that can be scaled up or down on demand so organizations can benefit from the elasticity, scale, and cost savings provided by cloud computing. Customers define their data access policies within Amazon FinSpace, and the policies are automatically enforced across data search, visualization, and analysis. Amazon FinSpace records data access, tracks data usage, and generates compliance and activity reports indicating who accessed data at what point in time. “FSI organizations generate and purchase massive amounts of data, but using this data is very difficult because of the time and effort it takes to collect and prepare data for analysis,” said Saman Michael Far, VP of Financial Services Technology, AWS. “Amazon FinSpace is a game changer for FSI organizations. Amazon FinSpace radically reduces the time it takes for FSI customers to do analytics across petabytes of data, making it significantly easier for them to identify new sources of revenue, attract customers, and reduce cost and risk.” Amazon FinSpace is generally available today in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), and Europe (Ireland), with availability in additional regions coming soon. Legal & General Reinsurance (L&G Re) is the global reinsurance hub of the Legal & General Group with a specialty in the reinsurance of annuities, particularly pension risk transfer business. “At Legal & General, our mission is to guarantee the long-term financial security of our clients’ customers around the world,” said Thomas Olunloyo, CEO of L&G Re. “Our reinsurance specialists work with a broad range of data to measure asset performance, mortality, and longevity risk. Today, this data is distributed and stored across many teams, systems, and structures. We are excited about the release of Amazon FinSpace and its ability to help us unlock the full power of our data to enable our team and efficiently give new insights to our clients. Amazon FinSpace will transform how we use data by giving our analysts the ability to instantly and easily access all the company’s data to carry out analysis faster and immediately share the results across the business, while ensuring our data governance and access control policies are met in full.” Deloitte is helping transform organizations around the globe. The organization continuously evolves how it works and how it looks at marketplace challenges so it can continue to deliver measurable, sustainable results for its clients and communities. “In working with financial services industry clients, we have found that cloud-based analytics and AI/ML allow us to answer questions that we couldn’t answer several years ago and drive value in new ways. Data, analytics, and AI/ML will continue to be key and become even more important to financial institutions’ decision making and business outcomes over the next decade,” said Jojy Mathew, Principal, Deloitte Consulting LLP, and Deloitte’s Financial Services Data and Analytics Leader globally. “When companies are building algorithmic, stochastic and predictive models, large data sets are key. Amazon FinSpace will allow users to process petabytes of data at the scale demanded.

    "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/aws-announces-general-availability-of-amazon-devops-guru-20210504.jpg",
    "site": "businesswire.com",
    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced the general availability of Amazon DevOps Guru, a fully managed operations service that uses machine learning to make it easier for developers to improve application availability by automatically detecting operational issues and recommending specific actions for remediation. Informed by years of Amazon.com and AWS operational excellence, Amazon DevOps Guru applies machine learning to automatically analyze data like application metrics, logs, events, and traces for behaviors that deviate from normal operating patterns. When Amazon DevOps Guru identifies anomalous application behavior that could cause potential outages or service disruptions, it alerts developers with issue details to help them quickly understand the potential impact and likely causes of the issue, with specific recommendations for remediation. Developers can use remediation suggestions from Amazon DevOps Guru to reduce time to resolution when issues arise and improve application availability—all with no manual setup or machine learning expertise required. There are no upfront costs or commitments with Amazon DevOps Guru, and customers pay only for the data Amazon DevOps Guru analyzes. To get started with Amazon DevOps Guru, visit: aws.amazon.com/devops-guru As more organizations move to cloud-based application deployment and microservice architectures to scale their businesses, applications have become increasingly distributed, and developers need more automated practices to maintain application availability and reduce the time and effort spent detecting, debugging, and resolving operational issues. Application downtime events caused by faulty code or config changes, unbalanced container clusters, or resource exhaustion (e.g. CPU, memory, disk, etc.) inevitably lead to bad customer experiences and lost revenue. Companies invest a considerable amount of developer resources, time, and money to deploy multiple monitoring tools, often managed separately, and then have to develop and maintain custom alerts for common issues like spikes in load balancer errors or drops in application request rates. Setting thresholds to identify and alert when application resources are behaving abnormally is difficult to get right, involves manual setup, and requires thresholds that must be continually updated as application usage changes (e.g. an unusually large number of requests during a sales promotion). If a threshold is set too high, developers don’t see alarms until operational performance is severely impacted. When a threshold is set too low, developers get too many false positives, which they are prone to ignore. Even when developers get alerted to a potential operational issue, the process of identifying the root cause can still prove difficult. Using existing tools, developers often have difficulty triangulating the root cause of an operational issue from graphs and alarms, and even when they are able to find the root cause, they are often left without the right information to fix it. Each troubleshooting attempt is a cold start where teams must spend hours or days identifying problems, and this leads to time consuming, tedious work that slows down the time to resolve an operational failure and can prolong application disruptions. Amazon DevOps Guru’s machine learning models leverage over 20 years of operational expertise in building, scaling, and maintaining highly available applications for Amazon.com. This gives Amazon DevOps Guru the ability to automatically detect operational issues (e.g. missing or misconfigured alarms, early warning of resource exhaustion, config changes that could lead to outages, etc.), provide context on resources involved and related events, and recommend remediation actions. With just a few clicks in the Amazon DevOps Guru console, historical application and infrastructure metrics like latency, error rates, and request rates for resources are automatically ingested from a user’s AWS applications and analyzed to establish normal operating bounds. Amazon DevOps Guru then uses a pre-trained machine learning model to identify deviations from this established baseline (e.g. under-provisioned compute capacity, database I/O utilization, memory leaks, etc.). When Amazon DevOps Guru analyzes system and application data to automatically detect anomalies, it also groups this data into operational insights that include anomalous metrics, visualizations of application behavior over time, and recommendations on actions for remediation—all easily viewable in the Amazon DevOps Guru console. Amazon DevOps Guru also correlates and groups related application and infrastructure metrics (e.g. web application latency spikes, running out of disk space, bad code deployments, etc.) to reduce redundant alarms and help focus users on high-severity issues. Customers can see configuration change histories and deployment events, along with system and user activity, to generate a prioritized list of likely causes for an operational issue via a dashboard in the Amazon DevOps Guru console. To help customers resolve issues quickly, Amazon DevOps Guru provides intelligent recommendations with remediation steps and integrates with AWS Systems Manager for runbook and collaboration tooling, giving customers the ability to more effectively maintain applications and manage infrastructure for their deployments. For example, when an analytics application using Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) begins to exhibit degraded latencies, Amazon DevOps Guru will detect the change by automatically analyzing the relevant metrics across the application stack, identify the underlying root cause (e.g. increased number of concurrent compute instances writing to RDS), and provide a recommendation to resolve the issue (e.g. increase the provisioned RDS capacity and IOPS storage to handle the higher load). “Customers continue to ask AWS for more services that enable them to take advantage of our decades of operational excellence in improving application availability running Amazon.com,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, Vice President, Amazon Machine Learning, AWS. “With Amazon DevOps Guru, we have taken that expertise and built specialized machine learning models to detect, troubleshoot, and prevent operational issues long before they impact customers and without dealing with cold starts each time an issue arises. Amazon DevOps Guru immediately provides customers the benefits of operational best practices we have learned running Amazon.com, and we designed Amazon DevOps Guru to be so simple that turning it on would be an easy choice for every AWS customer.” With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, customers can enable Amazon DevOps Guru to begin analyzing account and application activity within minutes to provide operational insights. Amazon DevOps Guru gives customers a single-console experience to visualize their operational data by summarizing relevant data across multiple sources (e.g. AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Config, AWS CloudFormation, AWS X-Ray) and reduces the need to switch between multiple tools. Customers can also view correlated operational events and contextual data for operational insights within the Amazon DevOps Guru console and receive alerts via Amazon SNS. Additionally, Amazon DevOps Guru supports API endpoints through the AWS SDK, making it easy for Amazon Partner Network Partners and customers to integrate Amazon DevOps Guru into their existing solutions for ticketing, paging, and automatic notification of engineers for high-severity issues. PagerDuty and Atlassian are among the AWS Partners that have integrated Amazon DevOps Guru into their operations monitoring and incident management platforms, and customers who use their solutions can now benefit from operational insights provided by Amazon DevOps Guru. Amazon DevOps Guru is available today in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), and US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), and Europe (Stockholm), with availability in additional regions in the coming months. Together with Amazon CodeGuru—a developer tool powered by machine learning that provides intelligent recommendations for improving code quality and identifying an application’s most expensive lines of code—Amazon DevOps Guru provides customers the automated benefits of machine learning for their operational data so that developers can more easily improve application availability and reliability. Teams at more than 194,000 companies rely on Atlassian products to make teamwork easier, and help them organize, discuss, and complete their work. “Atlassian is excited that our customers are implementing an AIOps strategy using Amazon DevOps Guru to manage the operational performance of their cloud applications,” said Emel Dogrusoz, Head of Product at Opsgenie. “With our new Opsgenie and Jira Service Management integration, the right teams are notified the instant Amazon DevOps Guru discovers a potential issue and prioritizes it by the severity of the incident using machine learning (ML). This integration ensures that every team can quickly respond to, resolve using ML-powered recommendations, and learn from every incident.” Fidelity Investments helps over 35 million people feel more confident in their most important financial goals, manages employee benefit programs for over 22,000 businesses, and supports more than 13,500 financial institutions with innovative investment and technology solutions to grow their businesses. “At Fidelity, we’re leveraging cloud technologies to enhance our global customer experience and improve the resiliency of our applications,” said Keith Blizard, SVP of Public Cloud Services at Fidelity Investments. “AIOps tools such as Amazon DevOps Guru are helping us deliver more efficient experiences and more resilient platforms to our customers.” PagerDuty, Inc.

Through PagerDuty’s ingestion of Amazon SNS via Amazon DevOps Guru, AWS customers can take real-time action on operational issues before they become customer-impacting outages.” Thomson Reuters is one of the world’s most trusted providers of answers, helping professionals make confident decisions and run better businesses. “Customer experience and satisfaction are our top priorities. When multiple sources of alerts and monitoring events are received, it can be challenging and time-consuming to filter through the noise to identify customer-impacting incidents,” said Steve Thoennes, Director of Site Reliability Engineering and Cloud at Thomson Reuters. “With Amazon DevOps Guru, we are able to leverage its ML-powered insights to provide clear paths for action to reduce—and in many cases eliminate—the impact issues have on our customers. The Amazon DevOps Guru integration with PagerDuty also provides a direct path to quickly and efficiently deliver recommendations to the right people at the right time, and we anticipate significantly reduced operational downtime as a result.” HCL Technologies is a next-generation global technology company that helps enterprises reimagine their businesses for the digital age. Its technology products and services are built on four decades of innovation, with a world-renowned management philosophy, a strong culture of invention and risk-taking, and a relentless focus on customer relationships. “We are always looking for ways to reduce the amount of time our teams spend on resolving operational issues, and we are now using Amazon DevOps Guru and leveraging its ML-powered insights to help us identify, correlate, and remediate operational issues quickly,” said Anchal Gupta, Senior Technical Lead, DevOps at HCL Technologies. “With the insights Amazon DevOps Guru provides, our teams can now quickly find issues without having to start from scratch trying to root cause problems. Our IT team has significantly reduced our mean time to recovery (MTTR), and they are saving hours upon hours of time resolving issues—all the while ensuring our customers have the best end-user experience possible.” 605 is an independent TV measurement firm that offers advertising and content measurement, full-funnel attribution, media planning, optimization, and analytical solutions on top of its multi-source viewership data set covering more than 21 million U.S. households. “We have over a dozen AWS accounts and tens of thousands of resources to monitor.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) plans to open its first robotics fulfillment center in the state of Louisiana. The new operations facility in Shreveport will create over 1,000 new, full-time jobs and provide employees with at least $15 per hour and comprehensive benefits. Amazon jobs support Louisiana communities of all sizes, from larger metro areas like Shreveport to smaller communities like Carencro. In the new 650,000 square-foot fulfillment center, Amazon employees will pick, pack, and ship smaller customer items such as books, toys, electronics and other household items. On top of Amazon’s industry-leading minimum starting wage of $15 per hour, full-time employees receive comprehensive benefits, including full medical, vision and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent company match. Amazon prioritizes the safety of all its employees and supports them with paid leave so they can take time off without having to worry about missing a paycheck. The company also offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and parental paid leave and innovative benefits such as Leave Share and Ramp Back, which give new parents flexibility to support their growing families. Amazon is committed to the long-term development of its employees. The company’s employees have access to innovative programs like Career Choice, where Amazon will pay up to 95 percent of tuition for courses related to in-demand fields, regardless of whether the skills are relevant to a career at Amazon. Since the program’s launch, more than 25,000 employees across the globe have pursued degrees in a range of fields, including game design and visual communications, nursing, IT programming and radiology. Amazon in Louisiana: From 2010-2019, Amazon has invested more than $250 million in Louisiana, including infrastructure and compensation to employees in the state. Amazon's investments in the state contributed an additional $220 million into the state’s economy over that same period. Using methodology developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Amazon estimates its investments have created an additional 750+ indirect jobs on top of the company's current 2,000+ full- and part-time direct hires. Amazon’s worldwide fulfillment network supports businesses of all sizes through its Fulfillment by Amazon offering, and many of those local businesses are based in Louisiana.

From the local jobs we bring, to the local people we employ, train, and upskill—our business is made up of people from communities like Shreveport,” said William Hicks, Regional Director of Operations at Amazon. “We’re thrilled to be able to expand our operations in Northwest Louisiana and we look forward to becoming part of the fabric of the local community.” Governor John Bel Edwards “This new Amazon project is a major advancement for the Shreveport-Bossier City metro area and for Louisiana’s economy,” said Governor Edwards. “In addition to providing strong benefits, Amazon will pay workers double the minimum wage or more in a state-of-the-art technology environment. Only a year ago, we dedicated Hunter Industrial Park as one site in a growing inventory of LED Certified Sites that now numbers 126 statewide. Through partnerships with our elected officials, economic development allies and utility partners, we are proving that great things are possible in Louisiana when we make smart plans for the future.” Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins “The City of Shreveport is committed to developing a diverse business community,” Mayor Adrian Perkins said. “We are excited to be the new home for a state-of-the-art distribution center. This will be a valuable asset to our community and will provide employment opportunities to hundreds of our residents. This project could change the life trajectory for many of our citizens who are still dealing with the financial fallout from the ongoing pandemic.” Caddo Parish Commission President Lyndon B. Johnson “Great things are happening in Caddo Parish, and we are delighted to welcome Amazon into our parish and region,” said Caddo Parish Commission President Lyndon B. Johnson. “The arrival of such a large and multidimensional distribution center to Caddo Parish will undoubtedly have a significant impact on our area’s economy. The ability to utilize over 1,000 members of our community’s diverse and talented workforce will enhance the quality of life for our residents, and is a result of the strong collaboration between our governing bodies and community partners to create a winning opportunity for Amazon and the parish.” Chairman Chap Breard of the North Louisiana Economic Partnership “We are thrilled to have Amazon become a new major employer in North Louisiana,” said Chairman Chap Breard of the North Louisiana Economic Partnership. “Their decision to locate in Shreveport confirms that North Louisiana’s competitive strategic location, strong stakeholder partnerships and project-ready industrial sites are critical for success in economic development.” About Amazon Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) today released its 2020 Brand Protection Report which provides a comprehensive view of how it ensures customers shop from authentic products in its stores. Amazon makes significant investments in dedicated teams and industry-leading machine learning technology to proactively protect customers, brands and its selling partners from counterfeiters, and to hold them accountable if they attempt to sell fakes through Amazon. In 2020, Amazon invested more than $700 million and employed more than 10,000 people to protect its stores from fraud and abuse. “Amazon was an important partner for the 1.9 million small and medium businesses that sell in our store during the pandemic. We’ve helped our selling partners keep their virtual doors open, and despite increased attempts by bad actors, continued to ensure that the vast majority of customers shop with confidence from our broad selection of authentic products,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Vice President, Customer Trust and Partner Support, Amazon. “Our team's relentless innovation has helped us stop 6 million attempts to create a selling account and more than 10 billion suspect listings as we continue to drive counterfeits to zero.” Highlights from the 2020 Brand Protection Report show Amazon’s significant innovation and worldwide progress in combatting counterfeits and protecting customers and brands, including: Amazon invested more than $700 million to protect its stores from fraud and abuse. Amazon employed more than 10,000 people to protect its store from fraud and abuse. Amazon’s verification processes prevented over 6 million attempts to create selling accounts, stopping bad actors before they published a single product for sale. Only 6% of attempted account registrations passed Amazon’s robust verifications processes and listed products for sale. Amazon seized more than 2 million products that were sent to its fulfillment centers and that it detected as counterfeit before being sent to a customer. Amazon destroyed those products to prevent them from being resold elsewhere in the supply chain. Amazon blocked more than 10 billion suspected bad listings before they were published in its stores. Amazon Transparency, a serialization service that protects individual product units, enabled the protection of more than 500 million product units. Fewer than 0.01% of all products sold on Amazon received a counterfeit complaint from customers. Those complaints were then investigated for accuracy. More than 7,000 small and medium-sized businesses were connected to trusted law firms in the U.S. and Europe through IP Accelerator. These businesses successfully submitted trademark applications and received early access to Brand Registry’s brand protection tools. Amazon established its Counterfeit Crimes Unit to build and refer cases to law enforcement, undertake independent investigations or joint investigations with brands, and pursue civil litigation against counterfeiters. Adrienne McNicholas, Co-Founder of the small business Food Huggers, said: “Brand owners can’t be in all places at all times. Having the Amazon brand protection tools available to small businesses like Food Huggers gives us the ability to protect our brands and our IP around the globe.” The Brand Protection Report outlines Amazon’s anti-counterfeiting approach, including: Robust proactive controls. Amazon leverages a combination of advanced machine learning capabilities and expert human investigators to protect its store proactively from bad actors and bad products. Amazon is constantly innovating in this space to stay ahead of bad actors and their continued attempts to circumvent its controls. Powerful tools for brands. Brands know their products best. They know their logos, patterns, and intellectual property inside and out. Amazon empowers brands to partner with us through tools like Brand Registry, Transparency, and Project Zero. These tools are powered by Amazon’s advanced technology and each brand’s expert knowledge of their products. Together, we can more effectively detect and stop counterfeiters, which allows us to better protect customers and rights owners. Holding counterfeiters accountable. Amazon continues to innovate on its robust proactive controls and powerful tools for brands, and won’t rest until there are zero counterfeits in its store. This is an escalating battle with criminals that continue to attempt to find ways to sell counterfeits, and the only way to permanently stop these counterfeiters is to hold them accountable through the court system and criminal prosecution.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN): What: Amazon today filed a federal lawsuit in the Western District of Washington against several yet-to-be-named individuals for operating an illegal advertising scheme. The bad actors in question are using Amazon’s name in text messages and on fake surveys as part of an affiliate marketing scheme. The suit allows Amazon to expand its investigation and hold the bad actors accountable. This suit is part of the company’s growing efforts to protect consumers from schemes that fraudulently use Amazon’s name. Bad actors in these schemes profit by creating fraudulent text message campaigns that drive traffic to advertisers and websites. These fake text messages are intentionally designed to trick unsuspecting consumers to click on a link by using Amazon’s name and offering recipients “rewards” or other “gifts.” Instead, victims are redirected to a website to take a survey, which also fraudulently uses Amazon’s brand and promises a reward for participation. Once participants click for their reward, they are sent on to online marketers, advertisers and websites to buy products or services that have no relation to Amazon. The defendants profit from fees paid to them by affiliate marketing networks and advertisers for the fraudulently created traffic. Amazon invests significant resources to protect customers and its brand, and has a history of identifying and shutting down similar operations. Amazon has already filed five lawsuits against fraudulent affiliate marketing schemes, won multiple injunctions in court to stop the illegal activities, and entered settlements with seven parties in which they agreed to stop their campaigns and pay in excess of $1.5 million in damages. Statement (attributable to Kathy Sheehan, VP, Business Conduct & Ethics, Amazon) “Amazon works hard to build a great, trusted experience for our customers and sellers. These bad actors are misusing our brand to deceive the public and we will hold them accountable. We also want to remind consumers to be vigilant and learn how to recognize the signs of a scam so they are protected, no matter where they shop.” Additional Background: Case: 2:21-cv-00627, United States District Court for the Western District of Washington The Better Business Bureau offers simple tips on how to recognized and avoid scams, https://www.bbb.org/article/scams/8767-bbb-tips-10-steps-to-avoid-scams In March 2021, the U.S. District Court of Utah the Federal Trade Commission’s filed order against four companies for operating a telemarketing scheme that fraudulently used Amazon Associates’ name to offer fake work-from-home opportunities. https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ftc-obtains-permanent-ban-and-2m-judgment-work-home-scammer In June 2020, Amazon shut down three email based affiliate marketing schemes in Michigan, Colorado, and California. https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-stops-multiple-fraudulent-affiliate-marketing-schemes In April 2019, Amazon stopped an Illinois-based affiliate marketer, First Impression Interactive, Inc. and its owners from advertising fake work-from-home jobs with Amazon. As a result of Amazon’s efforts, First Impression and its owners are now prohibited from using Amazon’s brand in any future marketing. https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/04/10/amazon-work-from-home-job-scam-first-impression-interactive/",

    "image": "https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/amazon-introduces-upgraded-echo-show-8-echo-show-5-and-20210512.jpg",

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(NASDAQ: AMZN)—Amazon today introduced its newest Echo Show devices—the new Echo Show 8, Echo Show 5, and the first Echo Show 5 Kids. Echo Show is the fastest-growing family of Echo devices, and the new models feature more powerful cameras for better video calling, alongside new ways to enhance your Alexa experience. “Customers love using Echo Show to stay in touch and in the past year have made nearly three times the number of video calls than the year prior,” said Tom Taylor, Senior Vice President, Amazon Alexa. “With these new Echo Show devices, we focused on communications—bringing a powerful camera and digital pan and zoom capabilities to the new Echo Show 8, upgrading the Echo Show 5 camera, and adding new AR effects to make video calls more fun and engaging.” Echo Show 8—Featuring a 13-megapixel, wide-angle camera that keeps you centered in frame—still just $129.99 The new Echo Show 8 has a vibrant 8-inch HD, adaptive color display; a powerful 13-megapixel camera with a built-in camera shutter; a new octa-core processor; and dual stereo speakers for clear, balanced sound. The upgraded camera automatically pans and zooms while you’re on video calls, so everyone stays centered in the frame. Just ask to make video calls via Alexa or say, “Alexa, call my family” to join a group call with multiple people. To add some fun to an Alexa call, soon you’ll be able to simply tap on the screen to choose from animated visual and audio in-call reactions, like hearts, laughs, or confetti. You will also be able to turn on in-call Augmented Reality (AR) effects, so you can appear in street art, a classic painting, and more. Support for Zoom also means you can quickly join meetings with coworkers, friends, and family by just saying, “Alexa, join my Zoom meeting.” With dual stereo speakers and an HD display, Echo Show 8 delivers an immersive entertainment experience. Simply ask to browse TV series or movies from Prime Video, Netflix, and Hulu, or ask Alexa to play your favorite music from Amazon Music, Apple Music, or Spotify. Alexa will also now show you music playlists or station recommendations based on the Amazon Music or Spotify song playing, making it easier to discover your next favorite artist or song. Echo Show 8 also offers even more ways to personalize your experience. With the new shared home screen, approved family and friends can share recent photos with you, and they’ll appear right on screen so you never miss an important moment. Plus, if you’re a Prime member, you have unlimited, full-resolution cloud photo storage with Amazon Photos—and the adaptive color display on Echo Show 8 makes your photos look great in any light. Echo Show 5—Compact design, improved camera, even more colors—now only $84.99 With its compact, 5.5-inch display, Echo Show 5 fits easily in any room of your house, and with three colors to choose from—Charcoal, Glacier White, and the new Deep Sea Blue—it seamlessly blends into your décor. You can ease into the day with a Sunrise Routine that turns your lights on gradually, plays the news, and shows you the weather for the day. You can also catch up on video highlights from your favorite sports team; watch news from NPR, CNN, ABC, and more; or, after working out with your Echo Buds, say, \"Alexa, show my workout history\" to see how many calories you burned, the distance you ran, or the duration of your workout. Echo Show 5 has an upgraded HD camera with double the pixels, making it perfect for a quick video call or to Drop In on the kitchen to see if dinner is ready. You can also securely access the built-in camera on Echo Show through the Alexa app to check in on home if you’re out of town, or just to see if the dog is on the couch. Alexa is getting even more proactive. Now, set up a Routine to turn on the lights as soon as you walk into a room in the morning to start your day. Or, to conserve energy, you can create a Routine to have Alexa power off your Fire TV if you left it on after going to bed. Soon, you can also set Alexa to recognize certain sounds—like a baby crying, dog barking, person coughing or snoring—and automate a series of actions. For example, you can create a Routine that gradually turns on your bedroom light when Alexa detects the sound of a baby crying or turns up white noise when your partner snores at night. Echo Show 5 Kids—Built for kids to be entertained, learn, and stay connected—just $94.99 The all-new Echo Show 5 Kids comes in a new and fun design that fits into the coolest of kids’ rooms. Kids can easily personalize the home screen of their device with colorful, kid-friendly clock themes; ask Alexa for homework help; make video calls to pre-approved contacts; and set alarms to wake up to the voice of their favorite characters. Amazon Kids+ also offers thousands of hours of premium entertainment and educational content—listen to Audible books, have dance parties to your favorite music, learn while having fun with skills like Lemonade Stand and Name that Animal, and more. Echo Show 5 Kids includes a 1-year subscription to Amazon Kids+ and a 2-year worry-free guarantee—if it breaks, return it, and Amazon will replace it for free. Built with Privacy in Mind Echo Show devices are designed with multiple layers of privacy protection, including microphone and camera controls and the ability to view and delete your voice recordings. All new generation devices come with built-in shutters to cover the camera. To learn more about the features that provide transparency and control over your Alexa experience, visit the Alexa Privacy Hub: http://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacy. Pricing & Availability Echo Show 8 ($129.99) is available in Charcoal and Glacier White; Echo Show 5 ($84.99) is available in Charcoal, Glacier White, and Deep Sea Blue; and Echo Show 5 Kids ($94.99) is available in Chameleon.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) today announced that it is hiring 75,000 people in its fulfillment and logistics network across the U.S. and Canada as it continues to expand its footprint and serve customers. Amazon recently announced pay increases across its fulfillment and transportation networks, and these open roles offer an average starting pay of over $17 per hour, plus sign-on bonuses in many locations of up to $1,000. In addition, the company offers full-time employees industry-leading benefits, which include health, vision, and dental insurance, 401(k) with 50% company match, paid parental leave, and access to various company-funded upskilling opportunities, including Amazon’s innovative Career Choice program, which prepays 95% of tuition for courses in high-demand fields. “We look forward to hiring 75,000 associates across our fulfillment and transportation network,” said Alicia Boler Davis, Vice President of Global Customer Fulfillment at Amazon. “Working at Amazon also comes with an unwavering commitment to safety, especially as we continue to navigate a global pandemic. In addition to the great pay and robust benefits available to new hires starting on their first day, we’re offering a $100 benefit to new hires who come to Amazon already vaccinated for COVID-19.” Creating well-paying jobs, offering great benefits, and ensuring employee health and safety are Amazon’s top priorities. In late March, the company began rolling out on-site vaccination events at fulfillment centers in Missouri, Nevada, and Kansas. The program has now expanded to more than 250 locations across the U.S. and Canada and offers more than half a million front-line employees, contractors, and partners access to the COVID-19 vaccine. In many locations, Amazon has also partnered with local authorities to expand its vaccination program to employees’ families as part of its commitment to employee safety—both in the workplace and at home. The on-site vaccine initiative is in addition to Amazon’s in-house COVID-19 testing program, which continues to provide front-line employees with access to voluntary, free testing across more than 800 sites globally. Hiring for the 75,000 roles is already underway. Interested candidates can visit amazon.com/apply to learn more, see where jobs are available, and apply. The locations with the most open roles include Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington, and Wisconsin.

    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and the National Hockey League (NHL) announced they will debut two new advanced analytics during the 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs. These new stats powered by AWS will appear as on-screen graphics and data visualizations during NHL games and give fans a better understanding and deeper appreciation of how their favorite players and teams perform during crucial moments. The first two stats, shot analytics and save analytics, will debut on Saturday, May 15, during the first day of the 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs and be used throughout the 2021-22 season. For more information about AWS and its involvement with the world’s premier professional hockey league, please visit https://aws.amazon.com/sports/nhl/. The new stats, powered by AWS, use cloud technologies such as analytics, serverless compute, and media services to gather data from the ice in real time, analyze it, and visualize it for fans as graphics appearing on the broadcast. The NHL stats will illustrate player effectiveness on offense, a goaltender’s success during different phases of the game, and the evolution of player performance over the course of a game in creating or blocking shot opportunities under different game scenarios. This new level of insight will help generate additional excitement during key moments of games by highlighting just how difficult certain plays can be. To build the new stats, the NHL and AWS drew from more than 10 years’ worth of data from the NHL’s Hockey Information and Tracking System (HITS), the League’s official system for recording game-time statistics. Leveraging AWS, the NHL will be able to combine this historical data with real-time game activity to give fans a new and unparalleled perspective on team and player performance. Shot analytics: Hockey is a fast-moving and fluid game. Opportunities to shoot and score can emerge suddenly as game strategies change based on a variety of situational factors. With shot analytics, fans will be able to see and truly appreciate how shot opportunities are created and converted into goals from different locations on the ice. Shot analytics will showcase the teams and players that have the highest shot-to-goal conversion rates from each area of the rink. It will also visualize how teams and players take advantage of even-strength, power play, and short-handed situations based on the number of shots and goals they attempt and score in each scenario. Shot analytics will allow fans to dive deep into team and player performance for a single game or across a season, giving them previously unavailable insights into their favorite teams and players. Save analytics: Hockey goaltenders face the daunting task of protecting their net against a puck that is only three inches in diameter but can be shot at speeds of up to 90 miles per hour. To do so, they use only their bodies, pads, and equipment. Save analytics will calculate and visualize goaltenders’ save percentages and the volume of shots they stop from each zone on the rink to help fans better understand and appreciate the pressure goaltenders face in a game. The NHL will use the stat to display how goaltenders perform against different team strength conditions—such as when they’re missing a defender during an opposing team’s power play—and during different game phases or events, such as a breakaway by the opponent or in a shootout. In addition, save analytics will illustrate goaltenders’ success in making saves with their sticks, their gloves, or other pads, equipment, and body parts—and how these results vary based on where shots originate. Together, the shot analytics and save analytics graphics will enhance the broadcast viewing experience for fans by delivering information that will deepen their understanding of team and player performance. In addition, the stats will allow the NHL and its broadcast partners to add color to their live game analysis and commentary by quickly delivering meaningful insights about shots, goals, and saves. “NHL fans are extremely tech savvy. They love the speed and skill of the sport and they crave more opportunities to understand and engage with the game and the players, and therefore, it’s important for us to use our data to deliver as many insights as possible,” said Dave Lehanski, Executive Vice President, NHL Business Development and Innovation. “AWS is the perfect partner for the NHL, helping us to aggregate our rich historical content and deliver real-time advanced analytics that will continue to transform the fan experience. The delivery of these stats will unlock opportunities for fans, along with players, coaches, and broadcasters, to see the game in new ways and to gain a deeper understanding of the strategic decisions made during a game.” “We announced our partnership with the NHL earlier this year and already it’s bearing fruit with these advanced statistics for the Stanley Cup Playoffs,” said Rachel Thornton, Vice President, Worldwide Marketing at Amazon Web Services, Inc. “Working with the world’s leading sports leagues, we know that their fans love to dive deep into stats about their favorite players and teams. Hockey moves quickly, and hockey fans are hungry for greater insights into the game. Together, AWS and the NHL are providing audiences around the world the real-time context they need to better appreciate the tension and skill behind every play.” These advanced analytics are the result of the new partnership announced in February 2021 when AWS was named the Official Cloud, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning Infrastructure Provider of the NHL. The NHL is also relying on AWS to automate and improve game video processing and content delivery. This work is part of the recently announced AWS for Media & Entertainment (M&E) initiative that aligns the most purpose-built capabilities of any cloud—including nine AWS Services, 11 AWS Solutions, dedicated AWS appliances, and more than 400 AWS Partners—within five solution areas to help customers transform M&E: Content Production; Media Supply Chain & Archive; Broadcast; Direct-to-Consumer & Streaming; and Data Science & Analytics.
