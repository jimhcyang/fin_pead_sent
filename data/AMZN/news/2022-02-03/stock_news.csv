Providing a deeply personal account of a family tragedy that unfolded on the world stage, Fulton imparts wisdom and shares the lessons she’s learned over these past ten years. Her essay is about life, love, and loss; about bad faith; about what changes have and have not occurred; and about the power of finding and using her voice. “We all have an obligation to help children and create communities that lead with safety, love, and equity. I hope that with my new essay and the work I have done over the last ten years, readers, watchers, and supporters will feel inspired to create something positive for the world we live in, and our children’s futures,” said Fulton. “From small good deeds to large scale cultural change, these transformations can honor Trayvon and others who senselessly lost their lives.” “We are privileged to publish Sybrina Fulton’s powerful essay and thank her for her vulnerability, honesty, and inspiration,” said Selena James, editor at Amazon Original Stories. “Sybrina has become one of the most important activists of our time, and we are proud to work with her to share her essay with readers at this crucial moment in history.” Available at no additional cost to Prime and Kindle Unlimited customers, Trayvon: Ten Years Later can be downloaded as a Kindle eBook and will also be available on Audible at www.amazon.com/trayvon. Fulton joins other notable authors in the Amazon Original Stories library sharing their stories and experiences with readers. In 2021, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar explored racial conflict through the prism of his childhood and the influence of his father in Black Cop’s Kid, and in 2020, Mindy Kaling shared a relatable take on love and relationships in her Amazon Charts bestselling essay collection Nothing Like I Imagined (Except for Sometimes).

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company, (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that Best Buy Co., Inc. (NASDAQ: BBY) has selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider for cloud infrastructure services and its strategic partner for developing cloud engineering talent. This collaboration will help Best Buy further apply cloud technology across its retail operations and support the rapid innovation of its customer experiences and the work of its teams to create world-class digital experiences that can enrich the lives of millions. “Our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important, and this new partnership with AWS is another step in our commitment to deliver outstanding experiences for our customers,” said Brian Tilzer, Chief Digital and Technology Officer of Best Buy Co., Inc. “Not only will AWS’s cloud technologies help us in this work, but in combination with our culture of innovation and reinvention, they will give our teams invaluable development opportunities as we continue to grow our skilled teams and remain one of the best places for amazing technology talent to thrive.” Best Buy—recently named one of Fast Company’s Best Workplaces for Innovators—is known for its culture of innovation and use of technology and analytics to better serve customers, including responding with significant flexibility to external challenges. For example, using advanced cloud technologies, part of which were already supported by AWS, Best Buy was able to deploy an industry-leading curbside pickup experience in just two days at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost two years later, this service continues to allow customers to safely pick up technology products essential to working and learning from home. Using the breadth and depth of AWS Cloud capabilities, Best Buy’s product teams and engineers continue to transform the way people buy technology. By applying AWS compute, storage, database, and security services, Best Buy creates new experiences for its customers, including the ability to interact virtually with experts to receive live demos of physical products. Combining AWS’s advanced cloud technologies with Best Buy’s company-wide agile development model fuels new offerings such as Best Buy’s Totaltech program. Totaltech provides members with access to 24x7 tech expertise delivered via an AWS-powered chatbot and a heightened sense of confidence that their tech support needs can be resolved quickly. “Best Buy is transforming the way people buy technology and is using AWS’s comprehensive set of cloud services to accelerate its innovation. Thousands of retailers like Best Buy continue to trust AWS as their cloud provider of choice because of our ability to help them remain agile and innovate faster to meet the demands of the constantly evolving retail landscape,” said Werner Vogels, Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of Amazon.com, Inc. “Our shared culture of customer obsession and innovation will help us work together to ensure that the cloud will benefit every customer across every aspect of their business.” Through this strategic collaboration with AWS, Best Buy will also accelerate the pace of its cloud migration and implementation of its cloud-first strategy, beginning with moving additional retail operations workloads from on-premises data centers to AWS. Moving forward, Best Buy will expand its use of AWS capabilities and AWS Marketplace, a digital catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software vendors that makes it easy to find, test, buy, and deploy software that runs on AWS, to increase resilience, gain agility, and accelerate innovation. In addition, the collaboration will give Best Buy’s growing teams of skilled technologists access to AWS Training and Certification’s comprehensive cloud training curriculum and resources. These training resources will give Best Buy teams new skills development opportunities and help Best Buy achieve its goal of being one of the best companies to work for, especially for technical talent. Best Buy has committed to hiring 1,000 new employees to its technology team—with 30% of them being diverse, specifically Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and women—and has growing tech and data science hubs in Atlanta, Boston, Seattle, and Minneapolis. About Amazon Web Services For over 15 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud offering.

Given the extraordinary growth we saw in 2020 when customers predominantly stayed home, and the fact that we’ve continued to grow on top of that in 2021, our Retail teammates have effectively operated in peak mode for almost two years. It’s been a tremendous effort, and I’m appreciative and proud of how hard our teams have worked to serve customers,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “As expected over the holidays, we saw higher costs driven by labor supply shortages and inflationary pressures, and these issues persisted into the first quarter due to Omicron. Despite these short-term challenges, we continue to feel optimistic and excited about the business as we emerge from the pandemic. When you combine how we’re staffing and scaling our fulfillment network to bring even faster delivery to more customers, the extraordinary growth of AWS with 40% year-over-year growth (and now a $71 billion revenue run rate), the addition of marquee new entertainment like The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and Thursday Night Football, and a plethora of new capabilities that we’re building in areas like Alexa, Ring, Grocery, Pharmacy, Amazon Care, Kuiper, and Zoox, there’s a lot to look forward to in the months and years ahead.” Amazon also continues to invest heavily in Prime. In the last few years, Amazon has added more product selection available with fast, free, unlimited Prime shipping; more exclusive deals and discounts; and more high-quality digital entertainment, including TV, movies, music, and books. Since 2018, Prime Video has tripled the number of Amazon Originals, rolling out new series and movies like The Boys, The Wheel of Time, Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, The Underground Railroad, Sound of Metal, Coming 2 America, The Tomorrow War, and Being the Ricardos. This September, Prime Video will release the highly anticipated The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and become the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football as part of a historic 11-year agreement with the National Football League (NFL). Since 2018 in the U.S., availability of Free Same-Day Delivery has expanded from 48 metropolitan areas to more than 90, items available for Prime free shipping have increased over 50%, and members have saved billions of dollars shopping Prime Day. This is all on top of new program benefits like prescription savings and fast, free delivery from Amazon Pharmacy and the continually growing Amazon Music for Prime members, Prime Reading, and Prime Gaming. With the continued expansion of Prime member benefits as well as the rise in wages and transportation costs, Amazon will increase the price of a Prime membership in the U.S., with the monthly fee going from $12.99 to $14.99, and the annual membership from $119 to $139. This is the first time Amazon has raised the price of Prime since 2018. For new Prime members, the price change will go into effect on February 18, 2022, and for current Prime members, the new price will apply after March 25, 2022, on the date of their next renewal. Highlights Shopping Amazon had its biggest-ever Black Friday to Cyber Monday holiday shopping weekend, with apparel, beauty, home, and toys among the top-selling categories. During the holiday season, third-party sellers—most of which are small and medium-sized businesses—achieved record worldwide sales in Amazon’s store. More than 130,000 third-party sellers worldwide surpassed $100,000 in sales on Amazon, and between Black Friday and Christmas, U.S.-based third-party sellers sold an average of 11,500 products per minute. In addition, Amazon India’s month-long Great Indian Festival sales event was the biggest shopping celebration ever for sellers and brand partners on Amazon.in, with nearly 30,000 sellers surpassing $100,000 in sales. Prime members are taking advantage of program benefits in record numbers. In 2021, members in the U.S. received more than 6 billion free deliveries, and over 200 million Prime members worldwide streamed shows and movies. Amazon Style, Amazon’s first-ever physical store for apparel, will open this year at The Americana at Brand, a top shopping destination in greater Los Angeles. Amazon Style is built around personalization and innovation. It uses machine learning algorithms to produce tailored recommendations in real time as customers shop, making it easier than ever to discover new looks. At Amazon Style, customers will be able to have items sent to a fitting room with the tap of a button in the Amazon app and continue shopping from their fitting room without having to leave. The first Starbucks Pickup with Amazon Go store opened in New York City. With this new store concept, customers can order a handcrafted Starbucks beverage or food item for pickup through the Starbucks app and grab food items from the Amazon Go market, all in one convenient location without having to wait in line to pay. Starbucks and Amazon Go plan to open two more stores in 2022, with the next location planned for The New York Times Building in New York City. UK grocer Sainsbury’s opened SmartShop Pick & Go, a Just Walk Out technology-enabled convenience store in Holborn Circus, London. The store marked the first time Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology launched in a third-party customer store internationally. It was also the first time Amazon retrofitted a third-party retail store with Just Walk Out technology, meaning the store uses Sainsbury’s existing fixtures and fittings with Amazon’s technology. For the second year in a row, the Retailer Preference Index—a report from research firm dunnhumby based on insights from 10,000 shoppers on 57 grocers in the U.S.—ranked Amazon as the best overall grocery retailer. Amazon was recognized for offering customers consistently low prices, convenience, and great selection on a wide variety of grocery items sold on Amazon.com. Amazon partnered with Affirm to offer customers even more ways to pay on Amazon. Customers in the U.S. now have the flexibility to split the total cost of eligible purchases of $50 or more into monthly payments at checkout with no late or hidden fees. Amazon announced that later this year, more than 80 million Venmo users in the U.S. will have the option to pay with PayPal-owned Venmo in Amazon’s online stores using their linked bank account or Venmo balance. Amazon continues to invest in offering Prime members around the world same-day delivery options, including Free Same-Day Delivery, where Prime members can receive their order the same day they ordered it, and Faster Same-Day Delivery, where Prime members can receive their order in as fast as five hours. Free Same-Day Delivery is now available in more than 90 metro areas in the U.S. with the addition of Fort Collins, Colorado, and Provo, Utah; in 58 metro areas in Europe; and in Tokyo, Japan. Faster Same-Day Delivery is now available in 24 metro areas in the U.S., with new launches in the past quarter in Austin, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Denver, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, and San Diego. Amazon published its largest ever Holiday Fashion print lookbook, which was sent to millions of Prime members offering more than 1,000 items to choose from for their holiday shopping.

Simmons, and original screenplay Aaron Sorkin). The Tender Bar was nominated for a SAG Award (male actor in a supporting role Ben Affleck). A Hero, the foreign language feature from Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, was nominated for a Critics Choice Award (foreign language film) and shortlisted for the Academy Awards (international feature). The Underground Railroad, which earned seven Emmy nominations in 2021, was nominated for three Critics Choice Awards (limited series, lead actress Thuso Mbedu, and supporting actor William Jackson Harper) and two Independent Spirit Awards (new scripted series and female performer Thuso Mbedu). The fourth quarter marked Prime Video’s strongest viewership for live sports globally. The 2021-2022 Thursday Night Football season streaming on Prime Video and Twitch delivered the highest average minute audience, a measurement of the average number of devices streaming Thursday Night Football at any given minute during the live game, since Amazon acquired shared rights in 2017. In the UK, the Manchester United vs. Arsenal soccer game on December 2, 2021, became the most-watched Premier League match ever on the service, with an estimated viewership of more than 4 million. Plus, millions of rugby fans tuned in to the Autumn Nations Series, the first full competitive international rugby union series featuring the top Northern and Southern Hemisphere teams since 2019. In India, Prime Video made its first foray into live sports, streaming cricket matches between New Zealand and Bangladesh. Prime Video debuted 28 local originals internationally, including Maradona: Blessed Dream (Argentina), Burning (Australia), Inside Edge Season 3 (India), and The Ferragnez - The Series (Italy).

As part of the collaboration, Amazon will deliver software for Stellantis’ new digital cabin platform, STLA SmartCockpit, in millions of vehicles over the next decade. Amazon announced it has now sold more than 150 million Fire TV devices worldwide since launching the device in 2014. Amazon introduced a new in-vehicle experience for passengers to use Alexa or on-screen touch controls to access more than 1 million TV episodes and movies on Fire TV in the U.S. Fire TV will also be built into BMW’s new 31-inch Theatre Screen for rear-seat passengers. Amazon announced a collaboration with Lockheed Martin and Cisco that will send Alexa into space as a part of Artemis I, the first of several NASA missions that will land the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon. Alexa will join the upcoming mission as a part of Callisto, a technology-demonstration payload embedded into NASA’s Orion spacecraft. Amazon launched new features to make Alexa more proactive, conversational, and personal. Customers can now teach Alexa their preferences, such as for food and sports, that Alexa will remember when recommending recipes, local restaurants, and sports scores. Alexa can also start a Routine after detecting activities. For example, if Alexa detects a beeping washing machine or the sound of running water, Alexa can alert customers that the laundry is done or to turn off the faucet. Customers using the Echo Show 10 can also enable Conversation Mode for a more natural, back-and-forth interaction with Alexa without needing to repeat the Alexa wake word. Amazon launched the Amazon Smart Air Quality Monitor in Canada, France, Italy, Spain, the UK, and the U.S. This new air quality monitor measures the presence of indoor allergens and toxins and makes it simple for customers to check the air quality of their home. Ring launched and started shipping the Ring Alarm Glass Break Sensor, which uses artificial intelligence technology to monitor glass windows or doors and alert customers if their glass is broken. Amazon announced Amazon Sidewalk Bridge Pro by Ring, which will bring professional-grade device connectivity to even more places, including commercial centers, parks, universities, and wilderness areas. Alongside the announcement, Amazon launched two pilot programs. The first pilot, with Arizona State University, will focus on extending the range of connectivity for the university’s on-campus internet of things devices, including sunlight sensors, temperature sensors, CO2 detectors, and particle counters. The second pilot is with Thingy, a technology company that provides information to first responders about wildfires. Thingy will work with Sidewalk Bridge Pro to provide connectivity for Thingy’s air quality monitoring systems and share information to help combat wildfires. Amazon launched Ultrasound Motion Detection for customers to enable Occupancy Routines when motion is detected (or not detected) near their Echo device. With Ultrasound Motion Detection, the device can emit an inaudible ultrasound wave to detect movement and initiate a Routine. For example, with an Occupancy Routine, Alexa can turn off the lights when a person leaves the room or automatically play music when motion is detected near an Echo device. Amazon Web Services AWS announced significant customer momentum, with new commitments and migrations from customers across many major industries.

Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 3, 2022, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. This guidance reflects our estimates as of February 3, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as the effect of other factors discussed above. First Quarter 2022 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between $112.0 billion and $117.0 billion, or to grow between 3% and 8% compared with first quarter 2021. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 150 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion, compared with $8.9 billion in first quarter 2021. This guidance includes approximately $1.0 billion lower depreciation expense due to increases in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment beginning on January 1, 2022. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results. These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Early this year, Prime Video forged the show’s title treatment in molten metal, fuelling fans’ insatiable appetite for this series and organically reaching an estimated 1 billion impressions worldwide within the first 24 hours. This campaign milestone was quickly followed with the unveiling of 23 intricately detailed posters featuring only the hands of the series’ stars, sparking huge online conversation regarding the identity and backstories of these characters. The eagerly awaited The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power will premiere exclusively on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories around the world in multiple languages on Friday, September 2, with new episodes available weekly. Prime Video’s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power brings to screens for the very first time the heroic legends of the fabled Second Age of Middle-earth's history. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings books, and will take viewers back to an era in which great powers were forged, kingdoms rose to glory and fell to ruin, unlikely heroes were tested, hope hung by the finest of threads, and one of the greatest villains that ever flowed from Tolkien’s pen threatened to cover all the world in darkness. Beginning in a time of relative peace, the series follows an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared reemergence of evil to Middle-earth. From the darkest depths of the Misty Mountains, to the majestic forests of the elf capital of Lindon, to the breathtaking island kingdom of Númenor, to the farthest reaches of the map, these kingdoms and characters will carve out legacies that live on long after they are gone. The series is led by showrunners and executive producers J.D. Payne & Patrick McKay. They are joined by executive producers Lindsey Weber, Callum Greene, J.A. Bayona, Belén Atienza, Justin Doble, Jason Cahill, Gennifer Hutchison, Bruce Richmond, and Sharon Tal Yguado, and producers Ron Ames and Christopher Newman. Wayne Che Yip is co-executive producer and directs along with J.A. Bayona and Charlotte Brändström. The multi-season drama will premiere exclusively on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories around the world in multiple languages on Friday, September 2, with new episodes available weekly. The Lord of the Rings books have been translated into over 38 languages and have sold more than 150 million copies.

A bold new force on the music landscape, BRELAND’s groundbreaking mix of hip-hop and country has turned heads, and as a Breakthrough Artist, the singer/songwriter/producer will receive substantial support from Amazon Music, including bespoke video and audio content, global marketing campaigns, increased visibility across playlists and programming, and high-profile Amazon Original tracks. As part of Breakthrough, BRELAND will be a featured guest on Country Heat Weekly, the first genre-focused Original podcast from Amazon Music, to connect with co-hosts Kelly Sutton and Amber Anderson on his new music and the year ahead. “It’s an honor to be selected as the next Breakthrough Artist. Coming together with Amazon Music is a natural pairing. We share the same vision for my music, and I know that by working with them, I’ll be able to make even my most ambitious plans a reality. I can’t wait to share what we’re working on with my fans,” said BRELAND. New Jersey-born BRELAND began writing songs as a teenager, inspired by a diverse collection of sounds and eclectic artists like the Beatles, Rascal Flatts, Prince, and his number-one influence, Stevie Wonder. His debut single, “My Truck,” fused hip-hop with country and became a breakout success, going platinum and ending up on best-of-the-year lists from NPR and The New York Times. Since signing to Bad Realm Records/Atlantic Records, BRELAND has collaborated with heavy-hitters such as Gary LeVox of Rascal Flatts, Nelly, Blanco Brown, Lauren Alaina, and Chase Rice. He recently enlisted Keith Urban for the dynamic collaboration “Throw It Back,” and is currently featured on Dierks Bentley’s single with HARDY, “Beers On Me.” Praised by Rolling Stone as “1,000 percent the whole package,” he made his Grand Ole Opry debut to a standing ovation last year. Amazon Music has also unveiled details of the Breakthrough Development Fund, an initiative created to provide independent artists with additional financial support to help them as they launch their careers. The fund is the newest part of the Breakthrough program from Amazon Music, joining Breakthrough Live and the Breakthrough playlists supporting new artists. Each month, one independent artist in the U.S. will receive financial support that they’ll be able to use to cover some of the costs artists face when starting out, like funding an early tour, hiring a PR or social team, and more. Thus far in 2022, Amazon Music has used the fund to support singer/songwriter Lauren Spencer-Smith in January and Muni Long in February. “Helping to develop artists is something that is very important to Amazon Music, and we understand that as their career starts to grow, each artist has different needs. Depending on where they’re at in their career, they may need to build a strong team around them or to enhance their live show. With the Breakthrough Development Fund, we want to help artists build their teams and their profile,” said Amazon Global Co-Head of Artist Relations Chris Graham. “Whether we’re backing artists with this new fund, providing a stage for their music on our Breakthrough playlists, or supporting them with the Breakthrough Artist program, Amazon Music is constantly working to help emerging artists find new fans and get to the next level of their careers.” Breakthrough is the emerging artist program from Amazon Music, aimed at amplifying the best new talent and championing them at different moments early in their careers. The program encompasses playlisting, livestreams, funding, marketing and social campaigns, events, editorial content, and more. Breakthrough has supported a wide variety of artists from around the globe, including U.S. hip-hop artist Blxst, country powerhouse Gabby Barrett, rising pop star Remi Wolf, London-based musician and poet Arlo Parks, rising German pop sensation Malik Harris, London singer/songwriter Olivia Dean, and Latin pop duo Las Villa.

Prime Video veröffentlichte nämlich den ersten offiziellen Teaser-Trailer für die mit großer Spannung erwartete neue Serie Der Herr der Ringe: Die Ringe der Macht, die 2022 anläuft. Der 60-sekündige Werbespot bot den Zuschauern des Super Bowl die allerersten audiovisuellen Eindrücke des sagenhaften Zweiten Zeitalters von J. R. R. Tolkien und enthüllte die legendäre neue TV-Serie von Amazon Studios und den Showrunnern J. D. Payne und Patrick McKay, die am 2. September erstmals ausgestrahlt werden soll. Mit einer vielfältigen Auswahl an Figuren aus dem Ensemble – von Elben über Zwerge bis hin zu Orks – und ganz Arda umspannenden Gebieten entführt der Teaser-Trailer die Zuschauer auf eine actionreiche Reise voller Wunder und Aufregung nach allen Regeln der Filmkunst. Die Freigabe des Teaser-Trailers während des Super Bowl LVI am 13. Februar ist der bisher spannendste Moment in einer der größten globalen Marketingkampagnen des Jahres 2022. Anfang dieses Jahres goss Prime Video den Titel der Serie mit flüssigem Metall in eine Form, die den unstillbaren Hunger der Fans anfachte, sodass innerhalb der ersten 24 Stunden auf organische Weise rund eine Milliarde Seitenaufrufe erreicht wurden. Auf diesen Meilenstein der Kampagne folgte rasch die Enthüllung von 23 mit viel Liebe zum Detail gestalteten Postern, die lediglich die Hände der Hauptfiguren der Serie darstellten und die online zu gewaltigen Diskussionen um die Identität und die Vorgeschichte dieser Figuren führt. Die mit Spannung erwartete Serie Der Herr der Ringe: Die Ringe der Macht feiert ihre Exklusivpremiere in mehr als 240 Ländern und Hoheitsgebieten rund um die Welt und in mehreren Sprachversionen am Freitag, 2. September, auf Prime Video, worauf jede Woche neue Folgen freigegeben werden. Der Herr der Ringe: Die Ringe der Macht bringt auf Prime Video zum allerersten Mal die Helden und Legenden des sagenhaften Zweiten Zeitalters aus der Geschichte von Mittelerde auf den Bildschirm. Das Epos spielt sich mehrere Tausend Jahre vor den Ereignissen aus den Büchern Der Hobbit und Der Herr der Ringe ab und entführt die Zuschauer in eine Zeit, in der enorme Kräfte geschmiedet wurden, Königreiche zu Ruhm kamen und wieder in den Ruin versanken, überraschende Helden auf die Probe gestellt wurden, die Hoffnung an einem seidenen Faden hing und eine der mächtigsten Verkörperungen des Bösen, die J. R. R. Tolkien je aus der Feder flossen, die ganze Welt in Dunkelheit zu stürzen drohte. Zu Beginn der Serie ist das Leben in Mittelerde noch relativ friedlich, doch das Ensemble aus vertrauten und neuen Figuren muss sich schon bald der Tatsache stellen, dass das Böse wieder an Macht gewinnt. Von den dunkelsten Tiefen im Nebelgebirge über die majestätischen Wälder des Elbenreichs von Lindon und das atemberaubende Inselkönigreich Númenor bis hin zu den äußersten Gefilden, die auf der Karte verzeichnet sind, werden diese Welten und Figuren ein Erbe hinterlassen, das noch lange weiterleben wird, nachdem sie selbst längst verschwunden sind. Die Idee für die Serie stammt von den Showrunnern und Executive Producers J. D. Payne und Patrick McKay. Ihnen zur Seite stehen die Executive Producers Lindsey Weber, Callum Greene, J. A. Bayona, Belén Atienza, Justin Doble, Jason Cahill, Gennifer Hutchison, Bruce Richmond und Sharon Tal Yguado sowie die Produzenten Ron Ames und Christopher Newman. Wayne Che Yip ist als Co-Executive Producer sowie zusammen mit J. A. Bayona und Charlotte Brändström als Regisseur verantwortlich. Das über mehrere Staffeln konzipierte Epos wird zum ersten Mal am Freitag, 2. September, in mehr als 240 Ländern und Hoheitsgebieten rund um die Welt und in mehreren Sprachversionen exklusiv auf Prime Video ausgestrahlt, worauf jede Woche neue Folgen freigegeben werden. Der Roman Der Herr der Ringe wurde in über 38 Sprachen übersetzt, und bisher wurden mehr als 150 Millionen Exemplare des Buchs verkauft.

Prime Video lanzó su primer tráiler oficial de su nueva serie más esperada de 2022, El Señor de los Anillos: Los Anillos de Poder. El comercial de 60 segundos ofreció a los espectadores del Super Bowl sus primeros vistazos audiovisuales de la legendaria Segunda Edad de J.R.R.

Con una selección de personajes del elenco del conjunto, como elfos, enanos y orcos, y entornos que abarcan Arda, el tráiler lleva a los espectadores a un viaje lleno de acción, lleno de asombro y emoción en un verdadero esplendor cinematográfico. El debut del tráiler durante el Super Bowl LVI el 13 de febrero marca el último momento decisivo de lo que podría decirse que será una de las mayores campañas de comercialización global de 2022. A principios de este año, Prime Video forjó el tratamiento del título del programa en metal fundido, alimentando el apetito insaciable de los fanáticos por esta serie y alcanzó orgánicamente un estimado de mil millones de impresiones en todo el mundo en las primeras 24 horas. El hito de esta campaña fue rápidamente seguido por la presentación de 23 carteles intrincadamente detallados que mostraban solo las manos de las estrellas de la serie, lo que provocó una gran conversación en línea sobre la identidad y las historias de fondo de estos personajes.

Este drama épico está ambientado miles de años antes de los eventos de los libros de J.R.R. Tolkien El Hobbit y El Señor de los Anillos y llevará a los espectadores a una era en la que se forjaron grandes poderes, los reinos alcanzaron la gloria y cayeron en ruinas, se pusieron a prueba a héroes inverosímiles, la esperanza pendía del más fino de los hilos y uno de los mayores villanos que alguna vez fluyó de la pluma de Tolkien amenazó con cubrir todo el mundo en tinieblas. Comenzando en una época de relativa paz, la serie sigue a un elenco de personajes, tanto familiares como nuevos, mientras se enfrentan al temido resurgimiento del mal en la Tierra Media. Desde las profundidades más oscuras de las Montañas Nubladas, hasta los majestuosos bosques de Lindon, la capital de los elfos, pasando por el impresionante reino insular de Númenor, hasta los confines más lejanos del mapa, estos reinos y personajes crearán legados que perdurarán mucho después de su final.

O Prime Video lançou seu primeiro trailer oficial da sua mais nova série mais esperada de 2022, O Senhor dos Anéis: Os Anéis do Poder. O comercial de 60 segundos ofereceu aos expectadores os primeiros relances audiovisuais da legendária Segunda Era de J.R.R. Tolkien, revelando uma nova lenda da Amazon Studios e dos showrunners J.D. Payne & Patrick McKay, que começará em 2 de setembro. Com uma seleção de personagens do elenco – como elfos, anões e orcs – e ambientes que abrangem Arda, o trailer leva os espectadores em uma jornada repleta de ação, maravilha e emoção no verdadeiro esplendor cinematográfico. A estreia do trailer durante o Super Bowl LVI em 13 de fevereiro marca o mais recente momento decisivo do que indiscutivelmente será uma das maiores campanhas globais de marketing de 2022. No início deste ano, o Prime Video forjou o tratamento do título do programa em metal fundido, alimentando o apetite insaciável dos fãs da série e alcançando organicamente cerca de um bilhão de impressões no mundo inteiro nas primeiras 24 horas. Este marco na campanha foi rapidamente seguido pela revelação de 23 pôsteres sofisticadamente detalhados mostrando apenas as mãos das estrelas da série, gerando enormes discussões on-line sobre a identidade e históricos desses personagens. A ansiosamente esperada O Senhor dos Anéis: Os Anéis do Poder estreará exclusivamente no Prime Video em mais de 240 países e territórios em diversos idiomas na sexta-feira, 2 de setembro, com novos episódios sendo lançados semanalmente. O Senhor dos Anéis: Os Anéis do Poder do Prime Video traz para as telas pela primeira vez as lendas heroicas da lendária Segunda Era da história da Terra-Média. Esse drama épico é ambientado milhares de anos antes dos eventos dos livros O Hobbit e O Senhor dos Anéis de J.R.R. Tolkien, e levará os expectadores de volta a uma era onde grande poderes eram forjados, reinos ascenderam à glória e caíram em ruínas, heróis improváveis foram desafiados, a esperança esteve por um fio, e um dos maiores vilões que já surgiram da escrita de Tolkien ameaçou cobrir o mundo todo em trevas. Começando em uma época de relativa paz, a série segue com personagens conhecidos e novos enquanto eles enfrentam o temido ressurgimento do mal na Terra-Média. Das profundezas mais sombrias das Montanhas Nebulosas, às florestas mágicas de Lindon, capital dos elfos, ao exuberante reino insular de Númenor, aos pontos mais extremos do mapa, esses reinos e personagens esculpirão legados que viverão muito além do seu final. A série é liderada pelos produtores executivos e showrunners J.D. Payne e Patrick McKay. Juntam-se a eles os produtores executivos Lindsey Weber, Callum Greene, J.A. Bayona, Belén Atienza, Justin Doble, Jason Cahill, Gennifer Hutchison, Bruce Richmond e Sharon Tal Yguado, e os produtores Ron Ames e Christopher Newman. Wayne Che Yip é o produto coprodutor executivo e responsável pela direção ao lado de J.A. Bayona e Charlotte Brändström. O drama de várias temporadas estreará exclusivamente no Prime Video em mais de 240 países e territórios em diversos idiomas na sexta-feira, 2 de setembro, com novos episódios sendo lançados semanalmente. Os livros O Senhor dos Anéis foram traduzidos para mais de 38 idiomas e venderam mais de 150 milhões de exemplares.

Prime Video a publié sa première bande-annonce officielle pour sa nouvelle série la plus attendue de 2022, Le Seigneur des Anneaux : Les Anneaux de Pouvoirs. Le spot publicitaire de 60 secondes a offert aux téléspectateurs du Super Bowl leurs tout premiers aperçus audiovisuels du légendaire Second Âge de J.R.R. Tolkien, dévoilant une toute nouvelle légende d'Amazon Studios et des showrunners J.D. Payne & Patrick McKay qui débutera le 2 septembre. Présentant une sélection de personnages de la distribution d'ensemble, tels que des elfes, des nains et des orcs, et des environnements couvrant Arda, la bande-annonce emmène les téléspectateurs dans un voyage plein d'action rempli d'émerveillement et d'excitation dans une véritable splendeur cinématographique. Le lancement de la bande-annonce lors du Super Bowl LVI le 13 février marque le dernier moment décisif pour ce qui sera sans doute l'une des plus grandes campagnes marketing mondiales de 2022. Au début de cette année, Prime Video a forgé le traitement du titre de la série dans du métal en fusion, alimentant l'appétit insatiable des fans pour cette série et atteignant organiquement, durant les premières 24 heures, un nombre d'impressions estimé à 1 milliard dans le monde entier. Cette étape importante de la campagne a été rapidement suivie par le dévoilement de 23 posters minutieusement détaillés sur lesquels ne figurent que les mains des stars de la série, ce qui a suscité une énorme conversation en ligne concernant l'identité et l'histoire de ces personnages. Le très attendu Le Seigneur des Anneaux : Les Anneaux de Pouvoirs sera diffusé en exclusivité sur Prime Video dans plus de 240 pays et territoires à travers le monde en plusieurs langues le vendredi 2 septembre, et de nouveaux épisodes seront disponibles chaque semaine. La série Prime Video Le Seigneur des Anneaux : Les Anneaux de Pouvoirs présente à l'écran pour la toute première fois les légendes héroïques de l'histoire légendaire du Second Âge de la Terre du Milieu. Se déroulant des milliers d'années avant les événements des livres Le Hobbit et Le Seigneur des Anneaux de J.R.R. Tolkien, ce drame épique ramènera les spectateurs à une époque où de grandes puissances ont été forgées, où des royaumes ont connu la gloire et sont tombés en ruine, où des héros improbables ont été mis à l'épreuve, où l'espoir ne tenait qu'à un fil et où l'un des plus grands méchants qui ait jamais jailli de la plume de Tolkien menaçait de couvrir le monde entier de ténèbres. Commençant dans une période de paix relative, la série suit un ensemble de personnages, à la fois familiers et nouveaux, alors qu'ils affrontent la réémergence tant redoutée du mal sur la Terre du Milieu. Des profondeurs les plus sombres des Montagnes Brumeuses, aux forêts majestueuses de la capitale elfe de Lindon, en passant par l'époustouflant royaume insulaire de Númenor, jusqu'aux confins de la carte, ces royaumes et ces personnages se tailleront un héritage qui perdurera longtemps après leur disparition. Cette série a à sa tête les showrunners et producteurs exécutifs J.D. Payne et Patrick McKay. Ils sont rejoints par les producteurs exécutifs Lindsey Weber, Callum Greene, J.A. Bayona, Belén Atienza, Justin Doble, Jason Cahill, Gennifer Hutchison, Bruce Richmond et Sharon Tal Yguado, et les producteurs Ron Ames et Christopher Newman.

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced the completion of its first 16 AWS Local Zones in the U.S. and plans to launch new AWS Local Zones in 32 new metropolitan areas in 26 countries around the world. AWS Local Zones are a type of infrastructure deployment that extends AWS Regions to place compute, storage, database, and other AWS services at the edge of the cloud near large population, industry, and information technology (IT) centers—enabling customers to deploy applications that require single-digit millisecond latency closer to end users or on-premises data centers. AWS Local Zones allow customers to use core AWS services locally while seamlessly connecting to the rest of their workloads running in AWS Regions with the same elasticity, pay-as-you-go model, application programming interfaces (APIs), and toolsets. To learn more about AWS Local Zones, visit aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones. The vast majority of customers receive the necessary latency required to support their applications’ performance by running them in AWS Regions (geographic locations around the world where AWS clusters data centers to serve customers in local AWS Availability Zones). However, for applications that require ultra-low latency (e.g., remote real-time gaming, media and entertainment content creation, live video streaming, engineering simulations, augmented and virtual reality, machine learning inference at the edge, etc.), customers want AWS infrastructure closer to their end users to support a seamless experience. Other customers have local data residency requirements where they must run parts of their applications in on-premises data centers, but they also want to take advantage of AWS services and similarly benefit from the ultra-low latency that AWS Local Zones can provide to these types of hybrid applications. Both of these use cases would otherwise require customers to procure, operate, and maintain IT infrastructure—and use a different set of APIs and tools for the on-premises and AWS environments—which creates unnecessary costs and operational complexity. Prior to today, customers could use AWS Local Zones to deliver applications that require single-digit millisecond latency in 16 cities in the U.S. (Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, and Seattle). However, customers in Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East would also like to use AWS Local Zones to deliver applications closer to end users and run hybrid workloads near their data centers with single-digit millisecond latencies around the world. Over the next two years, new AWS Local Zones will launch in Amsterdam, Athens, Auckland, Bangkok, Bengaluru, Berlin, Bogotá, Brisbane, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Chennai, Copenhagen, Delhi, Hanoi, Helsinki, Johannesburg, Kolkata, Lima, Lisbon, Manila, Munich, Nairobi, Oslo, Perth, Prague, Querétaro, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, Toronto, Vancouver, Vienna, and Warsaw. The new AWS Local Zones will give customers around the world the ability to offer hundreds of millions of end users single-digit millisecond performance for their applications. Using AWS Local Zones, customers outside the U.S. have the ability to meet data residency requirements in regulated sectors like health care and life sciences, financial services, and government. AWS manages and supports Local Zones, meaning customers do not need to incur the expense and effort of procuring, operating, and maintaining infrastructure in various cities to support low-latency applications. Customers can connect to AWS Local Zones through an internet connection or use AWS Direct Connect to route traffic over a private AWS network connection. “The edge of the cloud is expanding and is now becoming available virtually everywhere,” said Prasad Kalyanaraman, Vice President of Infrastructure Services at AWS. “Thousands of AWS customers using U.S.-based AWS Local Zones are able to optimize low-latency applications designed specifically for their industries and the use cases of their customers. With the success of our first Local Zones in 16 U.S. cities, we are expanding to more locations for our customers around the world who have asked for these same capabilities to push the edge of cloud services to new places. AWS Local Zones will now be available in over 30 new locations globally, providing customers with a powerful new capability to leverage cloud services within a few milliseconds of hundreds of millions of end users around the world.” Netflix is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with 214 million paid memberships in over 190 countries for TV series, documentaries, and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. “Netflix is poised to become one of the world’s most prolific producers of visual effects and original animated content. To meet that demand, we are hiring the best artistic talent from all over the world. These artists need specialized hardware and access to petabytes of images to create stunning visual effects and animations,” said Stephen Kowalski, Director of Digital Production Infrastructure Engineering at Netflix. “Historically, artists had specialized machines built for them at their desks; now, we are working to move their workstations to AWS to take advantage of the cloud. In order to provide a good working experience for our artists, they need low latency access to their virtual workstations. AWS Local Zones brings cloud resources closer to our artists and have been a game changer for these applications. By taking advantage of AWS Local Zones, we have migrated a portion of our content creation process to AWS while ensuring an even better experience for artists. We are excited about the expansion of AWS Local Zones globally, which brings cloud resources closer to creators, allowing artists to get to work anywhere in the world and create without boundaries.” Couchbase delivers the modern database for enterprise applications. Developers worldwide choose Couchbase for its advantages in data model flexibility, elastic scalability, performance, and 24x365 availability to build business-critical web, mobile, and IoT applications. “The database is just as critical to edge computing as the infrastructure and network. Apps that are stateful and need to store data require a modern database. And that database needs to be able to operate and synchronize across the entire architecture, not just on a single edge device or endpoint,” said Wayne Carter, Vice President of Engineering at Couchbase. “Couchbase is using AWS Local Zones to provide low latency and single-digit millisecond database access times for applications, ensuring developers’ apps are always available and fast. Using AWS Local Zones, along with Couchbase’s edge computing capabilities, means that our customers are able to store, query, search, and analyze data in real-time with high availability.” Finland-based Supercell is one of the most recognized mobile game developers in the world. Since its founding in 2010, Supercell has brought five chart-topping games to the market: Hay Day, Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Clash Royale, and Brawl Stars. “Our player base has scaled at an incredible pace, and we have relied on AWS to manage our infrastructure and match our growth. We deploy game servers in multiple AWS Regions today to serve our end users globally and evaluate all new Regions as they come online,” said Juho Mäkinen, Lead of Infrastructure and Services at Supercell. “We are also using AWS Local Zones as deployment targets in the U.S., and we are considering additional Local Zones as they become available in order to bring the latency-sensitive portions of game servers closer to more end users.” The FOX Corporation creates and distributes some of the most compelling entertainment, sports, and news content in the industry, through its iconic domestic brands including FOX Entertainment, FOX Sports, FOX News Media, and the network of FOX television stations. “Home to exceptional artists, it’s our mission to find and leverage technology which removes any friction or barrier from the creative process, allowing our storytellers to focus solely on the content, not the way it’s created,” said Christian Kennel, Vice President Post and Production Technology at FOX Entertainment. “With AWS Local Zones in close proximity to our production hubs, shoots, and the famed FOX lot, we’re able to deliver cloud resources directly to our artists, allowing them to craft their vision without the limitations of traditional remote solutions. Creative workflows like editorial, motion graphics, and finishing demand ultra-low latency, and AWS represents the best of breed solution that FOX has come to rely upon. Integrating AWS into the FOX workflow enables us to execute and deploy much faster, taking us closer to the goal of allowing artists to create from the field, the home, or the lot, with seamless access to every resource necessary to create the award-winning content for which FOX is known. Ubitus is a cloud gaming technology leader that offers turnkey solutions to help customers build their cloud game businesses. “Today, we use AWS Local Zones in the U.S. to provide players a consistent, low-latency gameplay experience, and it has transformed the way we deliver service to our customers,” said Wesley Kuo, CEO at Ubitus. “With AWS Local Zones, we can deploy and test clusters of game servers in cities across the world to ensure all customers get a great experience regardless of where they are located. AWS Local Zones is reinforcing Ubitus’s cloud game services, and its expansion to more cities helps us deliver the low-latency gaming experience our customers want and expect.” JackTrip Labs leverages edge computing technologies to bring live music over the internet to patrons everywhere. When performing music over the internet, low audio latency between performers is critical for a smooth experience. “JackTrip is using AWS Local Zones to run low-latency audio servers closer to musicians, enabling musicians to perform live music together over the internet,” said Mike Dickey, CEO at JackTrip Labs. “With the expansion of AWS Local Zones to more than 30 cities around the world, we are able to provide more robust, high-fidelity interactions for more musicians around the world to connect with audiences anywhere.” Edgegap is a leading game hosting service provider focused on delivering the best online experience for players. “Providing the best online experience to our players logging in from all over the world is our competitive advantage. High or unstable latency is detrimental to our end-user experience and ultimately to revenue in gaming,” said Mathieu Duperré, CEO at Edgegap Technologies. “With AWS Local Zones, Edgegap can now deploy even closer to where the players are, elevating their gaming experience to new heights. This means our clients like Die by the Blade game maker, Triple Hill Interactive, can successfully run a one-versus-one global tournament online, or the makers of fast-paced arena shooter Brutal Grounds, Agog, can now provide a fair environment for every gamer anywhere.” JamKazam is proprietary networked music performance software that enables real-time rehearsing, jamming, and performing with musicians at remote locations, overcoming latency. “Playing music live and in sync over the internet requires extremely low latency between musicians. Every millisecond counts,” said Seth Call, Co-founder and Director of Engineering at JamKazam. “AWS Local Zones enable us to offer a solution that lets musicians reliably play with each other with incredibly low latency by providing a ‘shortcut’ path across the internet. Without exaggeration, this is the biggest opportunity for our company in years. It’s a boon to musicians who can stop spending hours traveling and setting up and tearing down gear to instead spend their time rehearsing and jamming anytime in less than five minutes online.” Esports Engine is a turnkey esports solutions company working with gaming publishers, rightsholders, brands, and teams to provide production, broadcast, tournament, and program design. “In gaming production, low latency matters and every millisecond counts. Having high-powered computing available in proximity lets us quickly scale up our productions as needed,” said Ryan Thompson, Co-Founder and Chief Production Officer at Esports Engine. “With AWS Local Zones, we’re able to deploy resources in more geographic locations across our multiple studios. This has been integral to the success of our crew members who are able to access cloud studio servers at such low latency that it almost feels like they’re using a computer locally.” Pre1.com is a leading CRM/ad management software platform for the newspaper industry. “Our clients have typically run their applications on local hardware, but with the advent of COVID and the fast pace of social media environments, the media world had to make a change to keep up,” said Don Bauernfeind, CEO at Pre1.com. “AWS Local Zones provided us with a great solution that we could offer to our clients. We were able to move their applications to the cloud with low latency and high stability. Our clients reduced their local hardware support costs while improving overall operational efficiency. Plus, it has made our life better from a support perspective. We are constantly looking for ways to collaborate with AWS to help us find a win-win for our clients and our team.” Masomo, founded in 2015, is an interactive entertainment company transforming the power of social in mobile games. “We deploy select portions of our latency-sensitive game servers in various locations across the world in order to reach the breadth of our end users with lower latency. Providing end-users with low-latency gameplay is an important part of ensuring fairness and consistent player experience,” said Oğuzhan Yilmaz, CTO at Masomo. “With AWS Local Zones, we get the single-digit millisecond latency and proximity in lots of cities across the country, helping us improve end users’ latency, reduce churn, and provide end users with a great experience.” About Amazon Web Services For over 15 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud offering.
