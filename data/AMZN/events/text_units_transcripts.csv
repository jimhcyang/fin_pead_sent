Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today’s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today, February 2, 2021 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to-date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence, actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity; and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It’s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I will turn the call over to Brian."

I realize that you may have questions about the news which we announced today in our press release, but I would like to begin with some comments on Q4 results, and then we can proceed to your questions. First, I’d like to start by thanking the nearly 1.3 million Amazon employees who have risen to the challenge of serving customers around the world during this pandemic. We are proud that more than 500,000 people chose to take new jobs at Amazon in 2020. We are committed to providing all employees with great jobs, including $15 an hour starting pay in the U.S., health insurance, 401(k) matching, leading parental benefits, and upskilling opportunities. We remain focused on the safety of our employees and delivery partners, particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations in stores as well as the customers shopping in our Whole Foods Market and other stores. Our Q4 results include approximately $4 billion in COVID-related operating costs, including additional employee pay during the holidays. We continue to see productivity headwinds from physical separation and training of new employees and of course investments in PPE for employees and enhanced cleaning for our facilities. This Q4 spend brings our total COVID-related costs for the year to more than $11.5 billion. Our teams worked hard in 2020 to ramp up in-house COVID-19 testing capabilities that are incremental to those already available to the general public. More than 700 employees are now being tested every hour, and globally we have built hundreds of COVID-19 testing sites in two labs. We are encouraging essential employees working at Amazon fulfillment centers, AWS data centers, and Whole Food Market stores across the country to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at the earliest appropriate time. We are also working at the federal and state levels to support the vaccinations of frontline employees and those in the community who are providing essential services throughout the pandemic, including enabling pop up clinics in Washington State and Florida with more on the way. Now some comments on Q4 results. Our fourth-quarter holiday season has always been the busiest time of our year. This year presented additional challenges for our teams as we work to meet strong customer demand, while simultaneously growing our operations’ footprint and welcoming far more new employees than any prior Q4. We welcomed nearly 175,000 new full and part-time employees in Q4 alone. This compares with 50,000 in Q4 of 2019. We also continue to add buildings in our fulfillment and logistics network with square footage growing about 50% year-over-year in 2020. And unlike in a typical year when new buildings are mostly in place by the end of Q3, this year a significant number of them came online in Q4 as our teams pulled out all the stops to be ready for customer demand, and it turns out we needed that capacity in order to fill the strong customer demand in Q4. Revenue for the quarter was $125.6 billion versus our guidance range of $112 billion to $121 billion. You will remember that we kicked off the holiday season early for customers with Prime Day in October versus its usual timing in Q3. We then saw strong seasonal holiday demand through Q4. Our Q4 results also largely reflect the continuation of demand trends we have seen since the early months of the pandemic, particularly as people are staying at home, including for household staples and other home products. We saw sales growth across our major product categories, led by strong Prime member engagement. Prime members continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic began. Prime members also continue to expand their usage of Prime’s digital benefits including Prime Video and Prime Video channels. Amazon Music launched podcast in September and in Q4, Prime members listened to millions of hours of podcasts each month. We’re reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. In Q4, we had another strong quarter that largely reflects the continuation of demand trends from Q3. We saw strong growth in new Prime member sign-ups. As demand remained strong in the quarter, the additional volume leverage helped to achieve higher-than-expected profits. We saw strong order volumes throughout the holiday season with good sales growth not only in our peak sales days, which include Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday, but also throughout the remainder of the quarter. We had good operational performance within our fulfillment centers and transportation network even as we added significant capacity. Third-party sellers also stepped up as never before to serve customers. The 2020 holiday season was the best ever for small and medium-sized businesses selling in our store, with our worldwide sales growing over 50% year-over-year in Q4. Third-party units represented 55% of total paid units during the quarter, the highest 3P unit mix we’ve ever had since we invited businesses to sell on Amazon more than 20 years ago. Lastly, AWS’ efforts were headlined by our Ninth Annual re:Invent Conference. This is the first time in our history that the event was virtual and free. We had over 570,000 registered attendees during the three-weeks-long event. AWS continues to innovate at a rapid clip, announcing more than 180 new services and features at re:Invent across compute, storage, database, machine learning, and more. You can read more about this in our earnings release. The team also announced significant customer momentum with new commitments and migrations from JPMorgan Chase, Thomson Reuters, ViacomCBS, and Twitter just to name a few. We continue to see companies meaningfully growing their plans to move to AWS. In Q4, AWS saw continuation of strong usage and revenue growth. AWS added more revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in any quarter in its history and is now a $51 billion annualized run-rate business supporting millions of active AWS customers. And just as they have all year, sellers, partners, and employees across Amazon stepped up to deliver on unprecedented customer demand, and for this we remain extremely grateful. And today, we announced that our Founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos will transition to the role of Executive Chair in the third quarter this year and that Andy Jassy will become Chief Executive Officer at that time. Those of us who know Andy are excited to see him take on this greater responsibility. He is a visionary leader, a great operator, and he understands what makes Amazon such a special innovative company. We are also excited that Jeff will retain a very important role at the company that he founded and has guided for over 25 years. He has created a culture of invention and innovation that drives us every day, and we remain bound by our common focus and obsession on the customer. With that, let’s move on to Q&A."
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Operator,Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Heath Terry,"Great. Thanks. Just wanted to dig a bit deeper into the incredible acceleration that we saw in the international business, obviously, pandemic aside, wondering if you could help us sort of break down the pieces of what drove that into specific regions, specific initiatives that drove that level of acceleration? And then just on the AWS business, bit more of a housekeeping question, would you mind going through just where the backlog stands and any material drivers of changes in the that to the extent there has been any?"
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure. Thank you, Heath. I would start on international segment results. So yes, it was sequential growth jump from 33% in Q3 to 50% in Q4. Part of that is the timing of Prime Day, but in the U.S. it was less pronounced, sequential growth was 39% to 40% in the North America segment. So, there was something else going on in international in Q4. I would attribute it really to the government actions and lockdowns that we saw, especially in the UK and Europe. I think that increased during the quarter unfortunately for the economy, but it did drive higher sales on our site. We also saw probably a larger impact of moving Prime Day from Q3 to Q4 in international just because it’s a little more nascent there, it’s still ramping up but very strong performance."
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Dave Fildes,"Yes, Heath, this is Dave. On the backlog number, it’s at about $50 billion at the end of the year, the balance and that’s up about 68% year-over-year. So that’s one component of all the great work that AWS is doing, and of course you are seeing some continued very strong growth, strong usage and revenue growth there, $51 billion annualized run-rate business. So, it’s continuing to grow at a meaningfully larger absolute dollar rate than others out there, and we are really pleased with the growth we are seeing in there. It’s as Brian touched on at the opening, just a lot of good engagement and innovation coming out of the re:Invent conference as well."
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Operator,Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Eric Sheridan,"Thanks so much for taking the question. Just following up on some of the comments you made between the release and in your opening comments, Brian, wanted to know if we could tease out how we should be thinking about the level of investments that are needed between the mix of fulfillment versus where you want to go on the customer service side and the logistics and delivery side as you look up to ‘21. And obviously, it’s going to be a very different year in ‘21 than what we saw in ‘20, where you saw a surge in demand and a lot of capacity constraints that have opened up as the year goes on. And there will be sort of tougher comp dynamics as you get into the middle of ‘21 as you are lapping against that demand impact in ‘21? How do we think about the levels of investment you will make, where those investments are going to go, and what that means for sort of confidence on the demand side over the medium to long-term? Thanks so much."
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure, Eric. Obviously, we had a large investment last year, crew fulfillment capacity, including transportation 50% year-over-year. I would say that – and it’s been, I believe it’s $44 billion on CapEx, yes. We are still working through our plans for 2021. I think the added complexity here is the range of outcomes certainly was the case in 2020, but even for 2021, there is a lot of question as to the continuation of COVID conditions comping against prior year sales, sometimes there are things in there that definitely wouldn’t repeat probably the number of gloves we sold and hand lights [ph] and things like that or computer monitors that people setup their home offices. But there is also a lot of people who engage more strongly with Prime benefits in 2020, and we think that will have a lasting impact both from purchase frequency, amount they purchased, use of digital benefits, etcetera. So, we are going to have to build probably for multiple scenarios, and in this FC [ph] world, it’s hard to turn that capacity on quickly. So, it generally means you may have to overbuild to protect the customer experience. On transportation, we made large investments in our transportation network in 2020. That work is not done yet. We have a lot of continued expansion. So, we see that over definitely through 2021. I can’t quantify it right now only – I am only giving guidance through Q1 right now, and we are still working some -- through some of the plans as we do this time of the year. And then infrastructure will remain a healthy part of our investment as well. We are supporting an AWS business that is growing at a rapid clip both in usage and in revenue. We are expanding regions globally and have a lot of upside in that area talking with customers on their transition plans to the cloud. So, we definitely do not want to run out of capacity, and we work to not do that. So, there could be a risk of forward spend in 2021 due to the uncertainty, but we will see as we move through the year."
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Operator,"Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Doug, your line is open. Please proceed with your question."
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Doug Anmuth,"Sorry, I was muted. Brian, hoping you could talk more about the importance of AMZL Amazon Logistics during the holiday season. If you could talk more about percentage of packages perhaps shipped from your fulfillment centers and then where this can go in coming years? And then also a quick comment on the COVID costs, you mentioned $2 billion in 1Q, just curious how you think about it more on a full year basis with some of the puts and takes can be there? Thanks."
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Yes. So yes, for the full year, we are again $11.5 billion was our gross cost for 2020, $4 billion of that in Q4. We see a step down to closer to $2 billion in Q1 that compares with a $600 million spend last Q1 as the pandemic just started and we started to react in March. And obviously, this cost escalated in Q2 and Q3. So, if we look at the core components of that, right, there is productivity that – productivity drags from hiring so many new employees and also having physical separation. That gets better all the time. It was exasperated a bit in Q4, because of all the new hires that we brought on over 170,000 new people that should moderate. That’s why one of the reasons that we see a step down in Q1 versus Q4, it’s volume-related and also mix of employees. After that, we are going to have to see again hopefully the vaccine gets going, everyone gets vaccinated and we return to normalcy. That would be very helpful on a lot fronts for everybody. And if not there will be continuation of some of these costs. I will say that, while we are very transparent or try to be on the costs that we are seeing, specifically around COVID, there are some positive things happening as that counteract a bit of that and not the least of which is the top line volume in 2020, we grew 37% on an FX neutral basis versus growing 22% in 2019. And the fact that we have been running pretty full out since arguably April, but definitely it’s May, has created operating efficiencies of its own that counterbalance the physical separation and the training of new employees. So there is a lot of moving parts in here. We are able to save about $1 billion in transportation costs this year – excuse me in 2020 as for universally, all travel was shutdown and our sales teams found new ways to reach customers. We will see how that develops over time. Marketing, although it got back to probably more healthy levels in Q3 and Q4 definitely was lower in Q2 as we work through some capacity issues and it wasn’t fruitful to invest in marketing when you are having trouble hitting existing customer demand. So, there are a lot of moving parts that I will try and be as transparent on as I can be during the quarter and this again Q1 is we are seeing about $2 billion of absolute COVID costs. And Dave can take the AMZL question."
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Dave Fildes,"Yes. Just as we talk about AMZL, Amazon Logistics, right, that’s where you think about that in terms of facilities, it’s a lot of the middle mile and the last mile elements that are under our management and control. And so you are talking about centers at the middle mile delivery station to the last mile. We have talked on a square footage basis 2020 was a big build year for us. Our footprint grew around 50%, about half of that incremental square footage fit into that sort of AMZL transportation side of the equation, which is a higher mix than what you have seen of any incremental adds in a year. It’s higher mix being 50:50 than what you see from us in the past. So, a lot of focus on that there both because of the desire to pre-pandemic increase the one day delivery capabilities for Prime members. That also as we have moved through this year, it gives us a little bit more or much more certainty on being able to get items from point A to point B. So we finished here where now more than half our packages, both U.S. and worldwide are handled through AMZL and a lot of work going into that. And so, we will look to expand and continue to build on that with our AMZL offerings. But as we have said in the past, our delivery partners, independent delivery partners that are out there, the USPS is certainly oversees carriers as well, are an important part of that and they will continue to help us scale that up and build up that offering and make it better."
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Operator,Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,John Blackledge,"Great. Thank you. Two questions. First, the other revenue line saw significant acceleration in 4Q, just curious if you can talk about or provide some further color on the advertiser demand that you saw in the fourth quarter? And then secondly on grocery was a big driver for Amazon in 2020 just general thoughts on grocery and I think you mentioned in the release, 7 communities rolled out Amazon Fresh grocery stores, how are they performing and should we expect a broader rollout?"
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure, John. Let me start with the other revenue question. Yes, we saw strength in other revenue grew 64% in Q4 versus 49% in Q3 and 41% in Q2 that is primarily advertising. That’s the majority of it. I would say that there has been a recovery, in advertising spend as the year progressed. The fact that we moved Prime Day into Q4 has an impact here, because again it carries a lot of clicks and eyeballs into Q4 for this time period. But I want to highlight a lot of great work being done by the advertising team. Their main principle is to help sellers, vendors, authors, publishers and partners use our tools, navigate them as fluidly as possible, and add value both for them and for our customers – and customers and get to see and find and discover new and different products. There is some things that are adding to the efficiency of advertising. We are now using a deep learning model to show more relevant sponsored products and had success with that. We are improving the relevancy of ads shown on the product detail pages all the time. And we have seen rapid adoption of video creative format for sponsored brands. All these things help checkup the conversion and the productivity of the advertising both for the seller or vendor involved and also for Amazon and makes it more productive experience with the customer as well."
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Dave Fildes,"John, on the grocery point, yes, we have got a couple of different formats, I think there is the Go Grocery has a couple of locations open and off to a good start, lot of interest in those and the technology that those offer as well as the Amazon Fresh locations. So we are at about 8 locations open and I think in the neighborhood of about half dozen locations are confirmed at open, so more to come on those. There is other kind of tangents of footprints on that, the Go stores, there is around 25 of those that are out there and that also important part of that is food. So, you see us it’s we have talked about this a bit in the past is we are doing that with online grocery and branching out from Whole Foods and some of the other physical footprint locations and being able to offer that convenience, but we also think that being able to offer some innovative physical store grocery offerings like these Go and Fresh, some of which have some pretty cool self-checkout capabilities and implement some of the Just Walk Out technology qualities are really some interesting areas that are resonating with customers. I think they appreciate that not just in times of maybe not wanting to have physical contact with everyone in the store, but just even beyond that, the general convenience of being able to move throughout the store and check out more efficiently than you otherwise would in a traditional retail environment, so excited to do more on that front."

AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, I would be curious to hear about any of the learnings you had from the strength of the international business in 2020 and how you think about the right types of investments to make in that business in ‘21 and beyond to ensure you retain as many of these users and wallets as you’ve gained throughout 2020? And the second one understanding the comments, Brian, earlier about sort of investments going forward, maybe just talk to us a little bit about one-day. Are these investments you are making, could they get you back to a one-day product in later part this year or in ‘22 when the world normalizes or are these assets you are putting in place now not able to be deployed from a one day perspective when overall e-commerce slows down a little bit?"
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure, Brian. Let me start with your international question. I think the biggest learning is that if we can move 2021 volume into 2020, it creates good leverage for us and it’s kind of what we saw. There was essentially a doubling of the growth rate versus probably the going in time – rate for 2020. Now again, that was a very hard volume because of the COVID restrictions and issues with our workforce, keeping our workforce safe and everything else, but I think what you saw was some very high leverage on that model that overcame some of the more fixed costs that we’re seeing in the Prime benefits. So we pre-invested, as we have discussed in the past, in things like video and devices and other elements of the Prime offering, now grocery, you’re starting to see. And we have added those Prime benefits ahead of probably the curve that you would have seen in North America. So that has always created a bit of a drag on operating income, that as well as investments in new geographies, the investment in India, the investment that we’ve made over the last two or three years that are in places like the Middle East, Turkey, Brazil, Australia, most recently, Sweden and the Netherlands in 2020. So there’s a lot of moving parts in the international segment. But you’re starting to see the benefit of the higher volumes and with it, higher advertising as well that we expected and we expect over-time. And we’ll see the growth rate is going to have the same challenges year-over-year that perhaps we’ll see in North America we’re going to have a race between lapping things that may have been one-time in nature in 2020 versus accelerating Prime membership and Prime members’ purchases, purchase frequency and adoption of digital benefits. So we will see what that looks like in 2021, very happy with the performance in 2020 and really hats off to the teams in many countries around the world who are all dealing with the same issues that we were in North America."
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Dave Fildes,"And I know this is a bit of an offshoot, but I just think it’s worth mentioning it fits in the AWS business, but we’re continuing to see strong growth from AWS around the world as well. And there is a number of international located customers out there like MercadoLibre and Zalando and others that we’ve listed in there that are great customers for us. So we’re working on that and really looking to support that just globally. And I mentioned this before, but re:Invent, it was a great way to bring a lot of those folks from around the world together virtually and free. And typically, we’ve recorded the revenue for re:Invent from ticket sales and sponsorships. If you account for this COVID anomaly this year of it being virtual and free, AWS year-over-year revenue growth, if you look at it, actually accelerated adjusting for that from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So a lot of fun innovation, good innovation coming out of that event that we’re excited to talk more with customers about."
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"And then your question on one-day, I believe it was whether our investments will be consistent with establishing higher and higher levels of one-day. Yes, definitely. And we’ve been doing that throughout the year and it’s been getting better. In fact, we had a lot of examples of deliveries right up to the last minute on December 24 in the United States for holiday gifts. So the one-day has been getting better, and it’s – the issues in 2020 was essentially around capacity and volume and getting things at the door and being able to then hit a shortened time period. So it wasn’t that we were delaying or slowing down the shipment itself, it was the time taken to get through the warehouse and handle backlog of demand. So as the year progressed, we did see that get better and better. We do forecast that it will get better. I’m not quantifying this for you. I realize that. But I think you can generally notice wherever you’re particularly are, whatever geography you are, some cities are back probably to one-day levels that they saw or even better pre-pandemic. Other areas that may have other dynamic issues are still working their way out of backlogs and volume issues. But when the dust settles and as we open up more and more capacity, you’ll see greater and greater one-day percentages for our Prime shipments."

I think Jeff Wilke is also retiring. Can you talk a little bit if you expect any changes to Amazon, how we should think about that? And then maybe Dave Clark is taking over retail. Talk a little bit about that. And then secondly, obviously, the backlog is really strong in AWS, up 68%. The margins did come down a little bit quarter-over-quarter to 28%. Can you talk about the deals, how pricing is in the cloud segment? Is it remaining robust and any reason the margins came down a little bit quarter-over-quarter? Thank you."
AMZN,2021-02-02,2021-02-03,,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2021-02-02,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure, Justin. Let me start with your comments on the CEO transition and then the Consumer CEO transition. I think they’re both examples of what are highly effective succession planning processes at Amazon. The Board of Directors obviously takes that very seriously. It is an annual discussion and probably more often on succession plans, development of key executives, expanding the number of key executives, etcetera. And you see the byproduct of that as we expand the S team as we, 5 years ago, set up the two-CEO structure where Jeff Wilke was CEO of Consumer and Andy Jassy was CEO of AWS. We have strong single-thread leaders on devices, Amazon or – Video, including Amazon Studios, Advertising. So I think there’s a lot of bench strength within Amazon and generally, we do try and push the decisions down in the organization as we scale, especially internationally as we try and do things consistently globally, but recognize local differences in our model. So having said all that, succession planning is super important. The example you saw with Jeff Wilke, Jeff announced in the fall that he was stepping down to pursue some other goals and interest that he has outside of Amazon. He had been here over 20 years, had been super pivotal in our development of our consumer business, our culture, the development of layers and layers of leaders. And one of them was Dave Clark, who has, over the last 5 plus years, really been charged with developing some very fundamental things for our Company, the expansion of the fulfillment center network, the expansion and creation of our transportation capacity, grocery delivery and the grocery plan, a lot of other things. But Dave had been great leader in his own right. So when Dave – or, excuse me, when Jeff Wilke decided to retire in the fall, it was a natural transition to Dave Clark. And that just occurred in January, and they’re wrapping things up in the next month. So that’s a successful example of succession planning and a successful transition. Same thing for Jeff Bezos’ role and I will reiterate that Jeff is not leaving. He is getting a new job. He’s going to be Executive Chair of the Board, super important role. The Board is super active and important in Amazon’s success story. And Andy has been here since 1997. He is not only a visionary leader. He is a strong operator as I said and he has got a great track record of developing multiple things and businesses within Amazon, not the least of which is AWS, which is arguably the most profitable, important technology company in the world. So that’s just a flavor on the insight on how it works. We’re very happy to see both Jeff and Andy get new perspectives. So Andy has a chance to put his imprint on Amazon. He is certainly going to carry through the culture and the vision and the invention factory that Amazon is and will take that to the next level. Jeff will be the Executive Chairman of the Board. He will be involved in many large one-way-door issues, as we say, one-way doors, meaning the more important decisions, things like acquisitions, things like strategies and going into grocery and other things. So Jeff’s always been involved with that, and that’s where we will keep his time focused on – or he will keep his time focused on in his new role, so very excited all around to see the ability to have a strong transition to Andy in Q3. We will be working on backfilling the AWS role and we will talk more about that in the future, but for now, today is about Andy and Jeff Bezos."

The factors we’ve talked about in the past continue to be in play. We’re improving infrastructure planning to meet the capacity needs, given the growth we’re seeing. More broadly, our results reflect that balance between the investing, the price reductions, driving cost efficiencies and the margins are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on those factors to the extent we are investing in new regions and some other elements. A few discrete things that aren’t probably new but just to call out, the driver of the reduced impact from the change in the useful life of the servers. As you recall, we amended the server useful life at the beginning of the year from 3 to 4 years, and so we saw some benefit to the AWS margins and the broader margins in total. When we look at that, the impact does diminish throughout this year. So when we increased it beginning in January, the benefit from this change in Q4 was about $538 million. That’s down from $634 million in Q3. So that gives you some sense of it’s coming down. That’s the total amount that’s allocated amongst the segments, but the majority of those figures I just gave do relate to AWS because significance of the server assets going to that segment. And again, that impact’s going to continue to taper down over time for example into Q1 of 2021. One other element is just FX impact. That’s always going to hit us to some degree, but AWS customer billings are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. The cost, though, if you think about it, many of the costs are going to be for build-out in local currency for data centers and the people that work there and power and what have you, so there’s a bit of a foreign exchange difference there. And that happens to be this time around a little bit bigger. We saw an unfavorable impact of about $96 million to the AWS margin this time around for FX, so just another point to call out there. You mentioned the backlog, too. Look, I think that’s one data point amongst many as you look at AWS, but I think we’re really encouraged by just general large enterprise business adoption is continuing to do well as they are choosing AWS as a tech provider and speeding up innovations. You saw a long list of the many companies that we have announced arrangements within the past 90 days, so really excited to continue to build onto that."

This is one of the few lines that’s kind of variable and kind of increasing a little bit faster than the other fixed costs. And Dave, you mentioned that over half the orders are now going through Amazon Logistics worldwide. When do you expect that rate of inflation per order to level out a little bit because of these efforts? And if you look at the cost curve in places like the UK where – or in London, where you have well over half on your own last-mile delivery, are you starting to see leverage there? Any comments on that? And thanks a lot."

I think it’s not – I won’t give a forward kind of guidance mix or what that levels-off like. Some of the step-up in costs and disparity or the bigger gap, I should say, versus the unit growth rates that you’re seeing there, there’s a few factors. But I think this is Q4. We did add on a lot of new capacity as I said. It came on later in the year into Q4. More of it was in kind of that transportation arm and so the costs associated with that would be going to that trans cost piece. So that’s one of the factors, along with the fact that we’re continuing to try where we can to focus on improving one-day. And that varies region to region with all the kind of challenges of COVID that have gone on this year. But that’s a goal of ours, is to get back to where we were in terms of one-day unit mix and continue to build onto that. So that’ll be something to keep an eye on as we move into 2021."

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020.  Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 29, 2021 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.  During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.  This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity; workforce staffing and productivity; and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain.  Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  And now, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Before we get to Q&A, I will touch upon a few highlights from the first quarter of the year. Let me start by highlighting the momentum we are seeing in AWS. In the first quarter, AWS revenue growth accelerated across a broad range of customers. During COVID, we've seen many enterprises decide that they no longer want to manage their own technology infrastructure. They see that partnering with AWS and moving to the cloud gives them better cost, better capability and better speed of innovation. We expect this trend to continue as we move into the post-pandemic recovery.  There's significant momentum around the world, including broad and deep engagement across major industries. For example, last quarter, we announced new commitments and migrations from some of the world's most renowned sports leagues, the National Hockey League, the PGA Tour, Formula 1 and the German Bundesliga.  We continue to expand our AWS infrastructure footprint to support the strong growth we're seeing. AWS offers 80 availability zones across 25 geographic regions around the world. And we've announced plans to launch 15 more availability zones in five more regions. Turning to the consumer business, we continue to see strong customer demand globally in the first quarter. Revenue growth in our international segment grew 50% on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year in Q1 as restrictive regional and national lockdowns were in place throughout the quarter, particularly in the UK and Europe. In North America, revenue growth of 39%, largely reflects the continuation of demand trends that we have seen since the early months of the pandemic. Third-party sellers were largely comprised of small- and medium-sized businesses, continue to see strong sales and serve more customers. Our 3P seller services revenue increased 60% on an FX-neutral basis year-over-year in the first quarter, growing significantly faster than online stores revenue. Third-party units represented 55% of our total paid units in Q1, up from 52% in Q1 of last year.  Prime members also continue to shop with greater frequency and across more categories than before the pandemic. These trends have also extended to Prime's digital benefits. Over the past 12 months, Prime Video streaming hours were up over 70% year-over-year. Amazon Studio had its best award season yet, and Prime members can look forward to a strong slate of upcoming original series and films featuring an impressive group of diverse talent and creators. We're also continuing to expand our roster of live sports content, and we're excited to partner with the NFL and be the exclusive home of NFL Thursday Night Football into the next decade.  Twitch is also seeing great momentum. Hours watched on Twitch nearly doubled year-over-year in the first quarter, and we now average more than 35 million daily visitors. Another popular benefit of Prime membership is Prime Day, and we are excited to announce that we will hold the two-day savings event during the second quarter. Prime Day is also a great opportunity for our selling partners to reach more customers, and will make supporting small businesses a big focus again this year. We'll have more to share on Prime Day, including the event dates a bit later this quarter. We continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees. In the U.S., Amazon has held on-site vaccination events in 29 states, reaching more than 300,000 frontline employees and contractors. We are watching events closely in Europe and in particular, India, where we have put in place employee initiatives, from medical health lines, teleconsulting, hotel rooms for quarantining and financial support, as well as donating 100 ICU ventilator units to local hospitals. We'll continue to invest in the health and safety of our employees and delivery partners, particularly in our global fulfillment and logistics operations.  And finally, to summarize our financial results. Total revenue of $108.5 billion came in above the guidance range of $100 billion to $106 billion. In addition to our strong segment results, advertising revenue within the North America and international segments also accelerated during the quarter. The leverage we are seeing on this higher revenue, combined with strong operational performance led to higher operating income as well.  Operating income of $8.9 billion in Q1 was above our guidance range of $3 billion to $6.5 billion. We incurred a little less than the $2 billion in COVID-19-related operating costs that we had projected in the first quarter. We continue to incur these costs across our global fulfillment network as we maintain social distancing measures, which impacts our productivity and as we make direct investments in employee safety. Looking ahead, we expect to incur approximately $1.5 billion in COVID-19-related operating costs in the second quarter.  Lastly, I'd like to congratulate and thank our employees for making Amazon #1 in the U.S. on LinkedIn's 2021 top companies ranking, an annual list identifying the most sought-after places to work. We appreciate the customer obsession and passion for innovation from teams across the company to make Amazon a great place to work. With that, let's move on to Q&A."

So you guys are investing pretty aggressively to build out that Amazon control last-mile fulfillment. We see the blue vans driving around everywhere in the Bay Area, so congrats on that. So I guess the question is, how long until you feel like if that's in the right place as far as all your major metros where you want to set that up. And at what stage, does the unit cost of shipping start to improve from these initiatives? And I guess, high level, is controlling the last mile allowing you to further penetrate or gain market share in certain categories where speedy delivery is of the essence. Can you talk about that, please? Thank you."
AMZN,2021-04-29,2021-04-30,,2021-04-29,2021-04-29T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-04-29,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Ross, thanks for your questions. Yes, let me start with last mile in general. So we're investing heavily. We talked about it last year, our fulfillment, including Amazon Logistics investment, we increased our capacity by 50%. And you can see from our CapEx numbers, the CapEx, including infrastructure, of course, increased to 80% in the trailing 12 months over the prior trailing 12 months. So certainly, a large area of investment, not only fulfillment centers, but also two elements of transportation, what we call the middle mile where we're putting sort centers, Amazon Air, line haul, trailers, think of all the intermediate movements between our warehouses and our final delivery stations. And then that last mile was just delivery stations, DSP and seeing our delivery service partners as well.  So you talked about costs. We actually think our cost right now is very competitive with our external options, and we measure that very closely. It certainly gets better with demand and amortization and route density, et cetera. But we see, which is very helpful, is the ability to control the whole flow of products from the warehouse to the end customer. Its churn would -- normally was a batch process where we would hand off a large batch of orders to a third-party once a day, let's say, to a continuous flow process, where we continually have orders leaving our warehouses five, six times a day going through middle mile and then to final delivery, either through our AMZL drivers or DSP partners.  So that gives us a lot of ability not only to control the flow of the product, but also flow of information. We're seeing a lot of progress in that area. And I think you'll see it, too, as a customer where you're starting to get more precise estimates of delivery. You'll get notes that say, hey, you're eight stops away from your delivery, et cetera. Because everyone's busy. A big part of delivery is actually being there sometimes when you need to get -- be there for the delivery. Other times, Of course, you can just have it put on your doorstep and get to it later. But that's -- we see a lot of benefit from that. We also see that there's a lot of cutoff times that we can extend, again, because we pretty much have perfect information between the order placement allocation to warehouses where we're going to pick and box up the product and send it on its way. So lots of advantages. We are continuing to invest, and we'll see a large investment in this area through 2021 as well.  We do think that it may also spill to 2022. That should set us up in really good stead with our capacity. And already, the majority of our units are going through AMZL today."

Just to add to that, Ryan touched upon it, but there are an important part of this last-mile effort has been the program we've had, the -- Brian called this -- mentioned the delivery services partner program, or the DSP, it's an important part of the last-mile network. And that -- just as a reminder, that employs more than 100,000 drivers, and it's been growing for the past few years. And it's really -- it's a program with an incentive for those folks to become small business owners and start their own package delivery business. So it's a great way for those folks to access the delivery technology and the package volumes we have and tapping on the network. And we've got a lot of really cool elements as part of that program, grant programs to support entrepreneurs and minority groups and really help them build out and helps us support a diverse business community as well."

And there have been a lot of questions about the incredible backlog strength you've seen in the last several quarters, and it finally seems that you're seeing the conversions between that backlog growth and now revenue growth accelerating. If you could just comment a little more on that conversion and how you expect it to trend? Thank you."

I think it's -- the backlog growth, just to give you the figures for March 31, it's $52.9 billion. The weighted average life is about where we've been for the past several quarters, so about -- a little over three years in terms of the weighted average remaining life. So that's up about 55% right now. So it really continues to be really strong and really pleased with that. I think that's backlog figures, but also just the revenue growth and the momentum we're seeing in here is a lot of hard work and innovation on the teams and growing teams and reaching out and working with those. And so you can expect to continue to see customers making these long-term commitments. We think it's a representation you think of a lot of companies that have worked with us, been engaged with us, been with us. And as they get better comfort line of sight with what they want to do and as we are able to add even more value and services, it's just a great partnership and a relationship that they want to build with us over those multi-year periods."

First, Brian, you touch upon this a little bit in your prepared remarks about the acceleration in international growth. Can you maybe just speak to the drivers there? And in, particularly in markets where COVID is no longer a major issue, have you seen any particular declines or maybe just slowdown in e-commerce demand or a decline in growth? It seems like they're going in different directions in Europe, for instance, it seems like the -- a lot of these markets are still very much under lockdown, yet your international business has grown pretty significantly. I don't know if there is positive or negative correlation. Thanks."

Yes, I would say we're seeing strength pretty much across the board in international. And it does vary by country. But if you just step back a minute, on an - even on an FX-neutral basis, we grew 50% in the quarter. We grew 50% last quarter, although that's aided by the fact that Prime Day was in Q4 this year. But if you look at the growth rate prior to COVID and post-COVID, in the international segment, on a -- even on an FX-neutral basis, has been tripling their prior growth rate in revenue anyway. So very strong and probably advancement of the model in a lot of countries by a year or more. And we're really pleased that we've been able to show our value to those customers, not only with our shipments and our ability to deliver and get them what they need to survive in homes in place during the pandemic, but also the strength that we've seen in the digital offering and the adoption of video, music, our devices. So it's really -- and we're forward investing, as you know, in that, in international with a lot of those Prime benefits. So it's really -- it's good to see as the underlying consumer shipping business, part of it grows, that we're still seeing healthy engagement and growing engagement. So I don't have a downside case yet. In fact, surprised a bit by the growth. I don't think we normally would have forecasted 50% growth in Q1. And certainly stressing our operations. But I would -- my hat's off to the operations team, they handled the volumes in Q1 very efficiently. Costs were very much under control. We started to see strong leverage of our fixed assets, especially our fulfillment center and transportation assets."

And just these aren't big contributors by any means to the growth numbers Brian was talking about. But I think along with those efforts in countries we've been in for some period of time. We're continuing to open up new regions. If you look back, Poland recently opened up in March, Sweden opened up in the fourth quarter of last year. And even in some regions that we've been in for a few years, places like Turkey, we launched Prime in the back half of last year. So there's a lot of good effort and thought going into -- by the teams to continue kind of taking what we're learning in each of these geographies and feeding it back into a local presence to take advantage of everything we've learned with Prime and the broader consumer-facing experience."

Just wondering how -- what the consumer behavior has been post -- is it proving to be sticky? And just kind of zooming out, talking about grocery broadly, how the fresh store's performed?"

I think people really value the ability to get home delivery. And we've seen that as numbers go up considerably pre and post-pandemic. So -- but we've also worked very hard to increase our capacity during that time period. In the United States, we're delivering out of our Whole Foods stores, and we've engaged -- we'll be allowed to pick up a greater expansion of pickup at Whole Foods stores. Amazon Fresh became a free Prime benefit, as you know, in the late part of 2019. And customers really adopted it and continue to see strong growth. So I think on the fresh stores, it's a little too early. The stores themselves, we're confident that the Just Walk Out technology that will be a boon, a benefit to customers. And we're very excited about what's in the works, but that's still really early in day 1."

Could you just discuss demand levels you're seeing on the e-commerce side, and just other kind of key drivers of strong expected revenue growth in the second quarter. And then on the advertising business, if you can just talk about some of the key drivers of the acceleration. I think it, it feels like it's maybe the third quarter in a row of acceleration. So what's kind of driving that? And how should we think about the trajectory for the business as we round through the year?"
AMZN,2021-04-29,2021-04-30,,2021-04-29,2021-04-29T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-04-29,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure, John. Let me start with your second question on advertising. So certainly, traffic has been a large driver of what we're seeing in the advertising space. But it discounts kind of the improvement that we're also seeing, relevancy and new products that the team is, has been rolling out, that the customers also enjoy. So I think the advertising team's done a great job of turning clicks into productive sales, and the advertising that results is valuable to us as well. We're using new deep learning models to show more relevant sponsored products. We continue to improve the relevancy of the ads being shown on the product detail pages. And we've seen rapid adoption of the video creative format for sponsored brands, among other things. So you're seeing a little bit more than just traffic. And again, very pleased with the performance of that team and of the receptiveness of our customers, our vendors, our authors and sellers to our advertising products. We think it's also very valuable for consumers as well, helping them find things more easily and discover new brands. On Q2 guidance, yes, I would say, we are projecting, again, continued strength across all of our segments. We -- I will remind you that Prime Day has been scheduled for later in Q2, and we'll have more on that as the quarter unfolds. So that's a consideration as well."

Can you tell us at all just in terms of quantifying or just how you're thinking about the contribution within that 2Q guidance? And then also just on the rationale for timing, given historically in 3Q, we moved to 4Q last year and then now in 2Q. And then hoping you could also just talk about the Thursday Night Football deal, the strategy there, how that drives engagement and strengthens the ecosystem and also what it needs for ad dollars for you."

I think there's some pretty good estimates out there that you probably can leverage. But other than to say it's contemplated in this guidance. On the timing, last year, we had intended to hold Prime Day earlier. We -- there are a number of factors, the Olympics, which are still out there this year. In fact, in some -- many areas, July is a big vacation month. So it might be better to have -- for customers, sellers and vendors to experiment with a different time period. We experimented the other way, obviously, in 2020 by moving it into October, but we believe that it might be a better timing later in Q2. So that's what we're testing this year. On Thursday Night Football, I would say just -- I'm not sure I could size the advertising opportunity right now. But we're very excited to have the exclusive content for Thursday Night Football. Of course, we've broadcast Thursday Night Football for a number of years now, shared that responsibility with a lot of other partners. We think we can do some really new and innovative things with that -- with those games, with the NFL, and we're looking forward to kicking that off in earnest."

First on the AWS acceleration, was that at all related to transaction volumes coming back for maybe more cyclical sectors? And could 2Q see even more of that? And then secondly, I think in your release, you talked about 175 million Prime members watching video. It's about 7 of 8 users. So just wondering what you see is the effect on your retail business from that? Any updates you could provide on content spending. And how you think about Prime Video as a driver for overall Amazon."
AMZN,2021-04-29,2021-04-30,,2021-04-29,2021-04-29T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-04-29,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"So let me start on the AWS acceleration. We wouldn't point to any particular customer group. We're seeing great usage and expansion across a number of industries and a number of types of customers from startups all the way to enterprises. To put it little bit in perspective for you, in Q1 of 2019, we were at $31 billion run rate. By last year, we had increased that to $41 billion revenue run rate, which is a 32% increase. This year, we're up to a $54 billion annualized run rate, which is, while also a 32% year-over-year growth, it added $13 billion of revenue in the last 12 months as opposed to $10 billion prior -- $10 billion in the prior 12 months before that. So the percentages can be a little deceiving. I would encourage you to look at the absolute dollar growth, although both were very strong in this quarter. So we are seeing, again, strength across the board. We have firm confidence that we offer a lot of advantages to AWS customers from functionality to a vibrant and robust partner ecosystem. And then really, we also have less downtime and better security, which I think is super important to all of our customers, especially security nowadays. So that's on AWS. On -- Dave, why don't you pick up the..."

Just in terms of strategy, I think there's probably nothing new or surprising, but just to reiterate it, we look at Prime Video as a component of the broader Prime membership and making sure it's driving adoption and retention as it is. It's a significant acquisition channel in Prime countries. And that we look at it and see that members who watch video have higher free trial conversion rates, higher renewal rates, higher overall engagement. And there's great examples of places like Brazil, where you launch a video-only subscription, for example, that preceded the broader Prime membership with shipping components, and that was, as an example, a great way to expose people to Amazon. And as we launched the broader Prime in Brazil, it was a great mechanism to folks into that program. So a lot of, kind of different experiences there. But as the -- as Jeff's quote would indicate, a lot more people are continuing to enjoy it. And I think the studios team has done a great job, really striving to be the best home for talent, getting a lot of diverse artists and filmmakers and, I think folks are noticing that both critically, but of course, just in terms of viewership, a lot of good momentum there. Just in terms of spend, just to say we continue to expect to grow that on an absolute basis and invest in that beyond original content. Brian talked about live sports and a lot of the great opportunities that feed into that, too. So a lot of continued excitement there."

You guys have done such a great job building out your network and sort of providing consumers with access to so many categories of goods. Give us a couple of examples of areas where you see room for improvement? What areas are you most focused on when you look across all the categories, delivery experience, the countries to invest in and innovate, to really improve the consumer offering? That's one. And then secondly, can you just talk to us about sort of what you've learned about the Echo journey, areas where you've had success, and still existing opportunities for Echo to have a larger installed base and just more of an impact on the ecosystem."
AMZN,2021-04-29,2021-04-30,,2021-04-29,2021-04-29T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-04-29,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure. Thanks, Brian, for your questions. There's always a lot of areas that we're working to improve upon. I think generally, the speed of innovation is very quick at Amazon, but we always want it to be quicker. And we always want it to be globally consistent, and we want to take the best practices from 1 country to make sure we're doing it the same way everywhere. I think currently on our list right now is that we are in the process of getting our 1-day shipment percentages back up to where they were pre-pandemic. We're there in Europe, and we're starting to see in Europe not only strong 1-day, but also more broad, same-day selection, so they tend to go hand-in-hand. In the U.S., we've made improvements or consistently getting better. I would say the end delivery is really a function of everything before it, and how well we can handle and process in a timely manner all the orders in North America. It's been challenged by the volumes, but it's also been challenged by the rapid expansion of space. But we're making progress nonetheless, and we hope to get that even higher in 2021. We're very excited about the adoption of our Prime benefits pretty much across the board, especially with the digital benefits. We are looking forward to some new content, even though we're very happy with the performance, the studios business and the content and awards that they were nominated for and were able to garner this year. We have some big things on the horizon, including Lord of the Rings, and we're very excited about getting that type of content to our Prime members quicker."

And then just on your question on kind of Echo and if I could take it up a level, really broadly, Alexa and devices. Our goal with that has just been -- continues to be to make customers' lives easier and really more convenient. And we want to continue to bring more hardware choices in that case, but also make Alexa smarter with new features. As we talked about before, advances in AI and machine learning, and really deliver tools that help developers and the makers of those devices build for and with Alexa, because in that community, it's not just our Echo devices, but also a variety of third-party device manufacturers. We've seen a lot of momentum with smart home capabilities and working with them. And so -- and I think with us, with so many other areas, it's about making sure we're maintaining a really high bar, and a lot of that with that type of technology is speech recognition capabilities, the intelligence behind it and getting smarter. And some of that becomes a responsibility that customers have higher and higher expectations for their capabilities, something like Alexa, and that's great. And I think if we just look back over the last 12 months and what's been going on, the role that customer usage has played with Alexa and the behavior there, you've seen, as people have been isolated or unable to be as mobile, you see customers are using Alexa to help them stay connected with loved ones. We're seeing customers using Alexa to help stay healthy. So whether that's interacting with health-related tips or fitness apps or increased usage of the Fire TV, and they're looking to Alexa for information. And so using our devices and the services and the Alexa-enabled services for things like educational apps. And then, of course, part of that, too, is making sure they stay entertained when they're trapped or cooped up and don't have other access. So I think you can just see in that example a lot of really good utility, and it just, I think, encourages our teams to strive even harder to serve customers, given when you see those types of examples and how they resonate with customers."

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 29,2021, only, and will include Forward-looking statements.  Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors. detailed in our filings with the SEC.  This guidance also reflects our estimates to-date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce, staffing, and productivity; and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain.  Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I will turn the call over to Brian."

Before we get to Q&A, I'd like to first thank all of our Prime members, our vendors, our 3P sellers, and my Amazon colleagues, especially the Worldwide Ops team, for a record-breaking Prime Day in June. Third-party sellers, who are mostly comprised of small- and medium-sized businesses, were a big contributor to Prime Day 's success. The Prime Day event was the biggest two-day period ever for these SMBs in our stores, and our 3P revenue continued to grow significantly faster than our online stores revenue.  Third-party units represented 56% of our total paid units in Q2, up from a 53% mix one year ago. Our second quarter net sales were $113 billion or at about the midpoint of our guidance range. That’s a year-over-year increase of 27% or 24% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and included the shift of Prime Day into Q2 this year, which added about 400 basis points to the year-over-year growth rate. Q2 of this year was a transition period for many of our customers. As the quarter progressed, people were at home less as restrictions and lockdowns eased in some of our largest geographies, including the U.S. and much of Europe.  As a result, while Prime members continued to spend more with us, growth in Prime members spend moderated compared to spending seen during the peak of the pandemic. As you look at our recent revenue growth rates, I want to give you some insight into what we are seeing as there have been some noticeable intra-quarter changes in our revenue run rate. Prime Day has also been in three different quarters the past three years, so I will normalize for this impact in my growth rate comments.  Also since FX rates have bounced around, all of my comments exclude foreign exchange. Here’s a quick recap of our growth rates in 2020 and 2021. First, before COVID-19, we've been growing at a revenue growth rate close to 20%. 2019 full-year growth was 22%, and revenue growth for the first two months of 2020 was 21%. Once the pandemic hit and lockdowns began in March 2020, the initial growth rate jumped into the mid-30% range. Q1 of last year ended with a revenue growth rate of 27%. However, our operations network took time to step up to serve this growth in demand due to space constraints and our need to ramp up hiring quickly while prioritizing employee health and safety.  By mid-May of last year, we have made good progress to open up more capacity by adding hundreds of thousands of employees. This allowed our revenue growth rate to jump to the 35% to 45% range and remained at that level through Q1 of this year when we had 41% growth. In Q2 of this year, we began to comp this high sales period from last year, and the year-over-year revenue growth rate has narrowed. It has also narrowed as vaccines become more readily available in many countries and people are getting out of their homes.  Since May 15, again, excluding Prime Day, our year-over-year growth rate has dropped into the mid-teens. Our Q3 revenue guidance range of 10% to 16% growth reflects an expected continuation of this trend. Given all this volatility, it is useful to consider the 2-year compounded annual growth rate, which remained strong in the 25% to 30% range. Recall, this compares to our pre-pandemic growth rate of 21%. This reflects the acceleration of Prime membership and Prime member purchase levels over the past 18 months. While I'm not giving forward guidance beyond Q3 of this year, we do expect this pattern of difficult year-over-year revenue comps to continue for the next few quarters. As we move forward and start to comp COVID 's impact on our revenue growth, we encourage you to also look at the multiyear compounded annual growth rate since the onset of the pandemic to better put this growth in perspective. Now, back to the Q2 highlights. We continue to be very pleased with the Prime member growth and engagement we're seeing. We've been fortunate to welcome more than 50 million new members in the past 18 months, and Prime member benefits usage remains high.  That includes continued strong engagement in Prime's family of digital offerings, like Prime Video's original movies. For example, Prime members helped make The Tomorrow War and Tom Clancy's Without Remorse, the number one streaming movies on their respective opening weekends. Amazon Advertising is innovating at a fast clip, launching over 40 new features and self-service capabilities in the quarter, making it easier for sellers, companies, and authors to grow their businesses by helping customers discover their brands and products.  Other revenue increased 83% year-over-year in Q2, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven largely by continued acceleration in our ads business. Moving on to AWS, revenue growth accelerated across a broad range of customers. We see strong growth in enterprises, governments, educational, and research institutions, and our start-up and digital native customers.  We recently announced new commitments and migrations from customers across a diverse set of major industries, including Swisscom and Bell Canada in Telecom, BMO Financial Group, and Bancolombia in financial services, and Ferrari in automotive. AWS customers recognize that the move to the cloud is very positive for their businesses in the medium and long term. Disruptive economic events like COVID have caused many people to step back and think about how they want to change strategically, and many have come to the conclusion that they do not want to own and run their own datacenters. They assume they can save money and gain agility and innovation by moving to AWS.  I'll finish up with some comments on our ongoing investments in operations. As we think about the pull-forward in demand we've seen these past 18 months, it has required and will continue to require a significant amount of investment in our fulfillment network. Our teams have done a remarkable job stepping up to serve customers and support our vendors and sellers, and we've worked hard to increase capacity at a rapid rate. For the trailing 12 months ended Q2, Capex and equipment finance leases increased 74% versus the prior trailing 12-month period.  And as usual, most of our 2021 spend and building openings are planned in the second half of this year. This is all part of a multi-year investment cycle for us. Unit volumes, while obviously growing at lower rates of last year's large comp continue to remain high, and we see strong demand for FBA and third-party sellers. So, there's more work to do, including additional build-outs of our FCs, as well as our middle mile and last-mile capabilities to support our fast-improving delivery offers for customers.  I encourage you to read the business highlights in our press release. It's a diverse collection of efforts supported by many thousands of customer-focused Amazon employees, from Amazon Pharmacy to Business Prime to to AWS' plans to add seven new regions to NFL Thursday Night Football starting next year, to the Black Business Accelerator program, to Alexa’s collaboration with Ford Motor Company. We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to Q&A."

Brian, I just want to ask two, just going back to the 2Q revenue beyond Prime spend moderating and the reopening, is there anything else you'd point to, in particular, that they have kept you in the middle of the range versus obviously where you've been over the last year versus expectations? And I guess, in particular, can you talk about Prime Day relative to your expectations? And then secondly, the BigCommerce partnership, a couple weeks ago, you seem to have opened up more to working with merchants away from Amazon. Just hoping you could talk more about the multichannel fulfillment opportunity, and do you think you now have the logistics capabilities, and has everything recovered to the point where you can offer these services more to third parties? Thanks."

Now as far as Q2 run rate is concerned, if you look back the last few quarters, we've not done a great job of nailing the impact of COVID. We have generally over-performed our guidance range. I think last quarter we had kept the same process coming off some very high volumes for the last prior four quarters.  And really, the only difference I see is in Q2 versus Q1, and before is the year-over-year comp, which we had factored in, but also the increase in mobility. I think the impact of people getting vaccinated and getting out in the world, not only shopping offline, but also living life and getting out.  It takes away from shopping time. It's good -- it's a good phenomenon and it's great, and we just have to appropriately gauge our run-rate going forward. So, Prime Day was very successful. We passed the record set in last fall's Prime Day, which was a very different time of year to have Prime Day and started to bump up against early holiday shopping, so we're really pleased. And again, I think it was a great day then for third-party sellers as I pointed out."

I’d just say our focus is really squarely on adding capacity to meet the current high customer demand that Brian talked about in his opening remarks. We're always working to develop new and innovative ways to support partners, SMBs in particular who sell on Amazon, and that includes testing shipping programs and newer initiatives that can help those businesses get packages to customers quickly and reliably. So, continue to see us look for ways to be able to innovate where it's appropriate relative to the customer demand we're already seeing in our network."

I guess sort of masked in the headline results is actually pretty solid performance in the higher margin segments of the business, including third-party services, subscriptions, AWS, and advertising. and then I think that was evident in gross margin as well. I guess my question is whether there is any deliberate shift towards these services or is that just more of an output of somewhat weaker trends you saw after mid-May? And then secondly, is Prime Day still a once per year phenomenon or would you consider separate events spread out during the same year to capitalize on different seasonal trends? Thanks."
AMZN,2021-07-29,2021-07-30,,2021-07-29,2021-07-29T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-07-29,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure. On the second question, I don't have anything to announce today. Our trend has been once a year. Of course, it's moved between quarters the last three years. So, that's all I have on that one. As far as the higher-margin areas and whether that's a purposeful strategy, I'd like to say it is, but if you look at what they are third-party is kind of a continuation of strength in our FBA program, in particular, I think the sellers are doing a great job of adding additional selection that's very valuable and reinforces our flywheel, and we'd like to see that and you see that third-party percent of units went up from 53% last year to 56%, and that's a steady mark.  We've seen that, as we said, the third-party sellers are doing a great job and we like to see that. On advertising, advertising is, again, another part of our flywheel. We have traffic coming in for the consumer business. And if we do a good job with advertising, we'll make it an additive experience for our customers and our sellers and vendors.  So that's what we work on, is to make sure that it's a relevant experience and adds to your shopping experience and helps you find selection that perhaps you wouldn't have found otherwise or it would've been harder to. And then on AWS, AWS is again, its own separate part of the business. It has been 15 years in the development, and we think our scale and experience really pays dividends.  If you looked at the last quarter, AWS set more revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year than any quarter in our history. We are now at $59 billion annualized run-rate business, and that's up from 43 billion at this time last year. So, those are output measures as we like to say, the input measures are doing a good job on products, adding new capabilities, and being able to work with our customers to solve their problems.  I think that's what you are seeing and it's matching up well with a renewed emphasis on getting to the cloud by a lot of companies out there. And when they're looking to make that transition, it's giving up control and putting yourself in -- and choosing a partner for the long haul, and we're proud that companies choose us for that journey."

The nitpicky on, Brian, fulfillment on a per unit basis was pretty high in the second quarter given -- relative to normal seasonality. Can you talk about just what's driving that? Is that a new build, new square feet, or are there inefficiencies that went on in the quarter in fulfillment.  And the second one is sort of about bigger picture. In the last quarter, you talked a little bit about same-day in Europe. There’s been some headlines about same-day. How do we think -- how should we think about a larger same-day offering being part of the investment process right now, just to sort of maintain and grow your share of grocery and consumables? Thanks."
AMZN,2021-07-29,2021-07-30,,2021-07-29,2021-07-29T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-07-29,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure. Thanks. Yes, I would say on the fulfillment side, there are a number of things. First, we are adding a lot of capacity. If you step back, the Amazon fulfilled unit volume, so that's the units coming out of our fulfillment centers both retail and FBA have doubled in the past 2 years. And the AMZL, the delivery arm of our business, has more than doubled in that time period. So, you can see there's been very strong multiyear demand here that we're still catching up with from last year. So most of -- I mentioned earlier our year-over-year growth in CapEx and equipment leases is 74% in the second -- at the end of June compared to 38% the year before.  So, we're continuing to add and most of that development is really ahead of us in the second half of the year. So, if you've been with us a long time, you know, the cadence is that as we add demand -- excuse me, as we add capacity, there's a lot of additional costs from hiring to starting up to training, to getting that building or sort center or delivery station up and running. It usually takes a multi-year period to tame those assets.  And we've literally nearly doubled our network here in the last 18 months from a size standpoint. There's a lot of that going on, a lot of strong effort by our fulfillment and ops teams to help mitigate the costs. The other thing is wage pressure has become evident, we've talked about this a bit.  The wage increase for -- that we normally would do in October, we pulled forward into May. We're spending a lot of money on signing and incentives. And while we have very good staffing levels, it's not without cost. It's very competitive labor market out there, and certainly the biggest contributor to inflationary pressures that we're seeing in business."

We're investing in the transportation network to support the demands, a significant part of the capital investments we've been talking about for the past few years, and certainly since the pandemic's start, has been to support those efforts in middle and last mile capacity to keep pace and support with that demand. So as we [Indiscernible] here that work's not done yet. We're continuing to expand.  You'll see that investment throughout 2021. And that growing transportation network will support faster delivery times for customers. One-day delivery is improving and -- in the U.S. as well as same-day delivery, where it makes sense and where the network is growing there. So we'll have to continue to see how we go, but we are focused on those data points. And we're also focused on improving delivery precision as a way of improving the quality of -- of the overall offering."

One, within online stores, was there any particular area of softness during the quarter? I'm just thinking about maybe some product categories that may have come back, or actually the opposite, may have gone down, the demand for with the reopening that you can maybe highlight.  And then as you look beyond Q3 and Q4, what kind of growth assumptions for e-commerce or just in general for the next couple of years, are you guys working with to build your budget and events against the opportunity? I'm just thinking, are you guys assuming that e-commerce growth remains or it goes back to pre - COVID levels or stays at an elevated level, [Indiscernible] Thank you."
AMZN,2021-07-29,2021-07-30,,2021-07-29,2021-07-29T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-07-29,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure. Let me start with the online store's revenue. You're probably looking at a growth rate of 13% in Q2 versus the revenue growth -- FX-neutral revenue growth rate of 24%. I would point you back to last year in Q2. At that online stores grew 49%, there were restrictions on what we stocked in our warehouses. And as you remember, we had to constrain space for a lot third-party sellers as well as our retail offering. But the mix shifted for the early part of Q2 last year to be more of a retail mix and then MFN mix, and then it flip back to be more balanced mix that you've seen in the past.  On forward investment, here's how I would explain it. Again, we are sitting here with demand volumes that have gone up on an Amazon Fulfilled Network basis. It's doubled in the 2-year period. So we are not back to where we want to be on a number of dimensions. We handled Q4 last year, we've been playing catch-up pretty much since the pandemic started. But what suffered is space and space constraints. And that's -- it's gotten better, but it was a factor last year.  And also our one-day delivery percentage has dropped and has not returned to levels seeing pre-pandemic in the United States, It's on par and getting better than pre-pandemic in Europe. But in the United States, while it's improving, it still hasn't reached the pre-pandemic level. So we have a lot of growth to do there. As far as the stickiness of purchases. I think there's certainly a number of things that were purchased last year that didn't repeat for a lot of retailers.  Things like consumables early on, gloves, cleaning supplies, computer monitors, some things you use to outfit your house. You can probably go through your own checklist of purchases and say, okay, I probably will not do this every year. But there has been a healthy movement to online commerce. We have -- we've added Prime members, and the Prime members that we have have ratcheted up their purchases with us, which was always part of the plan and a good sign. It means we're offering them more things that they can buy and satisfying more their demand needs.  Even in Q2, when, and as I said, rates are starting to moderate, in the quarter, those Prime member purchases still grew year-over-year on a -- per Prime member basis they just didn't grow at the same cliff that they had in the prior 3 or 4 quarters. So that's a good sign. And we like the engagement levels and the retention levels that we see with Prime members.  So all-in-all very positive story on that front has accelerated the model quite a bit. There's just, again, some comparison issues that we'll just have to realize and perhaps look at a 2-year compound annual growth rate for a period of time to judge where we are on that progress because there's been a lot of ins and outs, especially with Prime Day moving around. So hopefully that answers your question."

I think, look, it's -- we've seen a 20-year progression in terms of building out the services that we thought were resonated with us and our business, but also saw very early on to externalize those services and offerings to sellers and particularly, small-medium size businesses over time.  Obviously, noteworthy with FBA and many other features. And so I think this -- what you see is really just a continuation of that effort put out by the teams around, whether it's logistics, brand representation. More recently. in recent years with some of the advertising features, we've been able to develop surface, for all our selling partners. And so I think that's a big area and a big part of commitment.  I don't know that I [Indiscernible] anything specifically in the near term other than to say that we should continue to see great momentum on a units basis as we give that metric every quarter, about 56% of our overall total paid units, are third-party. That's up about 300 basis points year-over-year. So, expect for us to continue to put forth that effort in FBA around the world. for sellers and some of these other SMB features continue to gain momentum there."

We've got labor estimate in our Q3 guidance, I would say it's a bit of a complicated mix of economic growth and industries opening up, government payments in some areas that may impact people's working, and then whether or not children are at back at school fully in the fall. So there's a lot of dynamics we do count on having more employees in Q3 and Q4, as you know, from our ramp up to the holidays. So I would I would probably count on wage pressure remaining for the immediate future."

I wanted to ask on just international operating income. that's -- if you look at the results, it's now producing consistently positive results here. And so can you talk to us a little bit more? Just talk to us a little bit more about what's driving that. Is this the result of most major builds are now complete, and you're seeing the efficiencies in fulfillment centers, and so we should see this trend continue or is there something else that's driving international operating income? Just remaining positive here. Thank you."

Yes, we have had strong international results in the last five quarters or so. Noticeably, the positive operating income, which had not been the trend prior to Q2 of last year. I would say the major factors here are the acceleration of growth, so we've in some ways put the set 2 years out - growth on top of today's assets. That's a lot of stress, but it's a lot of leverage of the assets that we have.  And as we've talked about before, our fulfillment centers and operations have been running pretty much at peak since May of last year. It's starting to mitigate a bit, but it's a strong undercurrent. But having said that, we continue to invest in international expansion. You may have noticed that we added Portugal as a Prime country last quarter. We have investments in Brazil, and India, and the Middle East and a number of countries. So we continue to add new countries.  We have a strong performance in our more established countries like Europe and Japan. And so it's a bit of a mixed bag, but right now, again, the performance is very strong. The foreign exchange rate has been favorable as well last few quarters. So that has helped. But really pleased with the performance of our international teams.  And we'll see again it -- our investment plans -- our plans are to make money, obviously in the long run. But we have forward advanced Prime benefits in a lot of these countries before they would have been able to see them. and if they have run the same trajectory as we did in the U.S. so there's bit of forward investment on Prime benefits, especially things like video, that resonate with customers and are good for the Prime program, and turn into eventually really strong businesses."

So you saw 10% sequential growth in the quarter, you saw that also in the fourth duarter, was there anything around reopening that made second quarter AWS exceptionally strong and that we should kind of keep in mind going forward, or do we feel like this was kind of a normal quarter for kind of AWS and this is a kind of a good cadence for the business. And then just a follow-up, just -- maybe your your point about the ability to kind of keep up. Is there any kind of throttling of FBA that's going on, just because you don't have the capacity or to -- or you are trying to say that you might be losing share to other sellers who can promise to get an item to customers faster, given still some of the challenges with logistics and last mile and everything. Thanks."

No, my comments were really about throttling of space last year which did impact -- it impacted our vendors and our retail business as well as our third-party business, probably more pronounced in Q2 of last year, especially April and into early May as we are working to get fully staffed in a help -- helpful and safe way, and also build out more capacity.  In Q4, again, we're handling volumes that were somewhat unheard of year-over-year. Our Q4 growth rate was 42%. That's usually not the case, and it's magnified at peak when we're already handling the highest volumes of the year. All I was trying to say was that our space planning and if you will, throttling of space for their price was not something we like to do. We don't think we're the only ones who had that issue. And that's why we're building out our networks so quickly in our minds.  It's hard to do quickly. but we're moving as quickly as possible. And again, we have a lot of new capacity being added in the second half of the year. On AWS growth, if you look at the run rate in last year, we had 33% growth rate in Q1 and it dropped to 29, 29, and 28 the last 3 quarters.  There's always a lot of year-over-year things going on, but we do note that last year there was a lot of effort by companies to limit their spend and operate more efficiently as as we're all plunged into an unknown demand curve and some industries who were hurt worse than others.  If you remember, we worked -- we actually worked very hard with our customers to help them lower their demand for AWS services as best we could to match any new demand patterns. We also help [Indiscernible] scale very quickly. Companies like [Indiscernible], Netflix and others were very help -- glad that AWS was there to help them scale to meet volume very quickly, so there's a lot of mixed bag there.  We think that it was a strong performance for this quarter. We can see good trends with new contracts and new clients that are either signing up with AWS and making the journey to the Cloud or accelerating their journey to the Cloud, or setting up new longer-term contracts with us."

So I was wondering if it is not on the call but any change in direction, investment philosophies, or any -- more integration of AWS, or anything that we should be aware of related to that change? And then second, AWS margins, really strong revenues. The margins came down quarter-over-quarter. Can you just remind us of what drives some of that margin fluctuation? Thank you."

So again, at any point in time, there's a lot of cross pressures in the operating margins of AWS. There's growth which helps us leverage our assets. There's increasing the efficiency of our servers and efficiency of our sales force. Those are all positives. On the flipside, there's price decreases, there's new contracts signed with large players for multiple years. So there's pricing pressure. There's also the expansion of the sales force and building infrastructure to add new regions globally.  So as we said, these margins are going to bounce around. We're happy with the Q2 margins. I would note that there was a negative impact from foreign exchange that was about 150 basis points. But even at 28.3, it's a strong margin for this business. We know it's going to bounce around as we invest, but also worked very hard to scale our businesses in and efficiently run our assets. on the leadership change.  It's your -- expect Andy, he's hit the ground, running. He's continuing to have a very high bar for customer experience. high standards, operational excellence, inventiveness, willingness to fail, and everything else that Amazon is known for internally and externally. I think we've had a good handoff. Jeff, of course, is moving into Executive Chairman role and he will not be leaving.  He is obviously continuing to be very involved in, as we say, the 1-way door decisions. We've also had a good leadership change at AWS with Adam Selipsky coming in. Adam himself comes with a lot of Amazon history and knowledge and external CEO experience that has made him even stronger as he comes back.  So we feel really good about the transition. And of course, don't expect any drop and expect Andy to add his unique brand of positive attitude and optimism in forward-looking focus to help Amazon keep going and delighting customers."

You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements.

We are now reporting our results for the seventh quarter since the pandemic began and we're especially proud of our employees for both their response to the unprecedented customer demand we have experienced, as well as for their implementation of many safety procedures to create a safe work environment. During this period, we have continued to earn the trust of our customers, especially our Prime members, who have increased their annual purchases and their use of Prime benefits over the last 20 months. We've also seen strong growth in our advertising products, as vendors and sellers have embraced our ability to build their brands and to reach customers just as they are considering their purchases. And AWS has seen a reacceleration of revenue growth as customers have expanded their commitment to the cloud and selected AWS as their cloud partner. As a result, Amazon 's Q3 revenue of $110.8 billion represented a two-year compounded annual growth rate of 25% versus a pre-pandemic growth rate in the low 20% range. We're grateful to our customers who have put their trust in us. However, there have certainly been challenges to overcome since February of last year. We've nearly doubled our operations capacity in the past two years to keep up with customer demand. We've incurred billions of dollars in additional cost to keep our employees safe and to support testing and other COVID-related costs. And we have grown our global headcount by 628,000 employees in the past 18 months and are recruiting for more, including more than 150,000 in the U.S. to support Q4 seasonal demand. This demand for labor has recently coincided with the shortage of available workers, particularly in the United States. It began in Q2, but it really started to impact our operations and cost structure in Q3. It's led to wage increases and sign-on incentives, as companies compete for workers, as well as inconsistent staffing levels in our operations. In addition, disruption to the global supply chains and inflation in the cost of materials such as steel and services such as trucking have also raised our cost of operations. We estimate the cost of labor, labor-related productivity losses, and cost inflation to have added approximately $2 billion in operating costs in Q3, particularly in August and September. Our Q4 guidance range anticipates that these costs will approach $4 billion in Q4 as we see a full quarter's impact of these effects and a higher seasonal unit volume. Specify in Q3, we saw nearly $1 billion of inflationary pressures, primarily tied to wage increases and incentives in our operations. Our average starting wage is now over $18 per hour, with an additional $3 per hour depending on shifts in many locations and sign-on bonuses that can be up to $3,000. In addition, we saw inflationary pressures in raw materials and services, as I mentioned, particularly in steel and third-party trucking. We also saw over $1 billion of cost tied to loss productivity and disruption in our operations. In Q3, labor became our primary capacity constraint, not storage space or fulfillment capacity. As a result, inventory placement was frequently redirected to fulfillment centers to have the labor to receive the products. This resulted in less optimal placement, which leads to longer and more expensive transportation routes. In short, our operations are normally well-staffed and optimized to be in-stock and to deliver to customers in one to two days. Labor shortages in supply chain disruptions upset this balance and resulted in additional costs to ensure that we continue to maintain our service levels to customers. As you look to Q4, we've incorporated this nearly $4 billion of added costs into our operating income guidance range. In addition, we have a nearly $1 billion year-over-year increase in Q4 for spend to support our digital media content efforts, including video, music, and games. We recently launched New World, a multiplayer online PC game, and we're delighted with the response and engagement. New World has become the highest played new game this year on Steam. Moving to video content. Prime Video has a compelling lineup of live sports, including the UEFA Champions League and Ligue 1 soccer in France, as well as NFL Thursday Night Football in the United States. And we have a great lineup of original series to look forward to, including the Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, and Citadel and new seasons from Jack Ryan, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and The Boys. We're excited to add this content to our Prime benefits and increase the value of our Prime membership. Q4's guidance also includes an estimated $1 billion year-over-year negative impact from lower fixed cost leverage in our fulfillment network. Recall that we saw very high unit volumes in Q4 of last year, and then our fulfillment centers were running at close to 100% capacity as we work to add physical capacity to match demand. As we're now back to having more normal Q4 fulfillment capacity and have even brought forward 2022 capacity into 2021, our operating leverage drops compared with last Q4. Our revenue guidance for the fourth quarter reflects the current trends we are seeing, including the lapping of our Prime Day Event in October of last year. We are dealing with labor risks and supply chain interruptions like many other companies, which increases our range of potential outcomes in Q4. Consumers have started to return to pre-pandemic spending patterns, increasing the mobility and spending more on travel and services in Q2 and Q3. But we're appreciative that the incremental demand that came our way during the pandemic has remained and that we're continuing to grow on top of that. We're all set to make this a great holiday season for customers. Last quarter, we discussed the physical capacity we were adding to meet customer demand. We made strong progress in Q3 to build and open new facilities. And as a result, for the first time since the pandemic began, we're no longer capacity constrained for fiscal space in the network. September alone, we brought online more than 100 new buildings in the United States, including fulfillment centers, source centers, and last-mile delivery stations. For the year, we expect our 2021 footprint additions to exceed last year's buildout, which was also significant. Put this in perspective, we are on track to double our fulfillment network over the two-year period since the pandemic's early days. A lot of this increased capacity supports our FBA sellers. Third-party sellers and the products they offer remain an important strength of our offerings for customers, representing 56% of total paid units sold in Q3, that's up from 54% in Q3 of last year. And we're working with these partners, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, to build an even stronger offering. We recently hosted Amazon Accelerate, a U.S. conference for selling partners, where we introduce new tools and capabilities, including local selling, which enables sellers to start or expand their multichannel offerings by providing both in-store pickup and fast delivery to nearby customers and global selling tools to make it easier for U.S. third-party sellers to offer their products worldwide. I'll finish with a few highlights regarding two fast-growing areas with strong profitability profiles. First, we saw continuation of strong usage and revenue growth in AWS, with revenues accelerating to 39% year-over-year in Q3, driven by a broad base of services and customers. There are number of areas we're excited about, but let's focus for a moment on our efforts in machine learning. Customers of all sizes and across all industries are using AWS as their preferred cloud provider for machine learning services. We've been investing in this area for several years, offering an extensive set of machines learning services, including ones that can be applied to common business problems, like Amazon Connect for contact center intelligence, or Amazon Kendra for intelligent enterprise search. We recently launched solutions specific to industries, including industrial machine learning services, as well as Amazon Health Lake to help healthcare and life sciences customers seamlessly transform their data across disparate sources to understand and extract meaningful medical information. And Amazon SageMaker continues to help customers scale their use of machine learning to core workloads, making it one of the fastest-growing services in AWS history, with tens of thousands of active external customers using it every month. We also continue to see strong interest in rapid adoption of our custom silicon and AWS design Graviton2 processors, delivering customers up to 40% better price performance than current X86 processors. Moving to Graviton2 means little to no code changes, so that customers can quickly and easily migrate their workloads to access the best price performance in Amazon EC2. Last but certainly not least, Amazon Advertising continues to grow quickly, representing the significant majority of other revenue, which grew 49% year-over-year in Q3. We're seeing strong adoption across Amazon vendors, sellers, and authors, as well as brands that don't sell in our store, particularly as we've built out our streaming TV offerings. Of course, advertising only works if we make it useful for customers. And when we create great customer experiences, we deliver better outcomes for brands. The team also recently hosted unboxed 2021, our annual conference for advertisers and brands, where we shared some of our newest solutions to help companies connect with their customers, measure the impact of their advertising, and grow their businesses. As we shift into Q4, we're heads down, focused on delivering a great experience for our customers this holiday season. We are committed to make the necessary investments in both people and capacity to bring more items in stock and to deliver them quickly to customers. With that, let's move on to Q&A."

Please proceed with your question."

You said your capacity is up 2x since before the pandemic and I've got units up around 55% on a two-year basis. So just wondering, is the capacity needed per unit going up as you speed up delivery times and try to get to one day? And then second, are you in really good shape for next year? And could you be ahead of plan for next year and kind of cut down the investment there? Thank you."
AMZN,2021-10-28,2021-10-29,,2021-10-28,2021-10-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-10-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Yes. Hi, Justin. On your first question about whether we've – the comparison of doubling the fulfillment capacity to the unit growth. Keep in mind also that our fulfillment capacity also includes our transportation delivery capacity. And in the last two years, we've also greatly ratcheted up our ability to deliver ourselves through NCL, and our percent of units that we deliver through MCL is over 50% of our units globally. So that's a big -- that's a driver as well. I'd also say that while we've been chasing really demand for last two years, we've been doing it is, as I said, we're running about 100%, pretty much all of last year. We are just now getting caught up on space for inventory and inventory is being brought in to support the holiday. And if you look year-over-year, while units growth is, as you say, closer to 8% in Q3, the cubic -- inventory cube is up closer to 40%, both in North America and internationally. So, there's like the second shoe that's dropping of getting the fulfillment centers back in stock, especially for sellers and especially as we head into holiday. So that's a -- I think that capacity, the amount of space we have for inventory is also going up probably at a higher rate than our unit ship right now. Your question about whether it pulls forward from next year, we're not forecasting into next year. We do see that we will -- we expect growth, and as I mentioned on the last call, we think that the growth will be suppressed for the four quarters that end middle of Q2 next year, but we expect -- just as a comp versus 2020 just because of the 40% growth we saw last year. But we expect the long- term trends to be strong in this business. We're investing in such -- as I mentioned, the two-year CAGRs, I do that just so you can kind of judge pre-pandemic versus today. We see strong growth even off a base of last year, which was strong. So, we'll see next year on CapEx, and certainly for the foreseeable future, our capacity constraint is actually labor, which is new and not welcome. That's what we've tried to articulate here today. And we are hoping that that rectifies itself through Q4 and into early 2022."

AMZN,2021-10-28,2021-10-29,,2021-10-28,2021-10-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-10-28,qa,,Mark Mahaney,"Great. Two questions. First, any color around those international losses in the quarter that was large achievement by Amazon standards, that $900 million? And then secondly, talk about the - you've been spending -- so you've doubled this fulfillment capacity. I think they're really kind of catch up to demand, but now I think like you're getting ahead of it. And as you roll out, you get close to one-day promise that you worked up two or three years ago pre-pandemic, and as you start rolling out, super same-day delivery or what you call sub one-day delivery. Talk about the incremental demand, do you think that that could unlock into the extensive which you're investing against not only to catch up to demand, but trying to liberate future demand if you get my point? Thank you."
AMZN,2021-10-28,2021-10-29,,2021-10-28,2021-10-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-10-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Yeah. I definitely do, and I'm glad you brought that up because I didn't include it in my last answer. But yes, we have unfinished business on the one-day promise side. We were ramping that up nicely in 2019 and in the first quarter of 2020 before the pandemic. We're still not back to levels that we saw pre-pandemic. We're getting closer. We feel again that labor constraints have not helped us close the gap there. But we don't want to be as good as -- just as good as we were before the pandemic. We expect that to increase in 2022, and we're going to plan accordingly. And I think you start to see the difference in the growth rate before and after that one day. I won't forecast it too much, but we do -- we did see pick-up and we saw really that we got into the consideration set for more purchases. When something's available in one day or less, now you really don't have to go to a store even if you need it very quickly. So, it just opens up more ways for us to serve our customers, especially our Prime customers. On your comment about international, yes, you're right, it was a larger loss than in prior quarters. In fact, we had flipped to positive operating income through the pandemic. A lot of that was again getting two years of volume growth on top of a one-year's -- current year cost structure. There's also a bit of a slowdown just in content and other things, although we're building that, we would have built it at a higher clip. But the long-term trends remain the same in international. It's a group that has a very different life -- we're in different stages in different countries. The established countries of Europe and Japan are further along, obviously, and they perform closer to the North America results. We have new countries. We've added a lot in the last few years, the investments in Brazil, the Middle East, Australia, and adjacent countries of Poland and Sweden within Europe. So those are all important investments, but they start as an investment. And they -- we build over time and we front-load a lot of Prime benefits in those countries, especially things like video. We find video as a really strong, excuse me, attractor of customers and it's a gateway to Prime in a lot of those countries. So, the model is a bit flipped as versus what we saw in North America, just because we added video later in the game. But we like what we see and we see the actual the hours watched in the percent of Prime members who watch video is actually higher in a lot of the countries, the new countries that we're getting into. So, we're - as we said, we're going to make money long-term in international. Right now, it's a bit of an umbrella that catches a lot of different countries in different stages. We're happy with both the established countries. They are also seeing, however, the pressures that we're seeing in United States on labor and cost and disruption from supply chains. So, can't forecast this any further at the segment level, but just want to give you a little color."

Brian, just curious, how have you fared in pulling holiday shopping earlier thus far this quarter? And to what degree can that help ease some of the impact? And perhaps, what did you learn there last year from having Prime Day in 4Q? And then can you just also talk a little bit about the drivers of AWS acceleration and how you think about the margin profile with more contribution from enterprise deals? Thanks."
AMZN,2021-10-28,2021-10-29,,2021-10-28,2021-10-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-10-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure. Yes. Let's start with the holiday shopping. So yes, you're right. Last year, we -- as we look back, we used Prime Day to pull a lot of holiday shopping forward. And people knew that delivery capacity across all retailers was going to be tight, so it was more distributed to the quarter. Obviously, that works better for us than to have it all hit in a few concentrated weeks around Cyber Monday and Black Friday and the week before and two weeks after. So operationally, it's easier to perform when the volume is spread out. You are seeing a lot of promotional activity from us in October. Again, trying to do what we did last year, just pulled some demand to get people to buy and to buy early. We think that's to their advantage. Although we're preparing to serve people throughout the whole quarter, we feel we've done a good job of lining up inventory commitments that are larger than normal. We've looked at getting more container capacity. We've been successful in that. We've accessed new ports and parts of entry into U.S. So, we're doing everything we can, granted it's at a cost penalty in many cases, but we are -- we feel good about being able to serve customers this Q4. Love it in October, but we will take it in November and December as well. On AWS, the acceleration, I would -- again, I would say that what we're seeing is, again, a lot of customers accelerate their journey to cloud based on the pandemic. Some of their spending was suppressed in 2020 as they -- it's different, some companies were booming. Disney, Zoom, Netflix, others that were more travel-related were suppressed in their demand. Then I think there's a general level of recovery across a lot of our customer base. We're expanding our customer base into a lot of different areas, a lot of new different customers. We add many new products. I highlighted a few of our machine learning products, so we feel really good about the acceleration in growth. We know there were some suppression last year, but it was -- the growth last year was still in the 28% to 32% - or excuse me, 28% to 33% range through on an FX-neutral basis through most of the year. On the margin side, the margins are going to be -- they're not going to fluctuate over time. There's a lot of moving parts. There is a lot of extensions of contracts and long-term commitments, which are great for our business and great for customers. So, there's negotiated long-term deals, there's also a lot of investment in new capacity in new regions to service high usage. We're certainly adding -- continuing to add to our sales force and marketing teams. And then the counterbalance on that is how well we run our data centers, what efficiencies we get, what cost reductions we get. So, it's always going to be varying. We like where we are and will not forecast forward. But again, they are apt to change, but we're working hard to keep them high and well passing through benefits and efficiencies to customers in lower pricing."

The first one, I wanted to kind of ask a big picture question about the retail business. I know there's a lot of extra costs sort of moving through the system now, but maybe can you just talk to us, big picture about any changes or factors that have changed the Company's view about the long-term profitability, the long-term return on invested capital of the retail business now, as opposed to at the end of 2019? Then the second one is on the physical stores. You have quite a few different formats and experiments going on in the physical stores. Talk to us about areas where you've seen sort of the most positive results from physical stores, where you're pleased as opposed to areas where you still see room for improvement in the physical store strategy. Thanks."
AMZN,2021-10-28,2021-10-29,,2021-10-28,2021-10-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-10-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure. Let me start with your comment on the, we'll call it the core retail business. We're very bullish on the retail business. In fact, it's impossible and not productive to even try and separate advertising from third-party from retail. It's all, to us, part of a flywheel where we service customers. We do it in an efficient way and we earn their trust in their future business, and we fight that battle every day. And we look to expand the Prime program to build that flywheel. We look to add new products and services like grocery and video and music and the list is long. So, when you look at retail, certainly expensive right now, especially with the costs I’ve laid out in Q3 and Q4, for us to service that business. However, we have other monetization vehicles, including advertising that if we do well, become a benefit to customers and to advertisers at the same time. That's what we work on. So that is an important part of our profitability structure. It's tied directly to happy customers and customers who are engaged in buying things. So, we don't separate those two. We do for some reasons. We want to make sure that we're understanding where our cost and where our profits happen to be. But we do realize it's all part of the same customer offering. So – and we like the return on investment flywheel. We do. We - I get to see investments in warehouses trucking programs, new offerings that we do in new country expansion. We segment those as much as we can into discrete decisions. And then we track them and make sure that not only are we delighting customers or delighting shareholders in the long-term. So, we feel good about that. Certainly, the cost of fulfillment in the last few months and what we forecast into the next quarter are not what we're happy about, but we see ourselves as the shock absorber, absorbing a lot of the costs, so that the customers not impacted and sellers are not impacted. And again, it's just quite limited options in the short run to impact your cost structure. Most companies would delay shipment or incur -- add fees or something. We don't think that is customer-centric nor productive. And we will get through this period and then we are committed to getting our cost structure down."
AMZN,2021-10-28,2021-10-29,,2021-10-28,2021-10-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-10-28,qa,,Dave Fildes,"And Brian, on that second question around the physical store strategy. We - of course, we have a number of different brands in store types, Whole Foods being the largest that's got over 500 locations, where we've got Amazon 4-star, Amazon Books, the Fresh Grocery stores, Amazon Go and Amazon Pop Ups. And each one of course has a name and the types of products they offer has its own differences. But I think when you step back, we've said that we want options for customers to be able to shop online and in-store. And I think you're seeing that probably most predominantly with the grocery offerings in the Whole Foods footprint that we've got out there. And we want to give customers choice and offer them the combination doing that online and in-store option, whatever works best. And the goal around this is really raise the bar for what customers can expect with this omni-channel experience. So, if you like the hybrid model and we're working on continuing to evolve on a lot of interesting in-store experiences that will resonate with customers. We know that customers like to have a choice to be able to do that. So, some of the things that we continue to be excited about and do a lot of work on are things like the Just Walk Out Technology, that's been in our Amazon Go stores and has now moved into some of our Amazon Fresh stores, just really eliminates, again, one of those things that people may not realize is such a hassle or a deterrent to shopping, waiting in line, and eliminating something that’s really been positively received by customers as they use that technology. Another one, just as you enter these stores, there's technology we have now in a little over 70 of our physical retail stores like Amazon One, which is a contactless way for folks to enter stores using their palm to identify. So that's in, as I said, retail stores and Whole Foods stores. And so, keep looking for us to roll that out. And I’d say with these technologies, too, there's opportunities beyond the Amazon physical store footprints that I mentioned. You're starting to see Just Walk Out going in sports and kind of large arena-type environments. And Amazon One is at some good locations. And both those technologies, I'm excited to employ them in Climate Pledge Arena here in Seattle. So, look for us to keep iterating on those and finding other new innovative ways for customers to enjoy unique shopping experience."

Just in terms of framing it almost against a year-ago period, could you talk a little bit about the 4 billion of COVID costs from a year ago, the elements of EBIT contribution from things like AWS and third-party and advertising, and maybe help investors better understand the bridge between some of the elements of headwinds to profitability in Q4 versus Q4 a year ago. I appreciate all the comments upfront. I didn't know if we could go a little bit deeper. And then of the costs you're incurring late Q3 into Q4, how should investors think about a permanent nature to that cost structure versus a transient nature of the cost structure, either as an output of the macro environment or the unit environment in Q4? Thanks so much."

So how should we think about the cost permanence? Certainly, on the labor front there, we estimate about half of the cost is permanent base wage. The other half is in incentives that we currently offer to attract workers. We're going to have to see. I think it's going to adjust -- we are going to have to adjust and work to lower our costs going forward, especially on things that we procure that may have gone up in price in the last few months. Mostly what I’m talking about is kind of third-party things like trucking and steel for fulfillment center construction. So, we will be working on our cost structure for a while. If you're trying to do the bridge for Q4 year-over-year, a couple of things I would say, yes, the COVID costs are lower by $1.5 billion versus last year."
AMZN,2021-10-28,2021-10-29,,2021-10-28,2021-10-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-10-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Yes. If your Q4, excuse me, the 4 billion is going to be pure variance year-over-year. That's what we've identified, 2 billion roughly of labor inflation and 2 billion of operational disruption mostly through higher transportation costs. There are a couple of other items year-over-year. If you remember last year, we were running at nearly 100% capacity. That's not the ideal for us, but it has the benefit of being highly leveraged and can have other costs, but it's highly leveraged mathematically on a cost per unit shipped. As we get more into a normal buffer, so that we can handle swings in volumes, especially as we get closer to holiday cutoffs, but we generally run with more slack in the system. And we’re kind of in a good fortunate for returning to maybe a more normal profile and space, this Q4 issues again on labor. So there's that. There's the increased cost in digital content, combination of video, games, music, audible. So, some rather large items year-over-year, having given you a complete bridge, but that's what we're seeing."

First, you mentioned growing customers use of Prime, more original programming coming, and the services you offer, continuing to expand. Do you see this demand, this new content, the new services having expanded to a point where a price increase for the Prime subscription begins to make sense? And then second, you mentioned the unboxed event earlier this week, number of new ad products announced there. Which among them do you expect to be most impactful to the overall advertising business? Thanks, guys."
AMZN,2021-10-28,2021-10-29,,2021-10-28,2021-10-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-10-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure. Thanks, Dan. I’m going to start with the first question on Prime. So yes, we're very excited about the current programming that’s coming out in the back-end of this year, and also the prospect for 2022. We think it's a real step-up in options and quality and volume for our customers globally in the video side and very excited about it. And you're right, it does have a lot of value. I've nothing to discuss or announce around Prime price increases. But we always look at that. We look at the value where it's generally a country-by-country discussion. We look at the value we’ve built. We look at the time since our last price increase. There’s a lot of strategic factors involved obviously. But the main job is to build the value of Prime, and that's what we work on and video is a big part of that."

And, Dan, on the second piece for advertising, I think, we still see there's a lot of opportunity in the biggest kind of bucket, if you will, of the current advertising revenue run rate. And that's in the sponsored activity that we're able to offer up to customers, continuing to find ways to just measure that information and be able to surface it credibly and quickly improve on that for advertisers out there. So, a lot of work and it's still being done on the team there and being able to add value for customers. I’d point to, there's a lot of excitement in the of video advertising area, I know we've talked about that in the past. It's growing quickly. It's not the biggest piece of that run rate that you see in there, but growing well. And I think just the technology, we're able to develop some of the relationships that we've been able to foster with things like live sports, the opportunities with the Fire TV device and the video community and where we can reach folks through those areas, it's really exciting. IMDb TV, our ad-supported channel is - continues to do really well. People really enjoy that. We recently expanded that beyond the U.S. for the first time to the UK. So, a lot of really good and interesting ideas and a lot of opportunities to grow in different ways with video."

So, you guys are always kind of beating the rest of e-commerce on speed of delivery across a wide set of SKUs, but there's a bunch of these new companies cropping up that are wiring up speedy same-day delivery for a lot of products from either their own warehouse or from various other retailers. Do you view that as a threat? And you have same-day offering in 15 cities. Does your same-day leverage kind of your existing fulfillment center footprint or do you have to kind of rethink the approach to get the speed down to that 30-minute window or wherever it's going to go? And the second question is just New World was a huge hit. So just any thoughts high-level on the overall strategy within gaming? Thanks."
AMZN,2021-10-28,2021-10-29,,2021-10-28,2021-10-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-10-28,qa,,Dave Fildes,"Yeah. I'll take the second question first related to games. So, I think as we mentioned at the top, really excited to get New World out there to more customers' hands and saw some really good momentum kind of an engagement coming out of the gate with customers there and some of the offerings like the Steam platform and Twitch as well. But if you step back, I think, look, we've said for a while now that gaming is obviously one of the fastest-growing industries in the entertainment space. And we find and see a number of different ways to be able to offer some folks a variety of services. So, we developed and published games for customers through Amazon Games, which developed that New World. We're also leveraging the Flywheel -- the Amazon Flywheel, offering some exclusive and free content as part of Prime Gaming, so it’s part of Prime benefits. You've got AWS, utilizing AWS servers to stream games with our Luna -- Amazon Luna offering. And then as I mentioned before, building this large, engaged, passionate gaming community online with Twitch. So, I think, again, kind of to my point about a lot of really interesting ideas when we're talking about video and the advertising space, it's a lot of different areas that can interrelate, serve different communities within the gaming area. And so, we're going to keep working on that, keep building and listening to customers on the games we've launched, and keep pushing forward with an exciting slate in the future."

We like our model. It's a rapidly evolving space. And obviously, we’re customer-obsessed, but we also are competitor aware. We like the business that we have. We have over 170,000 products that customers, Prime customers can get within two hours from Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and other stores that participate with us in over 5,000 cities and towns. So, we're well on our way to providing ultra-fast delivery for things that require ultra-fast, or things like groceries and others. And we see that expanding, but there will be room for multiple winners in the space. And as we say, there's -- you have to have a cost structure and a logistics network that will pay for the delivery over time. So, we see it as part of an offering that we offer to customers that ranges from two days to one day to two hours or one hour, in some cases. So, we like to meet customers where they are and when they need things, and we're working on speed consistently."

On the advertising business, I'm curious, given some of the concerns in the supply chain, have you seen a pullback on the ad side? So far, is that something that you're factoring in for the fourth quarter?"
AMZN,2021-10-28,2021-10-29,,2021-10-28,2021-10-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2021-10-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"No. We're actually -- again, we're seeing strong growth. Obviously, the Prime Day is always a really great advertising event as well. And then you saw a little bit of that in Q2 when we had Prime Day in Q2 this year and we're lapping Prime Day from Q4 of last year. So, there might be comparable issues, but as far as the strength of the offering and the differential between the growth of the advertising business versus the unit growth, we think we're really resonating with advertisers. We're given new products, new ways to advertise, new ways to highlight the brands. It’s resonating with sellers as well for the same reasons. And we feel it's additive to the customer experience. It helps customers find curated selection and also see brands that they may not have otherwise seen. Dave Fildes Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today’s conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2020. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today, February 3, 2022, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we’ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It’s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Brian."

Let me start by once again acknowledging and thanking our employees around the world for their efforts. This was the second holiday season during this pandemic, and it required exceptional collaboration and coordination among our employees and business partners to prioritize both safety and customer experience. The team did a great job of delivering for customers this holiday. Now, let’s discuss our fourth quarter financial results. For the fourth quarter, net sales were $137.4 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We continue to focus on offering the best experience for our customers across our businesses. On the consumer side, we welcomed millions of new Prime members in both the United States and international during the quarter, while continuing to see consistently high member renewal rates across geographies. Our third-party sellers, in particular, benefited from strong customer demand this holiday season. 3P sellers provided 56% of all unit sales in the quarter, the highest fourth quarter mix ever. And AWS saw a continuation of the strong usage and revenue growth we’ve seen throughout 2021. AWS added more revenue year-over-year than any quarter in its history, and it’s now a $71 billion annualized run rate business, up from $51 billion run rate one year ago. Even on a large base, revenue increased 40% year-over-year. As I’ve mentioned in prior calls, we also encourage you to look at the multiyear compounded annual revenue growth rate since the onset of the pandemic to better put this revenue growth in perspective. Despite lapping 2020’s extraordinary sales growth, we continue to see an increase in customer demand and sales during the remainder of 2021, even as the economy opened back up. For Q4, Amazon’s two-year annual compounded growth rate was 25%, excluding impacts from foreign exchange, consistent with our rate in the third quarter. We’ve invested significantly to keep pace with this demand, including nearly doubling our operations capacity in the past two years, expanding our fulfillment center footprint while adding significant transportation assets to ensure fast on-time delivery. There are now 1.6 million Amazon employees worldwide, also doubling in the two-year period. Our fourth quarter operating income was $3.5 billion. As we mentioned in the last earnings call, we did see more than $4 billion in costs from inflationary pressures and loss productivity and disruption in our operations. The inflation primarily relates to wage increases and incentives in our operations as well as higher pricing from third-party carriers supporting our fulfillment network. Loss productivity and network disruptions were driven primarily by labor capacity constraints due to challenges in staffing up our facilities for peak. This is driven by the very tight labor market in the second half of 2021 and more recently by the emergence of the Omicron variant. We do expect these cost challenges to persist into Q1, albeit adjusted for lower seasonal volumes relative to the fourth quarter. Our results also include approximately $1 billion year-over-year negative impact from lower fixed cost leverage in our fulfillment network. Recall that we saw very high unit volumes for most of 2020 and the first half of 2021 and that fulfillment network was running at close to 100% capacity during this time. Now with more normal fulfillment capacity, our operating leverage decreases versus the comparable prior year periods. We expect to continue to see some negative year-over-year impact from this in Q1 of 2022. While we navigate these near-term headwinds, the fundamentals of our retail business are strong and we are optimistic about a number of growth businesses and a strong innovation pipeline. AWS delivered another strong quarter of growth as enterprises and developers continue to look to AWS for critical innovative cloud solutions. Now to $71 billion annualized revenue run rate, AWS revenue grew 40% year-over-year in Q4, our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth rate acceleration. We hosted our 10th re:Invent conference in the quarter, welcoming 26,000 in-person attendees and hundreds of thousands who attended virtually. re:Invent remains a highlight of the year for us because it’s a great opportunity to introduce new services while engaging with customers and partners to better inform where we should be focusing next. We announced more than 115 new services and features during the event as businesses spanning all major industries continue to choose AWS as their technology provider to speed up innovation in their organizations. In the past quarter alone, NASDAQ announced a multiyear partnership to migrate North America markets to AWS, including their matching engine. Best Buy selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider for cloud infrastructure services. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp selected AWS as its long-term strategic cloud provider to accelerate artificial intelligence research and development. And Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler Dodge, Fiat, Jeep and Ram selected AWS as its preferred global cloud provider for vehicle platforms to accelerate new digital products and upskill global workforce. You can find more examples in our earnings release of how the world’s largest companies such as Adidas, Goldman Sachs, Pfizer, Rivian and more are using AWS to transform their businesses. Overall net income was $14.4 billion in the fourth quarter. While we normally focus our comments on operating income, I’d point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation gain of $11.8 billion related to our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, which completed its initial public offering in November. Before we move to Q&A, there are three additional items I’ll mention related to our disclosures. First, we are now separating advertising services revenue from other revenue as part of our revenue disclosures by groups of similar products and services. This updated presentation is provided in the supplemental financial information included in our earnings release. We’re excited to continue innovating in areas like sponsored ads, streaming video and measurement. Of course, advertising only works so we make it useful for Amazon customers when we create great customer experiences, we deliver better outcomes for brands. Second, we’re prospectively updating the useful life of our servers and networking equipment, beginning in January. As a practice, we monitor and review the useful lives of our depreciable assets on a regular basis to make sure that our financial statements reflect our best estimate of how long the assets are going to be used in operations. We are increasing the useful life for servers from four years to five years and network equipment from five years to six years. As a result, our first quarter guidance includes an approximate $1 billion of lower depreciation expense. We expect the quarterly impact of this change to decrease throughout the year. Although we’re calling out an accounting change here, this really reflects a tremendous team effort by AWS to make our server and network equipment last longer. We’ve been operating at scale for over 15 years, and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. This then lowers stress on the hardware and extends the useful life, both for the assets that we use to support AWS’ external customers as well as those used to support our own internal Amazon businesses. And finally, we will increase the price of Prime in the United States in Q1. We continue to make Prime better. In recent years, we’ve added more product selection available with fast free unlimited shipping, more exclusive deals and discounts, and more high-quality entertainment, including TV, movies, music and books. Since 2018, Prime Video has tripled the number of Amazon Originals. And this September, Prime Video will also release the highly anticipated the Lord of The Rings: The Rings of Power and become the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football as part of an historic 11-year agreement with the National Football League. Since 2018 in the U.S., availability of same-day delivery has expanded from 48 metropolitan areas to more than 90. Items available for Prime free shipping have increased over 50%. And members have saved billions of dollars shopping on Prime days. It’s all on top of new program benefits like prescription savings and fast free delivery from Amazon Pharmacy and the continually growing Amazon Music catalog for Prime members as well as Prime Reading and Prime Gaming. With the continued expansion of Prime member benefits, and the increased member usage that we’ve seen as well as the rise in wages and transportation costs, Amazon will increase the price of a Prime membership in the United States with the monthly price going from $12.99 to $14.99 and the annual membership going from $119 to $139. This is our first price increase since 2018. For new Prime members, the price change will go into effect on February 18th. For current Prime members, the new price will apply after March 25th on the date of their next renewal. With that, let’s move on to Q&A."

I want to come back to the comments in the release by Andy on same-day delivery. Can you talk a little bit about how many of those investments might be behind you versus ahead of you with respect to same-day delivery and how that sets the Company up with respect to either consumption behavior by consumers versus the competitive dynamic you’re seeing against elements of like omnichannel and last-mile delivery competitors? Thanks so much.
AMZN,2022-02-03,2022-02-04,,2022-02-03,2022-02-03T17:30:00-05:00,0,2022-02-03,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Hi Eric, sure thing. So, on same-day, again, there’s multiple levels of fast shipping here from ultrafast, which is essentially our grocery business in one to two hours to same day and less, and then one-day and two-day Prime. We feel good about where we are. We’re continuing to build capacity that enables us to hit those cutoffs. I think his comments were more around getting us back to our pre-pandemic levels for one-day delivery and improving upon that and then getting same-day to more and more metropolitan areas. We’re doing that globally as well, but we really think that that combination of speed for different product levels -- or product line, excuse me, really resonates with customers. And there’s a lot of new offers for free -- or excuse me, generally free shipping on a fast basis. But we know how hard this is. And our goal is to do it and do it at a price that we can make money on as well and our cost structure commensurate with that. So, that’s where the difficult work comes in, but we like the progress we’ve made developing our Amazon Logistics capability over the last few years. And what we’ve been adding, as we’ve mentioned, we’ve doubled the capacity in the network over the last two years. That is not all just to handle today’s volume. It’s also to handle getting closer to the customer and being able to ship faster. So, we like where we stand. We know there’s work to do on improving our customer service. We like the progress we’ve been making lately, but we think the future is bright on that dimension."

AMZN,2022-02-03,2022-02-04,,2022-02-03,2022-02-03T17:30:00-05:00,0,2022-02-03,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Brian, the first one, there’s a lot that’s changed within the retail business, sort of pre-pandemic, post-pandemic more same-day, more grocery, more last-mile investments in an ad business. Curious to hear, as you sort of -- you think about the long-term profitability of the retail segment, has your view about how you think about long-term profitability or cash flow retail fallen at all post-pandemic because of the higher required investments is the first one? Then the second one, like the new disclosure, I’d be curious for any other disclosure about the number of engineers or the size of the teams you are working on a lot of the innovation that you talked about that are sort of more around early-stage nonrevenue-generating projects, we can better understand that investment in Amazon. Thanks."
AMZN,2022-02-03,2022-02-04,,2022-02-03,2022-02-03T17:30:00-05:00,0,2022-02-03,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure. On the second one, we have a history of making long-term bets for customers, and some of those fall into very small short-term revenue businesses. They’ll generally roll up into other revenue, which you see as very small after we’ve separated out advertising. So, I think that you do see it in our revenue disclosure generally. But a lot of our profitability is shown at the segment level, and we’ll continue to do that with the revenue disclosure. You asked about the business model. I think it’s a good question. And we are -- as we reflect over the last two years, we are encouraged by a lot of things. You ticked them off there, the adoption of digital benefits, the use of grocery and how valuable that’s become to customers, not to mention the acceleration of companies going to the cloud. The ability to double our fulfillment capacity over that time period, including making major strides in our Amazon Logistics sets us up well for the future. And -- but we’ve been also dealing with a lot of disruption during this time period. So, the early wave of disruption was handling volume without the capacity to handle it, and then, quickly playing catch-up. And as that was starting to improve, labor took a turn in the United States, especially labor availability, and we’ve really had scrambled to add workers. We’ve been successful at it. We added over 273,000 employees in the last half of last year. But I think if you look at the prior year, it was over 400,000. So, there’s a lot of expansion that’s been going on in the network. And we feel good about the basic contributors of profitability. There’s -- if you step back, there’s procurement margin and working with vendors and sellers as well. There’s fees in some cases, for 3P services and Prime, as we just mentioned is going up. Advertising has certainly added a layer of contribution over the last few years. But again, that only works and is only successful if we make it a good customer experience. So, we’re really working hard to do that. And that becomes a part of our ability to offer lower prices, better selection and more convenience. So, if you take those, those are all stable and strengthening areas. It’s really the onus – our onus is to get our operational efficiency back in all of our areas of cost. We have, again, built a lot of capacity. We’ve hired a lot of people. Some of those people are still -- our teams are all battling Omicron right now. But, we do see the sun coming out and getting better here over the next number of quarters, and that’s going to be where we’re going to put a lot of our effort."

AMZN,2022-02-03,2022-02-04,,2022-02-03,2022-02-03T17:30:00-05:00,0,2022-02-03,qa,,Doug Anmuth,"Thanks for taking the question. Brian, you doubled your fulfillment network and also your headcount over the past two years. I believe you’re about 2.5 years into this investment cycle. Where is Amazon in terms of emerging from this investment cycle? Can you see a slowdown in that big investment spending this year?"
AMZN,2022-02-03,2022-02-04,,2022-02-03,2022-02-03T17:30:00-05:00,0,2022-02-03,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Yes. Let’s talk a little bit about capital expenditures. And I’m going to do this with the inclusion of equipment finance leases, which is the residual that we sometimes lease on our infrastructure assets. We’re doing less of it now, but we still do some and have done it historically. So, when you look at those numbers and how they’ve grown over the last few years, I’ll give you the proportions, which I’m not sure we’ve initially shown before is about 40% -- just under 40% of that CapEx is going into infrastructure, most of it’s feeding AWS, but also certainly, Amazon is a large customer of that as well as we build and structure for ourselves directly or through AWS. About just under 30% is fulfillment capacity building warehouses -- warehouse only, not transportation. And then just under 25% is transportation capacity and building out our AMZL network, principally globally. The remaining 5% or so is small things like offices and stores and other capital areas. But those are the three main areas. If I look to the future, we’re still working through some of our plans 2022, but it’s coming into focus a bit. We see the CapEx for infrastructure going up. We still have a very fast-growing business this growing globally, and we’re adding regions and capacity to handle usage that still exceeds revenue growth in that business. So, we feel good about making those investments. On the fulfillment center side, that’s about 30% of the spend in the last two years. We see that moderating and that will probably now match growth of our underlying businesses. I think there’s always things that can tick up that growth rate, things like expansion of our FBA business, expansion of cube that maybe not be different than the square footage. So, there’s -- we want to have capacity to have a healthy retail and FBA business because that fuels prime in 1-day delivery and 2-day delivery and same-day delivery. So, that’s very important. But we see the FC piece likely moderating this year. And then the third piece is transportation. We still see additional levels of investment in that in 2022. So, if you wrap that up, we expect CapEx including equipment finance leases to increase year-over-year. I can’t give you the exact percentage, but hopefully, it gives you a little more dynamic on what -- how we approach it."

Just talk to whether there are any real surprises to you. So, it looks like you had a little bit greater leverage than you may have thought. And then use that to help us think about what the -- I think you said the sun is coming out. Financially, does that mean that we’re going to have a kind of nice improvement in operating margins as we go through the year as some of those temporary costs get temporized and you get to absorb some of the more fixed costs? So, just talk about where the surprise was in terms of those costs that you laid out for the December quarter, the $6 billion? And how should we think about those playing out as we go forward?"
AMZN,2022-02-03,2022-02-04,,2022-02-03,2022-02-03T17:30:00-05:00,0,2022-02-03,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Okay, Mark. Just remember that I’m sitting in Seattle. So, my view of the sun coming out is a little different than perhaps where you are. But we do see things improving. We do -- let’s step back to Q4. We had said that we would have about $4 billion of additional costs due to labor shortages and the inefficiencies of that cause as well as increased labor rates and shift differentials of premiums and external transportation costs. We came in just slightly over that $4 billion. I think things went as expected. I would say that the hiring was strong, but we could have done better. We could have had more people, so we had to cover a lot of -- there was additional overtime. There are some higher costs on third-party transportation. But, all-in-all, the challenge in Q4 was to staff, raise -- or excuse me, increase the staffing, and we said we wanted to add 150,000 people or more. We added net-net of about 140,000 in the quarter, 273,000 in the second half of the year. So, as you turn the page into 2022, we feel good -- better about labor, except Omicron has kicked up, and now you have a different type of labor issue where there’s a lot of people who are on leave of absences and short term as they work to have a positive test on COVID and can get back into the workforce and protect their fellow workers. So, there’s instances where you’re paying twice or 3 times for the same labor hour if someone is on leave, you’re paying them and you’re also paying potentially for someone who’s covering the shift on over time. So, there’s cost pressure in Q1. I think, the good news is that the labor challenge is not as great in Q1 as it is in Q4 -- Q3 and Q4. So, we’re hopeful on that. We have to work to now make our operations more efficient as we get staffing levels up. And we’re going to plow a lot of our effort into increasing our transportation speeds and beating our pre-pandemic levels. So, there’s a lot of different challenges going on right now. The team has been working heads down for over two years now. So, they need -- we’ve got a great team, and we have confidence that we will -- things will improve as we get through the year. So hopefully, that answers your question."

Wondering if you could talk about maybe more specifically the driver of that acceleration. Is the application layer maybe now large enough where you’re seeing that contribute incrementally to growth? And I think in the release, you also highlighted infrastructure expansion globally. I think it might be interesting to add some context around the scale or distribution of the AWS business internationally outside of North America, if you could put some context around that. Thank you."

We’ve been adding resources in sales and marketing over the last few years, and that is starting to pay off. There was some cutback in spending in the early parts of 2020 that we’re lapping as people -- different companies have different COVID experience, some their volumes went through the roof, some their volumes went through the floor. So as things have stabilized, I think the lasting thing is that a lot of people made the commitment to go to the cloud, better understood the benefits of that and probably accelerated their internal time lines for that. And we’re there to help, and we’re working very hard to make that journey a successful one and we have a strong team of sales and marketing professionals to help as well as technical advisors. So that is what we’re seeing, and we’re pleased with the acceleration in the business the last four quarters. We will see -- we’re also pleased with the efficiency of the infrastructure investment, as I mentioned, the expansion of useful life is not done on an accounting basis unless you have proof that it’s actually -- we’re seeing it in real life. So, very positive indicators in AWS."

Just following up on the international point, what we’re seeing outside of the U.S., I mean we are -- as part of that overall strong growth, we are continuing to see considerable momentum really around the world. It’s customers moving their workloads over to AWS at different phases. And so, as you look at the release, some of the other announcements, there’s a good diverse list of companies, Adidas in Germany migrated its SAP environments to AWS, in the Netherlands, Stellantis selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider. There’s a number of really great companies examples doing different big things at different stages of that migration. What’s been important to us, amongst many things is continuing to expand our global infrastructure footprint really to support this momentum we’re seeing. So, just this last quarter in the fourth quarter, we opened the Asia Pacific region over in Jakarta. And we’ve got announcements for plans to launch and Canada in the Calgary region next year or perhaps it 2023 or 2024. So, a lot of work and a lot of momentum. Those are just a few examples. But where we sit now, it’s -- AWS has 84 availability zones in 26 regions around the world right now. And just in terms of the forward-looking road map, we have announced to launch 24 more zones in 8 more regions, and those will be here in the next couple of years."

The growth slowed there even on a two-year stack. So maybe if you could talk about some of the factors that you think could be weighing on that? And then, just on AWS, you kind of laid out some color there. Is there any bottlenecks to growth that you’re still seeing? I mean, you talked about why this is a very good quarter and having to do with some of the comps, but any bottlenecks to grow, either supply chain or employee related? Thank you."

No, we don’t see bottlenecks on the capacity side or -- probably the limiter in that business is our ability to work with customers to accelerate their time lines. So, we’re investing and working hard to do that. So -- but operationally, we continue to add capacity, as I mentioned, on the capital section -- capital discussion, and we expect that to increase year-over-year in 2022. On 3P, I think what you’re seeing is a decreasing growth rate, much like the rest of the business, as I mentioned earlier, we’re dealing with the very high growth period from Q3 of 2020 through Q1 of 2021. But on a two-year basis, you’re still seeing 31% compounded annual growth in the 3P seller services revenue. Granted that was in the -- it was 34% last quarter, but it’s maintaining. I think the bigger point is that sellers are definitely big winners in Q4. The percentage of units up to 56% was a record for 3P. We continue to invest a lot to make sellers -- help sellers be successful on our site. They’re a big consumer of advertising as well because they use it to build their brands and add -- enable customers to see their selection and make purchases. So we’re very happy with the third-party seller services businesses, and again, looking for ways to help sellers be successful."

What -- maybe tell us why you decided to break it out, if you haven’t already? And then, how much Prime Day might have been a factor in the deceleration? But bigger picture, how much room does that line have to grow bigger than GMV growth? How do we think about where you are on penetration on that? Thank you."

We’ve looked at the proportion of other revenue that is advertising services. And we got to a point where -- and I had been pretty much mentioning every quarter that for the majority of that line item was advertising revenue. And we feel it at a certain size that we should break it out and split the other half of that. So, that was really the impetus for the change. And we look at those things every year, and end of year was a good time to do it as we start 2022. So hopefully, that’s helpful for you to understand the growth rate without having to impute it from the other revenue. The growth rate in the quarter of 33% was down from 66% in Q4 of last year. Q4 last year obviously had Prime Day in it for first time. And Prime Day carries a lot. I can’t scale it for you, but there’s a lot of advertising tied to Prime Day, obviously. So when that moves quarters, it generally has an impact on the run rates. We saw that a bit in Q2 of this year when we did have Prime Day and it was lapping -- Q2 2021 was lapping, the 2020 period that didn’t have a Prime Day in it. So, that will move around a bit. But I think the bigger story here is the success we’re having with sellers and vendors, and making that a useful product for customers."

We think there’s great feedback loops with customers, as Brian mentioned, to keep building and making that better. That results in building more relevancy and better engaging experiences. And again, the more we can interact with the advertisers, the customers and learn and have more opportunities to hear from them and understand that we can build better analytic tools, provide better measurement, give them better insight in performance. So, really focused on serving brands. And it’s in the sponsored ad space, but we’ve talked about video advertising is certainly a great opportunity. And as we’ve got properties like Fire TV, IMDb TV, Twitch, live sports, a lot of exciting things that have been going on in the live sports and certainly to come this year as well, both in the NFL here in the U.S., but overseas in a number of properties, really excited to kind of work with folks. And again, this is about delivering good recommendations to customers and helpful when they’re making their purchase decisions and giving them information around that. And that, in turn, of course, helps the advertisers as well and have a great result. So, I think that’s one area that we’re excited about. Longer term, demand-side platform opportunities with Amazon DSP is something that we’re continuing to work on and refine and again, focus on the customer as we always do."

First, could you discuss how supply -- the supply chain affected the business in 4Q, and how we should think about perhaps impacts from supply chain issues in 1Q ‘22 and for the year? And then, the second question would be, do you expect to increase Prime pricing in non-U.S. markets? Thank you."

We evaluate each country differently. We look at the relative price to the customer versus our cost to supply that and the usage and the value that we’re creating for customers. We felt, especially after not raising the price in the United States since 2018 that the time was right to raise it. And we think it’s a much more valuable program today than it was in 2020, let alone 2018. So, other countries, we’ll continue to evaluate every year and nothing else to announce right now. On supply chain, there’s specific things that I think we all see in the supply chain where we’re waiting for products. But as far as Amazon is concerned, we did a lot to combat the supply chain issues we saw in Q4 or anticipated in Q4. We bottled product ahead. We work with vendors to secure inventory early, in some cases, paid earlier, which had a working capital impact. We also worked very hard to open up channels of -- existing channels of input into the country, whether it was port capacity or vessel capacity. So, we did everything. We knew how to as far as trying to get more capacity in a constrained market. And we think it worked for our customers in Q4 as challenges remain in ‘20, I wouldn’t say we’ve totally passed that, but we don’t expect it to be a big issue in Q1."

Anything you add could be great. And then, just second, Brian, you mentioned the exclusive broadcast of Thursday Night Football and is one of the reasons supporting a higher price increase for Prime. Dave, you mentioned it as an element that is a dynamic new one for the advertising business. Maybe could we just return to that point as the sort of importance of live sports in the video space is incredibly important, is that one that you see kind of taking the business to a new level at this stage?"

So, I didn’t want to leave you with the impression that we raised prices because there’s any football. I just use that as an example of great new content that we’ve been investing in for Prime members to make the Prime membership more valuable as well as international sports, we had one of the highest rated games in the Q4 with, I believe, is Manchester United and -- I’m going to mix up the team, sorry."

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 28, 2022, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It’s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Brian."

I'd like to start with a few comments on what we're seeing as we're coming out of the pandemic, both on the customer experience side and on the operating cost side in this current inflationary environment. Let's start with demand and customer experience. Worldwide net sales in Q1 were $116.4 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This is the top end of our guidance range of $112 billion to $117 billion. Our compound annual growth since before the pandemic stands at 25%, a growth rate higher than what we were seeing before the pandemic. Our prime members continue to be a key driver of growth. Prime members have meaningfully increased their spend since the start of the pandemic, and we continue to see consistently high member renewal rates. We also added millions more new Prime members during the quarter. Throughout the past two years, we've seen stronger usage of Prime benefits by Prime members and a greater reliance on Amazon for their shopping and entertainment. In the first quarter, we made encouraging progress on key customer metrics. Delivery speed performance is now approaching levels not seen since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020. And we now have the widest selection ever available for Prime's fast delivery. We have worked to protect and enhance the customer experience despite a sharp increase in costs, particularly over the past three quarters. We've seen a large cost to keep up with demand these past two years. During this period, we doubled the size of our operations and nearly doubled our workforce to 1.6 million employees. Labor and physical space are no longer the bottlenecks they were throughout much of 2020 and 2021. However, we continue to face a variety of cost pressures in our consumer business. We'll break these into two buckets, externally driven costs, primarily inflation; and internally controllable costs, primarily productivity and fixed cost deleverage. The externally driven costs are a result of intensifying inflationary pressures throughout Q1. Line haul air and ocean shipping rates continue to be at or above the rates in the second half of last year, which were already much higher than pre-COVID levels. Some of this is due to the impact of the Omicron variant in China and labor shortages at point of origin, and the start of the war in the Ukraine has contributed to high fuel prices. For example, the cost to ship in overseas containers more than doubled compared to pre-pandemic rates. And the cost of fuel is approximately 1.5 times higher than it was even a year ago. Combined with the year-over-year increases in wage inflation, these inflationary pressures have added approximately $2 billion of incremental costs when compared to last year. While we will continue to look for ways to mitigate these costs, we expect they will be around for some time. The next bucket of costs related to productivity and fixed cost leverage, which we consider to be more within our control and are working to reduce. These additional costs correspond to the state of the labor force and fulfillment network following two years of disruption and large demand variability. We now look forward to more predictability in our consumer order patterns and greater stability in our operations. Let's start with labor. As a reminder, in the second half of 2021, we were operating in a labor-constrained environment. With the emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021, we saw a substantial increase in fulfillment network employees that on leave, and we continue to hire new employees to cover these absences. As the variant subsided in the second half of the quarter and employees returned from leave, we quickly transitioned from being understaffed to being overstaffed, resulting in lower productivity. This lower productivity added approximately $2 billion in costs compared to last year. In the last few weeks of the quarter and into April, we've seen productivity improvements across the network, and we expect to reduce these cost headwinds in Q2. The last issue relates to our fixed cost leverage. Despite still seeing strong customer demand and expansion of our FBA business, we currently have excess capacity in our fulfillment and transportation network. Capacity decisions are made years in advance, and we made conscious decisions in 2020 and early 2021 to not let space be a constraint on our business. During the pandemic, we were facing not only unprecedented demand, but also extended lead times on new capacity. And we built towards the high end of a very volatile demand outlook. Now that demand patterns have stabilized, we see an opportunity to better match our capacity to demand. We have lowered our operations, capital expenditures for 2022 and are evaluating other ways to increase our fixed cost leverage. We estimate that this overcapacity, coupled with the extraordinary leverage we saw in Q1 of last year, resulted in $2 billion of additional costs year-over-year in Q1. We do expect the effects of these fixed cost leverage to persist for the next several quarters as we grow into this capacity. When you combine the impacts of the externally driven costs and the internally controllable costs, you get approximately $6 billion in incremental costs for the quarter. Approximately two-thirds of these costs are within our control. And with demand normalizing, we remain focused on rightsizing our cost structure and driving out any cost inefficiencies. Our guidance includes an expectation that we will incur approximately $4 billion of these incremental costs in Q2. We saw another strong quarter of innovation and customer engagement in the AWS segment, where net sales were $18.4 billion in Q1, up 37% year-over-year and now represent an annualized sales run rate of nearly $74 billion. Developers at organizations of all sizes from governments and not-for-profits to start-ups and enterprises continue to choose Amazon Web Services. Companies like Telefonica, Verizon, Boeing, MongoDB, Amdocs, Bundesliga, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, the NHL and Thread announced new agreements and service launches supported by AWS. We also continue to build support infrastructure to best serve AWS' millions of customers. We recently completed the launch of our first 16 local zones in the United States with 32 more to come across 26 countries. Local zones extend AWS regions to place our services at the edge of the cloud near large population, industry and IT centers, expanding our infrastructure footprint and enabling customers to build with single-digit millisecond latency performance. Last quarter, I provided some detail on our overall capital investments. So, let me add to that with our current thinking. First, as a reminder, we look at the combination of CapEx plus finance leases. Capital investments were $61 billion on the trailing 12-month period ended March 31. About 40% of that went to infrastructure, primarily supporting AWS, but also supporting our sizable consumer business. About 30% is fulfillment capacity, primarily fulfillment center warehouses. A little less than 25% is for transportation. So, think of that as the middle and last-mile capacity related to customer shipments. The remaining 5% or so is comprised of things like corporate space and physical stores. For full year 2022, we do expect infrastructure spend to grow year-over-year, in large part, to support the rapid growth in innovation we're seeing within AWS. We expect infrastructure should represent about half of our total capital investments in 2022. For the consumer business, as I said earlier, we currently have some excess capacity in the network that we need to grow into. So, we've brought down our build expectations. Note again that many of the build decisions were made 18 to 24 months ago, so there are limitations on what we can adjust midyear. That said, we expect fulfillment dollars spent on capital projects to be lower in 2022 versus the prior year. We also expect transportation dollars spent on capital projects to be flat to slightly down. Finally, I'll highlight a few additional items. We reported an overall net loss of $3.8 billion in the first quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net loss includes a pretax valuation loss of $7.6 billion, included in nonoperating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. You may remember that we had a $12 billion gain on Rivian in Q4. We also provided our second quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. As a reminder, our comparable period of Q2 2021 included the continuation of extraordinary net sales growth in roughly the first half of that quarter. That began to moderate in the second half as vaccines became more readily available in many countries and people started getting out of their homes. In addition, note that this year's Prime Day sales event will occur in the third quarter, in July to be specific. Last year, in 2021, Prime Day occurred in the second quarter. Prime Day contributed about 400 basis points to our Q2 2021 year-over-year revenue growth rate. Lastly, as you look at our Q2 operating income guidance, a reminder that we will see our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense as our employees receive annual restricted stock unit grants in the second quarter. This year, we expect to see stock-based compensation expense of approximately $6 billion, up from $3.3 billion in Q1, largely reflecting wage inflation as we continue to hire and retain employees in high-demand areas, including engineers and other tech workers. With that, let's move on to your questions."

In terms of the revenue guide for the June quarter, I think it sort of implies about 3%. And if you look sequentially and if you look back at the last couple of years, the non-COVID years, the growth has been between 4% and 6%. Are you seeing signs of consumer softness or weakening? Is there any particular factor that would be -- cause your sequential growth to be lower than typical? And then briefly on the margins for Q2. So, you got $4 billion in kind of these incremental costs versus $6 billion in the March quarter, but yet your guidance year-over-year implies kind of the same sort of year-over-year margin decline, about 500 bps. Could you just explain that a little bit? Thanks."

On revenue, yes, the revenue guidance we've given is kind of our best view of what we're seeing right now. Customer demand does remain strong. We're seeing, again, continued strength in Prime purchases, Prime commitment, levels of usage, benefits being used, et cetera. And the big part of the year-over-year comp is that we're comping the last part of the very elevated year-over-year step-up that lasted about half of last year's second quarter, and then we move Prime Day to Q3. So, we're not seeing softness. We're cognizant of the current inflationary environment and the impact it has on consumer -- or excuse me, the household budgets, a lot of times that is a time when -- and people come to Amazon because they know we have great prices and selection and convenience. So, it can go one of two ways. But we don't see any macroeconomic factors generally in this forecast on the demand side. We definitely see it on the cost side."

So, as Brian said, the first time we've given the guidance for the second quarter. But you detailed a number of pieces, but like you said, expect to see, in aggregate, about $4 billion of pressure for the 3 buckets that Brian talked about, higher inflationary pressures, lower productivity and some fixed cost deleverage persisting into Q2. So, that will be at some lower levels as we aim to and kind of expect to see some improvement in productivity, some of those other areas. We're also committed to just generally reducing variable cost per unit and working to lever our fixed costs, specifically where we have those controllable cost buckets Brian spoke about. The other thing -- again, Brian mentioned it towards the end there of this opening -- to see that seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense. So, recall that our employees received those RSU grants in the second quarter. This year, we expect to see the expense of approximately $6 billion. And so, that's up from about $3.3 billion in the first quarter."

AMZN,2022-04-28,2022-04-29,,2022-04-28,2022-04-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-04-28,qa,,Justin Post,"Big picture, Amazon hasn't really been around during a period of high inflation. How do you think about passing through the higher input costs through pricing? When you look at your units, they're flat and you're just not seeing any price increases in there. I know FX is a headwind, but how do you think about passing that through? And when can we start to see that? And then, second question, it looks like your shipping costs are up 14% versus units flat, probably makes sense with the input costs. But we would expect some savings as you bring a lot of that transportation in-house, a lot of the delivery in-house. Is -- are you seeing savings there? And how do you think about shipping costs versus units? Thanks."
AMZN,2022-04-28,2022-04-29,,2022-04-28,2022-04-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-04-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure. Let me make a comment on units first. If we step back, the first year of the pandemic from -- essentially from our world from the middle of May 2020 to May 2021, we saw high growth. We went from a 20% growth rate in revenue to a 40% growth rate almost overnight and held it for a year. And then, we started to lap that for the last year that will essentially end in the middle of this next month. And so, I noted step-downs in the run rate as soon as the middle of May hit last year. So, on units though, units grew during that -- instead of jumping from -- to 40%, they jumped to the mid-40% to 50% range, mainly because of the product mix, people were buying a lot more gloves and cleaning agents and all the things tied to the pandemic. So, there's a lot of -- you have to look at the unit data with keeping that in mind because there's a mix -- heavy mix issue. But putting all that aside, you asked the question about transportation shipping rates. Our shipping rates are very competitive, and we are seeing savings versus what we would get from external carriers. And it's beyond that. We would not even necessarily have had the capacity to -- from external third-party providers to handle the transportation loads that we've seen in the last couple of years. So, we're really glad that we have our -- as we built our AMZL network, we would not be able to have a one-day program, same day and one-day shipments, if we try to deliver it with third-party shippers. It just would not be cost effective. So, what you're seeing there in the growth in shipping costs versus the unit growth, a little bit on the unit side, but essentially a factor of inflation and productivity that I've mentioned to you on the component that hits in the transportation area."
AMZN,2022-04-28,2022-04-29,,2022-04-28,2022-04-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-04-28,qa,,Dave Fildes,"Justin, on your second point regarding inflation, of course, we've talked about we're not immune to inflationary pressures on the cost side and with the ongoing supply chain disruptions and the start of the war in the Ukraine since our last quarter. We see larger impacts of inflation, some line haul, shipping rates, fuel shipping supplies and wages, which we talked about in some recent quarters as well. And we also see some volatility in utility pricing for some of the energy costs in operating the AWS data centers. Now, when you look at costs for customers and sellers in terms of product pricing, I just reinforce our pricing philosophy hasn't changed. We aim to offer low competitive pricing and try to stay on top of that pricing environment and make sure we're delivering a great price for customers. For our 1P business, that means continuing to be really competitive in that space with low prices relative to the reputable competitors out there and staying really close to that on the data. For third-party, we don't control that price that's set by third-party sellers. So, they're running their own businesses and we'll adjust the pricing to account for inflationary costs in their environment as well. And of course, on pricing and another other many other services with sellers, we offer services to help them not only handle with logistics, but also get better pricing information to make sure that they're staying on top of that as well. So, wherever we can help them, we do that. We did increase some fees effective, I believe, is today related to the FBA sellers and some surcharge there. We're focused on, of course, addressing permanent costs and ensuring our fees are competitive versus those charged out there by their sellers. But it's still unclear if the inflationary costs will go up or down and so -- and for how long they'll persist. So, rather than a permanent fee change, we implemented that fuel and inflation surcharge for the first time. And it's, of course, a mechanism that's broadly used across the supply chain providers that are out there already, but it's the first time that we've done something like this."

First one, Brian, I want to ask you about one day, same day. Now that you're getting inventory selection, SKU selection in some cases back to where it was pre-pandemic. What are you seeing from a demand or an elasticity perspective as you get more inventory available for one day, same day? Is it really leading to incremental sales based on your data? And the second one, I want to ask about tech and content. It came in a little higher despite AWS costs coming in lower. Is there anything else we should sort of be thinking about in our modeling in tech and content, whether it's Kuiper or other items that are moving through that line item for the year?"
AMZN,2022-04-28,2022-04-29,,2022-04-28,2022-04-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-04-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Let me start with your first question on one day and same day. Yes, we're approaching the service levels that we had pre-pandemic, and that's a positive sign. But this doesn't -- it doesn't turn on a dime, I think as a consumer, I noticed it myself, I see more things in stock. And I -- it opens up the consideration set for things that I may have had to run to a store to get in a short period of time. And that trust and -- as you see more and more of that, you trust it and you continue to order and you then go to Amazon first and say, okay, well, it's maybe my first stop before I even think about going to the store. So, it's a -- it has to be built over time. It doesn't take years. It takes hopefully, weeks and months. But we're hopeful and expecting that that will add to good elasticity, the same elasticity is that we start to see prepandemic?"

Just as a reminder, components in there is you got the Amazon Tech and the AWS infrastructure, so everything from servers, network and equipment, data center-related depreciation, rent utilities, those types of things. The AWS Tech employee costs and costs to support the dotcom website and a number of other technology initiatives that we're working on. For Q1, it was up about 19% year-over-year, which was down a little bit, less than what you see for year-over-year growth throughout 2021. That growth rate, though, does, of course, include an offset Q1 2022 related to a partial offset, I should say, related to the change in estimated useful lives for servers, which was a little under $1 billion of impact in the first quarter. In terms of just the investment areas, I just reinforced it, it’s continued investment in the tech infrastructure. One of the bigger pieces remains AWS, of course, there. And then, just broadly speaking, inclusive of AWS, the headcount to support -- the build-out and support that the AWS team is doing as well as some consumer tech teams, Alexa and Echo devices and certain other areas there."

You talked about how you're no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity and, in fact, you're actually running at in excess at the moment.

We began and ended the quarter with essentially 1 billion -- excuse me, 1.6 million employees, 1.6 million employees, mostly -- most of them, of course, are in operations. During the quarter, we had a peak of 1.7 million, and we were able to work that down by the end of the quarter. So, we have certain ability with contractors and all to adjust headcount. But for the most part, our employees are what we call blue badges or permanent Amazon employees. And now, we work on getting productivity up. It's a combination of productivity at the employee level, but it's also a matter of productivity of the -- and harmonization of the network, having the right demand in the right -- excuse me, the right capacity and the right demand matched at the warehouse level and the transportation node level. So, that's what we're working on. And we've made good strides in the last month, and we're -- we see a line of sight to getting back, not all the way to prepandemic rates in the next quarter or two, but a good bit of the way. And that's what we're firmly focused on and working on, and that's in the warehouses and also in transportation. Is there a second half to that question? Okay. Go ahead."

Maybe if I could, just sticking on the capacity issues for a minute. In terms of the $4 billion number you're calling out, maybe the first part of the question would be, is that entirely the additional issues that are now front and center versus the issues we talked about from Q4 into first half of '22 from a logistics and supply chain standpoint where we had talked about permanent versus transient cost nature of that $4 billion as you move through the first half of the year? So, is this above and beyond that and above and beyond some of the lingering COVID costs that you had called out in prior periods? Just wanted to unpack some of the stack build of the $4 billion versus thing we already knew before. And then, maybe following up on Doug's question and asking it a little bit differently. When you look out to the back part of the year, not asking for how you might guide. But there's a typical cadence to fulfillment expense build and employee build and headcount build into the back part of the year as you build the capacity towards the holidays. Will that have a very different cadence to it this year because you find yourself with this much excess capacity at Q1, Q2 versus prior years, just so we can keep that front of mind? Thanks so much."
AMZN,2022-04-28,2022-04-29,,2022-04-28,2022-04-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-04-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure thing. Good questions, Eric. Let me start with the cost penalties. So, in Q4, we did mention $4 billion of cost penalties and drag on that quarter. And $1 billion of that was fixed cost deleverage, principally a combination of having enough space and having super high leverage in the prior year when we were chasing volume and had less space. And we indicated that that would be carrying over into 2022 and it has. From a productivity standpoint, our issues in the second half of last year were different. They were -- we didn't have as much labor, even though we added, I believe, was 200 -- I have it right here, 270,000 workers in the second half of last year. We were chasing labor and it was creating much disruption within our network. Long zone shipments, half full trucks, all kinds of negative consequences of not having labor, but we made it through Q4 with the anticipation that we'll be able to hold our labor for Q1 and labor certainty would be a lot better and certain in our network. That is still the plan, and we're probably a couple of months late on that because of some of the issues with Omicron in January. And our reaction to it was that uncertain labor environment where a lot of people were on leave. We hired more people and then found ourselves overstaffed when the Omicron variant subsided rather quickly, at least from our standpoint in warehouses. So, the issue is switched from disruption to productivity losses to overcapacity on labor. And we believe that that will dissipate. It will take time in Q2, but -- so it's not the full -- we don't get the full $2 billion back in Q2, but we will make great strides on that. Inflation has been in both periods. Inflation was in the transportation costs, especially in wage inflation last year. It remains there. It's been amplified a bit by the fuel costs following the Ukraine conflict, which has happened since we last spoke. So, it's more a factor -- those costs will now, we believe, will persist a little longer than we were hoping at the beginning of the year. And I mentioned some of the per unit rates for transportation, cargo shipments and also fuel costs. Those are real, and we have to find ways to offset those or use less of high-cost things, like transportation and fuel. So, we're working on that. As we progress, there's only guidance for Q2. But what we see is that the fixed cost deleverage will narrow as we go through the year, and we'll be really glad we have this capacity in Q3 when Prime Day hits because that's always a big surge of both, inventory and orders, and then definitely in the holiday season. So, we will -- the way we see it as we've come out of a very tumultuous two years. We are glad we made the decisions we made over the past two years. And now we have a chance to more rightsize our capacity to a more normalized demand pattern. So, what's left there is really inflation, and that's what we're working on and evaluating and finding ways to mitigate and in some cases, having to pass some of the costs through to third-party sellers as well so that we're not subsidizing sales there. And then, we will see. So, we expect the year-over-year revenue comps to improve in the second half of the year because, again, we're passing this year of super high growth that I mentioned before from May of 2020 to May of 2021. But, it's not like the volume has receded. Like, in Q1 literally, where revenue 61% higher over two years from 2020. So the way to think about it is it went up and stayed up and now it's -- it will resume a more normal growth pattern. But I wouldn't be full by the revenue growth rates in this difficult comp period."

We had what we consider to be a very strong March. It's very hard to compare year-over-year because March last year was the height of some stimulus payments in the United States. But from kind of a sequential period, we thought March was strong. So, there's no indicators that we're seeing of weakness in consumer demand, but we're wary of it as probably all companies are because household budgets are tightened when fuel costs are doubling and a big part of your -- it ripples through food, it ripples through everything else. So, we're cognizant of that. But what we'll focus on is the customer experience, continue to get our delivery times to be better and increasing selection, which is better than pre-pandemic time period and you're making the customer experience great on a lot of dimensions."

Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 28, 2022, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It’s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
AMZN,2022-07-28,2022-07-29,,2022-07-28,2022-07-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-28,prepared,,Brian Olsavsky,"Thanks for joining today's call. Before we get the questions, I'll make some comments about our Q2 performance and the outlook for Q3. Let's start with Q2. During the quarter, we saw improvement in many of our key operational metrics, including in-stock levels and delivery speed and saw a subsequent step-up in consumer demand. For the quarter, worldwide net sales of $121.2 billion exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance range and represented an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding approximately 320 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. This was a larger foreign exchange headwind than the 200 basis point impact we had incorporated into our Q2 guidance. As a reminder, our revenue growth accelerated to over 40% growth from the period between May 2020 and May 2021. While demand has remained strong, the lapping of this high growth period, depressed our revenue growth rate for the following 12 months ending in May of this year. Our growth rates going forward will no longer require this historical explanation. Q2 of last year was also when vaccines had become more available, particularly in the United States and we began to see more normal shopping patterns. Prime Day also occurred in Q2 last year and contributed about 400 basis points to our Q2 2021 year-over-year revenue growth rate. This year's Prime Day sales event occurred on July 12th and 13th, and is incorporated into our third quarter guidance. As the impacts of the last two years are normalizing, we are happy with how we've served customers and how they have responded. Our compound annual growth, since the start of the pandemic, stands at 25%, a growth rate higher than what we are seeing prior to the pandemic. Prime members have meaningfully increased their spend since the start of the pandemic. Over that period, we've seen stronger usage of Prime benefits by Prime members and a greater reliance on Amazon for their shopping and entertainment. We continue to improve the customer experience in Q2, including quarter-over-quarter improvements in delivery speed and inventory in stock levels. We have also moved quickly to adjust our staffing levels and improve the efficiency of our significantly expanded operations network. We have slowed our 2022 and 2023 operations expansion plans to better align with expected customer demand. While there's still work to be done, we've made good progress in Q2. Our Prime membership program remains a key driver of our worldwide stores business, and we continue innovating to make the membership even more useful and valuable. That includes the upcoming premier of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power on September 2 and exclusive access to NFL Thursday Night Football games starting September 15. Our seller community also had a strong Q2. Third-party sellers represented 57% of all units sold on Amazon in Q2, the highest percentage ever. Selling partners helped to expand the selection we can offer customers while fulfillment by Amazon provides sellers the ability to offer fast delivery. Operating income was $3.3 billion in the quarter, above the top end of our guidance range. Last quarter, I discussed several cost pressures facing our worldwide stores business; inflationary costs, fulfillment network productivity, and fixed cost deleverage. Recall that these amounted to approximately $6 billion of incremental costs in Q1 when compared to Q1 2021. We've made solid progress in reducing these costs. For the second quarter, incremental costs were in line with our expectations at approximately $4 billion when compared to Q2 2021. Inflationary pressures remained at elevated levels in Q2, similar to what we saw in Q1. These include pressures from higher fuel, trucking, air and ocean shipping rates, which we expect will continue into Q3. We made strides to improve fulfillment network productivity in Q2. Staffing levels were more in line with rising Q2 demand, and we saw better optimization of our fulfillment network. On the transportation side, we've continued to improve delivery route density and improve package deliveries per hour. We are encouraged by the progress during the quarter and see opportunity to further improve in the second half of the year. Lastly, the year-over-year negative impact of fixed cost leverage was relatively consistent with Q1. There are two main drivers when talking about fixed cost leverage. First is the unfavorable comparison to very high holiday level utilization rates that we saw in the first half of 2021. And second is the normal step down in volumes off of our Q4 peak that we saw in first half of 2022. On the first point, we expect this challenging year-over-year comp will have ended in Q2. On the second point, we expect fixed cost leverage to improve in the second half of the year as we continue to grow into our capacity. We've also taken steps to slow future network capacity additions. Let's turn to AWS. We saw another strong quarter of innovation and customer engagement in AWS, where net sales were $19.7 billion in Q2, up 33% year-over-year, and now represented an annualized sales run rate of nearly $79 billion. AWS continues to grow at a fast pace, and we believe we are still in the early stages of enterprise and public sector adoption of the cloud. We see great opportunity to continue to make investments on behalf of AWS customers. We continue to invest thoughtfully in new infrastructure to meet capacity needs, while expanding AWS to new regions, developing new services and iterating quickly to enhance existing services. Developers at organizations of all sizes, from governments and not-for-profits to start-ups and enterprises, continue to choose Amazon Web Services. Companies like Delta Air Lines, Riot Games, British Telecom, and Jefferies' Investment Bank to name a few announced new agreements and service launches supported by AWS. AWS operating income was $5.7 billion in Q2. As a reminder, this includes a portion of our seasonal Q2 step-up in stock-based compensation expense. AWS results include a greater mix of these costs, reflecting wage inflation in high demand areas, including engineers and other tech workers as well as increasing technology infrastructure investment to support long-term growth. Now let's talk about capital investments. As usual, we will discuss the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2021, we incurred approximately $60 billion in capital investments. About 40% of that is comprised of technology infrastructure, primarily supporting AWS as well as our worldwide stores business. Another 30% of the $60 billion was fulfillment capacity and a little less than 25% was for transportation, remaining 5% was comprised of things like corporate space and physical stores. For full-year 2022, we do expect to spend slightly more on capital investments than last year, but the proportion of capital spending shifts among our businesses. We expect technology infrastructure spend to grow year-over-year, primarily to support the rapid growth in innovation we are seeing with AWS. We expect infrastructure to represent a bit more than half of our total capital investments in 2022. For the worldwide stores business, we've continued to moderate our build expectations to better align with customer demand. We expect the fulfillment and transportation dollars spent on capital projects to be lower in 2022 versus the prior year. Finally, I'd highlight a few additional items. We reported an overall net loss of $2 billion in the second quarter, while we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I point out that this net loss includes a pretax valuation loss of $3.9 billion, which is included in non-operating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. In the U.S., we've started making customer deliveries using the Rivian electric delivery vehicles. This rollout is the start of what we expect to be thousands of EDVs in more than 100 cities by the end of the year and 100,000 vehicles across the U.S. by the year 2030. Additionally, note that all of our share and per share information included in our financial materials has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split, which was effective on May 27th. We also provided our third quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. Again, a reminder that this year, our Prime Day sales event occurred on July 12th and 13th, and is incorporated into our third quarter guidance. Prime Day occurred in Q2 in 2021. For revenue, note that our guidance includes an estimated approximately 390 basis points of unfavorable impact from year-over-year change in foreign exchange rates. The estimated FX impact to operating income is not significant. Our third quarter operating income guidance range is zero to $3.5 billion. This compares to Q2 operating income of $3.3 billion. This third quarter guidance assumes, we see approximately $1.5 billion in quarter-over-quarter sequential cost improvement in our fulfillment network operations, which we expect will be largely offset by investments in AWS and additional digital content for Prime members. For AWS, this quarter-over-quarter increases are primarily driven by higher infrastructure investments to support continued strong customer growth, including larger depreciation on a growing fixed asset base. We also expect increased energy costs as we continue to see volatility in utility prices around the world and operating our AWS data centers. Quarter-over-quarter increase in digital content primarily relates to new Prime Video content in Q3, including Thursday Night Football and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. Thank you. And now let's move on to your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question."
AMZN,2022-07-28,2022-07-29,,2022-07-28,2022-07-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-28,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Brian, I wanted to just talk a little bit about the bridge from 2Q to 3Q EBIT guide a little bit. It sounds like you're going to have revenue up nicely. You talked about the efficiencies of the $1.5 billion quarter-over-quarter and some of the incremental investments in content, et cetera. Where are the other areas where you're sort of investing more to grow and is any of that associated with merchandise margin or step-ups in discounting? That would be the first one. And the second one is kind of going back to your comment about you – how you've slowed 2022 and 2023 operations expansion plans. How should we think about the fulfillment and transportation CapEx sort of looking into the fourth quarter into next year? How far ahead of this build have you gone through for the last, call it, nine months? Thanks."
AMZN,2022-07-28,2022-07-29,,2022-07-28,2022-07-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure. Thanks, Brian. Let me start with your second question. So in any particular year when we're spending capital, a good portion of it, we estimate about 40% this year is being spent in support of warehouses or transportation capacity. That will be opening up and effective in 2023 and beyond. So there's always a pre-spend to keep the – again, the pipeline moving. So when we make adjustments to the time horizon, the impact is not as great as you might expect in the year 2022. Again, we have moved things out and capital is coming down in those areas as we just mentioned. We'll just have to keep you posted as we go quarter-to-quarter on what our expectations are. On the bridge to Q2 to Q3, so again, you have the – mentioned three items, ops improvement that we see of a $1.5 billion and offsetting that is increased costs in AWS, as we build out depreciation. We also are adding – continuing to add people in that space; product engineers, salespeople, customer support. Speaking more broadly, we know AWS is a huge opportunity to early days in the adoption curve for companies and governments. And we invest with that - with that confidence in mind and customers have responded and we're going to keep investing there. Your comment on discounting, we're not seeing some of the pressures that other people are seeing right now. Our macroeconomic issues are principally on inflation and pretty transparent on that. I think the new thing this quarter is additional pressure on the energy, electricity rates in our data centers because of the ramp up in natural gas prices, if you've seen that. So that's probably the new information and then the other inflationary factors. Well, some of them are coming down slightly. They're still significantly a penalty year-over-year. Other cost pressures are principally on our cost of employees. If you look at our stock-based comp as a percent of revenue, it's gone up 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter, as we stepped up from Q1 to Q2. We see that pattern every year, but we don't see that magnitude and that's where a lot of our wage inflation is for particularly our technical employees. So there's a certain amount of conservatism always built into this because we are in a very difficult macroeconomic state potentially. Again, we're not seeing it hit our businesses directly. In fact, we're seeing strong growth in sales through the quarter in Q2. But we're cognizant that things could change quickly and we'll see and monitor and that's how we set our forward guidance."

AMZN,2022-07-28,2022-07-29,,2022-07-28,2022-07-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-28,qa,,Douglas Anmuth,"Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, I wanted to ask about AWS. Some of your peers in the cloud space have talked about some slowdown in booking rates just as customers take longer to work through deal terms and duration. So if you could comment on whether AWS is seeing similar dynamics? And then also when you think about margins, the 35% for AWS in 1Q going to 29% in 2Q, what are some of the puts and takes that we should think about going forward just given decreasing server life benefits and tougher macro environment? Thanks."
AMZN,2022-07-28,2022-07-29,,2022-07-28,2022-07-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure, Doug. I'll start with second question. So on margins in AWS, yes, as you mentioned that is dropping sequentially. The margin rate is going to fluctuate and this business is going to be always a factor of new investment and things like the sales force and new regions and infrastructure capacity offset by infrastructure efficiency gains that we see. Pricing issues as we extend contracts, we've seen really good progress with our customer base, longer and longer commitments, really committing to the cloud, some of that comes with credits to help them make their conversion to the cloud and so that the revenue pattern can be, and the margin on that revenue can fluctuate quite a bit quarter-to-quarter, but see a lot of strength in the business right now. We're very happy with the growth rate. We're happy with the adoption of the cloud. As you hit a potential rough patch in the economy, I think the last time we saw this was back in 2008-ish. And it’s hard to draw lessons from that, but we did notice that it did help our cloud business at the time because again, when you're trying to launch a new product or service and you have to face with building your own data center and getting capital for a data center and building it yourself or moving to the cloud and essentially buying incremental infrastructure capacity, the cloud computing really shows its value. So we're prepared – just like when the slowdown in 2020, we are prepared to help customers optimize their costs and will help them any who are scaling down. But we'll also, again, continue to find new customers and new industries including government agencies and happy with that. And if you look again, where our investments been over the last few years and the growth of our sales force and our sales support, it's starting to – it is showing benefits, and we expect that to continue. On your – sorry, your other question was, is that…"

AMZN,2022-07-28,2022-07-29,,2022-07-28,2022-07-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-28,qa,,Douglas Anmuth,"Yes, you blended that."

AMZN,2022-07-28,2022-07-29,,2022-07-28,2022-07-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Doug, just to – I mean, just to pile on to that too. I mean, I think just the longer term vision I probably talked about here, we're right now with 84 availability zones. So that's 26 geographic regions, and we've got plans for – to launch 24 more of those availability zones across eight regions. And this is Australia, Canada, India, Israel, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, UAE, so a lot of different spots. And so continuing to focus on building out to customers, working on that pipeline and building longer commitments, making – finding customers that are making longer commitments is really important to that. And just to that point, the backlog figure that we've discussed in the past and disclosed on a quarterly basis on our filings, it's up 65% year-over-year or about 13% quarter-over-quarter and the weighted average remaining life of those long-term commitments that we're talking about here continues to grow. So it's at about 3.9 years on a weighted average remaining life basis. So again, a lot of good work, a lot of still good opportunity out there to come, and as Brian talked about, we're working hard in many facets and investing in that to make sure we're in good position to serve folks."

AMZN,2022-07-28,2022-07-29,,2022-07-28,2022-07-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-28,qa,,Eric Sheridan,"Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two-parter on the advertising business, where you saw continued strength. Is there any way to give us an update of how much of the advertising services line at this point is driven by North America e-commerce versus international e-commerce, and how you think about the relative growth rates and advertising going forward between North America and international? And the second part would be away from the e-commerce-driven parts of advertising. How are you feeling about the positioning and the investments you need to make around things like Connected TV and programmatic advertising, where from the outside in it looks like you're continuing to make greater levels of investment and increasing your exposure to a wider array of advertising products? Thanks."
AMZN,2022-07-28,2022-07-29,,2022-07-28,2022-07-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Great. Hi, Eric. Thanks for your questions. I would say on the geographic split, we haven't broken that out. The majority of advertising revenue is in North America, but having said that, we are making great strides in international as well. And we're also, as you mentioned, expanding our array of advertising products from our consumer websites to video opportunities, Twitch and others. Dave, do you want to take the second part of that?"
AMZN,2022-07-28,2022-07-29,,2022-07-28,2022-07-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-28,qa,,Dave Fildes,"Yes. I think it was – Eric, it was a question around kind of interactive work. I mean, we've got – one of our main priorities is building relevant and engaging ad experiences. And so, we of course, introduced interactive ads last year for streaming video content, things like Freevee. We've got Amazon Music as ad supported tier as well for audio ads. So looking for opportunities like that, where customers can more easily engage with brands while streaming content. So I think there's a lot of good opportunity for that, but what's great, video advertising, as you mentioned, it's still early in that space, it's increasingly coming mainstream and then viewing behaviors have really shifted away from some of the more traditional cable or kind of traditional viewing and advertisers are using our ad- supported content to reach those viewers. So things that are ongoing we've talked about around Freevee, around Twitch, and then of course, some things we're obviously excited about it. Thursday Night Football and Amazon streaming TV ads capabilities that we're going to continue to work with these partners and work with our own kind of technology capabilities to keep building out."
AMZN,2022-07-28,2022-07-29,,2022-07-28,2022-07-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Eric, I'd just add a little more on advertising because you're probably wondering again about softness – potential for softness in that or macroeconomic factors. Right now, we still see strong advertising growth. Again, it's got be a positive both for the customer and for the brand. I think our advantage is that we have highly efficient advertising. People are advertising at the point where customers have their credit cards out and are ready to make a purchase. It's also very measurable. And when people are looking, companies are looking to potentially streamline or optimize their advertising spend, we think our products compete very well in that regard. In addition to maybe longer term things like brand building and brings new selection to bear in front of customers."

So you called out just the 3P mix being a kind of highest level, maybe talk about your focus to increase the mix to 3P and how that fits into plans for improved efficiency? And then secondly, on international, how much of the weakness in the margin sequentially was FX-driven? Thank you."
AMZN,2022-07-28,2022-07-29,,2022-07-28,2022-07-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Let me start on your first one. So challenge the premise is a little bit there about incenting mix, sorry, I believe that is how I interpreted your question. We are relatively indifferent as to whether some customer buys a third-party or first-party product from us. We're all about obviously is price selection and convenience. And 3P particularly helps us with selection. And when it's part of FBA can also help as being more Prime eligible and available to ship in one, two days or whatever the Prime offer happens to be. So we're happy with the selection that we've added from third-party sellers. And I think that shows in the percentage mix that you see. We're proud of the investment we've made to build tools and products that allow sellers to be successful on our site. And it's a great partnership and it's worked really well. Sellers and vendors are also some of our larger advertising customers as well and helps – that advertising helps them surface new selection to our customer base. So it's a very strong partnership and it's been getting stronger. And I think you'll see also that they had a very big part in our Prime Day earlier this month."
AMZN,2022-07-28,2022-07-29,,2022-07-28,2022-07-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-28,qa,,Dave Fildes,"Yes. Jason, on your second question related to the international and the profitability there, reported there's a foreign exchange exposure there on that segment with the operating income, there's included in there about $231 million of unfavorable impact to that segment included in that $1.7 billion loss for the quarter. Just looking – broadly speaking at what's going on with that business and the losses that we're seeing there in the investments, I think it's important to remember it's early in many of our international countries, particularly in some of our emerging or more recent launch countries, places like India, Brazil, the Middle East, there are others as well, of course, but where we've been operating in many of those cases considerably shorter than the tenure we've had in the U.S. In our established international locations, UK, Germany, Japan, over time, we've continued to improve the profitability of that business as we build out and established stronger customer relationships and work on the cost structure and how we serve folks. A lot of that, of course, is driving improvements through our key pillars with price selection and convenience and working with vendors on commercial terms. In our emerging locations, there's a healthy amount of investment we've done to drive expansion. And we expect to continue to do that, given the strong competition across many of these markets and that's investments in Prime Video, not just in some of the flagship shows that are kind of sourced here in the U.S., but also you've seen us continue to push for opportunities for in-country and local language the video content that resonates with customers and can be a meaningful reason people sign-up for the Prime program, engage and renew. And we're also investing depending on the regions and kind of the local infrastructure [indiscernible], whether it's building out payment methods, third-party transportation services, even in some cases, the Internet and the telecom infrastructure. So we're playing a role along with others. It's not just us investing in ways to create and enable that infrastructure to be successful. So those are some of the opportunities and challenges that you think about kind of where we are in the U.S. versus international that are out there. The network complexities, of course, there are some regulatory hurdles and other differences out there. But we think it's important to continue to invest in those opportunities and learn from what we're – not just in what we've done in the history with the U.S., but also in many of these countries and keep that flywheel spinning and continue to serve customers in more efficient ways."

One, can you discuss the impact, the price action you took on Prime, on merchant fees, et cetera, had on retention during the quarter, and do you feel that that's enough to offset the inflationary pressure we're seeing to date? And then on Buy with Prime, I know it's early, but how do you see the rollout of this initiative from it being by invitation only today to all merchants using FBA to – Amazon merchants, et cetera, and just kind of the implications on – broader implications on the business from that initiative? Thank you."

So on the Prime fee increase earlier in the year, we're happy with the results we're seeing in the Prime program. Prime membership and retention is still strong. I think that change has been above our expectations positively. And I think the benefit of the program continues to get better and better. And as I mentioned in-stocks never been higher, delivery speed is increasing. So not to mention a lot of the new content, especially on the video side that will be coming in the fall. So we feel good about the program and the state of the Prime members after a very rough couple years of pandemic turmoil. And we think it's good base to build upon. So on the seller fee again, we added that fee grudgingly in May to compensate for some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing. I don't want to give you the idea that either of those fee increases came close to covering our costs. You can see from our operating results, some of it's internal related, but a lot of it's external factors that they're – we are not passing through that at a 100% to external groups. And it’s – we've got to work our way out of the condition we are in and we are making good progress in Q2 and expect to keep pressing on that in the second half of the year, but saw strength in the seller results in Q2, as we mentioned on the percentage mix. So I think, seller business remain strong in an integral part of our customer offering."

On your Buy with Prime question, yes, I mean, right now, it's allowing U.S.-based Prime members to shop directly from merchants on the online stores. And it's what they experience, they expect and kind of come to expect with Amazon that's the fast free delivery that seamless checkout and the free returns on orders that are eligible. Right now the program is available, as you mentioned, invitation-only for merchants that are already using FBA. And it'll expand throughout this year as we'll extend more merchants to invite and participate in the program. We're interested in learning and working with FBA sellers that we've known and had good trust with, but also expanding. And I think as you think about it, merchants, they obviously have a lot of choices on where they're going to sell products. And we have a long history of empowering and helping merchants. We've invested a lot in tools and capabilities, and of course, the delivery capabilities and all the things that go along with that. But that's an opportunity for us to support merchants who may or may not be FBA sellers with the tools and the opportunity just to sell their products online and scale their business and build their brand. And so I think I’m really excited about, of course, getting to be able to launch this program over the last few months and dialing it up for more sellers as the year progresses."

So Brian, I think you just reported a quarter-on-quarter decline on headcount, which was by design after what happened last quarter, but it won't be too long before you are gearing up for the holidays. So how do you think the environment is going to fair for you to be adding headcount? And also the stock-based compensation came in below, where you had guided for the second quarter. So is this a matter of not hitting the hiring goals you were hoping for, or do you think the environment for the hiring of technical and engineering talent is losing up a little bit? Thanks."
AMZN,2022-07-28,2022-07-29,,2022-07-28,2022-07-28T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-28,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure, Stephen. Thank you. On the headcount, yes, I think it was more as we mentioned last quarter – last year – excuse me, in Q1, we added – to give you a flavor for it, we added 14,000 workers in Q1, prior year we had reduced our net headcount by 27,000. So we’re pretty transparent about the fact that we had hired a lot of people in Q1 for the coverage of the Omicron variant, luckily that variant subsided and we were left with a higher headcount position that has come down through adjusting our hiring levels and normal attrition and – was pretty much resolved by the end of April or early part of May. So that is dominating the quarter-over-quarter reduction in headcount. I would note that we're still up 188,000 year-over-year and nearly double the headcount of what we had heading into the pandemic in early 2020. So you're right, there will be adjustments to that as we move forward into more holiday level demand. Right now, we see a stabilization in the workforce, maybe we see good hiring rates. And so I think as you remember, there was a very difficult labor period in the second half of last year, and it didn't arrived kind of quickly out of nowhere. So we're certainly diligent on that and making sure we have a good workplace and an environment that will attract employees."

And as we always remind you, employee annual RSU grants do occur in the second quarter. And as a result, we typically see a step-up in the SBC expense from Q1 to Q2 and of course, you saw it this time around. The growth in the line is impacted overall also on the step-up by continued headcount. We've grown our workforce over the last few years. And as Brian talked about hiring in a number of areas of the business, including engineers, other tech workers, and there's some component of the wage inflation as we look to continue to hire and retain employees there. In terms of the coming in at the five – little over $5 billion for stock-based comp, the main driver there was primarily driven by fewer employees stock awards vested – excuse me, fewer employee stock awards we’re vesting in Q2 than we expected."

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, October 27, 2022 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions; and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to-date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian."
AMZN,2022-10-27,2022-10-28,,2022-10-27,2022-10-27T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-10-27,prepared,,Brian Olsavsky,"Thank you for joining today's call. Before we move to questions, I will make some comments about our Q3 performance and the outlook for Q4. For the third quarter, worldwide net sales were $127.1 billion, representing an increase of 19% year-over-year, excluding approximately 460 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. As the dollar continued to strengthen during the quarter, the foreign exchange impact was higher than the 390 basis point impact we had incorporated into our Q3 guidance. This represents a headwind of approximately $900 million, more than we initially guided to. Throughout the quarter, our worldwide stores business continued to stay highly focused on our customers and driving the inputs that matter most, which helped to accelerate sales growth in the quarter. We now offer our widest selection ever. We've taken actions that have driven strong recovery of in-stock rates, and we continue to work on improving delivery speeds, all while ensuring our pricing remains sharp for our customers. Third-party sellers and the products they offer remain an important strength of our offering for consumers, representing 58% of total paid units sold in Q3, the highest percentage ever. It's up from 56% in Q3 of last year. And we're working with these partners, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, to build an even stronger offering. We recently hosted Amazon Accelerate, our US conference for selling partners, where we introduced new tools, including new e-mail marketing capabilities, free-to-use shipping software that offers discounted shipping rates and new features and analytics to help sellers better understand and act on conversion-driving content. This was a big quarter for Prime members. We celebrated our eighth Prime Day in July, which contributed approximately 400 basis points to our Q3 year-over-year sales growth rate. Prime members purchased more than 300 million items worldwide, making it the biggest Prime Day net sales event in Amazon's history. As a reminder, Prime Day occurred in the second quarter of 2021. We also debut the two largest Prime Video releases ever. The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power attracted more than 25 million global viewers on its first day. And in the first two months since its launch, Rings of Power has driven more Prime sign-ups globally than any other Amazon Original. NFL Thursday Night Football also premiered in September, averaging more than 15 million viewers during its first broadcast, and driving the three biggest hours of US Prime sign-ups in the history of Amazon. Our next broadcast, the seventh of the 15-game schedule, kicks off in a few hours, with the Ravens visiting the Buccaneers. We also saw good growth in our advertising offerings where sales grew 30% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange as vendors and sellers have embraced our portfolio of products, which allow advertisers to build general awareness and/or drive sales of a specific product. In AWS, net sales increased to $20.5 billion in Q3, up 28% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and now representing an annualized sales run rate of $82 billion. With the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, we've seen an uptick in AWS customers focused on controlling costs. And we're proactively working to help customers cost optimize, just as we've done throughout AWS' history, especially in periods of economic uncertainty. The breadth and depth of our service offerings enable us to help them do things like move storage to lower-priced tiers options and shift workloads to our Graviton chips. Graviton3 processors delivered 40% better price performance than comparable x86-based instances. And our teams across AWS continue to work relentlessly to expand that breadth and depth, including recent launches of new EC2 machine learning training instances in AWS IoT fleet-wise. And we continue to expand the AWS infrastructure footprint to support customers with the launch of the AWS Middle East region in August and the recent announcement to launch AWS Asia Pacific region in Thailand. Now, let's shift to operating income. During the quarter, we reported $2.5 billion in operating income. Turning first to our North America and international segments, during the quarter, we generated over $1 billion in operations cost improvements driven by higher leverage of our fixed cost base and continued productivity improvements in our fulfillment and transportation networks. This represents a solid improvement in productivity quarter-over-quarter, though not quite as much as we had planned. We are encouraged by the progress made during the quarter, but we recognize there's still a lot of opportunity to continue to improve productivity and drive cost efficiencies throughout our networks. We have identified initiatives that the teams continue to work hard on, and we expect to see further improvement in the quarters ahead. Another impact to operating income was the step-up in Prime Video content and marketing costs in Q3, primarily driven by the global premiere of the Rings of Power and the launch of the NFL Thursday Night Football package in the United States. Our results were also negatively impacted by non-recurring charges related to the closure of certain businesses and products such as Amazon Care, Fabric.com and Amazon Explore. We continue to ramp up our investments in AWS, adding product builders and sales and professional services headcount to help customers save money, invent more quickly in their businesses and transition to the cloud. We're also continuing to invest in new infrastructure to meet capacity needs, expanding to new geographic regions, developing new services and iterating quickly to enhance existing services. Overall stock-based compensation expense was $5.6 billion in Q3, up from $5.2 billion in the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by a reduction in the estimated forfeiture rate on certain unvested stock awards. We reported overall net income of $2.9 billion in the third quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation gain of $1.1 billion included in non-operating income from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, the impact of this investment to our income statement is driven by quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian's stock price. Now let's discuss capital investments, which is the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. For the full year 2022, we expect to incur approximately $60 billion in capital investments, which is broadly in line with what we spent in 2021. This represents an estimated reduction in fulfillment and transportation capital investments of approximately $10 billion compared to last year, as we've continued to moderate our build expectations to better align with demand. And this is offset by an approximately $10 billion year-over-year increase in technology infrastructure, primarily to support the rapid growth, innovation and continued expansion of our AWS footprint. We also provided our fourth quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. While we are encouraged by our progress across the business, macroeconomic environment remains challenging worldwide. The continuing impacts of broad-scale inflation, heightened fuel prices and rising energy costs have impacted our sales growth as consumers assess their purchasing power and organizations of all sizes evaluate their technology and advertising spend. As the third quarter progressed, we saw moderating sales growth across many of our businesses as well as the increased foreign currency headwinds, I mentioned earlier, and we expect these impacts to persist throughout the fourth quarter. As we've done at similar times in our history, we're also taking actions to tighten our belt, including pausing hiring in certain businesses and winding down products and services where we believe our resources are better spent elsewhere. We aim to strike the right balance between investing for our customers for the long-term, while driving operational efficiency improvements and accomplishing more with less. When faced with an uncertain economy or some kind of discontinuous event, customers tend to double-down on companies that they believe have the best customer experience and that take care of them the best. And that is where our efforts remain focused. As we head into the fourth quarter, we are ready to make this a great holiday season for our customers. We kicked off the season a few weeks ago with our first-ever Prime Early Access sales event where tens of millions of Prime members shopped and ordered more than 100 million items from Amazon's selling partners. We remain heads-down focused on driving a fantastic customer experience, and we believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders. Thanks. And with that, let's move on to your questions."

Brian, maybe I'll just ask a two-parter with respect to the revenue guide for Q4. Can you help us better understand some of the comments you made around the exit velocity, specifically with respect to the US e-commerce business or the AWS business and how that might inform, some of the lower-than-seasonal trends that seem to be implied in the Q4 guide, specifically with respect to either optimizations on the AWS side or changes in consumption behavior on the US e-commerce side? Thanks so much."
AMZN,2022-10-27,2022-10-28,,2022-10-27,2022-10-27T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-10-27,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure thing, Eric. Thanks for your question. As I look ahead to guidance for Q4, I think the biggest individual factor is still going to be foreign exchange. This guidance includes 460 basis points of unfavorable impact year-over-year. FX is a bigger issue for us on our revenue growth in dollars than it is on our income. It actually has a slight favorability due to the investments we're making internationally. But put that aside for a moment. What we saw in Q3 was a really strong July with a great reaction to Prime Day globally. And the resumption of things like in-stock rates are starting to come back, and delivery speed was coming back. And that continued through the quarter, but growth rates started to slow a bit. And primarily in the consumer stores business, it was in international. North America, obviously, it was strong, but it started to slow a bit. But it was mostly in international where we saw the biggest impact, and we think that is tied to a tougher recessionary environment there. Compared to the US, it's worse in Europe right now. The Ukraine war and the energy crisis issues have really compounded in that geography. But when I talk about enterprise customers in AWS, yes, we've been working with customers to lower their bills. Just like all companies, they want to lower their spend when they're faced with uncertainty in the market. I would say one that's real valuable points about cloud computing is that it's turning fixed cost into variable for many of our customers, and we help them save money either through alternative services or Graviton3 chips. There's many ways that we have to help them lower their spending and still get great cost performance ratios. So what we're really excited about the business, both in the long term and even in the short run, you noticed we've added $4.5 billion to the $16 billion base we had of revenue last Q3, so the business is growing in absolute dollars at a really good clip. We do see some of the consumers are cutting their budgets and trying to save money in the short run. I would say that although we had a 28% growth rate for the quarter for AWS, the back end of the quarter, we were more in the mid-20% growth rate. So we've carried that forecast through to the fourth quarter. We're not sure how it's going to play out, but that's generally our assumption. We're excited about the re:Invent conference that's coming up in late November. We expect to have over 40,000 people in Las Vegas and many more tuning in virtually. So continue to drive value for customers with new products, new services and, lately also, additional ways for them to manage their budgets and optimize in what is shaping up as a tough economy."

AMZN,2022-10-27,2022-10-28,,2022-10-27,2022-10-27T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-10-27,qa,,Doug Anmuth,"Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, free cash flow generation has always been Amazon's focus in the past, but that went negative last year and likely this year as well. Can you just talk about the path to restoring meaningful free cash flow? And do you think that CapEx tied to data centers and the AWS ramp can ultimately step back, similar to what we've seen recently with fulfillment and transport? Thanks."
AMZN,2022-10-27,2022-10-28,,2022-10-27,2022-10-27T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-10-27,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Yeah. I think if you look at our free cash flow, there's multiple factors here. One is the drop-off in income for the trailing 12 months versus the 12 months before it, and a lot of that is driven to things that we've talked about on these calls. Ops cost, we’re still not in a -- our network doubled over the last 2.5 years. While we're making strides in productivity and network optimization, we still work to do there. So we have to get our cost structure back to pre-pandemic levels in a lot of areas of the company and mostly in operations. There's a unique thing going on with inventory right now because we have a lot of weeks of cover mainly due to supply chain issues coming out of Asia primarily and we're seeing with our sellers, too. We just have additional weeks of cover. We think our model reacts quickly to customer demand. This is more about the other side of the equation, the supply chain and having more in stock. So what the issue there is that we generally have a favorable working capital impact from accounts payable that is more days than our inventory. That's been flipping the last year, and we expect that to normalize as we move into 2023. And then CapEx is a big driver. We had, again, a doubling of the network, had very high CapEx the last two years. You'll see that we've lowered CapEx year-over-year. We probably cut about one-third of our budget from what we originally thought for 2022 while still focusing our capital dollars really on the AWS business and increasing customer demand or capacity for increasing customer demand in our stores business. So we're working hard on all those dimensions. And we expect, as we see a recovery in income generation, normalization of the inventory versus accounts payable cycle and efficiency in our CapEx spend, we intend to flip those numbers around."

AMZN,2022-10-27,2022-10-28,,2022-10-27,2022-10-27T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-10-27,qa,,Mark Mahaney,"Let me ask two profit questions. AWS margins were a little lower than we would have thought. Is that just a reflection of the full quarter impact of that stock-based compensation granted to those employees earlier in the year? Is that the new normal for AWS margins? And then international losses also were a little bit heavier than we thought, just talk about what drove those losses. And is that also the new normal for that segment? Thank you."
AMZN,2022-10-27,2022-10-28,,2022-10-27,2022-10-27T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-10-27,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure. Let me start with AWS. So we did see a deceleration or a drop in op margin sequentially quarter-over-quarter. The broad disclaimer on AWS margins is that they will fluctuate over time as we balance investments versus renegotiating pricing with the long-term customer commitments, all as headwinds to the business, offset by increasing productivity and efficiencies in our data centers, which drive profitability. So there's moving parts there. I'd say what's happening lately is, yes, the stock-based comp. We have seen inflation in our wages this year and particularly on our Czech employees is heavily concentrated in AWS. So that's one element of it. We're also seeing energy costs that are materially higher than they had in pre-pandemic, electricity and the impact of natural gas pricing. So those prices have up more than 2x over the last couple of years and contribute to about 200 basis point degradation versus 2 years ago. So we're fighting through some of that as well, which is a new thing for the AWS business. But we'll continue to look for ways to optimize our operations to use less energy. And as we scale, we'll outrun that growth trajectory. On international, international is always a mix of profitability in more established countries of Europe and Japan, offset by emerging countries and investments in Prime benefits. I think the biggest issue quarter-over-quarter, the increase in losses versus Q2 was tied to some additional operating costs in Europe. We've seen higher fuel costs there, even more certainly in the United States. And Prime Day always has lesser profitability because there's just a lot of deals. And it's a bit of margin from Prime Day in both North America and international. So a big part of that is device sales. And again, we sell a lot of devices during our Prime Day events. We don't make money on the device. We make money on the use of the device. So that always can end up hurting profitability in the quarter. So there are some contributing things. As far as new normal, we're working very hard to make sure that current profitability is not the new normal, and we'll see how quickly we can make improvements. A lot of the improvements that I talked about on a macro level, capital efficiency, operations improvements are as important internationally as they are in North America."

How would you characterize those conversations? And I think the other question is related to backlog. Backlog has been running 60-plus percent, so the divergence between revenue and backlog is pretty large. Everyone's asking, how do you describe that divergence?"
AMZN,2022-10-27,2022-10-28,,2022-10-27,2022-10-27T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-10-27,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,Let me have Dave answer the backlog question first.

So it's about a little less than 60%, I think about 57% up year-over-year. And the new customer pipeline is healthy. I think with a lot of enterprises and customers, they're continuing to put plans in place. I think Brian will talk a little bit about some of the cost optimization in a second. Backlog growth, this figure, it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter because it is dependent on the commitments that you sign in the period and how those adjust but, yes, $104.3 billion for the end of Q3."
AMZN,2022-10-27,2022-10-28,,2022-10-27,2022-10-27T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-10-27,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Yes. And your first question about cost optimization, first, there are some industries that have lower demand that's showing up in our volumes as probably like other companies as well, things like financial services, the mortgage business being down, cryptocurrencies being down. We're very strong in some of those industries, and that's part of it. But basically, what we see is customers are looking to save money versus their committed spend. We have options for them to do that. They can manage workloads better. They can switch to lower-cost products that have different performance profiles. They can switch to Graviton chips that have higher cost performance ratios. So, all really good things for the customer and for Amazon long-term. Again, we think the benefit of cloud computing is really showing up right now, because we allow customers to turn what can normally be a fixed expense into a variable expense, and they can let us manage the highs and lows of inflation and other cost of electricity and everything else. And they can get about to do their business using our services in a very highly secure way. So, I think just like in 2020, these time periods are good for long-term adoption on cloud computing. But the offset in the short run is that some companies have demand that drops. I think what was different in 2020 was there were companies that went down and there's companies that went up quite a bit that were servicing high volumes during the pandemic. So, that dynamic is not in place right now, and I think everyone is just cautious and they want to, again, watch their spend. And as CFO, I appreciate that, and we're doing the same thing here at Amazon."

First, could you provide some more details on the cost structure initiatives, and when we could see those initiatives hitting the P&L? And then second, on the holiday season. It's a bit implicit in your guide and remarks thus far, but just curious of your expectations for consumer demand this holiday season versus last year. Thank you."
AMZN,2022-10-27,2022-10-28,,2022-10-27,2022-10-27T17:30:00-04:00,0,2022-10-27,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure. Let me start with the holiday. So, we're ready to roll. We've got the best selection we've ever had. In-stock levels are really high. Delivery speeds are getting very close to where we want them to be. And we're ready to have a really good holiday season with our consumers this year. And the Prime Early Access sale, I think, created great value for consumers. It allowed them to get a jump on some of their purchases for the holiday and also just find some great deals. So, we're happy with that effort. And the teams that put that together worked very hard this year to hold two large Prime events within four months. So, we're very optimistic about the holiday. But we're realistic that there's various factors weighing on people's wallets, and we're not quite sure how strong holiday spending will be versus last year. And we're ready for a variety of outcomes. But we know the consumers when they're looking for good deals, and that positions us well. Advertisers are looking for effective advertising. And our advertising is at the point where consumers are ready to spend. So we have a lot of advantages that we feel that will help both consumers and also our partners like sellers and advertisers. So the seller in-stock is very high. We've had great in-stocks from our FBA sellers. And so we're ready to go. And we're very optimistic about the fourth quarter, just realistic about whether we may have a range of outcomes that we just have to be ready for when we are. On the cost structure initiatives, I think you're primarily talking about the operations world. We made -- there's three large buckets there, as I've said in the past, productivity, fixed cost leverage and inflation. On productivity, made good strides, but there's still a lot of work to do there and we know the job ahead of us. It's hard to improve productivity much in the fourth quarter, because it's just a period of like maximum stress on the operations, and we're trying to fulfill every order in a very quick way. But we’re -- our goal is to leave ourselves in a really good, strong condition for a fast start on a lot of initiatives in Q1 of next year. On fixed cost leverage, we've taken steps to alter our forward plan and take CapEx out. A lot of the CapEx we spend in any given year is feeding future years' capability. And we've tightened that up. We feel good about the arc of demand versus supply that we have in our fulfillment and transportation area. Inflation is a wildcard. We do as much as we can to save money in an inflationary environment. We've looked to make sure that our trucks are fully utilized as best we can, preventing long-zone shipments, things that like use a lot of fuel or use a lot of trucking or use a lot of shipments from other parts of the world. So we're working under the umbrella of not having it impact the customer. We're working very hard to save that. Those challenges will be there through the end of the year, and we'll be working on them definitely in the first half of next year as well. So we'll keep you posted as we have these quarterly calls on our progress and where we see opportunities."

So, first, on retail, you did see some good efficiency gains in 3Q, and you talked about $1.5 billion. As we look forward, if those three areas you just mentioned do turn favorable, how quickly do you think you could get back to kind of historical North America retail operating margins? Is that 1 year, two years? Any time frame on that? And then, on AWS, you said the back half of 3Q was a mid-20s run rate. One of your prominent peers was talking about incremental macro weakness in 4Q. So could you just talk about, are you expecting the same thing in 4Q, or are some of the price concessions you already made in 3Q kind of getting in front of that? Thank you."

But just to clarify, we were aiming for about $1.5 billion improvements sequentially versus Q2 and Q3. We feel like we came up about $0.5 billion short on that. Primarily -- mostly in our productivity we have a lot of -- with the Prime Day and the preparations for the Prime Early Access event, we have been running with very high inventory levels in our warehouses. But our inventory and our sellers, as we get ready for those events, paid off in the events themselves. In-stocks have been at really high levels. But in that environment, it's a little harder to work on. There's, blockages to making improvement in productivity. There's a lot of extra work when you have space constraints. But we will continue that fight. And while I can't forecast into 2023 yet, and I'm not really only talking about Q4. My message is that we have work to do in 2023, that we are aware of and working on today. Dave, do you want to take that question on AWS?"

There's nothing really I'd add to what Brian had already said other than he's spoken about. We've seen the year-over-year growth rate come down as the third quarter progressed and exited in sort of the mid-20s growth rate. And so that's informed how we're thinking about the guidance ranges heading into the fourth quarter, but nothing else to add on that."

Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021.  Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 2, 2023 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.  During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.  Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions; and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.  Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  And now I'll turn the call over to Brian."
AMZN,2023-02-02,2023-02-03,,2023-02-02,2023-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2023-02-02,prepared,,Brian Olsavsky,"Thank you for joining today's call. As Dave mentioned earlier, I'm joined today by Andy Jassy, our CEO. Before we move on to take your questions, I will make some comments about our Q4 results. Let's start with revenue.  For the fourth quarter, worldwide net sales were $149.2 billion, representing an increase of 12% year-over-year, excluding approximately 360 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and above the top end of our Q4 guidance range. We've seen that during periods of economic uncertainty, consumers are very careful about how they allocate their resources and where they choose to spend their money.  Throughout Amazon's history, we have found that our focus on the customer helps to set us apart in times like these. This past holiday season, customers came to Amazon for great deals, fast delivery and our widest-ever selection, bolstered by nearly 2 million third-party seller partners who sell on Amazon. Enterprise customers continued their multi-decade shift to the cloud while working closely with our AWS teams to thoughtfully identify opportunities to reduce costs and optimize their work.  In our worldwide stores business, with the ongoing economic uncertainty, coupled with the continuation of inflationary pressures, customers remain cautious about their spending behavior. We saw them spend less on discretionary categories and shift to lower-priced items and value brands in categories like electronics. We also saw them continue to spend on everyday essentials, such as consumables, beauty and softlines. Our teams worked hard to offer low prices and secure millions of deals for customers in Q4, including our first-ever Prime Early Access Sale in October and the more traditional Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday holiday weekend. These global sales events outperformed our expectations as customers responded to millions of deals across our growing selection. Third-party sellers remain a key contributor to that expanding selection.  In Q4, sellers comprised a record 59% of overall unit sales. Sellers, vendors and brands continue to look to Amazon's advertising capabilities to reach customers in the always competitive holiday season, even as the macro environment required them to scrutinize their own marketing budgets.  We saw good growth in advertising revenues in Q4, up 23% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Prime membership continues to be a great value for our customers, and improving our Prime benefits is a continuous part of our investment strategy. Along with competitive pricing, broad selection and faster delivery speed, we've seen Prime members respond to our expanding entertainment offerings.  During the quarter, we completed our first season of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the most watched Amazon original series in every region of the world, reaching over 100 million viewers and driving more Prime sign-ups worldwide during its launch window than any previous Prime Video content. We also finished our inaugural season as the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football, reaching the youngest median age audience of any NFL broadcast package since 2013 and increasing viewership by 11% from last year among hard-to-reach 18- to 34-year-olds.  In aggregate, we invested approximately $7 billion in 2022 across Amazon Originals, live sports and licensed third-party video content included with Prime. That's up from about $5 billion in 2021. As a reminder, these digital video content costs are included in cost of sales on our income statement. We regularly evaluate the return on the spend and continue to be encouraged by what we see, as video has proven to be a strong driver of Prime member engagement and new Prime member acquisition.  Moving on to AWS. Net sales increased $21.4 billion in Q4, up 20% year-over-year and now representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rates slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions. As expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter.  Some of the key benefits of being in the cloud compared to managing your own data center are the ability to handle large demand swings and to optimize costs relatively quickly, especially during times of economic uncertainty. Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and we spend a lot of our time trying to help them do so. This customer focus is in our DNA and informs how we think about our customer relationships and how we will partner with them for the long term.  As we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens. That said, stepping back, our new customer pipeline remains healthy and robust, and there are many customers continuing to put plans in place to migrate to the cloud and commit to AWS over the long term.  Now let's shift to worldwide operating income. For the quarter, we reported $2.7 billion in operating income. The operating income was negatively impacted by 3 large items, which added approximately $2.7 billion of costs in the quarter. This was related to employee severance, impairments of property and equipment and operating leases and changes in estimates related to self-insurance liabilities. This cost primarily impacted our North America segment. If we had not incurred these charges in Q4, our operating income would have been approximately $5.4 billion. We are encouraged with the progress we continue to make in streamlining the costs in our Amazon stores business. We entered the quarter with labor more appropriately matched to demand across our operations network compared to Q4 of last year, allowing us to have the right labor in the right place at the right time and drive productivity gains.  We also saw continued efficiencies across our transportation network, where process and tech improvements resulted in higher Amazon Logistics productivity and improved line haul fill rates. While transportation overperformed expectations in the quarter, we also saw productivity improvements across our fulfillment centers, in line with our plan.  We also saw good leverage driven by strong holiday volumes. Overall, it was a strong effort by the operations team, and we look forward to making further headway as we head into 2023. We remain focused on driving cost efficiencies throughout the network and reducing our cost to serve our customers, while ensuring we maintain an outstanding customer experience.  Circling back to the 3 large charges during the quarter. Let me share some additional color, starting with the job eliminations we initiated during the fourth quarter. As we consider the ongoing uncertainties of the macroeconomic environment, this led us to the difficult decision to eliminate just over 18,000 roles, primarily impacting our stores and device businesses as well as our human resources teams. As a result, we recorded estimated severance cost of $640 million. These charges were recorded primarily in technology and content, fulfillment and general administration on our income statement.  Next, we recorded impairments of property and equipment and operating leases, primarily related to our Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go physical stores. We're continuously refining our store formats to find the ones that will resonate with customers, will build our grocery brand and will allow us to scale meaningfully over time. As such, we periodically access our portfolio of stores and decided to exit certain stores with low growth potential. We'll also take an impairment on capitalized costs and associated values of our leased buildings. The impairment charge in Q4 was $720 million and is included in other operating expense on our income statement.  We continue to believe grocery is a significant opportunity, and we're focused on serving customers through multiple channels, whether that's online delivery, pickup or in-store shopping. Lastly, during the quarter, we increased our reserves for general product and automobile self-insurance liabilities, driven by changes in our estimates about the cost of asserted and unasserted claims, resulting in additional expense of $1.3 billion. This impact is primarily recorded in cost of sales on our income statement.  As our business has grown quickly over the last several years, particularly as we've built out our fulfillment and transportation network and claim amounts have seen industry-wide inflation, we've continued to evaluate and adjust this reserve for both asserted claims as well as our estimate for unasserted claims.  We reported overall net income of $278 million in the fourth quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation loss of $2.3 billion included in nonoperating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, this activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations but rather the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian's stock price.  As we head into the new year, we remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders."

AMZN,2023-02-02,2023-02-03,,2023-02-02,2023-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2023-02-02,qa,,Brian Nowak,"I have two. Andy, I want to ask you, just the first one, you've been in the seat for a while. As you sit there, what are your key focal points, product categories or investment priorities that you're most focused on to drive durable multiyear growth in that North America retail segment as we recover?  And then the second one, just sort of staying on the North America retail side, how do you think about the potential margin potential of that business over the next few years as you sort of grow into the warehouse? And what are the warehouse network? And what are the efficiency factors to get you to those goals?"
AMZN,2023-02-02,2023-02-03,,2023-02-02,2023-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2023-02-02,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Brian, this is Brian. First, let me just start with your second question. On the -- sorry, can you hear me? On the expectation for retail margins, especially in North America, what we've said is when we look back to our cost structure pre-pandemic, we were just in the end of 2019, early part of 2020. We're just starting to roll out one-day shipping in North America, and we had an expectation of what our cost structure would look like. That has changed quite a bit in the last 3 years now due to a doubling of our network expansion. I think you've heard me tell this story on different calls.  But essentially, we're now trying to, again, regain our cost structure that we've had in the past, balance the -- and get more efficient on the assets we've added in the last 2, 3 years now and also look at all the investment areas that we are working on to drive growth, continuing to look at them where we need to make course corrections, where we need to change things up. And we expect that, again, a lot of the improvement will be in North America operations costs. We made good headway in 2022. We always want to make more, and we're going to be working on this definitely through 2023 and beyond. But we hope to make and expect to make big improvements in 2023."
AMZN,2023-02-02,2023-02-03,,2023-02-02,2023-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2023-02-02,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes. And I'll start just at a broad level, priority-wise, the connective tissue for everything we do across the company, including in stores in North America, is we realize that we exist to make customers' lives better and easier every day and relentlessly went to do so. And being maniacally focused on the customer experiences, always going to be a top priority for us. At the same time, and this is true in North America as well as across the entire business, we're working really hard to streamline our costs and trying to do so at the same time that we don't give up on the long-term strategic investments that we believe can meaningfully change broad customer experiences and change Amazon over the long term.  As I addressed directly the North American stores questions, I think our -- probably the #1 priority that I spent time with the team on is reducing our cost to serve in our operations network. And as Brian touched on, it's important to remember that over the last few years, we've -- we took a fulfillment center footprint that we've built over 25 years and doubled it in just a couple of years. And then we, at the same time, built out a transportation network for last mile roughly the size of UPS in a couple of years. And so when you do both of those things to meet the huge surge in demand, you're going to -- just to get those functional, it took everything we had. And so there's a lot to figure out how to optimize and how to make more efficient and more productive.  And then I think at the same time, if you think about doubling the number of fulfillment centers you have and then adding a very large transportation network and you realize that all of those facilities have to link together to get products to customers, that's a pretty big expansion in the number of nodes in the network. It becomes a little bit different network. And so to figure out how to be really efficient across all those links and have them be highly utilized and to get the flows in those facilities working the right way, it takes time. So we're working very hard on it. I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q4, and you can see that in some of the results. But that work will extend into '23. So that's first.  I think the second thing, priority-wise, I would talk about is just speed. We believe that continuing to get products to customers faster, makes customers happier, and they also converted a higher rate when they can see promises of deliveries that are faster. I think selection will always be a very high area of focus for us. We work with hundreds of thousands in the U.S. and millions overall in the world of selling partners. In this past quarter, 59% of the units sold were from our third-party selling partners, and we work very hard to provide unmatched selection. And that matters a lot to customers.  I think pricing being sharp is always important. But particularly in this type of uncertain economy, where customers are very conscious about how much they're spending, having the millions of deals that we put together with our selling partners in the fourth quarter was an important part of the demand that you saw, and we'll continue to work really hard on being sharp on pricing.  And then just the customer experience improvements that we're working all the time, whether it's adding Buy with Prime that allows Prime users to use their Prime benefits on other websites than just Amazon; or adding RxPass in the health care space, where our Prime customers for $5 a month can get all the medicines they're using in unlimited fashion; or whether it's just even in our apparel business, where when you're looking clothing you might buy, being able to see virtually your shoes with that outfit to see how it looks and it changes your customer experience, your buying experience, we will continue to work very hard on those customer experiences, and we have a lot more planned."

AMZN,2023-02-02,2023-02-03,,2023-02-02,2023-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2023-02-02,qa,,Douglas Anmuth,"Also for Andy, I have two. Just first, how would you evaluate your efforts in grocery thus far? I know you're -- it's a big, huge market. You're attacking it different ways. What are the key steps here that you're focused on to drive greater market share?  And then secondly, how should we think about the strategic importance of some of these emerging bets type of areas like health care and Kuiper and autonomous vehicles, among others?"
AMZN,2023-02-02,2023-02-03,,2023-02-02,2023-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2023-02-02,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"On the first one on grocery, I'd just start by saying that we think grocery is a really important and strategic area for us. It's a very large market segment, and there's a lot of frequency in how consumers shop for grocery. And we also believe that over time, grocery is going to be omnichannel. There are going to be a lot of people that order their grocery items online and have it delivered to them, and there are going to be a lot of people who continue to buy in physical stores. But you're going to also see a hybrid of those, where people pick out what they want online and pick it up in stores, or people are in stores and there's something that's not in inventory in the stores, so they go to their app or to a kiosk and order it to be delivered from online. And so I think having omnichannel is going to really matter.  And I think that we have a pretty significant-sized grocery business. I think people sometimes don't realize that and that we've been building for a long time. It's continuing to accelerate, and I kind of see it broken into a few pieces. If you think about the online grocery offering, we have a very large business there. It looks different from the typical mega physical grocery store. But if you think about the aisles in a grocery store, from packaged food to paper products to canned goods to pet supplies to health and personal care items to consumables, we have a very large business there that continues to grow at a rapid clip and then we think will continue to grow.  But it doesn't have a big market segment share in perishables. And if you really want to have significant market segment share in perishables, you typically need physical stores. And we have kind of 2 different offerings there. For what I think is the very best organic physical store experience and selection, we have Whole Foods, which is a very significant-sized business that's continuing to grow. I really like the progress that, that business has made on profitability in the last year. And I like what I see in front of it, and I think that's a very -- it's a premium product, but it's a significant business. It's a good business for us in the grocery space.  I think if you want to have a mass physical store offering, you need a different offering. And that's what we've been working on with Amazon Fresh, and we have a few dozen stores so far. We're doing a fair bit of experimentation today in those stores to try to find a format that we think resonates with customers. It's differentiated in some meaningful fashion and where we like the economics. And we've been -- we've decided over the last year or so that we're not going to expand the physical Fresh doors until we have that equation with differentiation and economic value that we like, but we're optimistic that we're going to find that in 2023. We're working hard at it. We see some encouraging signs. And when we do find that equation, we will expand it more expansively. But I think that we have a very significant opportunity in the grocery segment. I think we're building a pretty broad grocery network across online and physical, and you're going to see us continue to work on it."

Andy, keeping on this theme of sort of big picture and strategy and your perspective, I'd love to get your view on the international e-commerce businesses. Obviously, you're in a range of geographies with a wide variance of maturity and different investment cycles. Can you give us your perspective on how you see Amazon's global e-commerce footprint today? And how investors should be thinking about the mix of growth and margin evolution in those international businesses in the years ahead?  And maybe, Brian, if I can just ask a quick follow-up. In the Q1 operating income guidance that you gave, I think there's some confusion among investors as to where you might be capturing some of the restructuring charges from the announcements that the company has made on employee count between Q4 and Q1. Can you just clarify what was captured in Q4 versus what might be included in the way you frame the Q1 operating income guidance?"
AMZN,2023-02-02,2023-02-03,,2023-02-02,2023-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2023-02-02,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure, let me start. This is Brian. Let me start with that second part. So as I said earlier, we took a $640 million charge tied to the position elimination that we announced in Q4. A lot of that fell into Q1 into mid to late January. So the way to think about it is for the terminations in January, the salaries for the first 3 weeks are covered in operating results for Q1. But the period after that, where there's weeks or months of severance coverage, job placement, a lot of those costs are what the $640 million charge was in Q4. So I hope that helps."

I think just perspective, if you look at the compounded annual growth rate from 2019 to '21, in the U.K., it was over 30%; in Germany, it was 26%; in Japan, it was 21%. And the fact that we haven't given back that growth, and these are all net of FX, but if you look at even the last couple of quarters where we're continuing to grow and we haven't given back some of that growth, a meaningful amount of market segment share has shifted to our global established e-commerce territories, and we're excited about that.  Now we're -- at this stage, we're big enough in our developed international territories that when there's something significant happening in the macro, we're going to be impacted as well. And if you just look in Europe as an example, the inflation is higher than most places, and the impact on Europeans for the war in Ukraine is more significant, and also the energy prices and hikes there are more significant. So you can see that in some of our growth numbers.  And then you look at our emerging countries, and these are -- they're all a little bit different in all -- in a little bit different stage as you recognize in the question. But if you look at countries like India and Brazil and the Middle East and Africa and Turkey, Mexico and Australia and a number of those types of countries, we like what we're seeing. They take a certain amount of time. There's a certain amount of fixed investment you have to make when you enter a new geography, and then you have to drive a certain amount of revenue to be able to cover that fixed investment. But they're all on the right trajectory and following trajectories that roughly look like what we saw in North America and our established international geographies, and we think it's the right investment and believe we're going to have a large profitable international e-commerce business."

AWS, if you look at the revenue growth of mid-teens, it implies it could be flattish and even down this quarter. So maybe talk about what's driving that. Is it workload changes? Are there some clients that are shifting? Anything on the market share you could comment on?  And then second, when do you think this could recover? Like what's the time frame? And would you expect margins to come back when revenues reaccelerate? I'll leave it at that."

Let me start with the -- what we're seeing at the customer level. So as I've mentioned, continuing -- it's across all industries. There are some points of weakness, things like financial services, like mortgage companies that do. As mortgage volumes down, some of their compute challenges or compute volumes are down. Crypto is -- lower trading in crypto. And things tied to advertising, as there's lower advertising spend, there's less analytics and compute on advertising spend as well.  But -- so there's . But by and large, what we're seeing is just an interest and a priority by our customers to get their spend down as they enter an economic downturn. We're doing the same thing at Amazon, questioning our infrastructure expenses as well as everything else. And we -- there's things you can do. You can defer -- you can switch to lower-cost products. You can run calculations less frequently. There's just -- you can do different types of storage on your data. So there's ways to alter your cost and your bill in a short period of time. I think that's what we're seeing. And as I said, we're working with our customers to help them do that. And again, we're seeing ourselves at Amazon. So I'll let Andy add some color on kind of the general trends in AWS, but that's more what we're seeing at the customer level right now."
AMZN,2023-02-02,2023-02-03,,2023-02-02,2023-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2023-02-02,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"So I would just add -- I mean, I think Brian covered a bunch of it. I think most enterprises right now are acting cautiously. You see it with virtually every enterprise, and we're being very thoughtful about streamlining our costs as well. And when you are being cautious, you look for ways that you can find -- you can spend less money. And where companies can cost optimize or, in some cases, they may be used to doing analysis over 90 days of information and they say, ""Well, can I get away with it for 2 weeks, doing 2 weeks' worth,"" it's not necessarily the best thing long term. But a lot of companies will do that when they're in uncertain economic situation.  And the reality is that the way that we've built all our businesses, but AWS in this particular instance, is that we're going to help our customers find a way to spend less money. We are not focused on trying to optimize in any one quarter or any one year, we're trying to build a set of relationships in business that outlast all of us. And so if it's good for our customers to find a way to be more cost effective in an uncertain economy, our team is going to spend a lot of cycles doing that.  And it's one of the advantages that we've talked about since we launched AWS in 2006 of the cloud, which is that when it turns out you have a lot more demand than you anticipated, you can seamlessly scale up. But if it turns out that you don't need as much demand as you had, you can give it back to us and stop paying for it. And that elasticity is very unusual. It's something you can't do on-premises, which is one of the many reasons why the cloud is and AWS are very effective for customers.  I think -- and I've spent a fair bit of time with the AWS team on this, and we look closely at what we see. We have a very robust, healthy customer pipeline, new customers, migrations that are set to happen. A lot of companies during times of discontinuity like this will step back and think about what they want to change strategically to be in a position to reinvent their businesses and change their customer experiences more quickly as uncertain economies emerge, and that often means moving to the cloud. We see a number of those pieces as well.  And we're the only ones that really break out our cloud numbers in a more specific way. So it's always a little bit hard to answer your question about what we see. But we, to our best estimations, when we look at the absolute dollar growth year-over-year, we still have significantly more absolute dollar growth than anybody else we see in this space. And I think some of that's a function of the fact that we just have a lot more capability by a large amount, with stronger security and operational performance and a larger partner ecosystem.  So I think it's also useful to remember that 90% to 95% of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And if you believe that, that equation is going to shift and flip, I don't think on-premises will ever go away, but I really do believe in the next 10 to 15 years that most of it will be in the cloud if we continue to have the best customer experience, which we have to work really hard at an event which we're working to do. It means we have a lot of growth in front of us in the AWS business."

And I believe it was mentioned that customer is spending more on everyday essentials, which may be a relatively new use case. Talk just a little bit more, maybe Andy and Brian, just around how engagement is evolving here for Prime members and really how this has grown wallet share over time and where this is going."
AMZN,2023-02-02,2023-02-03,,2023-02-02,2023-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2023-02-02,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Yes. Thanks, Ron, for your question. I would say that the Prime membership is -- remains strong and so has the dollars purchased per Prime member. It varies a bit by geography. But in general, if you step back, we had some very large video properties that we had launched last year, Thursday Night Football and Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power. Both of them had record sign-ups for Prime membership. And we know that, again, investments like that will help with not only a new member or new Prime member acquisition, but also retention. And we see a direct link between that type of engagement and higher purchases of everyday products on our Amazon website.  So the health of Prime is very strong. As Andy mentioned earlier, we are continuing to work to get our speed of delivery up to get more one-day shipments. And we think that will also be well received by Prime members. But it's a combination of price selection and convenience. I think we've made inroads on all of them, especially with the third-party selection that's been added over the last few years. So I think testament to that is the sales that we had in the fourth quarter. In a very competitive and deal-driven environment, people came, Prime members and others came to Amazon to do their shopping. So we're encouraged by it."

If you think about the value of Prime, which is less than what I just mentioned, where you get the entertainment content on the Prime Video side and you get the shipping benefit, the fast shipping benefit you can't find elsewhere and you get the music benefit, you get the Prime Gaming benefit and you get the photos benefit and you get the Buy with Prime capability, use your Prime subscription on websites beyond just Amazon and some of the grocery benefits that we provide, and RxPass like we just launched to get a number of medications people take regularly for $5 a month unlimited, that is remarkable value that you just don't find elsewhere. And we will continue to add things to Prime and continue to experiment with lots of different features and benefits. But it's still early days. And as we continue to make the service better and better and fully featured, we see people continuing to spend more at Amazon across our various businesses. So we're optimistic about it."

Brian, just any color on why mid-teens is kind of a holdable growth rate for AWS over the next couple of quarters, given what looks like pretty clearly, continuing deterioration in enterprise demand?  And then, Andy, I wonder at a high level if you could just talk about how your priorities may have changed or the company's priorities may have changed over the last year or so as you've been the CEO. And it looks like there's a bit of a peel back on devices, a peel back on physical stores, except for groceries and then maybe a little bit more of a lean in on health. And I'm not quite sure what you're doing with entertainment content spend like that. Maybe it's the same, maybe it's a little bit more. But just at a high level, how would you say your priorities have changed or are different than the prior CEOs?"

You kind of -- this is a bit uncharted territories economically. And as we mentioned, there's some unique things going on with the customer base that I think many in this industry are all seeing the same thing.  So I don't have a crystal ball on that one, but we are going to continue to work for to be there for our customers. And as I said in the earlier comments, we do have new deals. We have new workloads coming to the cloud. The value was there. And whether there's short term, perhaps short-term belt tightening in the infrastructure expense by a lot of companies, I think the long-term trends are still there. And I think the quickest way to save money is to get to the cloud, quite frankly.  So there's a lot of long-term positive in tough economic times. Saw that in 2020 when volumes for customers shifted very quickly. It led to a resurgence after that and probably acceleration of people's journeys to the cloud, and we'll just have to see if that happens again with what we're seeing today."
AMZN,2023-02-02,2023-02-03,,2023-02-02,2023-02-02T17:30:00-05:00,0,2023-02-02,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes. I would say I think for any leadership team, each era is different, and it's often meaningfully impacted by what's happening around you. And I think that if you look at the last couple of years with things like the pandemic and the labor shortage in 2021 and the war in Ukraine and inflation and uncertain economy, good leadership teams look around and try to figure out what that means and how they should adjust their businesses.  And so if you look at -- in the early part of 2022, I think we realized that as we tried to make sure we met the surge in demand for consumers and sellers and having to make decisions in 2020 for what fulfillment network investments we're going to make in 2022, we just had more capacity than we needed. And you saw us in the early part of 2022 delay some of our builds and mothballed some of our facilities to try and be more economic.  And I think when we look at some of our physical business investments, physical store investments, I think there were just some areas where we didn't have conviction that they were going to be big needle movers for Amazon. And so that's why we closed down our 4-Star bookstores. And as we got into the early part of the summer, where we start our operating planning process, we -- and there was a lot of things happening in the macro economy, we started that process with the high-level tenet of we want to find a way to meaningfully streamline our costs in all of our businesses, not just their existing large businesses, but also in some of the investments we're making. We want to actually do a pretty good, thorough look about what we're investing and how much we think we need to, but doing so without having to give up our ability to invest in the key long-term strategic investments that we think could change broad customer experiences and change Amazon over time.  And you saw that process led to us choosing to pause on incremental headcount as we tried to assess what was happening in the economy, and we eliminated some programs in fabric.com and Amazon Care and Amazon Glo and Amazon Explore. We decided to go slower on some -- on the physical store expansion in the grocery space until we had a format that we really believed in rolling out and we went a little bit slower on some devices, and until we made the very hard decision that Brian talked about earlier, which was the hardest decision I think we've all been a part of, which was to reduce or eliminate 18,000 roles. And so those were all done with an eye towards trying to streamline our cost but still be able to invest in the things that we think really matter over the long term.  Now we have a way of looking at investments that is different maybe from some other companies. I'm not saying it's right or wrong. It's just the way we look at it, which is when we think about big areas to invest in, we ask ourselves a few questions. We ask, if we were successful, could it really be big and move the needle at Amazon, which is a high bar at a place like Amazon? Do we think it's being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have some competence in those areas? And if we don't, can we acquire them quickly? And if we like the answers to those questions, we will invest.  Sometimes, that leads to very logical extensions for people. When I got to Amazon 25 years ago, we were a books-only retailer. And when we expanded into music and video and electronics, that seemed pretty natural to people. Amazingly, people were very surprised we were expanding into tools. That seemed far field for people, but it turned out not to be.  When we launch something like Buy with Prime, I think people see that as more predictable. That process has also led us to less predictable investments. And I remember, I had a front-row seat in the AWS experience, having worked with the team and led the team from the very start. And I remember both externally and internally, there were a number of people who wondered why we were doing that. It was so different from retail only. But think about how different a company Amazon would be today if we hadn't invested in AWS.  And so that informs some of the other meaningful investments we're making beyond our stores, in retail and advertising and AWS businesses. I think that while we've gone slower in some devices and things, we still -- when we look at the answers to those 4 questions, we are very enthusiastic about our investments in streaming entertainment devices, our low Earth orbit satellite and Kuiper, health care and a few other things. And I think that do I think every one of our new investments will be successful? History would say that, that would be a long shot. However, it only takes one or two of them becoming the fourth pillar for Amazon for us to be a very different company over time.  So I think it's very worthwhile. We're going to continue to invest. We're going to be very thoughtful about how we streamline our costs, and I think you see a lot of that, but we're also going to continue to invest for the long term."

Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management’s views as of today, April 27, 2023, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today’s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we’ve seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It’s not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Brian."

As Dave mentioned earlier, I’m joined today by Andy Jassy, our CEO. Before we move on to take your questions, I’ll make some comments regarding our Q1 results. Let’s begin with revenue. For the first quarter, our worldwide net sales were $127.4 billion, up 9% year-over-year, or 11% excluding approximately 210 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. This was above the top end of our guidance range. Overall, we are pleased with the growth that we’re seeing in worldwide stores businesses, including quarter-over-quarter revenue acceleration in the International segment, which is helped by easing macroeconomic pressures in Europe. Across the geographies we serve, customers appreciate our focus on staying sharp on pricing, having strong selection and easier convenience, including delivery speeds, which continued to improve throughout the first quarter. That said, the uncertain economic environment and ongoing inflationary pressures continue to be a factor, and we believe it’s continuing to drive cautious spending across consumers. This means our customers are looking to stretch their budgets further and are focused on value. We saw moderated spending on discretionary categories as well as shifts to lower-priced items and healthy demand in everyday essentials, such as consumables and beauty. Third-party sellers, including businesses who elect to utilize Fulfillment by Amazon for their storage and shipping services are a key contributor to the selection offered to customers. We also continued to invest meaningfully in brand protection efforts, including industry-leading technology, so that sellers can trust we will provide a great selling experience free from bad actors. Sellers comprised 59% of overall unit sales in Q1, up from 55% one year ago. We also saw strong engagement in our advertising services with revenue up 23% year-over-year, excluding the impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. In particular, our sponsored product and brand offerings remain a key driver of growth as we work with advertisers to help customers make more informed purchase decisions. Our teams remain focused on delivering performance through our comprehensive and flexible measurement capabilities along with insights that allow advertisers the ability to measure the return on their advertising spend and help them grow their business. In AWS, net sales were $21.4 billion in the first quarter, up 16% year-over-year and representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Given the ongoing economic uncertainty, customers of all sizes in all industries continue to look for cost savings across their businesses, similar to what you’ve seen us doing at Amazon. As expected, customers continue to evaluate ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to these tough economic conditions in the first quarter. And we are seeing these optimizations continue into the second quarter with April revenue growth rates about 500 basis points lower than what we saw in Q1. As a reminder, we’re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We’re working to build customer relationships and a business that will outlast all of us. Therefore, our AWS sales and support teams continue to spend much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so that they can better weather this uncertain economy. This customer orientation is built into our DNA and how we think about our customer relationships and business over the long term. Now, let’s shift to worldwide operating income. For the first quarter, we reported $4.8 billion in operating income, above the top end of our guidance range. This operating income was negatively impacted by an estimated employee severance charge of approximately $470 million in Q1, including $270 million related to AWS. As we finalized our annual planning process and considered the ongoing economic environment, we made the difficult decision to eliminate 9,000 roles, impacting our AWS business as well as Twitch, devices, advertising and our human resources teams. In Q1, our year-over-year growth in stores revenue and unit sales outpaced growth in both our fulfillment expense and our outbound shipping costs. Inflationary pressures continued to ease quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by reductions in linehaul shipping rates as well as lower diesel fuel and electricity costs. We also built on the progress we made throughout 2022 in improving productivity in our fulfillment network through continued process and tech improvements. We exited Q4 with a good balance of labor throughout the network and leveraged that throughout Q1 with customer demand patterns remaining more stable compared to Q1 of last year. As labor availability has stabilized and inventory supply chain challenges have moderated, we’re able to implement some significant structural changes to transition our U.S. fulfillment network to a regionalized model. We believe these improvements put us in a good position to improve both delivery speed and our cost to serve customers over time. We reported overall net income of $3.2 billion in the first quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I’d point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation loss of $467 million included in non-operating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we’ve noted in recent quarters, this activity is not related to Amazon’s ongoing operations but rather to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian’s stock price. Turning to cash flows. We remain focused on building long-term sustainable growth in free cash flow, including our efforts towards a strong cash flow accretive working capital cycle. Our operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended March 31st increased to $54.3 billion, up 38% versus the comparable period year-over-year. Besides the cash benefit of improved profitability year-over-year, we’ve also seen supply chains easing up and made progress to improve our inventory purchasing and payment cycles, which in turn has a positive impact on working capital. Now, let’s turn to our capital investments. We define our capital investments as the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. For the full year 2023, we expect capital investments to be lower than our $59 billion investment level in 2022, primarily driven by an expected year-over-year decrease in fulfillment network investments. We’re continuing to invest in infrastructure to support AWS customer needs, including investments to support Large Language Models and generative AI. Before we open the call up for your questions, I’ll hand it over to Andy to share some high-level perspectives on the first quarter."
AMZN,2023-04-27,2023-04-28,,2023-04-27,2023-04-27T18:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-27,prepared,,Andy Jassy,"Thanks, Brian. I’ll share a few thoughts before opening up for questions. From my perspective, I think there’s a fair bit to like about how our teams are delivering for customers and the results we’re starting to see. In our storage business, we’ve been very focused on reducing our cost to serve in our fulfillment network. As we shared in the past, given the unexpected surge in demand during the pandemic, we doubled the size of our fulfillment center footprint and largely built the transportation network the size of UPS in a couple of years. This ended up substantially changing the number of nodes and connections in our fulfillment network. And as a result, we spent the last several months not only redesigning dozens of processes to drive better productivity but also re-architecting our placement approach and larger fulfillment center footprint to move from a national fulfillment network in the U.S. to a regional one. It means we’ve created 8 interconnected regions in geographic areas with each of these regions having broad relevant selection to operate in a largely self-sufficient way while still being able to ship nationally when necessary. We just recently completed this rollout and are quite bullish on the early results. Not surprisingly, shorter travel distances means lower cost to serve and customers getting their orders faster. And while on the topic of delivery speed, we’re really excited about our progress in providing customers more one-day and same-day deliveries and are on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023. On the advertising side, we’re continuing to buck wider advertising trends and deliver robust growth. I think there are a few reasons for it. First, even in difficult economies, most people still shop. And with the largest e-commerce shopping venue, we have a lot of customers that companies seek to reach. That, coupled with our very substantial investment in machine learning to make sure customers see relevant ads when they’re looking for various items, have meant that these advertisements have performed unusually well for brands, which makes them want to advertise on Amazon. It’s also worth noting that we’re still very early in our efforts to find a way to thoughtfully place ads in our broader video, live sports, audio and grocery properties. We have a lot of upside still in advertising. In AWS, what we’re seeing is enterprises continuing to be cautious in their spending in this uncertain time. Customers are looking for ways to save money however they can right now. They tell us that most of it is cost optimizing versus cost cutting, which is an interesting distinction because they say they’re cost optimizing to reallocate those resources on new customer experiences. One of the great attributes of the cloud is that you can scale seamlessly up or down as demand dictates, which is not the case with on-premise’ infrastructure. Customers want help finding ways to spend less during this challenging time. And given that it’s best for customers long term, we’ve been actively helping customers make these adjustments. We’ve spent a fair bit of time analyzing what we’re seeing, and I’ve spent a good chunk of time myself looking as well, and we like the fundamentals of what we’re seeing in AWS. The new customer pipeline looks strong. The set of ongoing migrations of workloads to AWS is strong. The product innovation and delivery is rapid and compelling. And people sometimes forget that 90-plus percent of global IT spend is still on-premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it’s going to move to the cloud. And having the cloud infrastructure offering with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, the best securing operational performance and the largest partner ecosystem bodes well for us moving forward. But we’re not close to being done inventing in AWS. Our recent announcement on Large Language Models and generative AI and the chips and managed services associated with them is another recent example. And in my opinion, few folks appreciate how much new cloud business will happen over the next several years from the pending deluge of machine learning that’s coming. This past year has seen us do a fair bit of cost streamlining. As I mentioned in my recent shareholder letter, we took a deep look across the Company and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative’s long-term potential to drive enough revenue, operating income, free cash flow and return on invested capital. In some cases, it led us to shuttering certain businesses like our physical bookstores, Forestar Stores, Amazon Fabric, Amazon Care and certain devices where we didn’t see a path to meaningful returns. In other cases, we looked at some programs that weren’t producing the returns we’d hoped, an example of free shipping for all online grocery orders over $35 and changed them. We also made the very difficult decision to eliminate about 27,000 corporate roles. Like most leadership teams, we’ll continue to evaluate what we’re seeing in our business and proceed adaptively. But while we’ve taken several actions to streamline our costs, we’ve been able to do so while still pursuing the key strategic long-term investments that we believe can meaningfully make customers’ lives better and potentially change what Amazon is. These are investments both in our larger business as mentioned earlier as well as in areas like international expansion in our stores business, large retail market segments in which we’re still nascent like grocery and business-to-business, allowing consumers to use Prime off of Amazon in our Buy with Prime program, entertainment, devices, health care and our Low Earth Orbit satellite for the hundreds of millions of households, companies and government entities that have limited to no connectivity. It’s hard to predict that all of these will be successful but only one or two working would change our business over the long term. We have a lot of work in front of us, but I like the direction we’re headed and strongly believe our best days are in front of us. And with that, I’ll open it up for questions."

AMZN,2023-04-27,2023-04-28,,2023-04-27,2023-04-27T18:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-27,qa,,Doug Anmuth,"Andy, you talked about the continued optimization. Just curious, can you talk about the degree to which optimization has been done in AWS versus what you think could still lie ahead, and when do you start to lap some of those efforts? And then also on the CapEx side, I think you said overall CapEx would be down in ‘23. Can you just help us understand that a little bit better between retail and AWS? And then what’s required on CapEx from a generative AI and large language model perspective? Thanks."
AMZN,2023-04-27,2023-04-28,,2023-04-27,2023-04-27T18:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-27,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"This is Brian. I’ll take the first -- the second part of that question first. On CapEx, we spent $59 million -- $59 billion, excuse me, last year. And we -- on our core fulfillment and transportation areas, we actually are spending less year-over-year, and those estimates are going down. The GAAP or the increases in AWS and infrastructure and we are adding more dollars to the -- for Large Language Models and generative AI. So, we’re creating some space in our fulfillment and transportation number that has been repurposed over to AWS. We still think the combined CapEx will be lower year-over-year."
AMZN,2023-04-27,2023-04-28,,2023-04-27,2023-04-27T18:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-27,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Just on your first question, Doug. It’s hard to say exactly where we are in the process. I think that what we continue to see when we talk with customers is that they’re appropriately cautious about what they’re seeing in the economy. They’re trying to find ways to save money as most companies are, including our own. And we have a long track-record, which we continue to pursue, which I think makes sense for customers and for our business long term that we’re not trying to optimize for a quarter or for a year. We’re going to do whatever it takes to help customers be successful over a long period of time because we’re trying to build relationships in a business that outlast to all of us. And so, we’re spending a lot of time with customers trying to help them think of smart ways, not short-term ways, but smart ways to optimize their costs and to be able to scale up and down. And again, one of the big advantages of the cloud is that if you grow quickly, you can seamlessly scale up. But when you don’t have the demand, you can give it back to us and stop paying for it, and that is not true with what you see on-premises. And so we’re trying to work hard to help customers with that. I think it’s important to remember that customers are pretty explicitly telling us that this is not a cost cutting effort where we intend on spending less money on technology or on the cloud. This is our reprioritizing what matters most to our business at this time and trying to reallocate resource so we can build new customer experience [and change what’s possible] (ph). And so, I think if you think about -- those projects, by the way, take time to build. When you’re reallocating, you’re reprioritizing, you’re redefining what you’re going to build, you got to actually go build it before you can implement it. And we’re working pretty carefully and closely with customers on those initiatives. I think it’s important to remember that there’s still so much growth ahead of the cloud, 90-plus percent of the global IT spend is on-premises. And so if you believe that equation is going to flip, it’s mostly moving to the cloud. And I also think that there are a lot of folks that don’t realize the amount of non-consumption right now that’s going to happen and be spent in the cloud with the advent of Large Language Models and generative AI. I think so many customer experiences are going to be reinvented and invented that haven’t existed before. And that’s all going to be spent in my opinion, on the cloud."

Can you give us an update on where you think you are in those broad efforts to match margins versus pre-pandemic levels and strike the right balance between profitability and driving your growth initiatives over the next couple of years? Thanks so much."

So I think we would describe ourselves as like along on the journey and making solid progress on recovering our cost structure and getting it back to pre-pandemic levels. Andy’s talked about the efforts in operations and the regionalization of our operations. We’ve obviously taken a hard look at all of our businesses that we’re in over the last 6 to 9 months and have made adjustments there. But there’s still a lot ahead of us, especially on the operational side that if you look at our operating margin in North America, for example North America segment, it was 1.2% this quarter, pre-pandemic that number was in the 4% to 6% range broadly. So, it’s a bit of marker on how much upside. But there’s a lot of moving parts in that number. Obviously, there’s the advertising, there’s investments going on for future growth, and there’s the core profitability and cost structure that our operations are achieving. So, making progress, working hard at it, but it’s a longer road than bouncing back in one or two quarters."
AMZN,2023-04-27,2023-04-28,,2023-04-27,2023-04-27T18:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-27,qa,,Andy Jassy,"I would just add to that we have looked pretty hard at every single one of our businesses. And I think that while it’s probably most visible given the size of it, what’s the improvement in the operating margin and the efficiency in our stores business, I think every business is working really hard on finding ways to be more efficient. And as Brian said, I think we’re making really, really good progress, the fulfillment costs in our operations network and our stores business. But one of the things that’s been interesting and frankly pretty encouraging to all of us is that as we -- over the last 6 to 9 months, as the network fundamentally changed, remember, when you go through as much growth as we went through and you add -- you double your fulfillment center footprint and you also build a last-mile transportation network the size of UPS in a couple of years, there’s a lot that you have to work on to get that as productive as you want. And we’ve spent a lot of time working on that the last 6 to 9 months. But some of the ways that you operated before, which worked through several elbows in the curve and scale, when they become inefficient because the network fundamentally changes, they become inefficient in a significant way. And so it’s part of what led to the regionalization effort that I talked about, but it also caused us to really reevaluate virtually everything we do in operations over the last 6 to 9 months. And we have found a lot more opportunities than we even thought were there before. So, I’m pretty optimistic that we have a chance not just to recover to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of operating margin, but I think there’s additional upside with some of the opportunities we’ve identified."

AMZN,2023-04-27,2023-04-28,,2023-04-27,2023-04-27T18:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-27,qa,,Brian Nowak,"I have two, Andy. The first one, you talked a lot about the long-term AI and large language model potential out of AWS. I think there’s a lot of discussion about AWS’s competitive positioning when it comes to these tools. Could you just sort of walk us through 2 or 3 of the key points of differentiation that you think AWS offers and AI tools versus some of the competitors? And then the second one around Echo and Alexa. The neural networks may not be a leading edge of technology now with the rapid emergence of some of these new Large Language Models. How do you think about the key investment priorities for Echo and Alexa going forward? And what’s your view on ROIC around that division? Thanks."
AMZN,2023-04-27,2023-04-28,,2023-04-27,2023-04-27T18:00:00-04:00,0,2023-04-27,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Yes. I’ll try and answer those together because they’re somewhat related. I think when you think about machine learning, it’s useful to remember that we have had a pretty substantial investment in machine learning for 25-plus years in Amazon. It’s deeply ingrained in virtually everything we do. It fuels our personalized e-commerce recommendations. It drives the Pick Pass in our fulfillment centers. We have it in our Go stores. We have it in our Prime Air, our drones. It’s obviously in Alexa. And then AWS, we have 25-plus machine learning services where we have the broadest machine learning functionality and customer base by a fair bit. And so, it is deeply ingrained in our heritage. I think if you look at what’s happened over the last 9 months or so is that these Large Language Models and generative AI capabilities, they’ve been around for a while, but frankly, the models were not that compelling before about 6, 9 months ago. And they have gotten so much bigger and so much better, much more quickly that it really presents a remarkable opportunity to transform virtually every customer experience that exists and many that don’t exist that weren’t really that easily made possible before. And so, it’s very early days in that space, but probably not surprisingly, we’ve been investing in building in our own Large Language Models for several years, and we have a very large investment across the Company. And the way I would break it out, Brian, is I would say that there’s three macro areas in this space. If you think about maybe the bottom layer here, is that all of the Large Language Models are going to run on compute. And the key to that compute is going to be the chip that’s in that compute. And to date, I think a lot of the chips there, particularly GPUs, which are optimized for this type of workload, they’re expensive and they’re scarce. It’s hard to find enough capacity. And so, in AWS, we’ve been working for several years on building customized machine learning chips, and we built a chip that’s specialized for training -- machine learning training, which we call Trainium, a chip that’s specialized for inference or the predictions that come from the model called Inferentia. The reality, by the way, is that most people are spending most of their time and money on the training. But as these models graduate to production, where they’re in the apps, all the spend is going to be in inference. So, they both matter a lot. And if you look at -- we just released our second versions of both Trainium and Inferentia. And the combination of price and performance that you can get from those chips is pretty differentiated and very significant. So we think that a lot of that machine learning training, inference will run on AWS. Then if you think about -- so you have to train the models, you have to run the inference, then you got to -- but you have to build the models. And if you look at the really significant leading Large Language Models, they take many years to build and many billions of dollars to build. And there will be a small number of companies that want to invest that time and money, and we’ll be one of them at Amazon, but most companies don’t. And so what most companies really want and what they tell AWS is that they’d like to use one of those foundational models and then have the ability to customize it for their own proprietary data and their own needs and customer experience. And they want to do it in a way where they don’t leak their unique IP to the broader generalized model. And that’s what Bedrock is, which we just announced a week ago or so. It’s a managed foundational model service where people can run foundational models from Amazon, which we’re exposing ourselves, which we call Titan. Or they can run it from leading Large Language Models providers like AI21 and Anthropic and Stability AI. And they can run those models, take the baseline, customize them for their own purposes and then be able to run it with the same security and privacy and all the features they use for the rest of their applications in AWS. That’s very compelling for customers. And then that third layer are really the applications that are going to be built on top of those Large Language Models. So, ChatGPT is a good example of an application that’s being built. We’ll build some of those applications ourselves. So for instance, we think one of the most compelling applications that are going to be built in generative AI have to do with making developers much more effective with coding assistance. And so, we built something called CodeWhisperer, which we just announced the general availability for, where developers can plug in a natural language, something like -- I want to build a video hosting website. And CodeWhisperer will bring up the code you need and the developer needs to employ and put that in production, which is really compelling. If you think about how much more productive a developer is going to be and what they’re going to spend their time on instead of rewriting code that as [Indiscernible] takes time, I think it’s a big deal. Now, to your second question, and it’s related to this top layer I was just talking about, we’re going to build a very -- every single one of our businesses inside Amazon are building on top of Large Language Models to reinvent our customer experiences, and you’ll see it in every single one of our businesses, stores, advertising, devices, entertainment. And devices, which was your specific question, is a good example of that. I think when people often ask us about Alexa, what we often share is that if we were just building a smart speaker, it would be a much smaller investment. But we have a vision, which we have conviction about that we want to build the world’s best personal assistant. And to do that, it’s difficult. It’s across a lot of domains and it’s a very broad surface area. However, if you think about the advent of Large Language Models and generative AI, it makes the underlying models that much more effective such that I think it really accelerates the possibility of building that world’s best personal assistant. And I think we start from a pretty good spot with Alexa because we have a couple of hundred million endpoints being used across entertainment and shopping and smart home and information and a lot of involvement from third-party ecosystem partners. And we’ve had a large language model underneath it, but we’re building one that’s much larger and much more generalized and capable. And I think that’s going to really rapidly accelerate our vision of becoming the world’s best personal assistant. I think there’s a significant business model underneath it."

If you could maybe add a little more color on some of the initiatives and improvements there. And then secondly, on the physical stores, including the grocery strategy, maybe any be worth kind of going through any updated thoughts you have there around the strategy of optimizing stores across categories. And if there are any changes to the footprint plans for those businesses? Thank you."

So yes, we saw an acceleration of growth on an FX-neutral basis, 9% versus 5% in Q4. I think the economy there is starting to stabilize and especially in established countries of Europe. We’re seeing consumer confidence has increased and inflation is ticking down. So some of those are similar to North America. But that is what we probably had some upside that we weren’t counting on in international in the first quarter, and that was a good strength. On the margin, the margin has -- the negative margin has come down. Top line is helping there but it’s also a function of some of the reductions that we’re making across some of our investments. Most of those are in North America, but that you’ll see kind of the improvement in operational efficiency and on the edge of some of the global programs are going to be reducing cost in international. I will remind you that, again, that international is an aggregation of established countries which are already profitable and who look a bit like North America, perhaps at an earlier stage of development and working their way to parity on profitability. We have forward-loaded Prime benefits in a lot of these countries that are ahead of the curve that we saw in North America. So happy there. We have a large emerging business. In the last 5 years, we’ve added more than 10 new countries. What we’re seeing is if you looked back to North America long ago, it took 9 years for us to reach breakeven profitability in the United States. We see a similar curve in a lot of countries overseas. There’s, in fact, additional challenges that we usually have to deal with, things like lack of payment methods, lack of the established infrastructure for -- especially for transportation and infrastructure for the internet and everything else. So, the adoption can be slower but we feel good about the businesses we’re building. They carry a lot of the same traits that we have in North America. Price selection and convenience are at the core of that, very happy with the adoption and traffic and new customer acquisition that we’re seeing from Prime Video in a lot of their emerging countries as well. So good quarter. We’ll continue to work again on cost structure and growing those businesses country by country. On the grocery part, what I would say is we continue to progress there. We have an interesting grocery business where we’ve been in it for a while and we have actually quite a large grocery business. It’s just an unusual selection grocery business, very much like how the mass merchandisers got into grocery 25, 30 years ago, where the selection -- are items that are not temperature-controlled, so it’s canned goods and packaged food and paper products and pet supplies and personal care and health and beauty and all sorts of consumables. And interestingly, in this current environment where consumers are being cautious about what they spend and finding ways to trade down in different product variations, consumables have stayed very, very strong. And so, we continue to be very pleased with that -- that part of our grocery business to serve a much broader number of the grocery shopping journeys, which we seek to try to help customers with. We have to have a bigger physical presence since most of the shopping visits are still physical stores. We’ve got two efforts there. We’ve got Whole Foods, which really pioneered the organic grocery space. And that continues to grow nicely, and we’ve made a number of changes in the last year of the business that have changed the profitability trajectory there and feel very good about that. And at the same time, it is still a portion of the overall market segment. And if you really want to serve as much of grocery as we’d like to, you have to have a mass physical offering. And that’s what we’ve been working on for a few years with the brand we’ve called Amazon Fresh. We wish we were further along at this point. We’ve tried lots of ideas. We haven’t yet found conviction around the format that we want to go expand much more broadly. We have a set of experiments and ideas and concepts that we’re working on across our dozens of stores there. And we’re pretty optimistic that we have something that may very well work. And we’re hopeful over this next year we find that. But we continue to believe -- it’s a big business for us today. It’s continuing to get bigger, but we believe we have the opportunity for it to be much larger for Amazon and where we can help customers more broadly. And I think having that physical presence, we will also have the ability both to be able to serve the grocery products they come for as well as store some other pieces and help customers across some other product lines as well."

On AWS, I think Andy did a good job of laying out the dynamics we’re seeing in -- among customers right now and where they’re cutting workloads and continued strength that we see in customers hitting their contractual limits and extending them and planning for the future. So, we feel really strongly about the outlook for the business and understand the short-term work that we’re doing to help customers save money. So, I would say Q2 versus Q1, there’s not an obvious year-over-year comp differential. It’s just, again, understanding which customers are cutting in some areas and growing in others and helping them get on hopefully to the new initiatives that they are planning as well."

In terms of the calling out health care and Kuiper in my annual letter, I think what I was trying to do in the letter was explain how we think about investing -- and how we think about our big new investments that we make. And I talked about in the letter that we look at a few things. We look at if -- if it’s successful, could it be big and move the needle for Amazon with the right ROICs? Is that experience being well served today elsewhere? Do we have some kind of differentiation? And do we have some confidence that the Company in that area? If not, can we acquire it quickly? And we’d like the answers to those questions, we will invest. Some of those investments lead to what seem like relatively straightforward investments. And I talked a little bit about category expansion and international expansion in our stores business and some of the nascent retail market segments that are large for us that we think we can have big businesses in and business to business, our Amazon business entity and grocery and things like Buy with Prime, which allow our consumers to use their Prime Benefit and other third-party websites beyond Amazon and also let merchants convert at a higher rate because Prime members are able to pay quickly and then get that fast, reliable shipping they get from Prime. But then there are other investments I was pointing out that sometimes don’t lead to categories that people might initially guess. And AWS was a good example of that where that seemed really different for us when we started to pursue that in 2003. And we’re a pretty different company because we did so, even though there were a lot of people externally and internally that thought was a little bit crazy. And so I just chose two of them there. I could have chosen a lot more. The letter was long enough as it was, so I just chose two but I chose two that we have conviction about. On the health care side, when you think about that set of questions that we ask ourselves when we consider whether we should make big investments, health care is a multitrillion dollar business that’s very segmented, and it’s really broken in the U.S. particularly, I think in other parts of the world, too, but particularly in the U.S. And we had what we thought were some differentiated ways that we could be successful at. And I think when -- our customers have been asking us for years to provide a pharmacy. And if you think about that, it’s not -- that’s a pretty natural extension from what we do in retail, and we’ve launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020 and I think it’s off to a good start. It’s continuing to grow. We have a lot to do there. But a lot of our customers who like that experience said, ""Gosh, I wish you guys would help us in the broader health care experience."" And if you think about trying to meaningfully change that experience, primary care is right at the center of it. And if you look at the experience that’s been the case for the last several decades, we’re going to have a hard time convincing our grandkids that it used to be the case to get a primary care appointment, you had to call ahead of time, a month ahead to schedule an appointment and drive 20 minutes to the doctor and park and get into the facility and wait 20 minutes in reception. And you get into an exam room, you wait 10 minutes for the doctor to come in. The doctor talks to you for 5 minutes and then prescribes you medicine where you drive 20 minutes to go get the medicine. And that experience just doesn’t make sense and won’t be the case. And so, we looked at -- we had some experience when we started experimenting with Amazon Care, and we couldn’t believe how much people liked the streamlined experience. And we ultimately decided we didn’t have the right business model there. But we came across one medical where the digital app is very compelling and you can talk to a medical practitioner by chat or by video conference, or if you have to come into a physical facility, they have clinics around the country and you can get that appointment same day or next day. In all those cities, they have relationships with health specialists, where you’re plugged into. Their ability to get reservations where you can get reservations in a day or two there. And then when you need medicine, you can have it automatically shipped to you by Amazon Pharmacy or other third-party pharmacies. It’s a very, very different experience. And we think we have an opportunity to be successful in helping change that experience. And if we’re successful with primary care and with health -- and with pharmacy, there are a lot of other things we can help customers with as well. So, we think that’s a big opportunity. And then I’ll just briefly say on Kuiper that it’s a very large number. It’s hundreds of millions of households and businesses and government entities that today have limited to no connectivity to the internet. And if you just think about what you can’t do if you don’t have connectivity, we all take it for granted. But having that connectivity means you can take online education courses and get an education, or you can start or run a business or you can enjoy entertainment or you can shop for anything you can imagine. And for businesses and governments, to be able to have that coverage to be able to operate much more seamlessly in the various environments in which you have to have a presence, it’s a total game changer. And so, we think it has the chance to be a very large business. We haven’t -- we’ve released some information about it in some of our designs. And it’s pretty exciting to us how many customers in all those different segments are excited about it. And so, I just chose those two as exemplary of some of the inventions that come out of that investment process that you might not guess but that we think can be very significant for the Company."

Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, August 3, 2023 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Andy."
AMZN,2023-08-03,2023-08-04,,2023-08-03,2023-08-03T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-08-03,prepared,,Andrew Jassy,"Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we are reporting $134.4 billion in revenue and $7.7 billion in operating income, both of which exceeded the top end of our guidance ranges. We're encouraged by the progress we're making on several key priorities, namely: lowering our cost to serve in our stores business; continuing to innovate on and improve our various customer experiences; and building new customer experiences that can meaningfully change what's possible for customers in our business long term. I'll start with our ongoing effort to lower our cost to serve in our stores' fulfillment network. Q2 saw another meaningful improvement in this area as we have steadily made progress for the last several quarters. Central to our efforts has been the decision to transition our stores' fulfillment and transportation network from one national network in the United States to a series of eight separate regions serving smaller geographic areas. We keep a broad selection of inventory in each region, making it faster and less expensive to get those products to customers. Regionalization is working and has delivered a 20% reduction in number of touches for our delivered package, a 19% reduction in miles traveled to deliver packages to customers and more than 1,000 basis point increase in deliveries fulfilled within region, which is now at 76%. This is a lot of progress. Sometimes I hear people make the argument that Amazon is chasing faster speed, while driving its costs higher and where it doesn't matter much to customers. This argument is incorrect.  There are two things to note. First, customers care a lot about faster delivery. We have a lot of data that shows when we make faster delivery promises on a detail page, customers purchase more often, not just a little higher, meaningfully higher. It's also true that when customers know they can get their items really quickly, it changes their consideration of using us for future purchases too. Second, when shipments come from fulfillment centers that are closer to customers, they travel shorter distances, which cost less in transportation, gets there faster and is better for the environment. There's a lot of goodness in that equation. This ability to have shipments closer to customers is the result of a lot of work and invention on the regionalization side, placement logic and local in-stock algorithms. It's also driven by our development and expansion of same-day fulfillment facilities, which is our fastest fulfillment mechanism and one of our least expensive, too. Our same-day facilities are located in the largest metro areas around the U.S., so our top-moving 100,000 SKUs, but also cover millions of other SKUs from nearby fulfillment centers that inject selection into these same-day facilities and have a design that streamlines getting items from order to being ready for delivery in as little as 11 minutes. The experience has been so positive for customers in our business that we're planning to double the number of these facilities. We believe that we are far from the law of diminishing returns and improving speed for customers. While we're seeing strong early results from this regionalization effort, we still see several ways in which we can be more efficient in this structure and we believe will improve productivity further. We've also reevaluated virtually every part of our fulfillment network this past year and see additional structural changes we can make that provide future upside. We're excited about this cost to serve improvement, but also remain maniacally focused on making customers' lives easier and better every day and relentlessly inventing to make it so. This means constantly trying to improve experiences that we can deliver to customers short and long term. This customer experience work is at the heart of what we do every day across every one of our businesses. And I can spend an hour on this call detailing various examples across the teams. For today, I'll just focus a bit on our stores and AWS businesses. For stores, our priorities continue to be providing customers with great selection, low prices and convenience. And as we've discussed, we've been especially focused on providing even faster delivery speeds. Our speed of delivery has never been faster. In this last quarter, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, more than half of Prime members' orders arrived at the same day or next day. So far this year, we've delivered more than 1.8 billion units to U.S. Prime members the same or next day, nearly 4x what we delivered at those speeds by this point in 2019. Lowering our cost to serve allows us not only to invest in these speed improvements, but also add more selection at lower price points. In particular, we're growing our selection in everyday essentials, enabling customers to avoid going out to get these items and both increasing our basket sizes and the frequency with which customers choose to shop with us. We now have more than 300 million items available with U.S. Prime free shipping, including tens of millions of items with free same-day and 1-day delivery. We're continuing to focus on providing great value with tens of millions of deals that help customers stretch their dollar a little more. For instance, in Q2 of '23, we offered customers 144% more deals and coupons than we did in Q2 of 2022. Prime Day was similar. Amazon offered more deals than any past Prime Day event with a wide selection across millions of products. Prime members purchased more than 375 million items worldwide and saved more than $2.5 billion across the Amazon store, helping make it the biggest Prime Day ever. Next, a few words about AWS. AWS remains the clear cloud infrastructure leader with a significant leadership position with respect to number of customers, size of partner ecosystem, breadth of functionality and the strongest operational performance. These are important factors for why AWS has grown the way it has over the last several years and for why AWS has almost doubled the revenue of any other provider. I've talked to many AWS customers over the years and continue to do so. And while all these factors I mentioned have been big drivers of the business' success, AWS customers tell us that as importantly, they care about the very different customer focus and orientation in AWS may see elsewhere. As the economy has been uncertain over the last year, AWS customers have needed assistance cost optimizing to withstand this challenging time and reallocate spend to newer initiatives that better drive growth. We've proactively helped customers do this. And while customers have continued to optimize during the second quarter, we've started seeing more customers shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. As a result, we've seen AWS' revenue growth rate stabilize during Q2 where we reported 12% year-over-year growth. The AWS team continues to innovate and change what's possible for customers at a rapid clip. You can see across the array of AWS product categories where AWS leads in compute, networking, storage, database, data solutions and machine learning, among other areas, and the continued invention and delivery in these areas is pretty unusual. For instance, a few years ago, we heard consistently from customers that they wanted to find more price performance ways to do generalized compute. And to enable that, we realized that we needed to rethink things all the way down to the silicon and set out to design our own general purpose CPU chips. Today, more than 50,000 customers use AWS' Graviton chips and AWS Compute instances, including 98 of our top 100 Amazon EC2 customers, and these chips have about 40% better price performance than other leading x86 processors. The same sort of reimagining is happening in generative AI right now. Generative AI has captured people's imagination, but most people are talking about the application layer, specifically what OpenAI has done with ChatGPT. It's important to remember that we're in the very early days of the adoption and success of generative AI, and that consumer applications is only one layer of the opportunity. We think of large language models in generative AI as having 3 key layers, all of which are very large in our opinion and all of which AWS is investing heavily in. At the lowest layer is the compute required to train foundational models and do inference or make predictions. Customers are excited by Amazon EC2 P5 instances powered by NVIDIA H100 GPUs to train large models and develop generative AI applications. However, to date, there's only been one viable option in the market for everybody and supply has been scarce. That, along with the chip expertise we've built over the last several years, prompted us to start working several years ago on our own custom AI chips for training called Trainium and inference called Inferentia that are on their second versions already and are a very appealing price performance option for customers building and running large language models. We're optimistic that a lot of large language model training and inference will be run on AWS' Trainium and Inferentia chips in the future. We think of the middle layer as being large language models as a service. Stepping back for a second, to develop these large language models, it takes billions of dollars and multiple years to develop. Most companies tell us that they don't want to consume that resource building themselves. Rather, they want access to those large language models, want to customize them with their own data without leaking their proprietary data into the general model, have all the security, privacy and platform features in AWS work with this new enhanced model and then have it all wrapped in a managed service. This is what our service Bedrock does and offers customers all of these aforementioned capabilities with not just one large language model but with access to models from multiple leading large language model companies like Anthropic, Stability AI, AI21 Labs, Cohere and Amazon's own developed large language models called Titan. Customers, including Bridgewater Associates, Coda, Lonely Planet, Omnicom, 3M, Ryanair, Showpad and Travelers are using Amazon Bedrock to create generative AI application. And we just recently announced new capabilities from Bedrock, including new models from Cohere, Anthropic's Claude 2 and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 as well as agents for Amazon Bedrock that allow customers to create conversational agents to deliver personalized up-to-date answers based on their proprietary data and to execute actions. If you think about these first 2 layers I've talked about, what we're doing is democratizing access to generative AI, lowering the cost of training and running models, enabling access to large language model of choice instead of there only being one option, making it simpler for companies of all sizes and technical acumen to customize their own large language model and build generative AI applications in a secure and enterprise-grade fashion, these are all part of making generative AI accessible to everybody and very much what AWS has been doing for technology infrastructure over the last 17 years. Then that top layer is where a lot of the publicity and attention have focused, and these are the actual applications that run on top of these large language models. As I mentioned, ChatGPT is an example. We believe one of the early compelling generative AI applications is a coding companion. It's why we built Amazon CodeWhisperer, an AI-powered coding companion, which recommends code snippets directly in the code editor, accelerating developer productivity as they code. It's off to a very strong start and changes the game with respect to developer productivity. Inside Amazon, every one of our teams is working on building generative AI applications that reinvent and enhance their customers' experience. But while we will build a number of these applications ourselves, most will be built by other companies, and we're optimistic that the largest number of these will be built on AWS. Remember, the core of AI is data. People want to bring generative AI models to the data, not the other way around. AWS not only has the broadest array of storage, database, analytics and data management services for customers, it also has more customers and data store than anybody else. Coupled with providing customers with unmatched choices at these 3 layers of the generative AI stack as well as Bedrock's enterprise-grade security that's required for enterprises to feel comfortable putting generative AI applications into production, we think AWS is poised to be customers' long-term partner of choice in generative AI. We're also continuing to make meaningful progress in building new customer experiences that can meaningfully change what's possible for customers in our business long term. Amazon Business is one of our fastest-growing offerings with a $35 billion annual gross sales run rate. And the team is working hard to further build out the selection, value, convenience and features that business customers need. Buy with Prime is continuing to show a lot of progress. Merchants in early trials who use Buy with Prime saw their shopper conversion increased by 25% on average, which makes a real difference to their business. Also, merchants who participate in Prime Day activities, in aggregate, experienced a 10x increase in daily Buy with Prime orders during the sales event period versus the month before we announced Prime Day. It's frankly only been a short amount of time that we've decided to invest significantly in the health care market segment. A lot of what we tried before were smaller experiments. But we're pleased with Amazon Pharmacy doubling its active customers in the past year, and we're pleased with the response to RxPass, which enables Prime members to receive all of their eligible generic medications for just $5 a month and have them delivered free to their door. One Medical has been part of Amazon for just a few months now and we're encouraged by what we're seeing there, too. Our grocery business continues to grow. We already have a very large business in nontemperature-controlled areas like consumables, pet food, beauty and canned goods that continues to grow as we keep increasing speed and lowering our cost to serve, which allows us to sell more items more cost effectively. Whole Foods continues to lead the organic grocery space, is growing at a healthy clip and has meaningfully improved its profitability in the last year. We're pleased with what we're seeing with Whole Foods. And as I've shared before, we're working on new formats in our mass physical store offering, Amazon Fresh, having significantly improved the number of the key business inputs and just rolled out new concepts in stores. We also see substantial innovation and progress in other areas like Kuiper, Zoox and Alexa. We're still relatively early in many of our investments with technology inventions that are changing what's possible to deliver for customers in these areas, but they're big long-term opportunities that we remain optimistic about. Finally, I want to recognize our teams on being named 1 in LinkedIn's Top Companies to Grow your Career in the United States. It's a testament to our work to be a great employer with leading compensation benefits and upskilling opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."
AMZN,2023-08-03,2023-08-04,,2023-08-03,2023-08-03T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-08-03,prepared,,Brian Olsavsky,"Thank you, Andy. As Andy mentioned, we saw worldwide revenue of $134.4 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year and above the top end of our guidance range. We are encouraged by the strength in our reported revenue, which is another proof point that our focus on price, selection and convenience continues to resonate with customers. We continue to see healthy demand across everyday essentials and in categories like beauty and health and personal care and have seen a positive customer response to improvements in personalization and enhancements to our website and mobile app. During the quarter, we also saw improvements in macroeconomic indicators across our North America and international segments, but continue to see customers trading down and seeking value in their purchases. Delivery speed has been a key area of focus over the last several quarters, and we reached record levels during Q2. Prime members love the faster ship speeds and are shopping more often. Advertising revenue remained strong, up 22% year-over-year. Our performance-based advertising offerings continue to be the largest contributor to our growth. Our teams worked to increase the relevancy of the ads we show to our customers by leveraging machine learning and improve our ability to measure the return on advertising spend for brands. Third-party unit mix increased to 60% during the quarter, the highest level we've ever seen, and we're continuing to see good growth in the number of sellers and the unit sold per seller. We're making steady progress on improving our worldwide stores profitability. Since North America segment operating margins bottomed out in Q1 of 2022, we have seen 5 consecutive quarters of improvement, with second quarter operating margin of 3.9%. This is an improvement of 620 basis points over these past 5 quarters. One of the largest drivers of this operating income improvement in the stores business has been reducing our cost to serve, with shipping costs and fulfillment costs continuing to grow at a slower pace than our unit growth. Most recently, regionalization is an important contributor. Faster delivery speed from better network connectivity and better inventory placement means less miles traveled and fewer touches, resulting in less cost. And while we are pleased with the progress we have made, we see more opportunity to drive improved cost efficiencies going forward. Moving to the international segment. Since our operating margin loss bottomed out in Q3 of last year, we have seen 3 consecutive quarters of improvement, with a second quarter margin loss of negative 3%. This is an improvement of 590 basis points over the last 3 quarters. This segment also includes our emerging countries. It is important to remember how early we are in some of these marketplaces. We've launched more than 10 countries in the past 6 years and are always evaluating our customer experience as well as our path to profitability, and we like the path we're on. As a reminder, it took us 9 years to reach profitability in the United States. In addition, across our North America and international results, inflation headwinds also continue to ease, most notably in fuel prices, linehaul rates, ocean and rail rates. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth was 12%, with growth rates stabilizing during Q2. We are encouraged by the strength of our customer pipeline and believe having a large diverse customer base that is mostly cost optimized sets us up well for future growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow was positive and improved for the fourth sequential quarter. Our financial focus remains on driving long-term sustainable free cash flows. The largest driver of the recent improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income, most notably in the North America and international segments where, as I said, we've made meaningful improvement in our fulfillment network productivity and operating leverage and benefited from moderating inflationary pressures. We've also seen improvements in our working capital contributions to free cash flow. Over the past couple of years, working capital hasn't been as efficient as we've held higher weeks of cover of inventory in the face of supply chain disruptions. Most recently, as these disruptions continue to ease, we are improving our inventory efficiency, resulting in improvements in our working capital. We will remain focused on continued free cash flow improvement moving forward. Next, let's turn to our capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of capital expenditures plus equipment finance leases. These investments were $54 billion for the trailing 12-month period ended June 30, down from $61 billion in the comparable prior year period. Looking ahead to the full year 2023, we expect capital investments to be slightly more than $50 billion compared to $59 billion in 2022. We expect fulfillment and transportation CapEx to be down year-over-year, partially offset by increased infrastructure CapEx to support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments related to generative AI and large language model efforts.  With that, let's move on to your questions."

AMZN,2023-08-03,2023-08-04,,2023-08-03,2023-08-03T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-08-03,qa,,Colin Sebastian,"I guess first on the fulfillment efficiency. Would be curious if you could give us a sense for how much of that optimization in the network with unit economics may have already been achieved in these numbers versus how much more you think is left to go. And related to that, I'm curious if you can leverage this reformulated network to help out with the grocery expansion. Or will that be limited to the stores and the specialized automated facilities you're building out?"
AMZN,2023-08-03,2023-08-04,,2023-08-03,2023-08-03T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-08-03,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"I'll take that first one. So on fulfillment efficiency, we're encouraged again by what we're seeing with regionalization and also the efforts to control our cost structure and the -- some of the inflationary pressures coming down. We're still in that journey, though, to reclaim the cost structure that we had previously and we consider this as a point along the road. So encouraged by some of the margin improvements we're seeing, particularly over the last 3 to 5 quarters but we're still underway. There's still a lot to be regained in our fulfillment area, and the teams are working very hard on it. On the question of grocery, as Andy explained at different points, our grocery business has a lot of dimensions to it. Obviously, there's consumables, there's fresh goods, there's Whole Foods. The same -- sub-same-day is probably mostly impacting the first -- that pocket of the consumables and everyday essentials. And as Andy mentioned, we're able to expand our selection in those areas because our cost structure can, quite frankly, afford it when the distances of customers are shorter and the transportation costs are more fixed."

And particularly in the case of being able to inject a number of items into our same-day facilities, to increase the number of items that people can add at the last minute, even grocery items that they can get same day. And I think that you see some of that already and you'll see more of that moving forward. And I also think that you'll see over time that we're going to be able to leverage being able to have -- people be able to pick up different items from different grocery-like options that are different grocery formats. But it's also true that we have infrastructure build-out in our grocery business that's different and optimized for the grocery business, too."

Amazon Business has been a couple of years since you've talked about that. It would seem like there'd be a lot more opportunities, frankly, a lot higher level of sales, bookings, whatever, that you get out of that. So Andy, just talk about like how big of a priority is that for you? And what's the growth strategy? Like how do you take that to $100 billion? And then on the -- Brian, on AWS, in the last 2 quarters, you provided a little bit of a look ahead into the quarter in terms of the AWS growth, given some of the commentary about moving beyond optimization and into new workloads without -- if you don't give a specific number, at least talk about the trends that you're seeing versus what you had in the second quarter."
AMZN,2023-08-03,2023-08-04,,2023-08-03,2023-08-03T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-08-03,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Yes, sure. Thanks, Mark. Let me start with that second question. So again, if we rewind to our last conference call, we had seen 16% AWS revenue growth in Q1, and the growth rates have been dropping during the quarter. And what I mentioned was that April was running about 500 basis points lower than Q1. What we've seen in the quarter is stabilization and you see the final 12% growth. I will stop for a moment and just put that in perspective. So again, last Q2 last year, we had close to $20 billion of revenue and we grew that $2.4 billion. So that's -- while that is 12%, there's a lot of cost optimization dollars that came out and a lot of new workloads and new customers that went in. So there was -- on our base, it's very large numbers. And when customers start to -- that cost optimization work, they can take some of their spend down for a while as they do that, and we help them do that and been part of our DNA ever since we started AWS. So that's all good. What we're seeing in the quarter is that those cost optimizations, while still going on, are moderating and many maybe behind us in some of our large customers. And now we're seeing more progression into new workloads, new business. So those balanced out in Q2. We're not going to give segment guidance for Q3. But what I would add is that we saw Q2 trends continue into July. So generally feel the business has stabilized, and we're looking forward to the back end of the year in the future because, as Andy said, there's a lot of new functionality coming out with -- and there's a lot of spend that will be in this area for all the great solutions that are out there for generative AI and large language models as well as machine learning solutions that we've always had for customers. So optimistic and starting to see some good traction with our customers' new volumes."
AMZN,2023-08-03,2023-08-04,,2023-08-03,2023-08-03T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-08-03,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes. I'll just underline one point Brian made and then quickly get to the Amazon Business point. Just if you think about the AWS business being an $88 billion revenue run rate business, to grow double digits on a business that size with the amount of cost optimizing that's been happening, to grow double digits, you have to be adding a lot of new customers and a lot of new workloads just to grow double digits. So when I talked about last quarter how I liked a lot of the fundamentals that we were seeing in the business with respect to customer pipeline, the new workloads, the migrations happening, what the team is rolling out functionality-wise, that's kind of what I'm talking about. And as we start to see cost optimization attenuate and more of the workloads, new workloads that people took those cost optimizations and actually started to plan come to fruition, not to mention what's coming with generative AI, there's a lot of growth in front of us on AWS. Just on your Amazon Business question, Mark, $35 billion annual run rate for gross sales is pretty strong growth. And if you look at it year-over-year, it continues to be very strong. But I like the way you're thinking, Mark, and it's almost like you're in some of the meetings that we're in where I asked the very same question. The team is working hard to build $100 billion-plus business over time. And I think that the business has grown to be pretty large already, and I still think we only have a fraction of the features that we need to address more of the enterprise at this point. There's all sorts of companies ordering obviously from Amazon Business. But the bigger procurement workloads, there are certain features that you need to make them much easier in the way that companies are used to buying in those big procurements. And so we have a lot of features that we're adding. We have a number of service pieces that we need to add really around helping on big buys, do some of the service substantiations. And so we have a lot of functionality that we're very quickly adding to the mix here. But I don't think we're close to being done growing there, and that is a very strong area of focus for our stores team and for our senior leadership team as well."

Can you just talk to when you think you'll start to see that flow into the AWS business? Is that 2024? Do you feel like the back half, you'll start to see that as a bigger impact for the business?"
AMZN,2023-08-03,2023-08-04,,2023-08-03,2023-08-03T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-08-03,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes. Good question, Brent. What I would say is that we have had a very significant amount of business in AWS driven by machine learning and AI for several years. And you've seen that largely in the form of compute as customers have been doing a lot of machine learning training and then running their models and production on top of AWS and our compute instances. But you've also seen it in the form of the 20-plus machine learning services that we've had out there for a few years. I think when you're talking about the big potential explosion in generative AI, which everybody is excited about, including us, I think we're in the very early stages there. We're a few steps into a marathon in my opinion. I think it's going to be transformative, and I think it's going to transform virtually every customer experience that we know. But I think it's really early. I think most companies are still figuring out how they want to approach it. They're figuring how to train models. They want to -- they don't want to build their own very large language models. They want to take other models and customize it, and services like Bedrock enable them to do so. But it's very early. And so I expect that will be very large, but it will be in the future."

Andy, maybe coming back to grocery. There's been a lot of coverage in the press around your grocery initiative in the last couple of days. When you take a step back, how much do you think about solving the grocery dynamic in the business to capitalize on it the way you want? Is it an element of things you need to build and the application of capital versus elements of executing on what's already in place and sort of aligning the assets in place against the scale of the Amazon Prime household in your customer base?"
AMZN,2023-08-03,2023-08-04,,2023-08-03,2023-08-03T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-08-03,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes, it's a good question. It's a little bit of both. I mean if I just step back and think about how we think about grocery, we continue to have this very big business in nonperishables, which is where a lot of the mass merchandisers started in grocery several years ago. So these are areas like consumables and canned goods and pet food and beauty and health. And as I said, it's a big business that's continuing to grow. But if you want to be able to serve more customers, which we do, and there are a whole number of reasons for that and customers want it, you have to have a strong physical presence. We started with Whole Foods, which is the pioneer in organic grocery, it continues to be, and we really like the way Whole Foods is growing. We've made a number of really important adjustments in the business, has changed its profitability trajectory over the last year. And we really like where that's headed and we're expanding that meaningfully. But if you want to be really broad, you have to have a mass physical format. We have been working on that for several years with Amazon Fresh. And I would say that we weren't pleased with the inputs, the progress on the inputs there. And the team has worked very hard over the last year to first start on the quality of the input, and that goes towards the quality of what we already had in place. And these are things like the right in-stock levels, the right cost structure, the right figures on things like obsolescence, just a number of the core inputs there, we just felt like we could be sharper and better. And I think that team has made up a lot of improvements. We have spent a lot of time thinking and rethinking how we want the formats to look. And we've just started rolling out some of those new formats, starting in our Chicago stores and then moving to our Southern California stores shortly thereafter. And you see added selection. You see added private brands. You see added well-known third-party brands like Krispy Kreme in coffee in the stores. You've seen a refined decor in the stores. You see refined dash cards that keep a running tally for people so they understand where they are at the moment wherever they're shopping, as well as refined self-service checkouts. And all those things, to me, are part of an effort we're trying to pursue to have a format in our mass Amazon Fresh stores that resonate more with customers. And we're hopeful that we will find that format and that it gives us the type of results that give us confidence to want to expand more broadly. But we won't expand unless we see that type of resonance. We're not just going to be on discipline. We're going to be thoughtful and disciplined about it. I do think also, you're starting to see across the team pulling some of the efforts together. So we have a number of different grocery offerings that I just talked about, just having a converged shopping cart for customers, which they have obviously wanted that I think will help them quite a bit. We're continuing to extend delivery to non-Prime customers as well. And so I think there are a number of opportunities for us over time to grow the business. We're optimistic that we'll be able to do so, but we're also being disciplined about not expanding the physical fresh stores until we have a format that we think is more resonant with customers."

AMZN,2023-08-03,2023-08-04,,2023-08-03,2023-08-03T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-08-03,qa,,Brian Nowak,"I have two. The first one, Andy, on the last call last quarter, you talked about how you sort of talked about North America retail margins potentially getting to at or above pre-COVID levels. I think you said a margin around 4% and you're sort of talking now about investing more in grocery and expanding same-day and expanding that footprint. How should we think about sort of the forward slope of North America retail margins and sort of invest in some of these new initiatives in the retail business? Then the second one on AI. How high of an investment priority is it for you to improve your own retail and device network through more AI investments, potentially through logistics or AI-based agents, et cetera? How large is that in the overall investment priority list?"
AMZN,2023-08-03,2023-08-04,,2023-08-03,2023-08-03T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-08-03,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Well, I'll start on the North America retail piece, which is again, I'll just remind that we're not going to expand the number of fresh stores in a very significant way until we believe we have something that is resonant with customers and that we're going to like the return on invested capital. So that to me, I'm hopeful we're going to find that but we won't until we do. I think as it relates to same-day facilities, we actually think that's going to be very positive for the business. It is -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, it is one of our most cost-effective mechanisms and fulfillment vehicles with respect not just to getting it there to customers quickly, but being fast, in part because those facilities, they're smaller facilities. They're big enough obviously to hold, in steady state, 100,000 SKUs and then also to have all of our nearby fulfillment centers be able to inject lots of different selection in there, so we can cover several million SKUs in that same-day or 1-day fashion. But they're smaller -- in general, they're smaller facilities with less conveyance and with more streamlined pick directly to pack and to get out to the dock to ship. And so they're just much more efficient as well. So we actually think that the expansion of those is going to not just help with speed and with demand, but we're going to also like the cost structure associated with that. And I continue to believe what I said last quarter, Brian, which is I do believe that we'll get back to margins like what we had pre COVID. And I don't think that's the end of what's possible for us there. On the AI question, what I would tell you, every single one of our businesses inside of Amazon, every single one has multiple generative AI initiatives going right now. And they range from things that help us be more cost effective and streamlined in how we run operations in various businesses to the absolute heart of every customer experience in which we offer. And so it's true in our stores business. It's true in our AWS business. It's true in our advertising business. It's true in all our devices, and you can just imagine what we're working on with respect to Alexa there. It's true in our entertainment businesses, every single one. It is going to be at the heart of what we do. It's a significant investment and focus for us."

AMZN,2023-08-03,2023-08-04,,2023-08-03,2023-08-03T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-08-03,qa,,Douglas Anmuth,"Just on AWS, as you lap optimizations and the macro-driven slowdown and you start to get the new workload deployment, how do you think about what normalized growth could look like for AWS in a better macro environment? And then secondly, helpful to get the just over $50 billion CapEx number for this year. Just curious how generative AI changes or could change your CapEx trajectory going forward."
AMZN,2023-08-03,2023-08-04,,2023-08-03,2023-08-03T17:30:00-04:00,0,2023-08-03,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Well, it's a good question. And I would say that while I expect there will continue to be cost optimization, I think that the balance of cost optimizations to actually new workloads and new migrations as we saw a shift in that in Q2, I expect that we'll continue to see that shift over time. And as I said, I mean, everybody has to make their own conclusions on what percentage revenue growth they believe it means. But to grow double digits on an $88 billion revenue run rate business, when you're seeing that amount of cost optimization as every company in the world is trying to save as much money as they can in the last year, to still grow double digits on a base that size means that we're acquiring a lot of new customers and a lot of new workloads. And so I'm very bullish on the growth of AWS over the next several years. And any one quarter, it's hard for me to predict, but I am bullish about it in the medium to long term for sure. I think that on the -- how much generative AI may impact the capital expense spend, included in that number is a pretty significant amount of capital expense in the AWS business for large language models and for generative AI. And we have quite a bit of demand right now. And so it's -- like in AWS, in general, one of the interesting things in AWS, and this has been true from the very earliest days, which is the more demand that you have, the more capital you need to spend because you invest in data centers and hardware upfront and then you monetize that over a long period of time. So I would like to have the challenge of having to spend a lot more in capital in generative AI because it will mean that customers are having success and they're having success on top of our services and -- but I think that, that's our best estimate right now on that capital expense, and we'll update it if we find it's different."

Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 26, 2023, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy."
AMZN,2023-10-26,2023-10-27,,2023-10-26,2023-10-26T05:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-26,prepared,,Andrew Jassy,"Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $143.1 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year; $11.2 billion in operating income, up 343% year-over-year or $8.7 billion; and $20.2 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases which is up $41.7 billion versus the comparable period last year. We continue to be encouraged by the progress we're making in lowering our cost to serve, improving our customer experiences and investing for future growth. I'll start with our stores business. Our move earlier this year from a single national fulfillment network in the U.S. to 8 distinct regions represented one of the most significant changes to our fulfillment network in our history. This change has gone more smoothly and made more impact than we optimistically expected. And you can see the benefits in many forms. Regional fulfillment clusters with higher local in-stock levels and optimized connections between fulfillment centers and delivery stations mean shorter distances and fewer touches to get items to customers. Shorter travel distances and fewer touches mean lower cost to serve. But perhaps most importantly, shorter distances and fewer touches mean that customers are getting their shipments faster. We remain on pace to deliver the fastest delivery speeds for Prime customers in our 29-year history. And as I talked about last quarter, we know how important speed of delivery is to customer satisfaction and buying behavior. A good example is the significant growth we're seeing in consumables and everyday essentials. When customers are getting items as quickly and conveniently as they are now from Amazon, they're going to consider us more frequently for more of their shopping needs. As we've shared the last few quarters, we've re-evaluated every part of our fulfillment network over the last year. The first substantial rearchitecture centered on the regionalization change. We obviously like the results but don't think we fully realize all the benefits yet and we continue to make steady improvements in fine-tuning the placement algorithms to enable even more in-region fulfillment and to further increase consolidation into fewer shipments. We've also identified several substantial changes to our inbound processes that we believe could have a significant impact on our cost to serve and speed of delivery. We have a long way before being out of ideas to improve cost and speed. The team is really humming on this and I'm proud of the way they're inventing and executing together. Moving to AWS and our investments in generative AI. AWS revenue grew 12% year-over-year in Q3, with $919 million of incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue and now has the annualized revenue run rate of $92 billion. AWS' year-over-year growth rate continued to stabilize in Q3. And while we still saw elevated cost optimization relative to a year ago, it's continued to attenuate as more companies transition to deploying net new workloads. Companies have moved more slowly in an uncertain economy in 2023 to complete deals. But we're seeing the pace and volume of closed deals pick up and we're encouraged by the strong last couple of months of new deals signed. For perspective, we signed several new deals in September with an effective date in October that won't show up in any GAAP reported number for Q3 but the collection of which is higher than our total reported deal volume for all of Q3. Deal signings are always lumpy and the revenue happens over several years but we like the recent deal momentum we're seeing. Top of mind for most companies continues to be generative AI. As I mentioned last quarter, we think about generative AI as having 3 macro layers, each of which is very large in each of which we're investing. A few updates there. At the lowest layer is the compute to train large language models, or LLMs and produce inferences or predictions. The key to this compute is the chip inside it. As we've shared, we've been working on custom silicon for training and inference with our Trainium and Inferentia chips, respectively. Recently, we announced that leading LLM maker Anthropic chose AWS as its primary cloud provider and will use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train and deploy its future LLMs. As part of this partnership, AWS and Anthropic will collaborate on the future development of Trainium and Inferentia technology. We believe this collaboration will be helpful in continuing to accelerate the price performance advantages that Trainium and Inferentia deliver for customers. In the middle layer which we think of as large language models as a service, we recently introduced general availability for Amazon Bedrock which offers customers access to leading LLMs from third-party providers like Anthropic, Stability AI, coherent AI 21 as well as from Amazon's own LLMs called Titan, where customers can take those models, customize them using their own data but without leaking that data back into the generalized LLM, have access to the same security, access control and features that they run the rest of their applications within AWS all through a managed service. In the last couple of months, we've announced the imminent addition of Meta's Llama 2 model to Bedrock, the first time it's being made available through a fully managed service. Also through our expanded collaboration with Anthropic, customers will gain access to future Anthropic models through Bedrock with exclusive early access to unique features, model customization and the ability to fine-tune the models. And Bedrock has added several new compelling features, including the ability to create agents which can be programmed to accomplish tasks like answering questions or automating workflows. In these early days of generative AI, companies are still learning which models they want to use which models they use for what purposes and which model sizes they should use to get the latency and cost characteristics they desire. In our opinion, the only certainty is that there will continue to be a high rate of change. Bedrock helps customers with this fluidity, allowing them to rapidly experiment with move between model types and sizes and enabling them to pick the right tool for the right job. The customer reaction to Bedrock has been very positive and the general availability is buoyed that further. Bedrock is the easiest way to build and scale enterprise-ready generative AI applications and a real game changer for developers and companies trying to get value out of this new technology. And the top layer which are the applications that run the LLMs, our generative AI coding companion Amazon CodeWhisperer has gotten a lot of early traction and got a lot more powerful recently with the launch of its new customization capability. The number one enterprise request for coding companions has been wanting these companions to be familiar with customers' proprietary code bases. It's not just having code companions trained in open source code, companies want the equivalent of a long-time senior engineer who knows their code base well. That's what CodeWhisperer just launched, another first of its kind out there in its current form and customers are excited about it. A few last comments on AWS's generative AI work. As you can tell, we're focused on doing what we've always done for customers, taking technology that can transform customer experiences and businesses but they can be complex and expensive and democratizing it for customers of all sizes and technical abilities. It's also worth remembering that customers want to bring the models to their data, not the other way around. And much of that data resides in AWS as the clear market segment leader in cloud infrastructure. We're innovating and delivering at a rapid rate and our approach is resonating with customers. The number of companies building generative AI apps in AWS is substantial and growing very quickly, including Adidas, Booking.com, Bridgewater, Clariant, GoDaddy, LexisNexis, Merck, Royal Philips and United Airlines, to name a few. We are also seeing success with generative AI start-ups like Perplexity.ai who chose to go all in with AWS, including running future models in Trainium and Inferentia. And the AWS team has a lot of new capabilities to share with its customers at its upcoming AWS re:Invent conference. Beyond AWS, all of our significant businesses are working on generative AI applications to transform their customer experiences. There are too many for me to name on this call but a few examples include, in our stores business, we're using generative AI to help people better discover products they want to more easily access the information needed to make decisions. We use generative AI models to forecast inventory we need in our various locations and to derive optimal last mile transportation routes for drivers to employ. We're also making it much easier for our third-party sellers to create new product pages by entering much less information and letting the models to the rest. In advertising, we just launched a generative AI image generation tool, where all brands need to do is upload a product photo and description to quickly create unique lifestyle images that will help customers discover products they love. And in Alexa, we built a much more expansive LLM and previewed the early version of this. Apart from being a more intelligent version of herself, Alexa's new conversational AI capabilities include the ability to make multiple requests at once as well as more natural and conversational requests without having to use specific phrases. We continue to be convicted that the vision of being the world's best personal assistant is a compelling and viable one and that Alexa has a good chance to be one of the long-term winners in this arena. Every one of our businesses is building generative AI applications to change what's possible for customers and we have a lot more to come. We're also encouraged by the progress we're making in our newer initiatives. Just to name a few, we're pleased with what we're seeing in Prime Video. Prime Video continues to be an integral part of the Prime value proposition where it's often one of the top 2 drivers of customers signing up for Prime. We also have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business in its own right as we continue to invest in compelling exclusive content for prime members but also offer the best selection of premium streaming video content anywhere with our marketplace offering, including channels for customers who can subscribe to channels like Max, Paramount+, BET Plus and MGM+, as well as our broad transaction video-on-demand selection. As we continue to invest in compelling content, beginning in early 2024, Prime Video shows and movies will include limited advertisements. We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. If customers prefer and add free option, we plan to offer that for an additional $2.99 per month for U.S. members. There is still a lot of work to be done in innovation ahead but we're excited about our future on Prime Video. We're seeing progress on a number of our investments that expand our ability to serve more consumers and sellers in their e-commerce missions. Our emerging international stores continue to improve their customer experiences and profitability and are on a strong trajectory. Both consumers and sellers are excited about Buy with Prime which enables third-party sellers with direct-to-consumer websites to offer Amazon Prime members the same fast payments and delivery options they receive on Amazon.com. We recently announced the capability for sellers to integrate Buy with Prime with their Shopify account, making it easier for Shopify merchants to manage their businesses with inventory pricing and promotions automatically synced in one place. And we're seeing very positive early response from sellers to Supply Chain by Amazon, a fully automated set of supply chain services where Amazon can pick up inventory from manufacturing facilities around the world, ship it across borders, handle customs clearance and ground transportation, store inventory in bulk, manage replenishment across Amazon and other sales channels and deliver directly to customers, all without sellers having to worry about managing their supply chain. Our health care team is continuing to make health care easier for people to access. The Amazon Pharmacy customer experience has significantly evolved this year and customers are responding that both in their purchasing behavior and qualitative feedback. We built RXPass for customers to get unlimited supply of eligible medications for $5 per month, meaningfully reduce the cost for customers to get insulin and diabetes products and partnered with Blue Shield of California to offer a first-of-its-kind model to provide more affordable pharmacy care to its 4.8 million members, providing fast and free delivery of prescription medications and 24/7 access to pharmacists. We remain convinced that we can be part of the solution of making health care a better customer experience. And our low Earth orbit satellite initiative Project Kuiper which aims to bring fast, affordable broadband to underserved communities around the world, took a meaningful step forward in the last few weeks with the successful launch of 2 prototype satellites. We will use this multi-month mission to test our satellites and network from space and collect data ahead of the planned start of satellite production later this year. I'd like to close by thanking our teams around the world who are gearing up for 2 of our most significant events across the company. First, our annual AWS re:Invent conference that begins on November 27. The team is excited to share a lot of new capabilities with customers and provide an array of opportunities for builders to learn and connect with one another. And on the stores side, we've already kicked off what will be our 29th holiday shopping season. Prime Big Deal Days held earlier this month was our most successful October holiday kick-off event ever, with Prime members saving more than $1 billion across hundreds and millions of items sold. Just as we do all year long, we aim to make our customers' lives easier and better every day and there's no time where it's more important to us that we deliver on this mission than during the busy holiday shopping season. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."
AMZN,2023-10-26,2023-10-27,,2023-10-26,2023-10-26T05:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-26,prepared,,Brian Olsavsky,"Thanks, Andy. Overall, we saw a strong performance in the third quarter. Worldwide revenue was $143.1 billion, representing an increase of 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and approximately $100 million above the top end of our guidance range. We saw our highest quarterly worldwide operating income ever which was $11.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $8.7 billion year-over-year from $2.7 billion above the high end of our guidance range. North America revenue was $87.9 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. And international revenue was $32.1 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange. During the quarter, we held our biggest Prime Day event ever with prime members purchasing more than 375 million items worldwide and saving more than $2.5 billion on millions of deals across the Amazon store. Outside of Prime Day, we continue to see strong demand across everyday essentials, including categories like beauty and health and personal care. From a customer behavior standpoint, we still see customers remaining cautious about price, trading down where they can and seeking out deals, coupled with lower spending on discretionary items. Building on the momentum from last quarter, we set another record for delivery speed. For the year-to-date period through the third quarter, we have delivered at the fastest speeds ever in the United States. These improvements in delivery speeds have been a key driver of growth and are resulting in increased purchase frequency by our Prime members. Third-party sellers grew at 18% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by selection expansion and growing adoption of our optional services for sellers, including Fulfillment by Amazon and paid account management and more. During the quarter, we hosted Amazon Accelerate, our annual seller conference, where we launched a number of new innovations and product developments for our sellers, including Supply Chain by Amazon. We also continue to see durable growth in advertising which grew 25% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange, primarily driven by sponsored products as we lean into machine learning to improve the relevancy of the ads we show our customers and enhance our measurement capabilities on behalf of advertisers. We have seen strong improvement in our profitability. North America operating income was $4.3 billion, an increase of $4.7 billion year-over-year, resulting in an operating margin of 4.9%, up 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Since North America operating margins bottomed out in Q1 of 2022, we have now seen 6 consecutive quarters of improvement, resulting in a cumulative improvement of over 700 basis points over these past 6 quarters. The third quarter marked the second full quarter of regionalization within the U.S. and we're pleased with the early results. Regionalization has allowed us to simplify the network by reducing the number of line-haul lanes, increasing volume within existing line-haul lanes and adding more direct fulfillment center to delivery station connections. We have also been focused on optimizing inventory placement in a new regionalized network which when coupled with the simplification mentioned earlier, is helping contribute to an overall reduction in cost to serve. Additionally, in the quarter, we saw benefits from lower inflation, primarily within line haul, ocean and rail shipping rates which were partially offset by higher fuel prices. While we are encouraged by the improvements in operating profit, we still see a lot of opportunity in front of us. In international, we were closer to breakeven during the quarter with an operating loss of $95 million. This was an improvement of $2.4 billion year-over-year. This improvement was primarily driven by lowering our cost to serve through higher productivity, decreased inflationary pressures and improvements in leverage across our established and emerging international countries as we continue to focus on customer inputs and improve efficiencies within our operations. Moving to AWS; revenues were $23.1 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we added more than $900 million of revenue in AWS as customers are continuing to shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Similar to what we shared last quarter, while optimization still remain a headwind, we've seen the rate of new cost optimization slowdown in AWS and we are encouraged by the strength of our customer pipeline. Customers are excited about our approach to generative AI, with several new announcements made during the quarter, including a strategic collaboration with Anthropic, opening Amazon Bedrock up to general availability, adding Meta's Llama 2 model to Bedrock in the near future and new customization capabilities of CodeWhisperer. AWS remains a clear cloud infrastructure leader with a significant leadership position in the number of customers, the size of our partner ecosystem, our breadth of functionality and the strongest operational performance in the industry. When we look at the fundamentals of the business, we believe we are in good position to drive future growth as the rates of cost optimization slow down. AWS operating income was $7 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion year-over-year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 30.3%. This is an improvement of approximately 600 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by increased leverage on our head count costs. Shifting to free cash flow. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow adjusted for finance leases was $20.2 billion, an improvement of $41.7 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of the improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income which we're seeing across all 3 of our segments. Key drivers of this improvement include reductions in our cost to serve, continued advertising growth and improved leverage on our fixed costs. We are also seeing improvements in working capital, notably with our inventory efficiency as we improve our inventory placement. Now, let's turn to our capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. These investments were $50 billion for the trailing 12-month period ended September 30, down from $60 billion in the comparable prior year period. For the full year 2023, we expect capital investments to be approximately $50 billion compared to $59 billion in 2022. We expect fulfillment and transportation CapEx to be down year-over-year, partially offset by increased infrastructure CapEx to support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments related to generative AI and large language model efforts. As we head into the fourth quarter, we are ready to make this a great holiday season for our customers. Looking at our operations network, our inventory is the best position it's ever been heading into the holiday season, enabling us to serve customers with fast delivery speeds from their local regions. We continue to believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to questions."

AMZN,2023-10-26,2023-10-27,,2023-10-26,2023-10-26T05:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-26,qa,,Justin Post,"I'll ask about AWS. I guess the first question is, as you look forward in the fourth quarter, you mentioned you've signed some new deals. Are you seeing less cost optimization as you look forward? Or do you think it will be similar to Q3? And then second, you couldn't help but notice the big margin improvement in AWS all the way back to where you were 7 quarters ago. Could you talk about the drivers and sustainability of those margins?"
AMZN,2023-10-26,2023-10-27,,2023-10-26,2023-10-26T05:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-26,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes, Justin. Sure. This is Andy. I think if you look at AWS, we grew 12% year-over-year. And I think that you saw a continued stabilization of our year-over-year growth rate. And included $919 million of incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue which it's hard to compare and do the math across different players because not everyone discloses them clearly. But as far as we can tell, that also looks like the most absolute growth of any of the players out there. We're still seeing elevated customer optimization levels than we've seen in the last year or year before this, I should say. So if you look at the optimization, it's more than a year ago but it's meaningfully attenuating from where we've seen in the last few quarters. And if you look at the optimization too, what's interesting is it's not all customers deciding to shut down workloads. A very significant portion of the optimization are customers taking advantage of enhanced price performance capabilities in AWS and making use of it. So for example, if you look at the growth of customers using EC2 instances that are Graviton based which is our custom chip that we built for generalized CPUs, the number of people and the percentage of instances launched their Graviton base as opposed to Intel or AMD base is very substantially higher than it was before. And one of the things that customers love about Graviton is that it provides 40% better price performance than the other leading x86 processors. So you see a lot of growth in Graviton. You also see a lot of customers who are moving from the hourly on demand rates for significant portions of their workloads to 1- to 3-year commitments which we call savings plans. So those are just good examples of some of the cost optimization that customers are making in less certain economies where it's really good for customers short and long term and I think it's also good for us. But we're starting to see -- as I said, we're seeing that optimization attenuate. I expect that to continue over time. I remain very optimistic about AWS in the medium to long term. And it's because we have the most functionality by a large amount. We have a much larger partner ecosystem than you'll find elsewhere. We have stronger security and operational performance than you can find elsewhere. I think we're the most customer-focused. Even if you look during optimization times in this difficult economy, customers have really noticed how AWS leaned in with them for the long term. And I think that matters to customers. And then we have a $92 billion revenue run rate business where 90% of the global IT spend still resides on premises. And if you believe like we do, that equation is going to flip. There's a lot more there for us. And then you look at the very substantial gigantic new generative AI opportunity which I believe will be tens of billions of dollars of revenue for AWS over the next several years, I think we have a unique and broad approach that's really resonating with customers. And you can see it with the array of customers I mentioned that are using us and starting to build workloads for generative AI who have already on top of us. I could see it also. Just the growth rate for us in generative AI is very fast. Again, I have seen a lot of different numbers publicly. It's real hard to measure an apples-to-apples. But in our best estimation, our -- the amount of growth we're seeing and the absolute amount of generative AI business we're seeing compares very favorably with anything else I've seen externally. So I think that you can see that in the deals that we're doing, too. I spoke about the significant number of deals that we've closed over the last couple of months. A lot of those conversations, it's -- a big piece of it is what I mentioned earlier, the functionality, the ecosystem, the operational performance, the security, how you take care of customers but also whether or not they like your vision and set of products that you're building in this brand-new technology space, generative AI which I think has been very effective so far. So to me, I think there's a lot of growth in front of AWS. I'm very optimistic about it."

So yes, the margin improved 600 basis points quarter-over-quarter, an increase of income of $1.6 billion quarter-over-quarter for AWS, is driven by -- primarily by our headcount reductions in Q2 and also continued slowness in hiring, rehiring open positions. There's been also a lot of cost control in non-people categories, things like infrastructure costs and also discretionary costs. Natural gas prices and other energy costs have come down a bit in Q3 as well. So as we've said historically, the margins on -- the operating margin for AWS is going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and this is a good example of that."

AMZN,2023-10-26,2023-10-27,,2023-10-26,2023-10-26T05:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-26,qa,,Doug Anmuth,"Can you just talk more about how the regional fulfillment network is exceeding your expectations? And then also, how does that support your confidence in moving North America beyond mid-single-digit margin levels? And then just perhaps on generative AI, obviously, a lot of innovation here. You talked about a number of different customers running early workloads. How should we think about the timing, just to drive some tangible monetization there?"
AMZN,2023-10-26,2023-10-27,,2023-10-26,2023-10-26T05:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-26,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Well, I'll start. The -- on regionalization, I think it was such a significant change for us in the network. It's hard to really appreciate with a big change across so many dimensions it was that first to make such a change has all sorts of risk. And I think the team did a great job planning around it being very thorough. I think that we were able, with our placement algorithms, to get more regional local in-stock levels than we anticipated. And then I think until you actually put all the connections together, we changed a lot of the connections from a lot of these middle connections going from fulfillment centers to sortation centers and then to delivery stations to connecting the fulfillment centers and delivery stations more directly which, of course, is easier to do when you have more local in stock in a region. But I think that we were able -- the connections that we made and the optimization that we made there allowed us to get shorter transportation distances than we even anticipated in items to people a lot quicker. And then always one of the issues you got to worry about when you make a change that big is whether or not you end up splitting shipments and having more -- fewer items per box and per shipment. And that was also something that we really had to work through in the design and in the early stages and we've gotten a lot better on. So we're just across the board, we're seeing shorter transportation distances and much faster delivery to customers. And when you deliver faster delivery to customers, they actually start to consider you for a lot more items than they otherwise would. I think it's part of what -- if you look at our very significant growth rates right now in everyday essentials and consumables, a lot of it is when you -- if you're going to order something which you need in the same day or next day, you're not going to consider it if it's coming in 3 or 4 days. But when you're consistently getting it in same day or the next day, just changes what you're willing to do. I think the second question was on gen AI and the timing of monetization. What I would tell you is that we have been surprised at the pace of growth in generative AI. Our generative AI business is growing very, very quickly, as I mentioned earlier. And almost by any measure, it's a pretty significant business for us already. And yet I would also say that companies are still in the relatively early stages. I mean now you have to get perspective. My perspective is that the cloud is still in the early stages. If you think about 90% plus of the global IT spend being on-premises, where I think that equation is going to flip in 10 years. I think cloud is early. So if you -- with that lens on, I still think we're very early in generative AI. And what's interesting, too, around generative AI because we have so many companies who are doing all sorts of prototypes and it's really accelerating very rapidly on the training side with Trainium and Inferentia and then on the application building and running side with Bedrock, is that companies are still trying to sort out for themselves what they're going to run at large-scale production in all of these areas. Because what happens is you try a model, you test the model, you like the results of the model and then you plug it into your application. And what a lot of companies figure out quickly is that using the really large -- the large models and the large sizes ends up often being more expensive than what they anticipated and what they want to spend on that application. And sometimes too much latency in getting the answers as it shovels through the really large models. And so customers are experimenting with lots of different types of models and then different model sizes to get the cost and latency characteristics that they need for different use cases. And it's one of the things that I think is so useful about Bedrock is that customers are trying so many variants right now but to have a service that not only lets you leverage lots of third party as well as Amazon large language miles but also lots of different sizes and then makes the transition of moving those workloads easy between them is very advantageous."

On AWS AI Andy, I recognize you have a pretty multipronged AI approach. But just could you talk us through sort of one or two of the early generative AI products where you're seeing the most early demand and interest? And as you talk to customers, are there still hurdles or pain points that you're not quite serving in your product suite you look to solve and innovate on over the next couple of years in AI? And then the second one, you made a lot of steps on the regionalization of warehouses and making it more efficient. Where are you on robotics in the warehouses? And how should we think about the potential impact of that to drive profitability even higher?"
AMZN,2023-10-26,2023-10-27,,2023-10-26,2023-10-26T05:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-26,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"On the AI side, I think that if you're looking for some of the products that we're offering that are -- that have a lot of early resonance and traction, I would -- I'd start with Bedrock. These customers are -- they're very excited about Bedrock. And it's making it so much easier to get applications, generative AI applications built. And again, it's machine learning and AI has been something that people have been excited about for 25 years. In my opinion, about a half dozen years ago, it took a pretty significant leap forward where it was much easier given the economics and scalability of compute and storage and then some of the tools that we built like SageMaker, it was much easier for everyday developers to start to interact with AI. But it just -- it took another meaningful step forward with generative AI but still it's complicated to actually figure out which models you want to work, you want to use and how you actually want to employ them and trying to make sure you have the right results, trying to make sure you get safe results, trying to make sure you end up with a cost structure and a customer experience that you want. And so it's hard. And customers will like -- there's a certain number of customers who have very deep AI expert practitioners but most companies don't. And so Bedrock just takes so much of the difficulty out of those decisions and those variables that people are very excited about Bedrock. They're using it in a very broad way. They're extremely excited about not just the set of models in there but if you look at a leader like Anthropic and the ability for our customers in Bedrock to have exclusive early access to models and customization tools and fine-tuning which gives them more control, there's just -- there's a lot of buzz and a lot of usage and a lot of traction around Bedrock. I would also say our chips, Trainium and Inferentia, as most people know, there's a real shortage right now in the industry in chips. It's really hard to get the amount of GPUs that everybody wants. And so it's just another reason why Trainium and Inferentia are so attractive to people. They have better price performance characteristics than the other options out there but also the fact that you can get access to them. And we've done, I think, a pretty good job providing supply there and ordering meaningfully in advance as well. And so you're seeing very large LLM providers make big bets on those chips. I think Anthropic deciding to train their future LLM model on Trainium and using Inferentia as well is really a statement. And then you look at the really hot start-up Perplexity.ai, who also just made a decision to do all their training and inference on top of Trainium and Inferentia. So those are 2 examples. I'd say CodeWhisperer, too, is just, again, it's just a game changer if you can allow your engineers not to have to do the more repetitive work of cutting and pasting and building certain functions that really, if somebody knew your code base better, could do. And so it's a real -- it's a productivity game changer for developers. And then actually launching that customization vehicle so that they actually understand your own proprietary code base, that is something that customers are quite excited about. So those are ultimately early traction AI. There's so much more to provide, Brian. I mean there's -- I think people -- even though Bedrock is so much easier to use than people trying to build models themselves and build the applications, I think people are still looking to find ways to make it easier to look at a big corpus of data and run an agent on top of it or maybe they don't have to do all that work themselves. I think people are looking for automated ways to understand developer environments and be able to ask any question on the developer environment. So there's a lot more. It's going to be a long time before we run out of services. And yes, I think it's a good thing to look toward the next few months in re:Invent to see the additional things that team launches. I think on the robotics piece, it's a very significant investment for us. It has been for several years. It's made a huge difference for us. It's made a big difference for us both on the productivity side, on the cost side as well as importantly on the safety side where we can have our teammates working on things that are even safer than what they get to work on today. We have a very substantial investment of additional robotics initiatives, I would say many of which are coming to fruition in 2024 and 2025 that we think will make a further additional impact on the cost and productivity and safety and our fulfillment service."

The cloud optimization theme started in the second half of '22 when there were a lot of macro concerns. And then the AI theme really only sort of came to the forefront in the last 8 or 9 months. What's your perspective on how turning the calendar into 2024 and there being a new IT budget cycle could possibly lead us to put the optimization theme in the background and some of the AI theme come more to the forefront when there might be more distinct budgeting around AI as a theme? That would be number one. And then in your ads business, you're approaching $50 billion run rate and it's compounding in the mid-20s. What are you most excited about on the initiative front to continue to build scale both on Amazon properties and possibly off Amazon as a broader digital advertising player?"
AMZN,2023-10-26,2023-10-27,,2023-10-26,2023-10-26T05:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-26,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"On the AWS side, my perspective, we'll obviously all have to wait and see to some extent. But my perspective is that in 2024, you're going to -- I think a lot of the relatively low-hanging fruit on optimization has happened in 2023. It's not to say there won't be any more optimization. It's just that there's more low-hanging fruit when you have very large footprints and you've built a lot of applications on a platform for you to go decide to optimize if that's what you want to go do. And so I think 2020 -- we're already seeing it now with the attenuation of optimization over the last several months. But I think you'll continue to see the attenuation continue and we're already seeing more and more companies that are turning their attention to newer initiatives. And I think what you will see in '24 and '25 as well, I think -- I don't think it's a 1-year deal, I think that's going to be a several-year trajectory, is that you're going to just see a lot of companies not just looking at the new generative AI workloads but also there was a significant number of new customer transformations where companies were going to largely move from being on-premises to being in the cloud. That got stalled in 2023 because companies were being more conservative with their spend and wary of an uncertain economy. And so I think that what you'll see increasingly is that companies will both go back to those transformations they were planning on making and working with a lot of systems integrator partners as well as ourselves as well as start to see the production in large scale of the generative AI applications that they're all working on and prototyping and starting to deploy into production. I think on the ad front, well, there's a lot I'm excited about on the ad side as well. I think that it's interesting what's happened in our ads business as if you look around the industry, most advertising-heavy companies have struggled growth-wise as the economy has been difficult. And while we see companies being more cautious on the ad side and the top-of-funnel products, things like display and a little bit of video, we're still seeing a lot of strength in the lower-funnel ad products like sponsored products. And I think in these types of economies, we have fared pretty well in part because we have a number of owned and operated properties that have very large volumes that advertisers and brands want to get in front of. Even in a harder economy, there's going to be a lot of e-commerce purchasing. So people want to be in front of our customers in our marketplace. Or take Thursday Night Football which is we're in our second season of Thursday Night Football and off to a great start, the ratings are 25% higher than they were a year ago through 6 weeks. But also, we're doing much better on the advertising side than we did in our first year and that's a property that's really valuable. It's the one game that week and advertisers want to be in front of customers because there's 13 million customers a week watching. So I think part of it is because we have owned and operated properties that have a lot of volume. And then I think the other piece is that most of our resource in the advertising side is spent on machine learning expert practitioners who are owning algorithms to make sure that the sponsor results people get when they search on something are relevant. And because of that, those ads perform better for advertisers. So when they have to think about budget decisions, they're going to choose the ones that have large volume and perform better. I think both of those are real advantages in our advertising area right now. In terms of additional things we're excited about. I think that we have barely scraped the surface with respect to figuring out how to intelligently integrate advertising into video, into audio and into grocery. So I think we're early days in that. I think that we also started externalizing some of our products like sponsored products to third-party websites. And you see that with what we've done with Pinterest, Hearst Newspapers and BuzzFeed, so I think there's -- again, we're still pretty early in that area but it's growing well and we're very focused on continuing to in a great customer experience."

AMZN,2023-10-26,2023-10-27,,2023-10-26,2023-10-26T05:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-26,qa,,Mark Mahaney,"Okay. On those AWS deals Andy, that you talked about in the September quarter, was there something different about those deals, different industry, different verticals, different geographic markets? Or is it just kind of a resumption of kind of the deal flow that you've had in years past? So that's the first question. And secondly, Brian, international. Is international finally at a point where it can be sustainably profitable going forwards, maybe except for the seasonally challenged March quarter? Have you wrung out enough efficiencies and gotten enough scales? And the oldest markets there are big enough and scalable enough and profitable enough that it offsets the newer countries? Have you finally reached that point?"
AMZN,2023-10-26,2023-10-27,,2023-10-26,2023-10-26T05:00:00-04:00,0,2023-10-26,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"First, just to give Andy a break. On international, thanks for your question. Yes, the quarter was just short of breakeven. And as you pointed out, that's a departure from kind of prior trends. I would answer that question this way. There's multiple things going on internationally. In our established countries, U.K., Germany, Japan, France, those countries are profitable and have been profitable. And we continue to work on price selection and convenience. And all that retail base is essentially adding sellers, adding vendors and selection, scaling advertising and improving the cost structure of our ops network. So many of the ops productivity initiatives, probably with the exception of regionalization, is more of a U.S. side right now. But we're working on all those productivity elements and speed concurrently globally. And you're seeing that internationally and customers are responding. On the emerging side, over the last 6 years, we've launched 10 new countries. History has shown us that those all take time to grow into profitability. The U.S. took 10 years -- excuse me, 9 years originally. And they're all on their own journey there with growth and scale and profitability and selection and a number of other variables. So that's -- those are all going well as well. We continue -- we're going to continue to invest internationally in things like Prime and expanding Prime benefits and we're going to continue to build out the fulfillment and transportation networks to better serve customers. So I can't say it's permanently we've reached a breakeven threshold for profitability. I think the trend lines are clear, though and we'll continue to work on accelerating that journey in all countries, especially the emerging ones."

Some are kind of first really big deals from customers. Some of them are very large expansions of existing agreements where they've gone from call it, 20% of their workloads to 50% of their workloads moving to AWS in the cloud. It's also -- I'm not even really including in that number, a number of really big public sector deals that we've done over the last chunk of time that won't hit for a period of time; and so all these deals don't hit in a month. They happen over a period of time as you help those customers safely transition and migrate their workloads to AWS. But it hasn't been any one piece. And I wish I could tell you we knew exactly why they're starting to happen in faster numbers. I do think, in general, historically, deal volume tends to be lumpy and it doesn't perfectly distribute over a calendar year. I do think though that we've seen this in '23, for sure, that the time to close deals lengthened. And I think it's all reflective of what most companies in the world have been thinking about the last year which is just in the face of uncertain economy, you're going to be more conservative. There are going to be more people involved. You're going to spend more time on how you can save on your existing cost instead of migrating new workloads or thinking about signing new deals. And so I think what you're just starting to see along with some of the optimization attenuation is that companies are starting to look forward again. And so we've just seen a collection of those the last couple of months that had been -- being discussed for several months where I think, frankly, both sides thought they would close faster but just went slower than they did. So I just think you're starting to see companies look forward more."

Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022.  Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's use as of today, February 1, 2024, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially, additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.  During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You'll find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions.  Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.  Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't include any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements, it's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.  And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy."
AMZN,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T17:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,prepared,,Andrew Jassy,"Thanks, Dave. Today we’re reporting $170 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, $13.2 billion in operating income, up 383% year-over-year, or $10.5 billion and $35.5 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $48.3 billion year-over-year.  While we've made meaningful progress in our financial measures, what we're most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses. These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, adjusting and reimagining from teams across Amazon.  Looking back at Q4, I'll start with our stores business where customers responded to our continued focus on selection price and convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection with hundreds and millions of products available and added tens of millions of new items last year alone, including fashion selection from Coach, Victoria's Secrets Fashion, Pit Viper, and Beyonce’s Renaissance to our Merge to cosmetics from Lancome, Urban Decay, cosmetics and No Beauty by Vanessa Hudgens, to consumer technology and services from Boost, Infinite, and Woop to homewares for Martha Stewart.  Being sharp on price is always important. But particularly in an uncertain economy where customers are careful about how much they're spending. We kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, which was open to all customers and ended up being our largest event ever. These events also helped attract new customers and Prime members.  Throughout the quarter customers saved nearly $10 billion across millions of deals and coupons almost 70% more than last year. In addition to offering great deals, we continue to improve delivery speeds. In 2023, Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day including more than 4 billion in the U.S and more than 2 billion in Europe.  In the U.S this result is the combination of two things, one is the benefit of regionalization, where we’ve architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same day facilities, where in the U.S in the fourth quarter, we increase the number of items delivered the same day or overnight by more than 65% year-over-year. As we're able to get customers items this fast. It increases the number of occasions that customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs. And we can see that in all sorts of areas including how fast or everyday essentials business is growing.  Our regionalization efforts have also brought transportation distances down which has helped lower our cost to serve. In 2023, for the first time since 2018, we've reduced our cost-to-serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S alone, cost-to-serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit compared to the prior year. Lowering cost-to-serve allows us not only to invest in speed improvements, but also afford adding more selection at lower average selling prices or ASPs and profitably. We have a saying, that it's not hard to lower prices, it's hard to be able to afford lowering prices. The same is true with adding selection, it's not hard to add lower ASPs selection, it's hard to be able to afford offering lower ASPs selection and still like the economics. Like improving speed, adding selection puts us in the consideration set for more purchases.  As we look toward 2024 and beyond, we're not done lowering our cost to serve. We've challenged every closely held belief for our fulfillment network and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where we believe we can lower costs while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there's more upside for us.  Alongside our stores business, our advertising growth remains strong, up 26% year-over-year, which is primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We've recently added Sponsored TV to this offering in the U.S. a self-service solution for brands to create streaming TV campaigns with no minimum spend, putting this advertising within reach of any business.  While still early days, streaming TV advertising continues to grow quickly. Brands are using our capabilities to reach engage viewers on Twitch, Freevee, Fire TV and Prime Video shows and movies, which just launched in the U.S., as well as Thursday Night Football.  Shifting to AWS. Revenue in the quarter grew 13% year-over-year in Q4 versus 12% year-over-year in Q3. And we're now approaching an annualized revenue run rate of $100 billion. We watched the incremental revenue added each quarter and in Q4 AWS added more than $1.1 billion an incremental quarter-over-quarter revenue, which on an FX neutral basis is more than any other cloud provider as far as we can tell. While cost optimization continued to attenuate larger new deals also accelerated, evidenced by recently inked agreements with Salesforce, BMW, NVIDIA, LG, Hyundai, Merck, MUFG, Axiata, Cafe, BYD, Arcore, Amgen, and SAIC.  Our customer pipeline remains strong, as existing customers are renewing larger commitments over longer periods and migrations are growing. 2023 also was a very significant year of delivery and customer trial for generative AI or Gen AI in AWS. You may remember that we've explained our vision of three distinct layers in the Gen AI stack, each of which is gigantic, and each of which were deeply investing. At the bottom layer, where customers who are building their own models run training and inference on compute with a chip is the key component in that compute, we offer the most expansive collection of compute instances with NVIDIA chips.  We also have customers who would like us to push the price performance envelope on AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips, which are 40% more price performance than other X86 alternatives. And as a result, we built custom AI training chips, named Trainium, and inference chips, name Inferentia. At re:Invent we announced Trainium2, which offers four times faster training performance and three times more memory capacity versus the first generation of Trainium, enabling advantageous price performance versus alternatives.  We already have several customers using our AI chips including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh and Snap. In the middle layer where companies seek to leverage an existing large language model, customize it with their own data, and leverage AWS’ security and other features all as a managed service. We've launched Bedrock which is off to a very strong start with many 1,000s of customers using the service after just a few months.  The team continues to rapidly iterate on Bedrock, recently delivering capabilities including guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, knowledge bases to expand models knowledge base with retrieval augmented generation or RAG and real time queries, agents to complete multi step tasks and fine tuning to keep teaching and refining models. All which will help customers applications be higher quality and have better customer experiences.  We also added new models from Anthropic, Cohere, Meta with Llama2, Stability AI and our own Amazon Titan family of LLMs. What customers have learned at this early stage of Gen AI, is it there's meaningful iteration required in building a production Gen AI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customers don't want only one model, they want different models for different types of applications, and different size models for different applications.  Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple and this is what Bedrock does, which is why so many customers are excited about it. And to top layer of the stack is the application layer, one of the very best early gen AI applications is a coded companion. At Reinvent, we launched Amazon Q, which is an expert on AWS, writes code, debugs code, tests code, does translations like moving from an old version of Java to a new one and can also query customer’s various data repositories, like Internet, Wickes or from over 40 different popular connectors to data in Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Elastin or Zendesk, among others. And answer questions, summarize this data, carry on a coherent conversation and take action. It was designed with security and privacy in mind from the start, making it easier for organizations to use generative AI safely. Q is the most capable work assistant and another service that customers are very excited about. By the way, don't underestimate the point about Bedrock and Q inheriting the same security and access control as customers get with AWS. Security is a big deal, an important differentiator between cloud providers. The data in these models is some of the company's most sensitive and critical assets. With AWS' advantaged security capabilities and track record relative to other providers, we continue to see momentum around customers wanting to do their long-term Gen AI work with AWS. We're building dozens of Gen AI apps across Amazon's businesses, several of which have launched and others of which are in development. This morning, we launched Rufus, an expert shopping assistant trained on our product and customer data that represents a significant customer experience improvement for Discovery.  Rufus lets customers ask shopping journey questions like what is the best golf ball to use for better spin control or which are the best cold weather rain jackets and get thoughtful explanations for what matters and recommendations on products. You can carry on a conversation with Rufus on other related or unrelated questions and retains context coherently. You can sift through our rich product pages by asking Rufus questions on any product features and will return answers quickly. We're at the start of what Rufus will do with further personalization and expansion coming, but we're excited about how it will make discovery even easier on Amazon. Gen AI is and will continue to be an area of pervasive focus and investment across Amazon, primarily because there are a few initiatives, if any, that give us the chance to reinvent so many of our customer experiences and processes, and we believe it will ultimately drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years. In addition to our stores and AWS businesses, we continue to make progress on newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long term. Touching on two of them. In October, we had a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper, which is our low earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide broadband connectivity to the 400 million to 500 million households who don't have it today. We launched two end-to-end prototype satellites into space and successfully validated all key systems and subsystems, made a 2-way video call, streamed a Prime Video movie in Ultra HD 4K and made an Amazon purchase over our end-to-end communication network. It's rare to be able to exercise all these elements in an initial launch like this. We're on track to launch our first production satellite in the first half of 2024 and started beta testing in the second half of the year. We've still got a long way to go, but are encouraged by our progress. During the quarter, we also completed our second season of Thursday Night Football, which was a rousing success by all accounts. The customer experience continued to improve as our talent, production, streaming quality, analytics, unique AI features like Prime Vision and defensive alerts, all took big leaps forward on top of the very good start last year. We launched a new NFL tradition with the inaugural Black Friday football game and our continuous innovation resonated with viewers as the number of people watching increased 24% year-over-year and with advertisers as we made dramatic year-over-year gains in ad sales. We have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own, and we'll continue to invest in compelling exclusive content for Prime members like Thursday Night Football, Go To The Rings, Reacher, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Citadel and more. And with the ads in Prime Video, we'll be able to continue investing meaningfully in content over time. I'll close by reiterating that 2023 was a really good year. I'm grateful to all of our teams who delivered on behalf of customers. Yet I think every one of us at Amazon believes this is just the start of what's possible. We have a long way to go in every one of our businesses before we exhaust how we can make customers' lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we're investing. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian."
AMZN,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T17:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,prepared,,Brian Olsavsky,"Thanks, Andy. Overall, we saw strong performance in the fourth quarter. Worldwide revenue was $170 billion, representing an increase of 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and approximately $3 billion above the top end of our guidance range. Saw our highest quarterly worldwide operating income ever, which was $13.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $10.5 billion year-over-year and $2.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range. For the full year 2023, we had a meaningful improvement across our financial results. Revenue was $574.8 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Operating income tripled year-over-year to $36.9 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $35.5 billion, up $48.3 billion versus last year. These financial outputs are a result of a lot of improvements in our key input metrics such as stores' cost to serve, which decreased year-over-year for the first time since 2018 and our ability to deliver to customers at our fastest speeds ever. I want to thank our customers, our partners and our teammates around the world for a very strong 2023 performance. Focusing on the fourth quarter, North America revenue was $105.5 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year and an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3. International revenue was $40.2 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, also an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3. During the quarter, we remained focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers, price, selection and convenience. Our shopping events throughout the quarter included Prime Big Deal Days in October and our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping event helped to attract new Prime members and deliver billions in savings for customers. We made meaningful progress on delivery speeds in the United States and globally, which helped strong sales throughout the quarter, including notable strength in the last-minute gifting where our ability to provide fast shipping helped our Prime members ensure that they got their gifts before the holidays. These improvements in delivery speed have led to increased purchase frequency by our Prime members across all of our major geographies. It also strengthened demand for our everyday essentials. Categories like beauty and health and personal care, where speed is even more important to customers. Third-party sellers were a big part of our success over the holidays with worldwide third-party seller services revenue growing at 19% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 61%, its highest level ever. We also saw strong performance in worldwide advertising, which grew 26% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products as our teams worked hard to increase the relevancy of the ads we show customers by leveraging machine learning. Advertising only works if the ads are helpful to customers and there's a lot of value in tailoring sponsored products, so they are relevant to what a customer is actually searching for. We're also continually focused on improving our measurement capabilities, which allow brands to see the payback of their advertising spend. Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $6.5 billion, an increase of $6.7 billion year-over-year, resulting in an operating margin of 6.1%, up 120 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Since North America operating margins were at their recent low levels in Q1 of 2022, we have now seen seven consecutive quarters of improvement resulting in a cumulative improvement of 800 basis points over these past seven quarters. In addition to the strong top line growth, which helped to drive improved leverage throughout our businesses, we continue to make progress on reducing our cost to serve. The fourth quarter is our busiest time of year, supported by an increasingly large and integrated operations network. Overall, our teams executed extremely well, yielding strong efficiency gains with minimal disruptions. We were pleased with the performance of our regionalized network during the holiday period, where we saw benefits from improved inventory placement helping drive faster speeds and also lowering costs. We also continue to see benefits from lower transportation rates, which include linehaul, ocean and rail and from a more stable labor market, resulting in improved staffing levels. In our International segment, we had an operating loss of $419 million, an improvement of $1.8 billion year-over-year. This improvement was primarily driven by lowering our cost to serve through increased units per box, lower transportation rates and leverage across our fixed costs as we continue to focus on customer inputs and improve efficiencies within our operations. The International segment represents more than 20 countries of varying degrees of growth and our largest established countries like the U.K., Germany and Japan, relatively strong revenue growth contributed to the year-over-year improvement in profitability. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they continued to expand their customer offerings, while seeking to invest wisely. Moving to AWS. Revenues were $24.2 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we added more than $1.1 billion of revenue in AWS as customers are continuing to shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Similar to what we shared last quarter, we continue to see the diminishing impact of cost optimizations. And as these optimization slow down, we're seeing more companies turning their attention to newer initiatives and reaccelerating existing migrations. Customers are also excited about our approach to generative AI. Still relatively early days, but the revenues are accelerating rapidly across all 3 layers and our approach to democratizing AI is resonating well with our customers. We have seen significant interest from our customers wanting to run generative AI applications and build large language models and foundation models, all with the privacy, reliability and security they have grown accustomed to with AWS. AWS' operating income was $7.2 billion, an increase of $2 billion year-over-year. Our operating margin for the quarter was 29.6%, up more than 500 basis points year-over-year and effectively flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis. This margin improvement reflects our headcount reductions from earlier in the year and a slowdown in the pace of hiring. Shifting to free cash flow. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow adjusted for finance leases was $35.5 billion, an improvement of $48.3 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of the improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income, which we are seeing across all three of our segments. We're also seeing improvements in working capital, notably in inventory efficiency driven by our regionalization efforts. Next, let's turn to capital investments. We define our capital investments as a combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2023, full year CapEx was $48.4 billion, which was down $10.2 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by lower spend on fulfillment and transportation. As we look forward to 2024, we anticipate CapEx to increase year-over-year, primarily driven by increased infrastructure CapEx, support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments in generative AI and large language models. One thing I'd like to highlight in our first quarter guidance is that we recently completed a useful life study for our servers and we are increasing the useful life from 5 years to 6 years beginning in January 2024. We will have this anticipated benefit to our operating income of approximately $900 million in Q1, which is included in our operating income guidance. As we turn the calendar to 2024, we are excited to continue upon the great work the teams have been able to deliver in 2023. We remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in an effective way that reduces costs and also allows us to continue innovating and inventing for customers. With that, let's move on to questions."

If we take a step back, can you talk a little bit about the contribution from backlog conversion, AI workloads and some elements that allowed you to reaccelerate revenue at AWS in Q4 and how we should think about those components from an exit velocity standpoint into 2024? And then against your broader comments on CapEx, any color on how we should be thinking about AI-driven CapEx within the AWS initiatives against the broader CapEx commentary? Thank you."

AMZN,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T17:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"And then if you look back at the revenue growth, it accelerated to 13.2% in Q4 as we just mentioned. That was an acceleration. We expect accelerating trends to continue into 2024. We're excited about the migrate -- continuous their resumption, I guess, of migrations that companies may have put on hold during 2023 in some cases and interest in our generative AI and products, like Bedrock and as Andy was describing that. On the CapEx side, let me talk in total for the company. We had $48 billion in 2023 was down $10 billion year-over-year. We talked about during the year quite a bit. A lot of the mix of investment in 2023 was tied to infrastructure, mostly supporting AWS but also supporting our core Amazon businesses was about 60% of our spend. So it reached a very high percentage. We anticipate those trends continuing into 2024. CapEx will go up in 2024. I'm not giving a number today, but we do -- we're still working through plans for the year, but we do expect CapEx to rise as we add capacity in AWS for region expansions, but primarily the work we're doing with generative AI projects. In the fulfillment center and logistics area, I would say it's more incremental capacity at this point based on additional demand, although we are seeing some additional investments for same-day delivery sites and automation, robotics. But the trend for most of the large percentage of the spend will be in infrastructure is going to continue into 2024."

I think just as it relates to the first part of the question, just the way to think about backlog conversion is just these are deals that we've signed that are long-term deals typically with customers. And then there's some amount of time it takes where we work with those customers to migrate those workloads. And so some of the trends that we have seen over the last quarter.  First of all, I think that the lion's share of cost optimization has happened. It's not that there won't be any more or that we don't see anymore, but it's just attenuated very significantly. And at the same time, what we've seen is that migrations and this speaks to some of the backlog, migrations that were proceeding, but maybe not at the pace that we saw before, have started to pick up again. We've also seen that a number of the deals that typically signed more quickly, but were signing more slowly in more uncertain environments. A lot of those got done in the last quarter, and you heard in my opening remarks some of the examples, but that was some of several, and we're continuing to see that trend.  And then on the Gen AI side, it's -- if you look at the Gen AI revenue we have, in absolute numbers, it's a pretty big number, but in the scheme of a $100 billion annual revenue run rate business, it's still relatively small, much smaller than what it will be in the future, where we really believe we're going to drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue over the next several years. But it's encouraging how fast it's growing and our offering is really resonating with customers."

Andy, the first one is sort of on the cost to serve comments coming down for the first time since 2018. As you sort of look into '24 and '25, can you just sort of walk us through some of the key operational blocking and tackling this to happen to continue to drive down that cost of serve back to 2018 levels? Or however you're thinking about your North Star from that perspective?  And then the second one is on sort of philosophical about capital returns. It looks like the cash balance could start building pretty nicely here. How do you think about the idea of buybacks, share repurchases or some type of capital return programs to sort of help shareholders out?"
AMZN,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T17:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Thank you, Brian, I appreciate it. I'll take the first, and I'll let Brian take the second. On the cost to serve coming down, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I don't think that we feel like where we're going to ultimately be. I think we feel like we have meaningful upside there. And I think one thing that it's easy to make as large a change as we made in regionalization in the U.S. and saying, check, we got that done. But the reality is, we still have several improvements and a bunch of ways that we can hone the regionalization improvements that we made in 2023 and in 2024. And so when the team speaks about the areas where they believe they have opportunities, there's still opportunities just in regionalization as we continue to hone that, but I also think, in many ways, it was very useful for us to go through what was a pretty significant change we went through during the pandemic, where we doubled the size of our fulfillment center network in 18 months and built out a last mile transportation network, the size of UPS in 18 months, it was disruptive to get that optimized. But one of the things that was very useful was, it really caused us to relook at everything we were doing with fulfillment network. And we looked at it really a beginner's eye and we have found so many areas that we believe that we can evolve that I think will both help our cost to serve and even more importantly, deliver faster delivery speeds for customers. And I mentioned one area which, in particular, which you'll see us focus on over the next year or two is just, we think there are real opportunities in our inbound network and our inbound processes. And then where we locate inventory in association with that, which will accomplish both of those tasks. But for us, I don't believe that we believe that 2018 is the North Star in cost to serve. I think we believe we can keep evolving it and being better than that."

We've gotten a lot better at fixed cost controls, as we scale. And I think you're seeing that as part of our ability to lower cost per serve not only in operations, it's actually throughout the company. And we're seeing a reduction in some of the inflationary factors that hit us in -- especially hard in 2021 and 2022, things like transportation services, fuel and others. So not totally out of the woods there, but coming down, and we still see some more upside. On your share repurchase question, first of all, just really excited to actually have that question. No one's asked me that in three years and appreciate it. But we have come through a tumultuous period where, as Andy just said, we doubled the size of our logistics footprint and invested heavily in -- we saw that negative free cash flow, at least on our all two calculation for the period 2021 to 2022. So we're glad to see the improvement in the bounce back in free cash flow. A lot of -- and we do debate and discuss capital structure policies annually or more often. And I have nothing to announce today, but again, we primarily think we have a lot of strong investments in front of us. We're good -- we're glad to have the liquidity -- better liquidity at the end of 2023, and we're going to try to continue to build that."

Brian, you've seen very good improvement in International profitability over the last several quarters. Can you just talk about some of the levers here that you're thinking about just as you look to move into positive operating income and then how International could potentially approach North America levels over time? And then just a follow-up there. Are you seeing any shipping disruptions currently related to the Red Sea and does that factor into your outlook at all for 1Q? Thanks."
AMZN,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T17:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Yes. Let me start with the second one first. So we're mindful of the geopolitical issues around the world, especially as you say in the supply chain and how that might impact shipments both to the U.S. and to Europe. We're just working very hard to make that not back up on customers, and we'll continue to work that. It's not a material impact into the -- it estimated in our guidance in Q1. But again, as I said, we're vigilant on that, and we'll work to take steps where we need to, to make sure that customer experience is not impacted. On the International segment, operating income, yes, we're very pleased with the results, especially over the last few quarters. We improved operating income by $1.8 billion year-over-year. And I would attribute it to the steady progress that Andy was saying about the U.S. is, again, cost of serve down, advertising is stronger, a lot of attention to cost, a lot of attention to investments, and we are going to invest and other fixed cost control. So a lot of that is what we're seeing in the established countries of Europe and Japan. I would divide the segment a bit into a couple of buckets. First, there's that International segment, excuse me, European established country segment. And that's -- it behaves a lot like you would see in North America. If you look at the emerging countries, and again, we've launched 10 countries in the last 7 years. They're all on their own trajectory of journey to profitability and significance with customers, and we're pleased with that. I think they're all growing nicely and again, leveraging their cost structure, investing wisely and Prime benefits, but all on a curve to breakeven and then be a contributor to income and free cash flow. The other thing I'd point out is that we have advanced loaded, I would say, price benefits in our International markets. We think it's a very good source of customer acquisition and customer retention. The investment in those areas can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. We had a bit of a higher spend in -- excuse me, in digital content in Q4 as we had a number of marketing and content, especially around live sports, English Premier League and Champions League in Germany and Italy, for example. But we like those benefits in those investments, different proven vehicle for customer acquisition, as I said, and it gets people shopping at our sites and engaging with benefits is always positive for the relationship with Amazon."

I think you mentioned, Brian, that the North American margins have improved for 7 quarters in a row or something like that, a significant number. I would assume that most of the factors like rising capacity utilization given your CapEx commentary about retail, the regional center efficiencies and then overall, moderation in shipping and logistics costs, labor costs, I mean, all these factors probably mean that we'll continue to get an improvement in North American margins, but if you would comment on that.  And then secondly, on the Primetime Video -- Amazon Prime video, I know we just launched. But could you provide any color or context on expectations around that? You've got a massive number of Prime users who are coming in with a reasonable CPM with low ad load, but it seems like there should be a substantial opportunity for you. So if you want to try to size that for us or how you think about the upside, that would be really appreciated. Thank you."
AMZN,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T17:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Sure, Mark. Thank you. I think Andy laid it out pretty well a few minutes ago on the cost structure, the regionalization, the -- growing into the assets that we added during the pandemic, great efficiency and work with productivity across really all of our operations network fixed -- attention to fixed cost and lowering costs where we can, maintaining costs where we can, the increase in advertising, success in advertising revenue growth that's outpaced our traffic growth rates.  So all of those trends we expect to continue, and we're going to work hard to make sure they continue. And as we said, we have one guidepost is maybe pre-pandemic profitability, but we are working to -- we're not putting a limit on our improvement. We're going to continue to look for ways to lower the cost to serve. And I might add, at the same time, increase the customer experience because we did that -- we had that cost improvement at the same time when we at first got back to our shipping speeds from pre-pandemic and then exceeded them. So we're happy with that, and we'll continue to do both to improve the customer experience and also to lower our costs and leverage our cost structure. Yes, your second question on ads. I can't scale it right now. I mean what I would say for ads in videos is that advertisers are excited to access our Prime customer base. We are looking for ways to increase our advertising in our streaming properties, including Fire TV, but also -- and Prime Video, but also things like Freevee and Twitch.  And it's an important part of the total business model, and we expect it will allow us to have a healthy business to continue to invest in content and to continue to grow that. And we feel good about it, and the way we anticipate the ads progressing, we will not have heavy ad loads relative to see other network TV and other things. And like all of our advertising, we're trying to be useful for customers."

First, on grocery, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the progress that you're making in unifying the offering between Dotcom, Fresh and Whole Foods. And as it relates to reverse logistics and using the grocery facilities, how that's lowering the cost of logistics and whether there is a significant opportunity there in terms of driving traffic and revenue in the grocery business?  Then secondly, on health care, in such a poor -- notoriously poor customer experience industry, you've made significant efforts now within acquisition and offering primary care. Just be curious if you could talk a little bit more about the longer-term vision in healthcare. Thank you."
AMZN,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T17:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes. On grocery, we're pleased with the progress we're making there. When we think about our grocery business right now and kind of, I'll call it, 3 big macro segments. The first is nonperishables where these are things like consumables and canned goods and pet food and health and beauty products and pharmaceutical. And we -- it's a big business and it's continuing to grow at a very healthy clip, and we're really pleased with that business. And it's really the way the most mass merchandisers got into the grocery business a few decades ago. So that continues to grow at a very healthy clip. We have a physical presence along with online, but Whole Foods market, which is really the pioneer and the leader in organic grocery and that's continuing to grow at a very good clip. We also made a number of changes in the business last year on the profitability side, where we really like the profitability trajectory we see there. And so again, you'll see that keep growing and expanding and feel very good about that as well.  If you want to serve as many grocery needs as we do, you have to have a mass physical presence. And that's what we've been trying to do with Fresh over several years. We have tested -- we've been testing a V2 of our Fresh format in a few locations near Chicago, in a few locations in Southern California. It's very early. It's just a few months in, but the results thus far are very promising and on almost every dimension. And so we need to see it for a little bit longer time, but the results appear like we have something that's resonating. And if we continue to see that, then the issue becomes how fast and what's the best way to expand. We have also been spending increasing amounts of time and efforts here trying to make it easier for customers to be able to shop between the nonperishables and then our selection of Whole Foods as well as Fresh, I think you can expect to see that over time, both in the user experience on the app and on the website as well as how we're able to better leverage between the different business segments and their logistics capabilities, being able to get better leverage there, better economics and then allowing people to order in one conservative place to be able to pick up in multiple -- pick up for multiple types of grocery products in one place. Just seeing us already do more of that, and I think you can expect that in the future. In the healthcare space, I -- if you think about what we do on the retail side, adding a pharmacy capability is a pretty natural extension. It's something that customers had asked us for many years, and it's got more complexity to it than the rest of our retail business. So we have to think carefully about whether we wanted to pursue it, but customers so badly wanted it and the experience we thought could be better and we could be a meaningful part of changing that, that we pursued it.  And I really like the momentum that we're seeing in our Amazon Pharmacy business. It's growing really quickly. But even more important with how fast it's growing, if you've used it and you've paid attention to the customer experience over the last 12 to 15 months, it's just substantially improved from where it already was pretty good. People really love the experience. And I think that when -- the healthcare experience, particularly in the U.S. is a pretty frustrating one and not a very good one. And I think that when we tell our grandkids that the way we used to have to go get primary care was to make an appointment 3 weeks in advance and then drive 20 minutes to the doctor, park, wait in the reception for 15 minutes, get put into an exam room for 15 minutes. Doctor comes in, talks to you for 5 to 10 minutes and then you got to drive 20 minutes to the pharmacy.  People are just not -- our grandkids will not believe that was the experience and it's not going to be, and you already see that changing. And its part of what attracted us in such a significant way to on medical. It's just their application, their app is so easy to use. You have all your healthcare data in one spot.  You can do chats with medical practitioners. You can do video calls, if you need to see someone, there's physical locations and lots of metropolis cities where you can get in the same day, if you need to see a specialist, they're probably into specialists and all the cities in which we operate, where you can get in a day or two later, like just it's a very different experience. Now if you actually need medication, you can get that sent to you in a day or two, either through Amazon pharmacy or other pharmacies that we work with. And that experience is so much better than what we've been accustomed to seeing. And so I think it's -- again, it's still early days. We're excited, we launched for Prime members the ability to get one medical subscription for $9 a month or $99 a year, which is 50% off, the typical price and that saw a very good take-up.  So it's still early days, but we think we have an opportunity to be a meaningful part of changing that experience. And if we are helpful in changing what that primary care experience is and what it looks like to get pharmaceutical items, there's a lot of other things that we might be able to help customers with over time that whether it's wellness or whether it's diet, there's a bunch of areas that I think we can help over time."

You outlined the generative AI stack, which I think is -- which is very clear. So I'm just curious maybe how you're going to market within the application layer given sort of the competitive dynamics of that. And then maybe expand, if you could, Andy, a little bit on the strategy for Gene AI on the consumer-facing side of the business. I know you launched Rufus today. Is that an area that you think could materially improve conversion rates and the overall consumer engagement on retail apps or what's your vision there? Thank you."
AMZN,2024-02-01,2024-02-02,,2024-02-01,2024-02-01T17:30:00-05:00,0,2024-02-01,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes. So Colin, I would say a few things on -- first on generative AI. It's -- when we talk to customers, particularly at enterprises as they're thinking about generative AI, many are still thinking through at which layers of those 3 layers of the stack, I laid out that they want to operate in. And we predict that most companies will operate in at least 2 of them. But I also think even though it may not be the case early on, I think many of the technically capable companies will operate at all 3. They will build their own models. They will leverage existing models from us, and then they're going to build the apps. And I know one of the other interesting things that we see early on right now in generative AI is that -- it's a very iterative process and real work to go from posing a question into a chat bot and getting an answer to turning that into a production quality application at the quality you need for your customer experience and your reputation and then also getting that application to work at the latency and cost characteristics that you need. And so what we see is that customers want choice. They don't want just 1 model to rule the world. They want different models for different applications. And they want to experiment with all different sized models because they yield different cost structures and different latency characteristics. And so Bedrock is really resonating with customers. They just -- they know they want to change all these variables and try and experiment and they have something that manages all those different transitions and changes so they can figure out what works best for them, especially in the first couple of years where they're learning how to build successful generative applications is incredibly important for them. So it's part of why we see Bedrock resonating so much. In the same way, what's attractive to enterprises when they think about coding companions like Q, is just if you can get 30%, 40% better productivity for your developers, which in many cases, for companies is their most scarce resource, it's a game changer. And they won't roll out every bit of code that comes from a coding companion. But if it can assist them to get 80% plus the way there quickly, that's a big deal. And one of the things that's unique about Q is it's not just a coding companion, yes, it's an expert on AWS. It will help you -- it helps you write the code, but it also helps you debug the code and it helps you test the code, helps you do transformations and it helps you figure out how a multistep implement features. There's a lot of -- helps you troubleshoot. If there's something in your application that's you write, you can find it and help you fix it. And so -- and then it also lets you look at all your data repositories, whether it's Internet or Wickes or the 40-plus data connectors like Salesforce, Alassian, and Zendesk and Slack. And let you have an intelligent conversation to get answers and take action. So it's a pretty differentiated capability there. And when enterprises are looking at how they might best make their developers more productive, they're looking at what's the array of capabilities in these different coding companion options they have.  And so we're spending a lot of time -- our enterprises are quite excited about it. It created a meaningful stir at reinvent. And what you see typically is that these companies experiment with different options they have and they make decisions for their employee base, and we're seeing very good momentum there. The question about how we're thinking about Gen AI in our consumer businesses. We're building dozens of generative AI applications across the company. It's every business that we have has multiple generative AI applications that we are building. And they're all in different stages, many of which have launched and others of which are in development.  So if you just look at our -- some of our consumer businesses, on the retail side, we built a generative AI application that allowed customers to look at summary of customer review, so that they didn't have to read hundreds and sometimes thousands of reviews to get a sense for what people like or dislike about a product. We launched a generative AI application that allows customers to quickly be able to predict what kind of fit they'd have for different apparel items. We built a generative AI application that in our fulfillment centers, that forecasts how much inventory we need in each particular fulfillment center. And so the start of the rollout of Rufus today is really just another step, but we think one that's pretty meaningful in being a generative AI powered shopping assistant and it's trained on our very expansive product catalog as well as our community Q&A and customer reviews and the broader web. But it lets customers discover items in a very different way than they have been able to on e-commerce websites. So if you want buying advice, like what should I look for in a pair of headphones or if you are doing purpose buying, like what should I buy for cold weather golf or comparisons, what's difference in lip-gloss or lip oil or you want recommendations of the best Valentine's Day gifts or you're on a detailed page with bridge product info, where you don't want to go through the whole page, you want to ask is this pickle ball rack that's good for beginners. All those questions you can pull in and get really good answers. And then it's seamlessly integrated in the Amazon experience that customers are used to and love to be able to take action. So I think that that's just the next iteration. I think it's going to meaningfully change what discovery looks like for our shopping experience and for our customers. And I could kind of step through every one of those consumer businesses. Our advertising business is building capabilities where people can submit a picture and ad copy is written and the other way around.  And you kind of think about Alexa, where we're building a very large -- expansive large language model is going to make Alexa even more productive and helpful for customer. Every one of our consumer businesses has a significant number of generative AI applications that they either have built and delivered or they're in the process of building. And I don't see that changing for many years. We have a lot of ideas."

Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2024, only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Andy."
AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,prepared,,Andrew Jassy,"Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $143.3 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates; $15.3 billion in operating income, up 221% year-over-year or $10.5 billion; and $48.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases, up $53.2 billion year-over-year. We remain focused on driving better experiences for our customers while also delivering efficiency improvements. Our financial results are an encouraging reminder of the progress we're making. Starting with our stores business, despite having hundreds of millions of items and the broadest selection available, we remain intensely focused on adding even more selection. One way is to continue adding brands we know our customers want. For instance, in the U.S., we recently welcomed Clinique and 2 Gen Z fashion favorites, Parade and Cider, and announced a collaboration with Hardly Ever Worn It in Europe to offer customers pre-owned items from luxury brands. Another way to drive selection is to make it easier for our third-party sellers to add their products to our store. We've recently launched a new generative AI tool that enables sellers to simply provide a URL to their own website, and we automatically create high-quality product detail pages on Amazon. Already, over 100,000 of our selling partners have used one or more of our gen AI tools. We remain focused on making sure we're offering everyday low prices, which we know is even more important to our customers in this uncertain economic environment. As our results show, customers are shopping but remain cautious, trading down on price when they can and seeking out deals. In Q1, we helped customers save with shopping events worldwide, including our first big spring sale in Canada and the U.S. We also held spring deal days in Europe and our Ramadan event in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Delivery speed really matters to customers, and we've continued to get faster while improving our safety performance. In this past Q1, we delivered to Prime members at our fastest speeds ever. In March, across our top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime members orders arrived the same or next day. And globally, in cities like Toronto, London, and Tokyo, about 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Faster delivery times have another important effect. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas, including how fast our Everyday Essentials business is growing and the continued increase in Prime member purchase frequency and total spend with us. Over the past year, we've talked about how our regionalization efforts have helped lower our cost to serve. We've continued to inspect our fulfillment network for additional opportunities and are working on several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also improving customer experience. One example of this is our work to increase the consolidation of units into fewer boxes. As we further optimize our network, we've seen an increase in the number of units delivered per box, an important driver for reducing our cost. When we're able to consolidate more units into a box, it results in fewer boxes and deliveries, a better customer experience, reduces our cost to serve, and lowers our carbon impact. Another prominent example is our efforts to revamp our U.S. inbound fulfillment architecture to allow for better inventory placement closer to our customers. This will be an iterative process throughout the year as we work with sellers and retail partners, and teams are making good progress on their plans. Advertising performance remained strong, with ad sales up 24% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products, supported by continued improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. We still see significant opportunity ahead in our sponsored products as well as areas where we're just getting started like Prime Video ads. Prime Video ads offers brands value as we can better link the impact of streaming TV advertising to business outcomes like product sales or subscription sign-ups, whether the brands sell on Amazon or not. It's very early for streaming TV ads but we're encouraged by the early response. Moving to AWS. Year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% in Q1, up from 13.2% in Q4. It's useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start. And given our much larger infrastructure cloud computing base, at this growth rate, we see more absolute dollar growth again quarter-over-quarter in AWS than we can see elsewhere. We're seeing a few trends right now. First, companies have largely completed the lion's share of their cost optimization and turned their attention to newer initiatives. Before the pandemic, companies were marching to modernize their infrastructure, moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud to save money, innovated at a more rapid rate, and to drive more developer productivity. The pandemic and uncertain economy that followed distracted from that momentum, but it's picking up again. Companies are pursuing this relatively low-hanging fruit in modernizing their infrastructure. And with the broadest functionality by a fair bit, deepest partner ecosystem and strong security and operational performance, AWS continues to be their strong partner of choice. Our AWS customers are also quite excited about leveraging gen AI to change the customer experiences and businesses. We see considerable momentum on the AI front where we've accumulated a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already. You heard me talk about our approach before, and we continue to add capabilities at all 3 layers of the gen AI stack. At the bottom layer, which is for developers and companies building models themselves, we see excitement about our offerings. We have the broadest selection of NVIDIA compute instances around, but demand for our custom silicon, Trainium and Inferentia, is quite high given its favorable price performance benefits relative to available alternatives. Larger quantities of our latest generation Trainium2 is coming in the second half of 2024 and early 2025. Companies are also starting to talk about the eye-opening results they're getting using SageMaker. Our managed end-to-end service has been a game changer for developers in preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training models faster, lowering inference latency, and improving developer productivity. Perplexity.ai trains models 40% faster than SageMaker. Workday reduces inference latency by 80% with SageMaker, and NatWest reduces its time to value for AI from 12 to 18 months to under 7 months using SageMaker. This change is how challenging it is to build your own models, and we see an increasing number of model builders standardizing on SageMaker. The middle layer of the stack is for developers and companies who prefer not to build models from scratch but rather seek to leverage an existing large language model, or LLM, customize it with their own data and have the easiest and best features available to deploy secure high-quality, low-latency, cost-effective production gen AI apps. This is why we built Amazon Bedrock, which not only has the broadest selection of LLMs available to customers but also unusually compelling model evaluation, retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, to expand model's knowledge base, guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, agents to complete multistep tasks, and fine-tuning to keep teaching and refining models. Bedrock already has tens of thousands of customers, including adidas, New York Stock Exchange, Pfizer, Ryanair and Toyota. In the last few months, Bedrock's added Anthropic's Claude 3 models, the best-performing models in the planet right now; Meta's Llama 3 models; Mistral's various models, Cohere's new models and new first-party Amazon Titan models. A week ago, Bedrock launched a series of other features, but perhaps most importantly, Custom Model Import. Custom Model Import is a sneaky big launch as it satisfies a customer request we've heard frequently and that nobody has yet met. As increasingly more customers are using SageMaker to build their models, they're wanting to take advantage of all the Bedrock features I mentioned earlier that make it so much easier to build high-quality production-grade gen AI apps. Bedrock Custom Model Import makes it simple to import models from SageMaker or elsewhere into Bedrock before deploying their applications. Customers are excited about this, and as more companies find they're employing a mix of custom-built models along with leveraging existing LLMs, the prospect of these 2 linchpin services in SageMaker and Bedrock working well together is quite appealing. The top of the stack are the gen AI applications being built. And today, we announced the general availability of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and leveraging company's internal data. On the software development side, Q doesn't just generate code. It also tests code, debugs coding conflicts, and transforms code from one form to another. Today, developers can save months using Q to move from older versions of Java to newer, more secure and capable ones. In the near future, Q will help developers transform their .NET code as well, helping them move from Windows to Linux. Q also has a unique capability called Agents, which can autonomously perform a range of tasks, everything from implementing features, documenting, and refactoring code to performing software upgrades. Developers can simply ask Amazon Q to implement an application feature such as asking it to create an add to favorites feature in a social sharing app, and the agent will analyze their existing application code and generate a step-by-step implementation plan, including code changes across multiple files and suggested new functions. Developers can collaborate with the agent to review and iterate on the plan, and then the agent implements it, connecting multiple steps together and applying updates across multiple files, code blocks and test suites. It's quite handy. On the internal data side, most companies have large troves of internally relevant data that resides in wikis, Internet pages, Salesforce, storage repositories like Amazon S3 and a bevy of other data stores and SaaS apps that are hard to access. It makes answering straightforward questions about company policies, products, business results, code, people, and many other topics hard and frustrating. Q makes this much simpler. You can point Q at all of your enterprise data repositories and it will search all this data, summarize logically, analyze trends, engage in dialogue with customers about this data. We also introduced today a powerful new capability called Q Apps, which lets employees describe a natural language what apps they want to build on top of this internal data and Q Apps will quickly generate that app. This is going to make it so much easier for internal teams to build useful apps from their own data. Q is not only the most functionally capable AI-powered assistant for software development and data but also setting the standard for performance. Q has the highest-known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors and catching security vulnerabilities, and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic actions. Customers are gravitating to Q, and we already see companies like Brightcove, British Telecom, Datadog, GitLab, GoDaddy, National Australia Bank, NCS, Netsmart, Slam, Smartsheet, Sun Life, Tata Consultancy Services, Toyota, and Wiz using Q, and we've only been in beta until today. I'd also caution folks not to overlook the security and operational performance elements of these gen AI services. It's less sexy but critically important. Most companies care deeply about the privacy of the data in their AI applications and the reliability of their training and production apps. If you've been paying attention to what's been happening in the last year or so, you can see there are big differences between providers on these dimensions. AWS has a meaningful edge, which is adding to the number of companies moving their AI focus to AWS. We expect the combination of AWS' reaccelerating growth and high demand for gen AI to meaningfully increase year-over-year capital expenditures in 2024, which given the way the AWS business model works is a positive sign of the future growth. The more demand AWS has, the more we have to procure new data centers, power and hardware. And as a reminder, we spend most of the capital upfront. But as you've seen over the last several years, we make that up in operating margin and free cash flow down the road as demand steadies out. And we don't spend the capital without very clear signals that we can monetize it this way. We remain very bullish on AWS. We're at $100 billion-plus annualized revenue run rate, yet 85% or more of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And this is before you even calculate gen AI, most of which will be created over the next 10 to 20 years from scratch and on the cloud. There is a very large opportunity in front of us. We also continue to make strong progress on our newer investments. Our emerging international stores are growing and moving towards profitability. Our third-party logistics business offering services like Buy with Prime, Amazon shipping and multichannel fulfillment continues to grow well. We just launched a Prime delivery grocery benefit that lets customers receive free unlimited grocery delivery for just $9.99 a month, which is great value and customers are responding accordingly. Later this year in Manhattan, we're launching a new smaller Whole Foods market concept called Whole Foods Market Daily Shops. Prime Video continues to produce compelling content, with Fallout being our latest big hit on the heels of a very successful Road House movie, with strong customer engagement in our original and partner content. Our health services business is growing robustly as customers are loving our pharmacy customer experience, and we've launched same-day delivery of prescription medications to customers in 8 cities, including Los Angeles and New York City, with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year, with customers now getting first fill medications 75% faster year-over-year nationwide. And Kuiper is getting closer to having its production satellites in space and entering our commercial beta. There's a lot of invention happening across our business, and I'm super grateful to all our employees for their hard work and ingenuity. I'll close by sharing that I'm enthusiastic about how we started this year. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us in every one of our businesses to make our customers' lives better and easier. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update."
AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,prepared,,Brian Olsavsky,"Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $143.3 billion, representing a 13% increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and near the top end of our guidance range. I'd like to highlight a couple of points to help you interpret our growth rates. First, we saw an impact from leap year in Q1, which added approximately 120 basis points to the year-over-year quarterly revenue growth rate. Second, while I typically talk about growth rates, excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange, we did see an unfavorable impact from global currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar, more than we had planned in Q1. This led to a $700 million or 50 basis point headwind to revenue relative to what we guided. Excluding this FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Worldwide operating income was $15.3 billion, which was our highest quarterly income ever, and it was $3.3 billion above the high end of our guidance range. This was driven by strong operational performance across all 3 reportable segments and better-than-expected operating leverage, including lower cost to serve. The impact on operating income from our Q1 FX rate headwind was negligible. I'll speak more to our profitability trends in a moment. In the North America segment, first quarter revenue was $86.3 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. In the international segment, revenue was $31.9 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange."
AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,prepared,,We remain focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers,"selection, price, and convenience. During the quarter, around the world, we helped customers save with our shopping events. We added selection, including premium and luxury brands, and we delivered our fastest speeds ever for Prime members. Third-party sellers continue to be an important part of our offering. Third-party seller services revenue increased 16% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We saw strong 3P unit growth, coupled with increased adoption of our optional services, such as fulfillment and global logistics. For the quarter, third-party seller unit mix was 61%, up 200 basis points year-over-year. Shifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $5 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 5.8%, up 460 basis points year-over-year. We saw improvements in our cost to serve, including continued benefit from our work to regionalize our operations, savings from more consolidated customer shipments, and improved leverage driven by strong unit growth and lower transportation rates. In our international segment, operating income was $903 million, an improvement of $2.2 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 2.8%, up 710 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by our established countries as we improve cost efficiencies through network design enhancements and improved volume leverage. Additionally, we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they expand their customer offerings and make strides on their respective journeys to profitability. Looking ahead, we see several opportunities to further lower cost to serve and improved profitability in our worldwide stores business while still investing to improve the customer experience. Within our fulfillment network, we are focused on investing in our inbound network, streamlining and standardizing process paths, and adding robotics and automation. These improvement opportunities will take time. However, we have a solid plan in place and we like the path we're on. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in North America and international segments. We see many opportunities to grow our offerings, both in the areas that are driving growth today like sponsored products and in areas that are newer, like streaming TV ads. Moving to AWS. Revenue was $25 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year, and AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue run rate business. Excluding the impact from leap year, AWS revenue increased approximately 16% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we saw growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads across a diverse group of customers and across industries as companies are shifting their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud. Additionally, we continue to see the impact of cost optimizations diminish. While there always be a level of ongoing optimization, we think the majority of the recent cycle is behind us, and we're likely closer to a steady state of these optimization efforts. AWS operating income was $9.4 billion, an increase of $4.3 billion year-over-year. As a reminder, these results include the impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers, which primarily benefits the AWS segment. We made progress in managing our infrastructure and fixed costs while still growing at a healthy rate, which has resulted in improved leverage. As we've said in the past, over time, we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we are making in the business. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including generative AI, which brings us to capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as the combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. In 2023, overall capital investments were $48.4 billion. As I mentioned, we're seeing strong AWS demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads, with customers signing up for longer deals and making bigger commitments. It's still relatively early days in generative AI and more broadly, the cloud space, and we see sizable opportunity for growth. We anticipate our overall capital expenditures to meaningfully increase year-over-year in 2024, primarily driven by higher infrastructure CapEx to support growth in AWS, including generative AI. Turning to our revenue guidance for Q2. Net sales are expected to be between $144 billion and $149 billion or to grow between 7% and 11% compared with the second quarter of 2023. We saw an unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange in our Q1 results, and we expect that headwind to grow in the second quarter. Our Q2 net sales guidance anticipates an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 60 basis points. As part of our guidance considerations, we also continue to keep an eye on consumer spending and macro level trends, specifically in Europe where it appears to be a bit weaker relative to the U.S. Operating income is expected to be between $10 billion and $14 billion in Q2. This estimate includes the impact of our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense, driven by the timing of our annual compensation cycle. I want to thank our customers, our partners, and our teammates around the world for a very strong start to the year, and we're excited to build on this momentum. We'll remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in a way that allows us to continue inventing for customers in a cost-effective way. With that, let's move on to your questions."
AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,qa,speaker_line_contains_cue,Operator,[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,qa,,Douglas Anmuth,"Probably for both Andy and Brian. Historically, Amazon has shifted between periods of heavy investment and then margin expansion back into heavier investment, but you now have a much bigger base of gross profit and overall operating income. As you think about gen AI and capital intensity or grocery or Kuiper or health care, is there anything from an investment perspective that could materially impact profitability going forward in your view?"
AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Doug, yes, we have historically always mentioned that. You have seen like a pendulum shift sometimes between profitability and investment. I think we're at the stage now where we're doing both at the same time continually, so we are more apt to talk about the specific investments that we're making and how that might impact our short-term outlook. So if you look at the progress we've made on operating income and free cash flow over really the last 18 months, a lot of it's driven by improvements in our stores business, lower cost to serve. We've talked about regionalization efforts and how that's moving into inbound areas now. Advertising has been growing strong and AWS has been strong. And you saw AWS margins increased 800 basis points sequentially off Q4. A lot of that's driven by cost controls and expanding revenue on the top line and lower cost structure throughout the company. We do see, though, on the CapEx side that we will be meaningfully stepping up our CapEx and the majority of that will be in our -- to support AWS infrastructure and specifically generative AI efforts. So I would expect that, that will increase -- it will increase depreciation, definitely in that segment. On the -- well, we're talking about CapEx. Right now, in Q1, we had $14 billion of CapEx. We expect that to be the low quarter for the year. As Andy said earlier, we are seeing strong demand signals from our customers and longer deals and larger commitments, many with generative AI components. So those signals are giving us confidence in our expansion of capital in this area. And as he also mentioned, we've done this for 18 years. We invest capital and resources upfront. We create capacity very carefully for our customers. And then we see the revenue, operating income and free cash flow benefit for years to come after that, with strong returns on invested capital. So a little bit of a long-winded answer to your question. But yes, we have -- the main issue that we'll see in the near term is additional CapEx and we've talked about that. And we continue to see strong CapEx performance in our stores business. Most of that will be related to modest capital or capacity increases, in addition to our same-day fulfillment network and some Amazon Logistics upgrades to the fleet. But for the most part, what you'll see is really going to be on the AWS side."
AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes, I just would add briefly, just to summarize. I understand where the question is coming from, Doug. And I think we're in a position to do both is the short answer. I think there's actually an opportunity in our existing large businesses in the stores business along with advertising and AWS. There's a lot of growth in front of us. And I think we're investing in a meaningful way. But I think we also -- we've been pretty consistent about don't believe that we're at the end of what we can do in terms of improving our cost structure on the store side. Yes, I think there are really unbelievable growth opportunities in front of us. And I think what people sometimes forget on the AWS side, it's a $100 billion revenue run rate business, that we're still 85-plus percent of the global IT spend is on premises. And if you believe that equation is going to flip, which we do, it means we have a lot of growth in front of us, and that's before the generative AI opportunity, which I don't know if any of us have seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time, for sure, since the cloud, perhaps since the Internet. And unlike in the cloud where so much -- there's a lot of work to be done to move from on-premises to the cloud, people do it and they get value out of it, which is why they modernize their infrastructure. But it's work. All of this generative AI set of workloads, which will transform every experience they're going to be built from scratch on the cloud largely. And so it's just tremendous opportunities there along with some of the other areas that we're investing that are really early stage. So I think it's both for us."

So I think the CEO of Anthropic has said that I think the next generation of models cost in the neighborhood of $1 billion to train. This would be like Claude 4, I guess, high end. And then the generation after that might be as much as $10 billion to train. So is this something that you feel like the industry will do on top of AWS? Do you feel like Olympus and some of the stuff you're doing in-house needs to kind of stay at the state-of-the-art, or can others do that? And then how much did all this training have an impact on the acceleration that you saw in 1Q for AWS revenue?"
AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Well, Ross, I would tell you that we have seen kind of 3, I'll call it, macro trends that I think are contributing to AWS' performance, at least in the last quarter. I think first of all, I think the lion's share of cost optimization is behind us. So I think companies will be smart and have learned a lot over the last number of months in how they run their infrastructure in the cloud. But I think the lion's share of the cost optimization is behind us. And I think people have moved to newer initiatives that I would, at a macro level, describe as modernizing their infrastructure and then trying to drive value at a generative AI. On the former, I think we were on this march before the pandemic, where most companies were trying to figure out how to move from on-premises to the cloud because it's more cost-effective and it's faster to innovate and they get real developer productivity. And then when the pandemic hit and people were in survival mode and the uncertain economy, you let people save costs wherever they could, and they got distracted on that. But they're back to pursuing and figuring it out because it's low-hanging fruit for them, and we see very significant growth in that space. And at the same time, we're seeing very significant momentum in people trying to figure out how to run their generative AI on top of AWS. I mentioned we have a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate that we see in AI already, and it's still relatively early days. And I think that there's -- at a high level, there's a few things that we're seeing that's driving that growth. I think first of all, there are so many companies that are still building their models. And these range from the largest foundational model builders like Anthropic, you mentioned, to every 12 to 18 months or building new models. And those models consume an incredible amount of data with a lot of tokens, and they're significant to actually go train. And a lot of those are being built on top of AWS, and I expect an increasing amount of those to be built on AWS over time because our operational performance and security and as well as our chips, both what we offer from NVIDIA. But if you take Anthropic, as an example, they're training their future models on our custom silicon on Trainium. And so I think we'll have a real opportunity for a lot of those models to run on top of AWS. I think the thing that people sometimes don't realize is that while we're in the stage that so many companies are spending money training models, once you get those models into production, which not that many companies have, but when you think about how many generative AI applications will be out there over time, most will end up being in production when you see the significant run rates. You spend much more in inference than you do in training because you train only periodically, but you're spinning out predictions and inferences all the time. And so we also see quite a few companies that are building their generative AI applications to do inference on top of AWS. And a lot of it has to do with the services. And the primary example we see there is how many companies, tens of thousands of companies, already are building on top of Amazon Bedrock, which has the largest selection of large language models around and a set of features that make it so much easier to build a high-quality, cost-effective low latency, production-grade generative AI applications. So we see both training and inference being really big drivers on top of AWS. And then you layer on top of that the fact that so many companies, their models and these generative AI applications are going to have their most sensitive assets and data. And it's going to matter a lot to them what kind of security they get around those applications. And yes, if you just pay attention to what's been happening over the last year or 2, not all the providers have the same track record. And we have a meaningful edge on the AWS side so that as companies are now getting into the phase of seriously experimenting and then actually deploying these applications to production, people want to run their generative AI on top of AWS."

I appreciate all the color in the shareholder letter and even tonight on cost to serve. Andy, maybe could you just help us quantify a little more how to think about some of your North Star cost to serve goals over the next couple of years? And what could that mean for potential accompanying reasonable ranges of outcomes for North America retail margins through all of that? And then the second one, if cost to serve does improve, I think it should lead to significant incremental cash flow even with more CapEx. So just remind us again how you sort of think through the philosophy of returning capital to shareholders in addition to continuing to invest for the long run?"
AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Brian, this is Brian. I will start with your second question. So as far as dividends or buybacks or any other capital structure moves, we don't have anything to share with you on that today. But I'll reacquaint you with our general philosophy. So our first priority is to invest in -- to support the growth opportunities and long-term investments within our businesses. And generally, we still have many opportunities to put that capital to use that would generate meaningful returns, especially as you heard in generative AI. So we're very -- we have a great deal of passion on that and conviction on that as well. We are reaching a different stage of free cash flow. As you mentioned, we had negative free cash flow for 2 years, '21 and '22, immediately after the pandemic as we had doubled the size of our operations network and had a lot of other expenses. That was followed by 2023 when we had our largest -- our highest free cash flow ever. And those trends have carried into Q1. So we feel good about the free cash flow. We are, again, still anticipating higher CapEx this year. The other thing that we're doing with cash flow right now is we're repaying some of the debt that we had taken on during that negative free cash flow period. We have reached a high watermark at the end of Q1 last year. And since then and then through this year, we'll pay that down over $25 billion. So that's our first priority as well as 2024 capital expenditures. But otherwise, nothing to share on that front. I'll tee up, Andy, on the stores profitability because I know there's always generally the comment about how high can operating margins go and how do they compare to historic trends. And I think the same still holds. We look back to before the pandemic, and we say, first, we can achieve those operating margins even without the impact of advertising. And we're not quite there yet. But we're not limiting ourselves to that. We're looking for ways to, again, turn over every rock, look at every process and everything that we do on the logistics side and see how can we get our cost structure down and how can we get speed up and selection up. So it is working on a lot of fronts there, but cost is certainly front and center as we meet and improve customer experience."

AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,qa,,Youssef Squali,"Andy, on logistics, in September, you launched Amazon supply chain. Can you just help us understand the opportunity you see there? Where are you in that journey to build logistics as a service on a global basis? And does that require a step function increase in CapEx?"
AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes. Thanks for the question, Youssef. I think that it's interesting what's happening with our -- the business we're building in third-party logistics. And it really kind of, in some ways, mirrors some of the other businesses we've gotten involved in, AWS being an example of it, even though it's -- they're very different businesses in that we realized that we had our own internal need to build a bunch of these capabilities. And we figured that there were probably others who had those same needs and we decided to build services out of them. So as our business has grown, it turns out to be pretty hard work to actually import items from overseas, get them through customs and through the border and then ship them from that point to various facilities. And then it turns out that you don't want to store those facilities in fulfillment centers because that space is really scarce. So you'd like to have them in upstream storage facilities that are very inexpensive. And then you'd like to have a way to be able to know when your more scarce supply in the fulfillment centers needs replenishment and be able to do it automatically from those upstream storage facilities. And so all of those were capabilities that we had to build for ourselves to be able to operate our stores business in the way that we wanted to and that our sellers wanted to. And so we built that capability for ourselves first and then we opened up those services as individual services to our sellers. And so we help sellers, we have a service that allows them to get items through the border and through customs. We have a service that allows them to ship from customs to various facilities, whether they're our own or their separate ones. We allow them to store items in our upstream low-cost warehouses that they can either automatically replenish into our fulfillment centers where we ship or they can move to other facilities that they have. We have a service that lets them -- where we'll ship either to our end customers if they're selling on Amazon or to their end customers. We obviously have Buy with Prime, where we enable our Prime customers to be able to buy from our third-party Buy with Prime sellers websites, which increases their conversion 25% versus what they would do on their own, and it's a great benefit for our Prime customers. And then I would say that supply chain with Amazon is really an abstraction on top of those individual building block services I just mentioned that makes it easier for customers to have the whole end-to-end supply chain integrated. That collective set of businesses is growing very significantly. It's already what I would consider a reasonable sized business. And I think it's just really early days. It is not something that we anticipate being a giant capital expense driver for us. We have to build a lot of those capabilities anyway to handle our stores business, and we think we can -- it will be a modest increase on top of that to accommodate third-party sellers. But are third-party sellers find high value in us being able to manage those components for them versus having to do it themselves and they save money in the process."

AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,qa,,Justin Post,"I thought I'd ask a couple of growth drivers that you mentioned. First, grocery, it seems like you're still changing the threshold for free delivery or the subscription prices. Just can you say at all how much that's contributing to your gross right now and do you think you're over the hump? Or are you optimistic this can be a really big category for you? And then maybe a little bit extra on Prime Video ramp, how that ramp went versus your expectations? And do you think that could be a meaningful contributor to ad revenues going forward?"
AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes. I'll take them in opposite order just on Prime Video ads. Very early days, just launched a few months ago. It's off to a really good start. I think advertisers are excited about being able to expand their ability to advertise with us in video beyond Twitch and Freevee to Prime Video shows and movies. I think they also find that the relevancy and the measurability of that type of advertising and Prime Video ads is unique for them. So it's off to a very good start, it's early days, but we're optimistic there. On grocery, I would tell you that we continue to be optimistic about what we're doing in grocery. We have a very large grocery business. It's kind of got a few different components. And we have a very, very significant nonperishables grocery business much the same way that the mass merchandisers entered this business 30 or 40 years ago. These are consumables and canned goods and pet food and health care and beauty products. That continues to grow at a very rapid rate. And we have an organic grocery business in Whole Foods Market, which is the pioneer in that space. And that business continues to grow very nicely. We're introducing a new smaller format in the fall in Manhattan and the Whole Foods Market Daily Shops idea. We've worked very hard on the profitability trajectory over the last 18 months and like the way that, that has taken shape. And then if you want to have -- do you want to serve as many grocery missions as we aim to serve. You have to have a perishables business and a mass physical presence. And that's what we've been working on with Amazon Fresh. We've launched our V2 format in physical stores over the last few months, primarily in Chicago and Southern California. We like the early results a lot. They're really meaningfully better in almost every dimension. It's still early, and there's some things to work through, but we like what we're seeing there. And then we have to decide the best way to roll those out over time. And as you mentioned, Justin, we just launched a Prime benefit for grocery, which is all-you-can-eat delivery for $9.99 a month, which if you order once from Whole Foods a month, it pays for itself, or once from Amazon Fresh for orders under $40, it pays for itself. It's a very valuable offering for our Prime members, and it's off to a great start. So we have a lot -- in my opinion, we have lots of ways that we can continue to help customers satisfy their grocery needs. And we have some building blocks that I think might also change how people split up their grocery orders over time. But I continue to be optimistic that, that's going to continue to grow for us."

AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,qa,,Ronald Josey,"Maybe, Andy, I wanted to ask on international profitability, just after 1Q's 2.8% margin. Talk just about where we are in terms of international getting or to consistent profitability. We're following a similar trajectory as North America in terms of benefiting from regionalization shift, and we saw what average distance of each package traveled actually came down by 25 kilometers and whatnot. And if you could provide any insights on maybe how inbound fulfillment architecture might add to just continued benefits on faster shipping, same-day, next day, et cetera."
AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Thank you, Ron. I'm going to start with this one on international profitability. So yes, in the quarter, our operating income was $902 million. And if you've watched that, we've seen a steady progression in operating income in our international segment, it's up $2.2 billion year-over-year. So we like the trend there. It breaks down into a few areas. I would say the established countries of Europe, Japan, as well as the U.K. are following a lot of the same trajectory as in the United States. They are profitable in their own right. They are adding selection, they're adding new features like grocery there, adding to their Prime benefits, and a lot of the work that we do in the United States carries over there. The second group is the emerging countries. And of course, we've launched 10 new countries in the last 7 years. Each of those has its own particular trajectory on profitability. The first thing we see there is having a good customer experience, having people sign up for Prime. A lot of times, our Prime Video benefits help with that. Then work on our cost structure as we get scale, add advertising and other things. And eventually, what we see is a breakeven -- countries breakeven and then they make positive income and free cash flow and are more of a contribution to the -- positive contribution to the international segment. So we're seeing both the emerging and the established improving, and we like the trajectory. And I think you'll see more of as we move forward."
AMZN,2024-04-30,2024-05-01,,2024-04-30,2024-04-30T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-04-30,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes. I would add a few things. I mean, I'm again quite bullish on our international stores business. It's already a very large business. We've added a number of countries that are on the right trajectory, as Brian just indicated, and it's going to be a big, profitable business for us. And I really like the direction it's headed. I'll take also just the second part of your question just really around continuing to take -- to work on cost structure. I'd say, first of all, on the regionalization side, which we've talked a lot about the last year, it may sound a little boring to talk about because we talked about it a lot of times. But I'd just tell you that we're not done there. A lot of the work that we've done, we still have opportunities to refine, to get more value out of that. And a lot of what we learned on the regionalization side in the U.S. was in part inspired from what we saw in Europe, which, in many ways, is set up as a regional network because of the nature of how close those countries are to one another. And I would say we have also learned lessons from what we've done in the U.S. that we're going to be able to apply to our international operations as well. I think we see additional opportunities in all sorts of places. A good example of which is just how and where we inbound items to. The architecture we've had set up has largely had people inbounding to a couple of places. And then we took -- we spent a lot of effort and time and expense in breaking those down and shipping them to lots of other places. And we believe we're going to be much more efficient in how we use the inbound network and how we partner with our sellers. Part of what we did with our change in seller fees, we lowered the outbound fees in a meaningful way, but then we added an incentive for our sellers to inbound into locations that allow us to be more cost following and allow both our sellers and us to enjoy in those cost savings when we're able to do so. And we're seeing very optimistic signs there, too. I think we're still early with respect to how we can continue to optimize the number of units per box, which has all sorts of good benefits. And then I'd just also say that it's been really interesting to watch the same-day facilities evolution in our fulfillment network. And I think a lot of people have made the assumption over the last few years that faster speeds are going to mean higher cost, and that is not the case if you build the infrastructure with the right building blocks the way we have over the last couple of years. And our same-day facilities are our least expensive facilities in the network. We still have a fraction of the number of those that we will have in the U.S. that we'll have in other parts of the world, which will, again, both change our cost structure while increasing speed. So I don't think we're at the limits of what we can do. It's not going to all happen in 1 year. We're going to be working hard at this and inventing at this for several years, but I think we have a lot of upside in front of us."

Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO, and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, August 1s, 2024 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy."
AMZN,2024-08-01,2024-08-02,,2024-08-01,2024-08-01T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-08-01,prepared,,Andy Jassy,"Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $148 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $14.7 billion, up 91% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $51.4 billion, up 664% or $44.7 billion year-over-year. As I think about what matters to customers long-term and, therefore, to Amazon, there's a lot to like about what we're seeing. Starting with AWS, year-over-year revenue growth accelerated again from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2. We're continuing to see three macro trends drive AWS growth. First, companies have completed the significant majority of their cost optimization efforts and are focused again on new efforts. Second, companies are spending their energy again on modernizing their infrastructure and moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. This modernization enables builders to save money, innovate at a more rapid clip, and drive productivity in most companies' scarcest resources, developers. This is the flip I've talked about in the past, where the vast majority of global IT spend today is on-premises, and we expect that to keep inverting over time. With the broadest functionality, the strongest security and operational performance, and the deepest partner ecosystem, AWS continues to be customers' partner of choice and the biggest beneficiary of this flip from on-premises to the cloud. And third, builders and companies of all sizes are excited about leveraging AI. Our AI business continues to grow dramatically with a multi-billion dollar revenue run rate despite it being such early days, but we can see in our results and conversations with customers that our unique approach and offerings are resonating with customers. At the heart of this strategy is a firmly held belief, which we've had since the beginning of AWS, that there is not one tool to rule the world. People don't want just one database option or one analytics choice or one container type. Developers and companies not only reject it, but are suspicious of it. They want multiple options for flexibility and to use the best tool for each job to be done. The same is true in AI. You saw this several years ago when some companies tried to argue that TensorFlow would be the only machine learning framework that mattered, and then PyTorch and others overtook it. The same one model or one-chip approach dominated the earliest moments of the generative AI boom, but we have a lot of data to suggest this is not what customers want here either. And our AWS team is determined to deliver choice and options for customers. You can see this philosophy in the primitive building blocks we're building at all three layers of the Gen AI stack. At the bottom layer, which is for those building generative AI models themselves, the cost to compute for training and inference is critical, especially as models get to scale. We have a deep partnership with NVIDIA and the broadest selection of NVIDIA instances available, but we've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. And the second versions of those chips, with Trainium coming later this year, are very compelling in price performance. We're seeing significant demand for these chips. These model builders also desire services that make it much easier to manage the data, construct the models, experiment, deploy to production, and achieve high-quality performance, all while saving considerable time and money. That's what Amazon SageMaker does so well, including its most recently launched feature called HyperPods that changes the game and networking performance for large models. And we're increasingly seeing model builders standardized on SageMaker. While many teams will build their own models, lots of others will leverage somebody else's frontier model, customize it with their own data and seek a service that provides broad model selection and great generative AI capabilities. This is what we think of as the middle layer, what Amazon Bedrock does and why Bedrock has tens of thousands of companies using it already. Bedrock has the largest selection of models, the best generative AI capabilities in critical areas like model evaluation, guardrails, RAG and agenting, and then makes it easy to switch between different model types and model sizes. Bedrock has recently added Anthropic's Claude 3.5 models, which are the best performing models on the planet. Meta's new Llama 3.1 models and Mistral's new Large two models. And Lama's and Mistral's impressive performance benchmarks in open nature are quite compelling to our customers as well. At the application or top layer, we're continuing to see strong adoption of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data. Q has the highest known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, but it does a lot more than provide code suggestions. It tests code, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors on catching security vulnerabilities and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic action. It also saves development teams time and money on the muck nobody likes to talk about. For instance, when companies decide to upgrade from one version of a framework to another, it takes development teams many months, sometimes years, burning valuable opportunity costs and churning developers who hate this tedious, though important work. With Q's code transformation capabilities, Amazon has migrated over 30,000 Java JDK applications in a few months, saving the company $260 million and 4,500 developer years compared to what it would have otherwise cost. That's a game changer. And think about how this Q transformation capability might evolve to address other elusive but highly desired migrations. During the past 18 months, AWS has launched more than twice as many machine learning and generative AI features into general availability than all the other major cloud providers combined. This team is cooking, but we're not close to being done adding capabilities for our customer's usage base. For perspective, we've added over $2 billion in advertising revenue year-over-year and generated more than $50 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months. Sponsored ads drive the majority of our advertising revenue today and we see further opportunity there. Even with this growth, it's important to realize we're at the very beginning of what's possible in our video advertising. In May, we made our first appearance at the upfronts and were encouraged by the agency and advertiser feedback on the differentiated value we offer across our content, reach, signals, and ad tech. With ads and prime video, the exciting opportunity for brands is the ability to directly connect advertising that's traditionally been focused on driving awareness, as is the case for TV, to a business outcome, like product sales or subscription signups. We're able to do that through our measurement and ad tech, so brands can continually improve the relevance and performance of their ads. While ads have become the norm in streaming video, we aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. And of course, for customers preferring an ad-free experience, we offer that option for an additional $2.99 a month. In our stores business, we saw growth of 9% year-over-year in the North America segment and 10% year-over-year in the international segment. A few notes on our North America revenue growth rate. First, last quarter's leap day added about 100 basis points of year-over-year growth. Second, we're seeing lower average selling prices, or ASPs, right now because customers continue to trade down on price when they can. More discretionary higher ticket items, like computers or electronics or TVs, are growing faster for us than what we see elsewhere in the industry, but more slowly than we see in a more robust economy. And our continued faster delivery speed is earning us more of our customers' everyday essentials business. Third, our seller fees are a little lower than expected given the behavior changes we've seen from our latest fee changes. While some of these issues compress short-term revenue, we generally like these trends. While consumers are being careful on price, our North America unit growth is meaningfully outpacing our sales growth as our continued work on selection, low prices, and delivery is resonating. So far this year, our speed of delivery for prime customers has been faster than ever before, with more than 5 billion units arriving the same day or next day. As more customers experience our fast delivery, they look to Amazon for more of their shopping needs, and the continued acceleration of our everyday essentials business is an example of this phenomenon. On seller fees, lowering apparel fees has spurred substantial year-over-year unit growth in apparel. And the incentive we've given sellers to send their items to multiple Amazon inbound facilities so they can save money where they save us effort and money is getting more traction than we even hoped. These collective developments will benefit customers in the form of better selection, lower prices, and faster delivery speed. There's no shortage of ideas aimed in improving the experience for stores' customers. For instance, we're adding even more value to Prime, recently introducing free restaurant delivery in many of our geos, expanding Amazon's PharmacyRx pass to Medicare members. This is a benefit that gives subscribers all you can consume access to the most common generic medications for just $5 a month, and offering a grocery subscription to help save on grocery items when shopping our U.S. and UK fresh stores. As we pursue these initiatives, we remain focused on lowering our cost to serve. We have a number of opportunities to further reduce costs, including expanding our use of automation and robotics, further building out our same-day facility network, and regionalizing our inbound network. With more optimal inbound inventory placement, we expect to enable faster speeds, consolidate more orders in one box, and reduce inventory transfers once items reach a fulfillment center. These cost improvements won't happen in one quarter or one fell swoop. They take technology and process innovation with a lot of outstanding execution, but we see a path to continuing to lower our cost to serve, which as we've discussed in the past, has very meaningful value for customers in our business. As we lower our cost to serve, we can add more low ASP selection that we can support economically, which coupled with our fast delivery, puts Amazon in the consideration set for increasingly more shopping needs for customers. A few other comments about areas in which we're investing. We remain very bullish on the medium to long-term impact of AI in every business we know and can imagine. The progress may not be one straight line for companies. Generative AI especially is quite iterative, and companies have to build muscle around the best way to solve actual customer problems. But we see so much potential to change customer experiences. We see it in how our generative AI-powered shopping assistant Rufus is helping customers make better shopping decisions. We see it in how our AI features that allow customers to simulate trying apparel items or changing the buying experience. We see it in how our generative AI listing tool is enabling sellers to create new selection with a line or two of text versus the many forms previously required. We see it in our fulfillment centers across North America where we're rolling out Project Private Investigator, which uses a combination of generative AI and computer vision to uncover defects before products reach customers. We see it in how our generative AI is helping our customers discover new music and video. We see it in how it's making Alexa smarter. And we see it in how our custom silicon and services like SageMaker and Bedrock are helping both our internal teams and many thousands of external companies reinvent their customer experiences and businesses. We are investing a lot across the board in AI, and we'll keep doing so as we like what we're seeing and what we see ahead of us. We also continue to like the progress in Prime Video. Our storytelling is resonating with our hundreds of millions of monthly viewers worldwide, and the 62 Emmy nominations Amazon MGM Studios recently received is another supporting data point. We recently debuted titles like Fallout, the second most watched original title ever for Prime Video, The Idea of You, which attracted nearly 50 million viewers worldwide in the first two weeks on Prime Video, and Season 4, The Boys, which reached number one on Prime Video in 165 countries in its opening two weeks. And we continue to see momentum in live sports. We recently announced 11-year landmark deals with the NBA and the WNBA. When combined with our original films and shows, partner streaming services, licensed content, and rent or buy titles, Prime Video continues to evolve into the best destination for streaming video. And for Project Kuiper, our low-Earth orbit satellite constellation, we're accelerating satellite manufacturing at our facility in Kirkland, Washington. We've announced a distribution agreement with Vrio, who distributes direct TV Latin America and Sky Brazil to offer Project Kuiper's satellite broadband network to residential customers across seven countries in South America, and we continue to feel significant demand for the service from enterprise and government entities. We expect to start shipping production satellites late this year and continue to believe this could be a very large business for us. I could go on, but we'll stop here. There's a lot to feel optimistic about over the next several years and the team collectively remains focused on continuing to invent and deliver for our customers in the business. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update."
AMZN,2024-08-01,2024-08-02,,2024-08-01,2024-08-01T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-08-01,prepared,,Brian Olsavsky,"Thanks, Andy. Let's start with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $148 billion, an 11% increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This equates to a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange in the quarter, which is about $300 million higher than we'd anticipated in our Q2 guidance range. Worldwide operating income nearly doubled year-over-year to $14.7 billion, which was $700 million above the high end of our guidance range. Across all of our segments, we remain focused on managing costs in a way that allows us to continue innovating and investing in areas that we think could move the needle for our customers. Starting with the North American international segments, customers continue to respond positively to our focus on low prices, broad selection, and fast shipping offers. We delivered at our fastest speeds ever so far this year, which helps drive strength in areas like our everyday essentials. These include items like non-perishable foods, as well as health, beauty, and personal care items. And Prime members continue to increase their shopping frequency while growing their spend on Amazon. Overall unit sales grew 11% year-over-year, which is consistent with our growth rates in Q1 after you adjust for the approximately 100 basis point impact of leap year. North America segment revenue was $90 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year. And international segment revenue was $31.7 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. North America segment operating income was $5.1 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 5.6%, up 170 basis points year-over-year, and down 20 basis points quarter over quarter. If we look at profitability of the core North America stores business, we actually improved our margin again quarter-over-quarter in Q2. The overall North America segment operating margin decreased slightly due to increased Q2 spend in some of our investment areas, including Kuiper, where we're starting to manufacture satellites we'll launch into space in Q4. We saw improvements in our cost to serve, driven by our efforts to place inventory more regionally, closer to where our customers are. This resulted in more consolidated shipments, with higher units per box shipped. We also saw packages traveling shorter distances to customers, and this also led to better on-road productivity in our transportation network. Our international segment was profitable again in Q2, with operating income of $300 million, an improvement of $1.2 billion year-over-year. Operating margin was 0.9%, up 390 basis points year over year. This increase is primarily driven by our established countries, as we improve our cost structure with better inventory placement and more consolidated shipments. Additionally, our emerging countries continue to expand their customer offerings, leverage their cost structure, and invest in expanding prime benefits. We are pleased with the overall progress of these countries as they make strides on their respective paths to profitability. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments, and we saw strong growth on an increasing larger revenue base this quarter. We continue to see opportunities that further expand our offering in areas that are driving growth today, like sponsored products, as well as newer areas, like Prime Video ads. Moving next to our AWS segment, revenue is $26.3 billion, an increase of 18.8% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of more than $105 billion. During the second quarter, we saw continued growth across both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads. We saw companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premises to the cloud, and tap into the power of generative AI. AWS operating income was $9.3 billion, an increase of $4 billion year-over-year. It's driven by our continued focus on cost control, including a measured pace of hiring. Additionally, AWS operating margin includes an approximately 200 basis point favorable impact from the change in the estimated useful life of our servers that we instituted in Q1. As we've long said, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including generative AI. Now let's turn our attention to capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as a combination of CapEx plus equipment finance leases. For the first half of the year, CapEx was $30.5 billion. Looking ahead to the rest of 2024, we expect capital investments to be higher in the second half of the year. The majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads. For the third quarter, specifically, I'd highlight a few seasonal factors to keep in mind. First, we hosted another successful Prime Day in mid-July. It was our 10th Prime Day and was our largest ever. Prime members globally saved billions of dollars on deals across every product category. From a profitability perspective, we've historically seen a headwind to operating margin in Q3, driven by Prime Day deals, as well as the marketing spend surrounding the event. Additionally, in Q3, we also begin to ramp up our capacity to handle Q4 holiday volumes in our fulfillment network. And lastly, we expect an increase in digital content cost quarter-over-quarter from the return of our NFL Thursday Night Football. We remain heads down, focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions."

Maybe a two-parter on AWS. There's been a theme during the last couple of weeks of earnings of the potential to over-invest as opposed to under-invest in AI as a broad theme. I'm curious, Andy, if you have a perspective on that in terms of thinking about elements of capitalizing on the theme longer term against the potential for pace or cadence of investment on AWS as a segment. And the second part would be coming back to your comments on custom silicon. How do you feel about custom silicon, both from a pace of investment and then more broadly, how you think about it as a return profile on a pivot to more custom silicon in your portfolio over the medium to long term? Thanks so much."
AMZN,2024-08-01,2024-08-02,,2024-08-01,2024-08-01T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-08-01,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Thanks, Eric. I'll take them in order. I think on the question about investment in AWS and on the AI side, I think where I'd start is, I think one of the least understood parts about AWS over the last 18 years has been what a massive logistics challenge it is to run that business. If you think about the fact that we have about 35 regions and think of a region as multiple -- a cluster of multiple data centers and about 110 availability zones, which is roughly equivalent to a data center, sometimes it includes multiple. And then if you think about having to land thousands and thousands of SKUs across the 200 AWS services in each of those availability zones at the right quantities, it's quite difficult. And if you end up actually with too little capacity, then you have service disruptions, which really nobody does because it means companies can't scale their applications. So most companies deliver more capacity than they need. However, if you actually deliver too much capacity, the economics are pretty woeful and you don't like the returns of the operating income. And I think you can tell from having -- we disclosed both our revenue and our operating income in AWS that we've learned over time to manage this reasonably well. And we have built models over a long period of time that are algorithmic and sophisticated that land the right amount of capacity. And we've done the same thing on the AI side. Now AI is newer. And it's true that people take down clumps of capacity in AI that are different sometimes. I mean -- but it's also true that it's not like a company shows up to do a training cluster asking for a few hundred thousand chips the same day? Like you have a very significant advance signal when you have customers that want to take down a lot of capacity. So while the models are more fluent, it's also true that we've built, I think, a lot of muscle and skill over time in building these capacity signals and models. And we also are getting a lot of signal from customers on what they need. I think that it's -- the reality right now is that while we're investing a significant amount in the AI space and in infrastructure, we would like to have more capacity than we already have today. I mean we have a lot of demand right now. And I think it's going to be a very, very large business for us. On the custom silicon point, yeah, it's really interesting what's happened here. And it's also -- our strategy and approach here has been informed by running AWS for 18 years. When we started AWS, we had and still have a very deep partnership with Intel on the generalized CPU space. But what we found from customers is that they -- when you find a -- an offering that is really high value for you and high return, you don't actually spend less, even though you're spending less per unit, you spend less per unit, but it enables you and free you up to do so much more inventing and building for your customers. And then when you're spending more, you actually want better price performance than what you're getting. And a lot of times, it's hard to get that price performance from existing players unless you decide to optimize yourself for what you're learning from your customers and you push that envelope yourself. And so we built custom silicon in the generalized CPU space with Graviton, which we're on our fourth model right now. And that has been very successful for customers and for our AWS business is it saves customers about -- up to about 30% to 40% price performance versus the other leading x86 processors that they could use. And we saw the same trend happening about five years ago in the accelerator space in the GPU space, where the products are good, but there was really primarily one provider and supply was more scarce than what people wanted. And people -- our customers really want improved price performance all the time. And so that's why we went about building Trainium, which is our training chip and Inferentia, which is our inference chip, which we're on second versions of both of those, they will have very compelling relative price performance and in a world where it's hard to get GPUs today, the supply is scarce and all the schedules continue to move over time. Customers are quite excited and demanding at a high clip. Our custom silicon, and we're producing it as fast as we can. I think that's going to have very good return profile just like Graviton has and I think it will be another differentiating feature around AWS relative to others."

AMZN,2024-08-01,2024-08-02,,2024-08-01,2024-08-01T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-08-01,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Thanks for the questions. I have two. So the first one I wanted to ask about in the second quarter, the retail gross margins that we're trying to do the monkey math, look a little weaker than expected. Was there any extra pressure on retail gross margins because of discounting? Or is that where Kuiper is? Or sort of how do we think about some of the drivers of retail gross margins in the quarter at shipping? And the second one, Andy, in the past, you talked about cost to serve improvement and sort of getting the North America margins back to pre-pandemic levels. Can you just remind us again sort of the internal philosophy about executing on that? Is there a time line to deliver on that? Sort of how are you sort of balancing showing that profitability improvement over the next couple of years versus pressing on new investments like Kuiper and perhaps reinvesting some of those profits over the next couple of years?"
AMZN,2024-08-01,2024-08-02,,2024-08-01,2024-08-01T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-08-01,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Brian, let me start with the first question on North America margins. So if you look at the segment operating margins, we did decrease 20 basis points sequentially from Q1 to Q2. I'll remind you that we have - see the annual step-up in stock-based compensation at the end of Q1 each year, and that added about $1.8 billion of stock-based comp expense in Q2 versus Q1. So that's impacting to some extent, all three segments. But even with that stock-based comp step up, the stores part of the North America segment, increase the margin again last quarter. So we're continuing to see strong improvements in cost to serve as well as improvement in speed, added selection, better safety. So a lot of the key areas that we're hitting on are strong. What you're seeing for the segment is that some of our investment areas had a tick up in expenses and investment in Q2 versus Q1. And that's not unheard of. Q1 is usually the lightest investment quarter, things like Prime Video and devices have less investment going on in those quarters. But the one thing I'd point out, I think we mentioned it is Kuiper stepping up a bit in Q2 versus Q1 as we start to build satellites that we'll launch in Q3 and Q4 this year. And your second question, Brian, I continue and the team continues to believe that we have the opportunity to expand the margin in our stores business. And as I've said on a number of the calls that we've done, it's not going to happen in one quarter, it's not going to happen in one fell swoop, it's going to take work over a long period of time. But I think that one of the silver linings, if you will, about year and half ago in the ricochet of the pandemic and all the growth that we had and the cost to serve challenges that we had was, it really forced us to reevaluate everything in the network. And really, even our most closely felt beliefs over a long period of time. And what it did was unveiled a number of opportunities that we believe we have to keep driving cost to serve down. And the first one that you've seen play out over the last year or so has been the regionalization of the U.S. network. And I think one thing to remember about that is that while it's had even bigger impact than maybe we theorized when we first architected it, we're still not done fully honing it. There's a lot of ways that we continue to optimize that U.S. regionalization that we think will continue to bear lower cost to serve. But at the same time, we found a number of other areas where we believe we can take our cost down while also improving the customer experience. One of the great things about regionalization was it not only took our cost to serve down, but it meaningfully changed the speed with which we're able to get items to customers. And so we have a number of those other opportunities. Another example of that is regionalizing our inbound network, which is also going to lower our cost to serve and get items more close to end users and diminish the amount of time it takes to get them to customers. We have a number of things that we're working on that allow us to combine more units per box, which lowers our costs as well and a lot of customers like that better because it's better for the environment, having more units per box. So I think we have a lot of opportunities to continue to take down our cost to serve. And strategically and philosophically, just two other things as you were alluding to that question. I think that from our perspective, as we're able to take cost to serve down, it means that we're able to afford to have more selection that we're able to offer to customers. And there are a lot of lower ASP items there, average selling price items that we don't stock because they're not economic to stock with our current cost to serve. But as we work hard to make progress like we are on lowering our cost to serve, that allows us to add more selection. And we see this time in and time out that we -- when we add more selection, customers actually consider us for more of their purchases and spend more with us down the line. I think the other thing, too, I would tell you is that I don't see it as being binary in any way, nor have I really ever seen it this way in the history of the company. I've been here 27 years. But we don't think of it as we can either be investing or we can be working on trying to take our cost to serve down. We believe we can do both. If you think about the examples you gave, the stores business and the Kuiper business are -- they're just different people working on those businesses. So our stores team is going to continue to work really hard on expanding selection and keeping prices low and speeding up our delivery times and driving our cost to serve down while our Kuiper team is working on how to figure out how to help the 400 million to 500 million households around the world who don't have broadband connectivity get that connectivity and allow them to do a lot of the things we take for granted today with broadband connectivity. So they're not going to be binary. We're going to work on them both at the same time."

AWS, those three factors that are causing that kind of acceleration in Q2 and recovery in growth rates from a year ago, those sound sustainable? Is there any reason that we shouldn't see sort of ongoing acceleration at some level through the back half of the year? And secondly, I just want to ask about a small segment of pharmacy. It seems to me like at least anecdotally I seem to lean more into marketing for that and survey work suggests to us that there's kind of greater consumer interest in that. Just talk about where that business is for you? And is it at a point where you feel like you move beyond early adoption and are leaning into kind of getting more mass Amazon customer adoption? Thank you."
AMZN,2024-08-01,2024-08-02,,2024-08-01,2024-08-01T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-08-01,qa,,Andy Jassy,"On the AWS question, it's always hard to predict what the growth rates are going to be, and it's a relatively large business at $105 billion revenue run rate at this point. But I do think that we have seen the lion's share of the cost optimization happen. And I also do believe that pre-pandemic, we were on this March where most companies are trying to figure out how to modernize their infrastructure, which really means moving from on-premises to the cloud because they can save money and invent that more quickly and get better developer productivity. And then the pandemic happen and people were in survival mode and then a difficult economy came and people are trying to save money. And we just see people going back to asking themselves, why aren't we taking this low hanging fruit here. I mean it makes -- I don't want to run my own data centers. I can actually be more cost-effective and invent more quickly from my customers if I'm using the cloud. And AWS with just a lot more functionality, stronger operational performance and security, which really matters to customers as well and a deeper partner ecosystem continues to be the partner of choice as people are moving to the cloud. And I think the generative AI component is in its very early days. It's -- as I said, we kind of sometimes look at it and say that it's interesting that we have a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate already in AI, and it's so early. But if we look at the amount of demand that we have from customers right now, it's very significant. So I think all three of those things have a chance and will likely continue over time. And we'll see where that growth rate nets out over the next number of years. I think that -- the one other thing I would say about that, too, Mark, is that -- the business today, as I mentioned, it's a $105 billion revenue run rate business, about 90% of the global IT spend is still on premises. And if you believe that equation is going to flip, which I do, there's a lot of growth ahead of us in AWS as the leader in all those dimensions I mentioned. But I also think that generative AI itself and AI as a whole it's going to be really large. I mean it is not something that we originally factored when we were thinking about how large AWS could be and unlike the non-AI space, where you're basically taking all of this infrastructure that's been built on premises over a long period of time and working with customers to help them migrate it to the cloud, which is a lot of work, by the way. In the generative AI space, it's going to get big fast and it's largely all going to be built from the get-go in the cloud, which allows the opportunity for those businesses to continue to grow. On the pharmacy side, I think you're right that you're seeing that business continue to grow and to get more resonance with customers. And I think it was always a relatively natural extension for us to build a pharmacy offering from our retail business. But I think a lot of what you see in the business has grown really quickly, a lot of what you've seen is that the work that the team has done on the customer experience over the last 18 months has really paid off. Customers love the customer experience of Amazon Pharmacy. And especially, by the way, when you think about the experience and the speed and ease with which you can order versus walking into a pharmacy in a physical store, if you walk into pharmacies and -- in cities today, it's a pretty tough experience with how much is locked behind cabinets, where you have to press a button to get somebody to come out and open the cabinets for you and a lot of shop lifting going on in the stores. So the combination of what's happening in the physical world and how much improved we've made our pharmacy experience is driving a lot of customer resonance and buying behavior. I think also you see us continuing to expand there. We expanded our RxPass package and program to Medicare members, that program allows customers and members to be -- Prime members to be able to get up to 60 common medications for just $5 a month. And we continue to launch same-day delivery of medications to cities. We have them in 8 cities, including Los Angeles and New York today with plans to expand to more than a dozen cities by the end of the year. So we're seeing a lot of growth there, and we're very optimistic about it."

And I guess, Andy, when you think about getting the data state ready, I know AI today is early, but when you see most of these companies are having to move to public cloud, are you seeing a step-up in return to workloads moving to get ready for this day to stay even if they're not ready to adopt AI? What are you seeing in those sales motions? Thank you."

So when we work with customers, and this is true both when we work directly with customers as well as when we work with systems integrator partners, everyone is in a hurry to get going on doing generative AI and one of the first questions that we ask is show us where your data is, show us what your data lake looks like, show us how you're going to access that data. And there's very often work associated with getting your data in the right shape and in the right spot to be able to do generative AI. Fortunately, because so many companies have done the work to move to the cloud, there's a number of companies who are ready to take advantage of AI, and that's where we've seen a lot of the growth. But also it's worth remembering that again, remember the 90% of the global IT spend being on premises, there are a lot of companies who have yet to move to a cloud, who will, and the ability to use AI more effectively is going to be one of the many drivers in doing so for them."

So yes, the margin is in the mid-30% range in Q2. It's up from the mid-20% range last year. So you're seeing the impact of a number of cost reductions that we've made and efficiencies we've driven in the business. There's also an adjustment that we made to the useful life of servers that happened in Q1. Talked about last quarter, that contributed about 200 basis points of margin year-over-year. So we continue to work on the cost structure. But again, as we've said in the past, these operating margin will fluctuate and be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. We are -- continue to work to build new products that attract new customers and work on our efficiencies. Second question was?"

You mentioned we're about $300 million profit for the quarter. That is up about 390 basis points year-on-year from a margin perspective. And as we talked about in the past, there's a number of countries that different stages of existence and maturity there. And so I think you're seeing continued progress, certainly on a year-over-year basis with both our established countries. So the UK, Germany and Japan in particular, being sizable contributors to that business, continued improvement and build out there, similar to the factors we talked about with the U.S., focused on operational efficiency while expanding the customer experience. And then in the emerging countries, as we've said over the past several quarters, we launched about 10 countries over the last seven years really focused on, again, expanding that customer experience, building out the Prime member benefits while building scalable solutions for customers. And so I think in both that established and emerging areas, seeing good progress year-over-year in working for further improvement there."

You factored in some macro indiscretionary pressures into your 2Q guide, especially in Europe, and I think you called out computers, electronics and maybe TVs in 2Q as well. I’m just curious, were the macro trends generally as you expected? Or did you see softening through the quarter? And kind of how does that influence your 3Q outlook? And then separately, Brian, can you help us quantify the incremental investment around Kuiper that you talked about? Thank you."
AMZN,2024-08-01,2024-08-02,,2024-08-01,2024-08-01T17:30:00-04:00,0,2024-08-01,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Yeah, sure. Thank you, Doug. The macro factors, if I step back, I think Andy discussed it earlier as well. We're seeing a lot of the same consumer trends that we have been talking about for the last year. Consumers being careful with their spend, trading down, looking for lower ASP products, looking for deals. That continued into Q2, and we expect it to continue into Q3. We're seeing signs of it continuing in Q3. The difference in Q2 was that, again, we had very strong unit volume growth. We actually slightly accelerated when you adjust for leap year in North America unit growth in Q2. So the drop in revenue sequentially -- revenue growth sequentially was tied to ASP and both continuation of existing trends, but also as we talked about growth in our everyday essentials business and categories. So while we think we are selling a number of higher ticket items, certainly and holding up well in the market itself, certainly not as strong as it's been in a normalized economy. And -- so it's -- lower ASP products are more of the mix right now. And we like that because, again, our speed allows us to deliver, especially everyday essentials, quickly, and we'd like to be in the consideration set for consumers on those items. We're not going to quantify Kuiper today, but thank you for your question."

Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 31, 2024 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Andy."
AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,prepared,,Andy Jassy,"Thanks, Dave. Today, we're reporting $158.9 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $17.4 billion, up 56% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $46.1 billion, up 128% or $25.9 billion year-over-year. As always, we're focused on making our customers' lives better and easier and thinking long term with respect to how we can keep helping customers and build a successful business to outlast all of us. In our stores business, we saw sales growth of 9% year-over-year in the North America segment and 12% year-over-year in the international segment. Our team continues to focus on the inputs that matter most to customers, really broad selection, low prices, fast and free delivery, and a range of compelling Prime member benefits, including our recent additions of unlimited grocery delivery from Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh, and local third-party grocery partners for $9.99 a month and fuel savings of $0.10 a gallon at bp, Amoco, and ampm stations in the US. At a time when consumers are being careful about how much they spend, we're continuing to lower prices and ship even more quickly, and we can see this resonating with customers as our unit growth continues to be strong and outpace even our revenue growth. In the last few months, we've hosted our largest and most successful Prime Day and Prime Big Deal Days ever and helped customers save over $5 billion across more than 50 million deals. And for the second year in a row, we are on track to deliver our fastest speeds ever for Prime members globally. We also continue to focus on lowering our cost to serve and are pursuing several initiatives that we believe will have meaningful long-term impact in this area. First, we continue to believe there are more gains on top of what we've captured thus far in outbound regionalization and getting more items closer to end consumers. As such, we're in the process of significantly changing the way we inbound items into our fulfillment network and subsequently spread them to our regional fulfillment nodes. In the last few months, we've made hundreds of changes to our US inbound network and opened more than 15 inbound buildings. While still relatively early in this re-architecture, we've already improved our ability to spread inventory across our fulfillment centers by 25% year-over-year, allowing us to have more of the requisite items in fulfillment centers closest to the customer, so we can compile shipments and ship to customers even more quickly. As we scale and optimize this new design, we expect these changes will further improve inventory placement, offer faster delivery time, save transportation costs, and enable us to increase units shipped per box. Second, we continue to roll out same-day delivery facilities, which is not only the fastest way to get products to customers but also one of our lowest cost ways to deliver. Over 40 million customers this past quarter have had their orders delivered for free with same-day delivery, an increase of more than 25% year-over-year. And third, we continue to innovate in robotics to speed delivery, lower cost to serve, and further improve safety in our fulfillment network. We recently launched our 12th-generation fulfillment center design with the first building launching in Shreveport, Louisiana. This is the first facility that incorporates our newest robotics inventions that simplify stowing, picking, packing, and shipping processes. Thus far, this new design reduces fulfillment processing time by up to 25%, increases the number of items we can offer for same-day or next-day delivery and is expected to drive a 25% improvement in our cost to serve during peak within this next generation facility. Though we believe we have more expansive automation and robotics than other retail peers, it's still early days in how much automation we expect in our fulfillment network. In advertising, we remain pleased with our progress, generating $14.3 billion of revenue in the quarter, 18.8% year-over-year growth. Our expansive reach, ability to service relevant offers to our customers, opportunity to engage customers from the top of the funnel to point of purchase, and leading capabilities around measuring outcomes at every touch point provide all types of brands with full funnel advertising at scale. With sponsored products, we're seeing meaningful growth on a very large base, and we see further opportunity in driving even better performance for advertisers by further improving the relevancy of the ads we show and by providing additional optimization controls. At the same time, some of our newer offerings are in their very early days. We're just entering our first broadcast season for Prime Video advertising, following a very strong showing at upfronts. And we're continuing to support brands of all sizes with our Generative AI-powered creative tools across display, video and audio, including our video generator that uses a single product image to curate custom AI-generated videos. While we're generating a lot of advertising revenue today, there remains considerable upside. AWS grew 19.1% year-over-year and now stands at a $110 billion annualized run rate. We've seen significant reacceleration of AWS growth for the last four quarters. With the broadest functionality, the strongest security and operational performance and the deepest partner community, AWS continues to be a customer's partner of choice. There are signs of this in every part of AWS's business. We see more enterprises growing their footprint in the cloud, evidenced in part by recent customer deals with the ANZ Banking Group, Booking.com, Capital One, Fast Retailing, Itaú Unibanco, National Australia Bank, Sony, T-Mobile, and Toyota. You can look at our partnership with NVIDIA called Project Ceiba, where NVIDIA has chosen AWS's infrastructure for its R&D supercomputer due in part to AWS's leading operational performance and security. And you can see how AWS continues to innovate in its infrastructure capabilities. With deliveries like Aurora Limitless Database, which extends AWS's very successful relational database to support millions of database writes per second and manage petabytes of data whilst maintaining the simplicity of operating a single database or with our custom Graviton4 CPU instances, which provide up to nearly 40% better price performance versus other leading x86 processors. Companies are focused on new efforts again, spending energy on modernizing their infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud. This modernization enables companies to save money, innovate more quickly, and get more productivity from their scarce engineering resources. However, it also allows them to organize their data in the right architecture and environment to do Generative AI at scale. It's much harder to be successful and competitive in Generative AI if your data is not in the cloud. The AWS team continues to make rapid progress in delivering AI capabilities for customers in building a substantial AI business. In the last 18 months, AWS has released nearly twice as many machine learning and GenAI features as the other leading cloud providers combined. AWS's AI business is a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate business that continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage and is growing more than 3 times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly. We talk about our AI offering as three macro layers of the stack, with each layer being a giant opportunity and each is progressing rapidly. At the bottom layer, which is for model builders, we were the first major cloud provider to offer NVIDIA's H200 GPUs through our EC2 P5e instances. And thanks to our networking innovations like Elastic Fabric adapter and Nitro, we continue to offer advantaged networking performance. And while we have a deep partnership with NVIDIA, we've also heard from customers that they want better price performance on their AI workloads. As customers approach higher scale in their implementations, they realize quickly that AI can get costly. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. The second version of Trainium, Trainium2 is starting to ramp up in the next few weeks and will be very compelling for customers on price performance. We're seeing significant interest in these chips, and we've gone back to our manufacturing partners multiple times to produce much more than we'd originally planned. We also continue to see increasingly more model builders standardize an Amazon SageMaker, our service that makes it much easier to manage your AI data, build models, experiment, and deploy to production. This team continues to add features at a rapid clip punctuated by SageMaker's unique hyperpod capability, which automatically splits training workloads across more than 1,000 AI accelerators, prevents interruptions by periodically saving checkpoints, and automatically repairing faulty instances from their last saved checkpoint and saving training time by up to 40%. At the middle layer where teams want to leverage an existing foundation model customized with their data and then have features to deploy high-quality Generative AI applications, Amazon Bedrock has the broadest selection of leading foundation models and most compelling modules for key capabilities like model valuation, guardrails, rag and agents. Recently, we've added Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, Meta's Llama 3.2 models, Mistral's Large 2 models and multiple stability AI models. We also continue to see teams use multiple model types from different model providers and multiple model sizes in the same application. There's mucking orchestration required to make this happen. And part of what makes Bedrock so appealing to customers and why it has so much traction is that Bedrock makes this much easier. Customers have many other requests, access to even more models, making prompt management easier, further optimizing inference costs, and our Bedrock team is hard at work making this happen. At the application or top layer, we're continuing to see strong adoption of Amazon Q, the most capable Generative AI-powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data. Q has the highest reported code acceptance rates in the industry for multiline code suggestions. The team has added all sorts of capabilities in the last few months, but the very practical use case recently shared where Q Transform saved Amazon's teams $260 million and 4,500 developer years in migrating over 30,000 applications to new versions of the Java JDK as excited developers and prompted them to ask how else we could help them with tedious and painful transformations. Spend a few minutes reading developer forums about what they wish they could move away from, and you'll get an idea of what they want. Expect more practical AI game changers from Q. We're also using Generative AI pervasively across Amazon's other businesses with hundreds of apps in development or launched. For consumers, we've expanded Rufus, our Generative AI-powered expert shopping assistant to the UK, India, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Canada. And in the US, we've added more personalization, the ability to better narrow customer intent and real-time pricing and deal information. We've recently debuted AI Shopping Guides for consumers, which simplifies product research by using Generative AI to pair key factors to consider in a product category with Amazon's wide selection, making it easier for customers to find the right product for their needs. For sellers, we've recently launched Project Amelia, an AI system that offers tailored business insights to boost productivity and drive seller growth. We continue to rearchitect the brain of Alexa with a new set of foundation models that we'll share with customers in the near future, and we're increasingly adding more AI into all of our devices. Take the new Kindle Scribe we just announced. The note-taking experience is much more powerful with the new built-in AI-powered notebook, which enables you to quickly summarize pages of notes into concise bullets in a script font that can easily be shared. Speaking of Kindle products, we just launched a completely new Kindle lineup, the first time we've done a portfolio refresh of this size. Apart from the Scribe, it includes the first-ever color Kindle, the fastest Kindle Paperwhite ever and a new pocket-sized Kindle. The early sales for these devices have significantly outperformed our expectations, and Kindle is having an excellent year with customers reading more than ever. We now have over 20 billion average monthly pages read on Kindle devices worldwide. There are so many things we're energized by right now, but we'll quickly mention one more, the progress we're making in improving customers' pharmacy experience. Brick-and-mortar pharmacies account for just over 90% of prescriptions dispensed in the US that require customers to make trips to forlorn physical venues with much of the selection behind locked shelves, waiting lines for meds and only finding out about pricing at the point of purchase. The largest mail order pharmacies offer delivery in 5 to 10 business days. We think customers deserve better. Today, we can deliver to 95% of first-time Amazon Pharmacy customers in the US within two business days and to 20% of US Prime members within 24 hours. Next year, we plan to launch operations in 20 new cities, so nearly half the US will have the ability to have their medications delivered to their door within hours. We believe making it easier for customers to get their medications will improve medication adherence, which we know can directly improve health outcomes. Across Amazon, we have a lot coming in the next few months. We eagerly look forward to sharing these with customers, and a big thank you to my Amazon teammates around the world for all their hard work. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update."
AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,prepared,,Brian Olsavsky,"Thanks, Andy. Let's start with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $158.9 billion, an 11% increase year-over-year, excluding a 20 basis point unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. As a reminder, our Q3 guidance had anticipated a larger unfavorable impact of approximately 90 basis points. Worldwide operating income increased 56% year-over-year to $17.4 billion, our highest quarterly operating income ever and was $2.4 billion above the high end of our guidance range. We remain focused on streamlining and managing costs in a way that allows us to continue inventing for customers in a cost-effective way. In the third quarter, North America segment revenue was $95.5 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year. International segment revenue was $35.9 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Worldwide paid units accelerated to 12% growth year-over-year as our customers continue to come to Amazon for low prices, broad selection and convenient fast delivery. Prime remains a core contributor to this growth. Year-over-year paid membership growth accelerated in Q3 from both the US and globally, helped by our tenth annual Prime Day event in mid-July. Customers are enjoying even faster delivery speeds, which also helps drive strong growth in items like everyday essentials. This includes items like health, beauty, and personal care as well as nonperishable grocery. Though all these items often have a lower average selling price, the strength in everyday essential's revenue is a positive indicator that customers are turning to us for more of their daily needs. We see that when customers purchase these types of items from us, they build bigger baskets, shop more frequently and spend more on Amazon. We remain focused on keeping prices sharp and offering broad selection that gives customers options when making purchase decisions. Shifting to profitability. Our North America and international segments each delivered their seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement. North America segment operating income was $5.7 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion year-over-year. North America operating margin was 5.9%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. In the third quarter, we continue to make progress in improving our fulfillment network cost structure, driven in part by improved inventory placement. This helped us drive better productivity in our transportation network and shipping efficiency from higher units per box. In the international segment, operating income was $1.3 billion, an improvement of $1.4 billion year-over-year. International operating margin was 3.6%, up 390 basis points year-over-year. So far this year, we've generated operating profit in each of the three quarters for the international segment and totals $2.5 billion year-to-date. We're seeing strength in our established countries like the UK and Germany as we continue to drive efficiencies to improve on-road productivity in our transportation network and better execution in our fulfillment centers. Our emerging countries are growing revenue at a healthy rate also, and they are leveraging their cost structures on investing strategically in Prime benefits. We have confidence that our focus on the inputs, coupled with the strength of our global teams, will continue to drive improvement over time. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. This quarter, we saw strong growth on an increasing large base of advertising revenue. We see many opportunities to further expand our ads offering in areas that are driving growth today like Sponsored Products as well as more recent growth areas like Prime Video ads. Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $27.5 billion, an increase of 19.1% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of $110 billion. The business continues to grow, mostly opportunity to expand our core cloud offering and our AI services. Customers increasingly recognize that to get the true benefit of Generative AI, they also need to move to the cloud. AWS operating income was $10.4 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion year-over-year as a result of our continued focus on cost control, including a measured pace of hiring, a focus on driving efficiencies in our infrastructure, and reducing costs across the business. Additionally, we increased the estimated useful life of our servers starting in 2024, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to the AWS margin increase year-over-year in Q3. As we said in the past, we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. Now turning to our capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as a combination of cash CapEx plus equipment finance leases. Year-to-date capital investments were $51.9 billion. We expect to spend approximately $75 billion in CapEx in 2024. The majority of the spend is to support the growing need for technology infrastructure. This primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI services while also including technology infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. Additionally, we're continuing to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support the growth of the business, improve delivery speeds and lower our cost to serve. This includes investments in same-day delivery facilities, in our inbound network and as well in robotics and automation. We're encouraged by the start of the holiday season, which kicked off in October with a strong Prime Big Deal Days. We are ready to serve customers throughout the season, and I want to thank our teams across Amazon for delivering two very large Prime member events in the past four months and for getting us ready to delight customers during this holiday season. With that, let's move on to your questions."
AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,qa,speaker_line_contains_cue,Operator,[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,qa,,Doug Anmuth,"Thanks so much for taking the questions. Brian, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the drivers of the 38% AWS margins. I know you mentioned the 200 basis points related to the useful lives push-out, but just how to think about sustainability kind of in the 30s there going forward? And then perhaps related the step-up in CapEx that you saw in 3Q, you gave the full-year number, which was helpful. Any kind of early read or thoughts on how we should think about 2025? Thanks so much."
AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Okay. Thanks, Doug. Let me start with AWS. Yeah, the primary drivers of the year-over-year margin increase are threefold. So first is accelerating top-line demand. That helps with all of our efficiencies, our cost-control efforts and of course, what you just mentioned, I believe, the change in the useful life of our servers this year. Let me remind you on that one. We made the change in 2024 to extend the useful life of our servers. This added about 200 basis-points of margin year-over-year. On cost-control, it's been a number of areas. It's -- first is hiring and staffing. We're being very measured in our hiring and you can tell as a company where our office staff is down slightly year-over-year and it's flat to the end of last year. So we're really working hard to maintain our efficiencies not only in the sales force and other areas and production teams, but also in our infrastructure areas. Infrastructure is a big part of our cost structure in AWS and we're probably the best at matching up supply and demand and driving cost efficiencies and driving those operations very, very strongly. And I think you saw that this quarter, especially on the higher-volume. And over-time, this margin will fluctuate in the segment. It's a number of factors to keep in mind, including our level of investment in the amount of innovation and product development we're doing for new products and services, changes in our staffing for sales and support organizations and of course, capital to support customer growth and to build cost performance chips for our customers' applications. So as I mentioned, we do a really good job of matching supply and demand and we do that in this business, it can result in quarters that we just saw."
AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Yeah, I'll take the capex part of that. As Brian said in his opening comments, we expect to spend about $75 billion in 2024. I suspect we'll spend more than that in 2025. And the majority of it is for AWS and specifically, the increased bumps here are really driven by Generative AI. As I was mentioning in my own opening comments, our AI business is a multi-billion dollar business that's growing triple-digit percentages year-over-year and is growing three times faster at its stage of evolution than AWS did itself. We thought AWS grew pretty fast. And so the thing to remember about the AWS business is the cash life cycle is such that the faster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware. And of course, in the hardware of AI, the accelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so we invest in all of that upfront in advance of when we can monetize it with customers using the resources. But of course, a lot of these assets are many year useful life assets. Data centers, for instance, are useful assets for 20 to 30 years. And so I think we've proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free-cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business and we expect the same thing will happen here with Generative AI. It is a really unusually large maybe once in a lifetime type of opportunity. And I think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long-term that we're aggressively pursuing it."
AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,qa,,Operator,And our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,qa,,Ross Sandler,"Andy, if I could push on that last answer, you talked about how AI is about the same size but growing way faster than early AWS. And if we look back at the market in like the early 2010s is hypercompetitive on pricing, your margins were below 15%, I believe, back then. And it seems like a lot of that is what's going on right now in AI with these new AI data centers where you've got competitive pricing and suboptimal utilization just in the whole industry. So as that revenue line grows from where it is today to tens of billions of dollars in coming years, how does that margin come on from the AI data centers versus your existing kind of 30-plus-percent margin at AWS? Any thoughts on how quickly you can close the gap and how that looks on the new AI workloads versus maybe this mid-30s that the core business is running at? Thank you very much."
AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Yeah. So some quick context, Ross. I think one of the least understood parts about AWS, over time, is that it is a massive logistics challenge. If you think about, we have 35 or so regions around the world, which is an area of the world where we have multiple data centers, and then probably about 130 availability zone through data centers, and then we have thousands of SKUs we have to land in all those facilities. And if you land too little of them, you end up with shortages, which end up in outages for customers. So most don't end up with too little, they end up with too much. And if you end up with too much, the economics are woefully inefficient. And I think you can see from our economics that we've done a pretty good job over time at managing those types of logistics and capacity. And it's meant that we've had to develop very sophisticated models in anticipating how much capacity we need, where, in which SKUs and units. And so I think that the AI space is, for sure, earlier stage, more fluid and dynamic than our non-AI part of AWS. But it's also true that people aren't showing up for 30,000 chips in a day. They're planning in advance. So we have very significant demand signals giving us an idea about how much we need. And I think that one of the differences if you were able to get inside of the economics of the different types of providers here is how well they manage that utilization and that capacity. It has a very direct impact on what kind of margins you have over time and what kind of capital efficiency you also have over time. And so I think you're right, Ross, that there are some similarities in the early days here of AI, where the offerings are new and people are very excited about it. It's moving very quickly and the margins are lower than what they -- I think they will be over time. The same was true with AWS. If you looked at our margins around the time you were citing, in 2010, they were pretty different than they are now. I think as the market matures over time, there are going to be very healthy margins here in the Generative AI space."

AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Thanks for taking my questions. Andy, I have two. The first one, I feel like we talk a lot about your targets and sort of north stars for domestic profitability. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you think about the drivers of international retail profitability from here and sort of how you -- just conceptually where the margins could go and what drives them there? And then the second one, I wanted to sort of ask you more about the robotics that you mentioned. I know you've been investing in robotics now for quite a few years. Where are you now in that journey? And how do we think about the next largest areas of investment in robotics in the warehouse network? Thanks."
AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"This is Brian. Let me take the first part of that question on international segment profitability. So if you've looked at the trends, we see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations certainly in operating profit in the international segment. But we're starting to see clear trend lines that are moving positive and above zero. And for each of the last seven quarters, as I mentioned, we've had year-over-year improvement in op margin. And in the last quarter, operating income was up $1.4 billion versus the prior year. So really, it is a lot of the same factors you're seeing in North America, lower cost to serve, greater contribution from advertising, improved selection, faster delivery speeds, which help drive consumer demand. And if you step back further, international is really a mix of our established countries where we've been operating for a long time, the UK, Europe, and Germany -- excuse me, Europe and Japan, and a number of emerging countries, including 10 new countries that we launched in the last seven years. So there's a lot under the hood there and there's different stories in each country. Each of them is on a different point in the path from launching to customer adoption, just scaling towards profitability to then making consistent operating profit. So I think our expectations in each of those countries mirror those in North America. And we intend, over the fullness of time, that we're going to aim for North America margins, which are not static themselves. So we're happy with the performance. Glad to see a number above zero in many of the last few quarters, but really it’s a story on a country-by-country basis that we're working hard. On the robotics piece, what I would say is even though we believe we have more expansive and advanced automation, robotics capabilities in our fulfillment network than other peers, it's so early with respect to what we're going to do automation, robotics-wise in our fulfillment network. We're just at the stage right now where we're starting to roll out. We had about a five or six very significant new robotics capabilities in the areas of stowing, picking, packing, and shipping that we are finally put into one facility to get the entire workflow. It's a facility in Shreveport, Louisiana that was just launched a few weeks ago. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing very encouraging results there. And of course, the reason why we're trying to have more robotics and automation in our fulfillment network is it allows us to fast -- to ship more quickly, to ship more cost effectively, and to make conditions even safer for our fulfillment teammates than what they already have today. And I think something that the team has done in a very disciplined way, and I talked about this a little bit in my annual letter, my shareholder letter is just they have been very thoughtful about defining what are the primitive foundational building blocks that you need, that you can then use in lots of different combinations to build additional automation/robotics capabilities down the road, so we can move even more quickly with the next generation of robotics capabilities. And that team has invested in those and they're already working on the next generation. And the last piece I would add to that is we really do believe that AI is going to be a big piece of what we do in our robotics network. We had a number of efforts going on there. We just hired a number of people from an incredibly strong robotics AI organization. And I think that will be a very central part of what we do moving forward, too."

Looking at the results in the commerce business, there's a clear sort of pattern emerging with respect to ASPs versus unit growth. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior and the propensity to be receptive to either lower ASP items or discounts among consumer behavior? And then the second part would be, can you talk a little bit about some of the strategic initiatives you're building for the long term around capitalizing on lower ASP items and the potential shift to more consumables and the base of consumption habits on the platform? Thanks so much."
AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Yeah, hi, Eric, thank you for your question. Yeah, you're right. Q3 unit volume was strong, 12% worldwide. It's pretty similar in North America versus international. And the consumer factors, we've seen a continuation of many of the things we've discussed over the first -- or last few quarters. Customers looking for deals and are price conscious. This matches up well with our Prime events where we were -- which were well received and saved billions for our -- billions of dollars for our Prime members. It also led to Prime member -- paid Prime member growth accelerating in the quarter, which is hugely impactful for us. A lot of our best offers and deliveries are tuned to Prime membership, and it's the best deal in retail. So with all the benefits you get for the subscription price, so those are all positive signs. When you look at the split between revenue growth and unit growth, you do see some impact of the lower ASP products that we're selling as well as some of the trade down that consumers are doing. But we take that as a real positive, seeing the growth in everyday essential categories, which are really predicated on speed. So it's -- you have to have fast delivery to be able to sell the those products to customers. And when you do, it results in a stickier consumer relationship, higher orders, building larger baskets, which help our ship economics, and repeat orders are stronger. So those are all positive signs, and we'll take any short-term degradation in ASP because what we're focused on primarily is free cash flow here. And we see the ability to unlock all new elements of the consumer spend."
AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"I'll just add, Eric, on the lower ASP strategy. There's an expression that we've used a lot of times over the years that it's easy to lower prices but it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices. And the same thing is probably true about lower ASP items. It's pretty easy to choose to supply them but it's much harder to be able to afford to economically supply them. And so one of the reasons that we have been so maniacal about cost to serve over the last few years is that as we're able to take our cost to serve down, it just opens up the aperture for more items, particularly lower ASP items that we're able to supply in an economic way. And when you layer on top of that the broader selection, you layer on top of that faster speed and what we're able to do in getting items and fulfillment nodes local and close to our end customers, what we're able to do in expanding our same-day network, which allows us to ship same-day but also is one of our lowest-cost ways is it just lets us serve so many more of customers' shopping missions. And that's what we're seeing in our business right now. But again, I think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to expand that."

The third-party unit mix declined a little bit in Q3, which is unusual. So just wondering if there are any specific drivers of that shift. And then secondly, you made a lot of progress with the AI agents on AWS and for sellers and Rufus for buyers. I wonder with all the underlying data that you have and leveraging those agent capabilities if you could provide any perspective on what a next-generation Alexa might look like and your opportunities there to perhaps drive incremental revenues. Thank you."
AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Sure, Colin. Thanks for your question. On the first one, third-party sellers, yes, the percent of paid units was 60% in Q3. And if you look over the last two years, it's -- essentially, it was at 59%, stepping up to 60%, stepping up to 61% pretty much every second quarter. So what we're seeing is still in a tight band between 59% and 61%. But what we're seeing is the impact of the everyday essentials. There's -- 3P demand is still strong and unit volumes are strong. It's just the everyday essentials tend to skew more to 1P than 3P. And on your second question, Colin, around Alexa, I think we have a really broad number of Alexa devices all over people's homes and offices and automobiles and hospitality suites. We've about 0.5 billion devices out there with a couple of hundred million active endpoints. And when we first were pursuing Alexa, we had this vision of it being the world's best personal assistant and people thought that was kind of a crazy idea. And I think if you look at what's happened in Generative AI over the last couple of years, I think you're kind of missing the boat if you don't believe that's going to happen. It absolutely is going to happen. So we have a really broad footprint where we believe if we rearchitect the brains of Alexa with next-generation foundational models, which we're in the process of doing, we have an opportunity to be the leader in that space. And I think if you look at a lot of the applications today that use Generative AI, there's a large number of them that are having success in cost avoidance and productivity. And then you're increasingly seeing more applications have success in really impacting the customer experience and being really good at taking large corpuses of data and being able to summarize and aggregate and answer questions, but not that many yet that are really good on top of that in taking actions for customers. And I think that the next generation of these assistants and the Generative AI applications will be better at not just answering questions and summarizing the indexing and aggregating data, but also taking actions. And you can imagine us being pretty good at that with Alexa."

AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,qa,,Justin Post,"Great. Thank you. Maybe a couple of questions. Just on the cloud, are you at all capacity constrained, and will the new Trainium or NVIDIA chips maybe even drive sales growth faster? And then secondly and I know there's been some competition from some of the more traditional retailers growing quickly online. Maybe talk about maybe the advantages that Amazon has with a fulfillment center distribution versus store distribution? Any thoughts on that? Thank you."
AMZN,2024-10-31,2024-11-01,,2024-10-31,2024-10-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2024-10-31,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Well, on cloud, Justin, what I would tell you is that we -- I believe we have more demand that we could fulfill if we had even more capacity today. I think pretty much everyone today has less capacity than they have demand for, and it's really primarily chips that are the area where companies could use more supply. And so we have -- we're growing at a very rapid rate and have grown a pretty big business here in the AI space and it's early days, but I actually believe that the rate of growth there has a chance to improve over time as we have bigger and bigger capacity. And I think that one of the reasons I mentioned in my opening comments that we have a very deep partnership with NVIDIA. We tend to be their lead partner on most of their new chips. We were the first to offer H200s in EC2 instances. And I expect us to have a partnership for a very long time that matters. It's also true that for customers that start to scale out their implementations on the inference side, particularly, they realize pretty quickly that it can get costly. And it's really why we have pursued building Trainium and Inferentia, which is our custom silicon. And the second version of Trainium, Trainium2 will start to ramp up in the next few weeks. And I think it's going to be very compelling for customers on a price performance basis. And we have a lot of customer interest. We have gone back to our manufacturing partners a couple of times now to produce a lot more Trainium than we anticipated. Some of that, for sure, is due to the fact that we just -- we have very large demand, and we want more capacity and supply to be able to provide them. But a lot of it is that customers are excited about the price performance that they believe they're going to get in Trainium. So I think it's a very significant opportunity for us in the AWS space, and it's going to be a very significant opportunity for customers. I think on the retail side, I'd start by just saying that we've always believed that competition is very positive and very healthy. It's good for consumers, good for businesses. It's actually great for innovation. And if you look at the retail space, it's a very, very large market segment. I mean, we have a pretty big retail business, and yet we're only about 1% of the market segment share of the worldwide global retail market segment. And still about 80% to 85% of that market segment share lives in physical stores. And so if you believe that equation is going to flip in the next 10 to 20 years, which we do, there's just a lot of opportunity not just for us but for several players. There won't be only one successful player. I do think that we have some elements of our customer experience that are really unusual and unlike others. I think we have meaningfully broader selection than almost all the players that you probably have seen and heard of. We have low prices with very significant deals that we go work with our third-party selling partners around key holiday shopping occasions. And then we have very significant advantages and speed of delivery to customers. And we just continue to see in every bit of testing and analysis that we do, that the faster that we're able to promise customers that we can get them their items, the more frequently they buy and the more they actually use Amazon for their shopping needs. And so those are things that are pretty different. I also think we have a way of prioritizing customers that I think is unusual. Our orientation, our DNA and our core at Amazon starts with the customer, and everything moves backwards from that. Any meeting you go to inside of Amazon, we're always asking ourselves what do customers want? What do customers say? What do they not like about the experience? What could be better? And that customer orientation is very important, not just in how you take care of customers, but the world changes quickly all the time. And the technology is changing really quickly. And so if you have the combination of strong technical aptitude, propensity and a passion for inventing and then also a customer orientation where it drives everything you do, I think you have an opportunity to continue to build great trust in a business over a long period of time."

As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2023. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 6, 2025 only and will include forward-looking statements, actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-Ks and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non GAAP measures. Including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes among other things that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. I will now turn the call over to Andy Jassy."

Given the way the dollar strengthened throughout the quarter, we had $700 million more foreign exchange headwind than we anticipated at guidance. Without that headwind, revenue would have been 11% year over year and exceeded the top end of our guidance. Operating income was $21.2 billion, up 61% year over year, and trailing twelve-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $36.2 billion, up $700 million year over year. We're pleased with the invention, customer experience improvements, and results delivered in 2024, and have a lot more planned in 2025. I'll start by talking about our stores business. We saw 10% year over year revenue growth in our North America segment, and 9% year over year in our international segment, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Our continued focus on expanding selection, lowering prices, and improving convenience drove strong unit growth that even outpaced our revenue growth. We continue to add to our broad range giving customers choice across a variety of price points. We welcomed notable brands to our store throughout 2024, including Clinique, Estee Lauder, Aura Rings, and Armani Beauty. We continue to add to the hundreds of millions of products offered from our selling partners, who made up 61% of items that we sold in 2024, our highest annual mix of third-party seller units ever. We also launched Amazon Haul for US customers in Q4, which offers customers an engaging shopping experience that brings ultra-low priced products into one convenient destination. It's off to a very strong start. In the fourth quarter, consumers saved more than $15 billion with our low everyday prices and record-setting events during Prime Big Deal Days in October, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday around Thanksgiving. Additionally, Profitero's annual pricing study found that entering the holiday season, Amazon had the lowest online prices for the eighth year in a row, averaging 14% lower prices on average than other leading retailers in the US. Our speed of delivery continues to accelerate, and 2024 was another record-setting year for Prime members. We expanded the number of same-day delivery sites by more than 60% in 2024, which now serve more than 140 metro areas. Overall, we delivered over 9 billion units the same or next day around the world. Our relentless pursuit of better selection, price, and delivery speed is driving accelerated growth in Prime membership. For just $14.99 a month, Prime members get unlimited free shipping on 300 million items, off the same day or one day delivery, exclusive shopping events like Prime Day, access to a vast collection of premium programming and live sports on Prime Video, ad-free listening of 100 million songs and podcasts with Amazon Music, access to unlimited generic prescriptions for only $5 a month, unlimited grocery delivery on orders over $35 from Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh for $9.99 a month, a free Grubhub Plus membership with free unlimited delivery, and our latest benefit of a 10 cent per gallon fuel discount at BP, AMPM, and AMCO stations. When you think about this as a whole, and also compared to many other membership services that are comparably or more expensively priced and offer just one benefit like video, Prime is a screaming deal. And we have more coming for our Prime members in 2025. We also remain squarely focused on cost to serve in our fulfillment network, which has been a meaningful driver of our increased operating income. We talked about the regionalization of our US network. We've also recently rolled out our redesigned US inbound network. While still in its early stages, our inbound efforts have improved our placement of inventory so that even more items are close to end customers. Ahead of Black Friday in November, we'd improved the percentage of ordered units available in the ideal building by over 40% year over year. We've also spent considerable time optimizing the number of items sent to customers in the same package, which reduces packaging, is more convenient for customers, and less expensive for us to fulfill. And our per-unit transportation costs continue to decline as we build out and optimize our last-mile network. Overall, we've reduced our global cost to serve on a per-unit basis for the second year in a row. While at the same time increasing speed, improving safety, and adding selection. As we look to 2025 and beyond, we see opportunities to reduce costs again as we further refine inventory placement, grow our same-day delivery network, and accelerate robotics and automation throughout the network. In advertising, we remain pleased with the strong growth on a very large base, generating $17.3 billion of revenue in the quarter, and growing 18% year over year. That's a $69 billion annual revenue run rate, more than double what it was just four years ago at $29 billion. Sponsored products, the largest portion of ad revenue, are doing well, and we see a runway for even more growth. We also have a number of newer streaming offerings that are starting to become significant new revenue sources. On the streaming video side, we wrapped up our first year of Prime Video ads, and we're quite pleased with the early progress and head into this year with momentum. We made it easier to do full funnel advertising with us. Full funnel is from the top of the funnel with broad reach advertising that drives brand awareness to mid funnel where sponsored brands let companies specify certain keywords and audiences to attract people to their detail pages or brands to our Amazon to bottom of the funnel where sponsored products help advertisers surface relevant product ads to customers at the point of purchase. We also have differentiated audience features that leverage billions of signals from Amazon Marketing Cloud secure data clean rooms, providing advertisers the ability to analyze data, produce core marketing metrics, and understand how their marketing performs across various channels. With our new multi-touch attribution model, advertisers can understand how various ad types in their campaigns contribute to sales. Moving on to AWS, in Q4, AWS grew 19% year over year and now has a $115 billion annualized revenue run rate. AWS is a reasonably large business by most folks' standards. And though we expect growth will be lumpy over the next few years as enterprises adopt and technology advancements impact timing, it's hard to overstate how optimistic we are about what lies ahead for AWS' customers and business. I spent a fair bit of time thinking several years out. And while it may be hard for some to fathom a world where virtually every app is generative AI-infused, with inference being a core building block just like compute, storage, and database, and most companies having their own agents that accomplish various tasks interact with one another, this is the world we're thinking about all the time. And we continue to believe that this world will mostly be built on top of the cloud with the largest portion of it on AWS. To best help customers realize this future, you need powerful capabilities of all three layers of the stack. At the bottom layer, for those building models, you need compelling chips. Chips are the key ingredient in the compute that drives training and inference. Most AI compute has been driven by NVIDIA chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with NVIDIA and will for as long as we can see into the future. However, there aren't that many generative AI applications of large scale yet, and when you get there, as we have with apps like Alexa and Rufus, cost can get steep quickly. Customers want better price performance, and it's why we built our own custom AI silicon. Tranium 2 just launched at our AWS reInvent conference in December, E2 instances with these chips are typically 30 to 40 percent more price per form than other current GPU-powered instances available. That's very compelling at scale. Several technically capable companies like Adobe, Databricks, Poolside, and Qualcomm have seen impressive results in early testing of Tranium 2. It's also why you're seeing Anthropic build its future frontier models on Tranium 2. We're collaborating with Anthropic to build project right near. A cluster of training and two ultra-servers containing hundreds of thousands of training m two chips. This cluster is going to be five times the number of Exo-ZLofts as the cluster that Anthropic used to train their current leading set of cloud models. We're already hard at work on Training 3, which we expect to preview late in 25, and defining Training 4 thereafter. Building outstanding performing chips that deliver leading price performance has become a core strength of AWS's, starting with our Nitro and Graviton chips in our core business, and now extending to Tranium and AI. It's something unique to AWS relative to other competing cloud providers. The other key component for model builders is services that make it easier to construct their models. I won't spend a lot of time on these comments on Amazon SageMaker AI, which has become the go-to service for AI model builders to manage their AI data, build models, experiment, and deploy these models. HyperPOD capability automatically splits training workloads across many AI accelerators, prevents interruptions by periodically saving checkpoints, and automatically repairing faulty instances from their last saved checkpoint and saving training time by up to 40 percent. It continues to be a differentiator with several new compelling capabilities at reinvent including the ability to manage costs at a cluster level, and prioritize which workloads should receive capacity when budgets are reached. It is increasingly being adopted by model builders. At the middle layer, for those wanting to leverage frontier models to build Jet AI apps, Amazon Bedrock is our fully managed service providing high performing foundation models with the most compelling features making it easy to build a high-quality generative AI application. We are iterating quickly on Bedrock announcing Luma AI, poolside, and over a hundred other popular emerging models to Bedrock and reinvent. We've just added DeepSeq's R1 models to Bedrock and SageMaker. Additionally, we delivered several compelling new Bedrock features to re-event, including prompt caching, intelligent prompt routing, and model distillation, all of which help customers achieve lower cost and latency in their inference. Like SageMaker AI, Bedrock is growing quickly and resonating strongly with customers. Related, we also launched Amazon's own family of frontier models in Bedrock called Nova. These models compare favorably in intelligence against the leading models in the world to offer lower latency, lower price, about 75 percent lower than other models in Bedrock, and are integrated with key Bedrock features like fine-tuning, model distillation, knowledge base as a rag, and Agentec capabilities. Thousands of AWS customers are already taking advantage of Amazon Nova models' capabilities and price performance, including Palantir, SAP Densu Fortinet Trellix, and Robinhood, and we've just gotten started. At the top layer of the stack, Amazon Q is our most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data. You may remember that on the last call, I shared the very practical use case where Q transformation helps save Amazon Teams $260 million and 4500 developer years in migrating over 30,000 applications to new versions of the Java JDK. This is real value, and companies ask for more, which we obliged with our recent deliveries of Q transformation that enable moves from Windows dot net applications to Linux VMware to EC2, accelerates mainframe migrations. Early customer testing indicates the queue can turn was going to be a multi-year effort to do a mainframe migration into a multi-quarter effort, cutting by more than 50% the time to migrate mainframes. This is a big deal, and these transformations are good examples of practical AI. While AI continues to be a compelling new driver in the business, we haven't lost our focus on core modernization of companies' technology. We signed new AWS agreements with companies including Intuit, PayPal, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Northrop Grumman, The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America, Reddit, Japan Airlines, Baker Hughes, the Hertz Corporation, Resin Chime Financial, Asana, and many others. Consistent customer feedback from our recent AWS reInvent was appreciation that we're still inventing rapidly in non-AI key infrastructure areas like storage, compute, database analytics. Our functionality leadership continues to expand and there were several key launches customers were buzz about, including Amazon Aurora D SQL, our new serverless distributed SQL database that enables applications with the highest availability strong consistency, post-test compatibility, It's four times faster reason rights compared to other pop distributed SQL databases, Amazon S3 tables, which makes S3 the first cloud object store with fully managed support for Apache Iceberg for faster analytics, Amazon S3 metadata, Which automatically generates queryable metadata simplifying data discovery, business analytics, and real time inference to help customers unlock the value of their data in S3, and the next generation of Amazon SageMaker which brings together all the data analytics services and AI services in interface to do analytics and AI more easily at scale. As 2024 comes to an end, I want to thank our teammates and partners for their meaningful impact throughout the year. It was a very successful year across almost any dimension you pick. We're far from done, and look forward to delivering for customers in 2025. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update."
AMZN,2025-02-06,2025-02-07,,2025-02-06,2025-02-06T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-02-06,prepared,,Brian Olsavsky,"Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $187.8 billion, an 11% increase year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This equates to an approximate $900 million headwind from FX in the Quarter, which is about $700 million higher than what we'd anticipated in our Q4 guidance range. Excluding that additional FX headwind, we would have exceeded the top end of our revenue guidance range. Worldwide operating income was $21.2 billion, our largest operating income quarter ever, and was $1.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range. Across all segments, we continue to innovate for customers while operating more efficiently at the same time. In the North America segment, fourth quarter revenue was $115.6 billion, an increase of 10% year over year. International segment revenue was $43.4 billion, an increase of 9% year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units grew 11% year over year, as our focus on low prices broad selection, and fast shipping continues to resonate with customers. Shifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $9.3 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion year over year. Operating margin was 8%, up 190 basis points year over year. In the international segment, operating income was $1.3 billion, an improvement of $1.7 billion year over year, operating margin was 3%, up 400 basis points year over year. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we've seen year over year margin improvement in both the North Two thousand twenty-four also marks the second year in a row where we've lowered our global cost to serve on a per unit basis.  In the fourth quarter, we saw strong productivity in our transportation network, from improved inventory placement, higher units per package, and reduced travel distances. We also saw improved productivity in our fulfillment centers. Overall, our teams executed extremely well throughout the quarter, and particularly during our peak seasons. I want to thank them for all they do to deliver for our customers. Looking ahead, we have several opportunities to keep lowering our costs through even better inventory placement, which also allows us to deliver items to customers faster. In the US, we're tuning our inbound network and continuing to expand our same day delivery network. Globally, we're adding automation and robotics throughout our network. While these efforts will take time to implement, and progress may not be linear, We have a good plan to continue to drive improvements in our cost structure. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and international segments. This quarter, we saw strong advertising revenue growth on an increasingly large base. We will also continue to invest in experiences that have potential to be important to customers in Amazon long term. In areas like Alexa, health care, and grocery, as well as satellites in the coming months. As a reminder, we currently expense the majority of the cost associated with the development of our satellite network. We will capitalize certain costs once the service achieves commercial viability, including sales to customers. Moving next to our AWS segment, revenue was $28.8 billion, an increase of 19% year over year. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of $115 billion. During the fourth quarter, we continue to see growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI offerings. As companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premise to the cloud, and tap into the power of generative AI. Customers recognize to get the full benefit of generative AI, they have to move to the cloud. AWS reported operating income of $10.6 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion year over year. This is the result of strong growth, innovation in our software and infrastructure to drive efficiencies, and continued focus on cost control across the business. As we've said in the past, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making. Additionally, we increased the estimated useful life of our servers starting in 2024, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to the AWS margin increase year over year in Q4. Now turning to our capital investments. As a reminder, we define these as a combination of cash CapEx plus equipment finance leases. Capital investments were $26.3 billion in the fourth quarter, and we think that run rate will be reasonably representative of our 2025 capital investment rate. Similar to 2024, the majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for technology infrastructure. This primarily relates to AWS, including support demand for our AI services, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. Additionally, we're continuing to invest in capacity for our fulfillment and transportation network to support future growth. We're also investing in same-day delivery facilities and our inbound network, as well as robotics and automation, to improve delivery speeds and to lower our cost to serve. These capital investments will support growth for many years to come. Turning to our revenue guidance for Q1, net sales are expected to be between $151 billion and $155.5 billion. I'd like to highlight two items impacting our Q1 revenue guidance. First, we estimate the year-over-year impact of changes in foreign exchange rates based on current rates, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately $2.1 billion in Q1 year over year, or 150 basis points. As a reminder, global currencies can fluctuate during the quarter, and just as we saw in Q4 with the strengthening of the dollar versus most other currencies. Second, a reminder that we are comping the impact of last year's leap year. The extra day contributed approximately $1.5 billion of additional net sales across our businesses in Q1 2024, or about 120 basis points to the year-over-year growth rate, which impacted all segments. Q1 operating income is expected to be between $14 billion and $18 billion. This guidance includes the estimated impact of certain updates to the useful life of our fixed assets. I'll provide a bit more detail in a moment, but on an aggregate basis, we estimate this will decrease full-year 2025 operating income by approximately $400 million for the assets on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. First, in Q4, we completed a useful life study for our servers and network equipment and observed an increased pace of technology development. Particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As a result, we're decreasing the useful life for a subset of our servers and networking equipment from six years to five years beginning in January 2025. We anticipate this will decrease full-year 2025 operating income by approximately $700 million. In addition, we also early-retired a subset of our servers and network equipment. We recorded a Q4 2024 expense of approximately $920 million from accelerated depreciation and related charges and expect this will also decrease full-year 2025 operating income by. Both of these server and network equipment use for life changes primarily impact our AWS segment. Lastly, we also completed a useful life study for certain types of heavy equipment used in our fulfillment centers. And are increasing the useful life from ten years to thirteen years beginning in January 2025, we anticipate this will increase full-year 2025 operating income by approximately $900 million. As we turn the page to 2025, we're energized by the great work our teams have delivered. We'll remain focused on driving even better customer experiences, and we believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions."

If you would like to ask a question, we ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handsets to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a question, please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question."
AMZN,2025-02-06,2025-02-07,,2025-02-06,2025-02-06T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-02-06,qa,,Mark Mahaney,"Thanks. Two quick questions. So, Brian, that's $100 billion CapEx we should think about in 2025. And then, Andy, were there any—so would you describe that AWS growth as being currently moderated down by supply constraints. Do you see those across the industry, or do you see those materially impacting AWS today? Thank you very much."
AMZN,2025-02-06,2025-02-07,,2025-02-06,2025-02-06T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-02-06,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"So I'll take both of those, Andy. On the CapEx side, as Brian mentioned earlier, we spent $26.3 billion in CapEx in Q4. And I think that is reasonably representative of what you can expect in the annualized CapEx rate in 2025. The vast majority of that CapEx spend is on AI for AWS. It's, you know, the way the AWS business works, the way the cash cycle works is that the faster we grow, the more CapEx we end up spending because we have to procure data center and hardware and chips and networking gear ahead of when we're able to monetize it. We don't procure it unless we see significant signals of demand. And so when AWS is expanding its CapEx, particularly in what we think is one of these once-in-a-lifetime type of business opportunities like AI represents, I think it's actually quite a good sign medium to long-term for the AWS business. And I actually think that spending this capital to pursue this opportunity, which, you know, from our perspective, we think virtually every application that we know of today is gonna be reinvented with AI in inside of it. And with inference being a core building block just like compute and storage and database, if you believe that plus that altogether new experiences that we've only dreamed about are gonna actually be available to us with AI, AI represents for sure the biggest opportunity since cloud probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the internet. And so I think that both our business, our customers, and shareholders will be happy medium to long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI. We also have CapEx that we're spending this year in our stores business, really with an aim towards trying to continue to improve the delivery speed and our cost to serve. And so you'll see us expanding the number of same-day facilities from where we are right now. You'll also see us expand the number of delivery stations that we have in rural areas so we can get items to people who live in rural areas much more quickly. And then a pretty significant investment as well on robotics and automation so we can take our cost to serve down and continue to improve our productivity. So that's the CapEx piece. I think the second question you asked, Mark, is really around AWS growth and whether this is being moderated down at all by supply chain constraints. What you know, it's it is hard to complain when you have a multibillion-dollar annualized revenue run rate business in AI, like we do. And it's growing triple-digit percentage year over year. It's hard to complain. However, it is true that we could be growing faster if not for some of the constraints on capacity. And they come in the form of, you know, I would say, chips from our third-party partners coming a little bit slower than before with a lot of midstream changes. It takes a little bit of time to get the hardware actually yielding the percentage healthy and high-quality servers we expect. It comes with our own big new launch of our own hardware and our own chips in Tranium two, which we just went to general availability at reInvent, but the majority of the volume is coming in really over the next couple of quarters, the next few months. It comes in the form of power constraints where I think, you know, the world is still constrained on power from where I think we all believe we could serve customers if we were unconstrained. There are some components in the supply chain like motherboards that are a little bit short in supply for various types of servers. So, you know, I think the team has done a really good job scrapping and providing capacity for our customers so they can grow. We're still growing a pretty reasonable clip as I mentioned earlier. But I do think we could be growing faster if we were unconstrained. I predict those constraints really start to relax in the second half of '25, and, you know, as I said, I think we could be growing faster even though we're growing at a pretty good clip."

Andy, when you think about the news that came out of China over the last couple of weeks and think longer term about bending the cost curve lower with AI. I understood the commentary around CapEx for 2025. Would you look at where you sit in the industry the move towards open-source elements of custom silicon, How do you think about bending the cost curve and either speeding up or amplifying time deployment to market or possibly, you know, higher returns on capital for AI? Thanks so much."
AMZN,2025-02-06,2025-02-07,,2025-02-06,2025-02-06T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-02-06,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Well, I'll tell you a few things because there are a few questions built into that. You know, first of all, I think like many others, we were impressed with what DeepSeq has done. You know, I think in part impressed with some of the training techniques, you know, primarily in flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training, reinforcement learning being earlier without the human in the loop. We thought that was interesting ahead of the supervised fine-tuning. We also thought some of the inference optimizations they did were also quite interesting. For those of us who are building frontier models, we're all working on the same types of things, and we're all learning from one another. I think you have seen and will continue to see a lot of leapfrogging between us. There is a lot of innovation to come. And, you know, I think if you run a business like AWS, and you have a core belief like we do that virtually all the big generative AI apps are gonna use multiple model types and different customers are gonna use different models for different types of workloads. You're gonna provide as many leading frontier models as possible for customers to choose from. That's what we've done with services like Amazon Bedrock, and it's why we moved so quickly to make sure that DeepSeq was available both in Bedrock and in SageMaker. You know, faster than you saw from others. And we already have customers starting to experiment with that. I think what's, you know, one of the interesting things over the last couple of weeks is sometimes people make the assumptions that if you're able to decrease the cost of any type of technology component, in this case, we're really talking about inference, it's somehow it's gonna lead to less total spend in technology, and we just, we have never seen that to be the case. You know, we did the same thing in the cloud where we launched AWS in 2006, where we offered S3 object storage for fifteen cents a gigabyte and compute for ten cents an hour, which, of course, is much lower now, many years later. People thought that people would spend a lot less money in the on infrastructure technology. What happens is companies will spend a lot less per unit of infrastructure, and that is very, very useful for their businesses, but then they get excited about what else they could build that they always thought was cost prohibitive before. And they usually end up spending a lot more in total on technology once you make the per-unit cost less. And I think that is very much what's gonna happen here in AI, which is the cost of inference will substantially come down. You know, what you heard the last couple of weeks out of DeepSeq is a piece of it, but everybody is working on this. I believe the cost of inference will meaningfully come down. I think it will make it much easier for companies to be able to infuse all their applications with inference and with generative AI. And I think it's gonna if you run a business like we do, where we wanna make it as easy as possible for customers be successful building customer experiences on top of our various infrastructure services, the cost of inference coming down is gonna be very positive for customers and for our business."

Just, Brian, maybe you can talk a little bit more about margins there just given that they've kind of moved between the mid-20s to the high thirties over the past two years. How should we think about that more normalized especially as you're investing that much more in generative AI? And then just on the store side, can you talk about the impact of less volume going through your shipping partner UPS going forward? And are you able to manage that incremental shipping that's required? Thanks."
AMZN,2025-02-06,2025-02-07,,2025-02-06,2025-02-06T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-02-06,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Yes. Sure, Doug. Thanks for your question. First on AWS, yeah, we have seen a lot of fluctuation in operating margin AWS, and we've said historically that they will be lumpy as you say over time. And, you know, the stage we're in right now, AI is still early stage. It does come originally with lower margins and a heavy investment load, as we've talked about. And in the short term, over time, that should be a headwind on margins. But over the long term, we feel the margins will be comparable to non AI business as well. So, you know, we're very pleased with the strong growth focus on driving efficiencies in all of our data centers, saving power, reusing power in new generative AI applications, and just generally reducing costs. So very pleased with the performance of the AWS team, and I look forward to a strong 2025. I'll take the UPS one, which is, really UPS has been a partner of ours for many years, and we expect that that we'll continue to be partners with UPS for many years. As you know, increasingly over the last several years, particularly accelerated by the pandemic, we have shipped a much larger percentage of our shipments through our logistics network, our own last-mile transportation network, and I think that's in part because we needed to scale up so fast in the pandemic with everything being shut down and needing to serve more of the total market segment share of retail units during that time. And needing to do it at a low-cost structure because, of course, our customers expect low prices, and that's the nature of the business. I think UPS has decided that serving Amazon is lower margin for them. So I think they've walked away from some of the volume that they otherwise could have had in the partnership. We're able to handle it with our own logistics capability, and we'll see how it continues to evolve."

AMZN,2025-02-06,2025-02-07,,2025-02-06,2025-02-06T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-02-06,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Thanks for taking my questions. Andy, maybe to drill a little bit into the robotics acceleration that you talked about. Any new data points, I think you can share on learnings from Shreveport? And how do we think about the scalability of savings or the timing that we could see a real impact on profitability from robotics? And then maybe just a bigger picture Gen AI, GPU-enabled changes, any other examples of how you see the Amazon retail shopping experience changing throughout 2025 as you're better using Gen AI or GPU-enabled?"
AMZN,2025-02-06,2025-02-07,,2025-02-06,2025-02-06T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-02-06,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Yeah. Okay. Well, on the robotics piece, what I would tell you is, you know, since we've been pretty substantially integrating robotics into our fulfillment network over the last many years, we have seen cost savings, and we've seen productivity improvements and we've seen safety improvements. And so we have already gotten a significant amount of value out of our robotics innovations. What we've seen recently, and I think maybe part of what you're referencing in Shreveport, is that the next tranche of robotics initiatives have started hitting production. And we've put them all together for the first time as part of an experience in our Shreveport facility, and we are very, very encouraged by what we're seeing there both by the speed improvements that we're seeing, the productivity improvements, the cost to serve improvements. You know, it's still relatively early days, and these all being put together are only in Shreveport at this point. But we have plans now to start to expand that and roll that out to a number of other facilities in the network, some of which will be our new facilities and others of which will retrofit existing facilities to be able to use those same robotics innovations. I'll also tell you that this group of, call it, half dozen or so new initiatives is not close to the end of what we think is possible with respect to being able to use robotics to improve productivity cost to serve a safety in our fulfillment network. And we have a kind of next wave that we're starting to work on now. But I think this will be a many-year effort as we continue to tune different parts of our fulfillment network where we can use robotics. And we actually don't think there are that many things that we can't improve the experience with robotics. On your other question, which is about how we might use AI in other areas of the business than AWS, maybe more in, I think you asked about our retail business. The way I would think about it is that there's kind of two macro buckets of how we see people, both ourselves inside Amazon, as well as other companies using AWS, how we see them getting value out of AI today. The first macro bucket, I would say, is really around productivity and cost savings. And, in many ways, this is the lowest hanging fruit in AI. And you see that all over the place in our retail business. For instance, if you look at customer service, and you look at the chatbot that we've built, we completely rearchitected it with generative AI. It's delivering; it already had pretty high satisfaction. It's delivering 500 basis points better satisfaction from customers with the new generative AI-infused chatbot. If you look at our millions of third-party selling partners, one of their biggest pain points is because we put a high premium on really organizing our marketplace so that it's easy to find things, there's a bunch of different fields you have to fill out when you're creating a new product detail page. But we've built a generative AI application for them. Where they can either fill in just a couple of lines of text or take a picture of an image or point to a URL, and the generative AI app will fill in most of the rest of the information they have to fill out, which speeds are getting selection on the website, easier for sellers. If you look at how we do inventory management, try and understand what inventory we need in what facility at what time, the generative AI applications we've built there have led to 10% better forecasting on our part, 20% better regional predictions. Our robotics, we were just talking about the brains in a lot of those robotics, are generative AI-infused that do things like tell the robotic claw, you know, what's in a bin, what it should pick up, how it should move it, where it should place it in the in the other bin that it's filling. So it's really in the brains of most of our robotics. So we have a number of very significant, I'll call it, productivity and cost savings efforts in our retail business. They're using generative AI, and again, it's just a fraction of what we have going. I'd say the other big macro bucket are really altogether new experiences. And, again, you see lots of those in our retail business ranging from Rufus, which is our AI-infused shopping assistant, which continues to grow very significantly. To things like Amazon Lens, where you can take a picture of a product that's in front of you, check it out in the app. You can find it in the little box at the top. You take a picture of an item in front of you, and it uses computer vision generative AI to pull up the exact item in a search result. To things like sizing where we basically have taken the catalogs of all these different clothing manufacturers and compared them against one another so we know which brands tend to run big or small relative to each other. So when you come to buy a pair of shoes, for instance, they can recommend what size you need, even what we're doing in Thursday Night Football where we're using generative AI for really inventive features like the sense of alerts where we predict which player is gonna put the quarterback or vulnerabilities where we're able to show viewers what area the field is vulnerable. So we're using it really all over our retail business and all the businesses in which we're in. We've got about a thousand different generative AI applications we've either built or in the process of building right now."

Could you talk about the current speed of delivery, maybe how much more room to go there, and how is it driving the everyday essentials business? Then some of relatedly, any further color on inbound network efficiencies you would expect to see this year as you guys try to continue to lower the cost to serve. Thank you."
AMZN,2025-02-06,2025-02-07,,2025-02-06,2025-02-06T17:00:00-05:00,0,2025-02-06,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Yeah. I would say on speed of delivery, that we measure this very carefully. And we measure both what the conversion rate is of somebody who views a product detail page with a faster delivery promise versus those that are slower as well as what we see downstream from customers once they've bought with a fast promise and what they end up buying throughout the year. And we have not yet seen diminishing returns of being able to continue to improve the speed of delivery. It doesn't mean that there won't be instances in which people are happy to take products later. You know, we have a program where if people want to pick a day during the week where they want to combine a bunch of their shipments and have it delivered then to be more sustainable and more environmentally friendly, they can. And we have plenty of customers who choose that, but we time in and time out see that people choose to buy from us more frequently when we're able to deliver to their homes or wherever they are much more quickly, and it leads to actually using us for more of their everyday purchases when we can do ever more quickly. And I think that if you look at what we're doing with Prime, you know, the promise there is for a number of items that we'll be able to deliver items to customers inside an hour. And I think when you're ordering everyday essentials where you need something more quickly, it's a big deal. And you see it, it's had a big impact on our everyday essentials. It's had a big impact on our pharmacy business where people are able to get items same day now in lots of cities throughout the US. And they're just using us much more frequently than they had before. The inbound network efficiencies, what I would tell you is, we made a pretty significant architectural change in our inbound network that we've been working on for the better part of the year that we rolled out just a few months ago. And it's what we find when we make big architectural changes like this is that you tend to get some low hanging fruit efficient early, but then there's all sorts of tuning and refinement you have to do once you actually see it working live across the really vast network. And we have all sorts of ways here that where I think it's early, and I think we're gonna get additional efficiencies throughout the year. But I expect that we'll have opportunities to keep taking our costs to serve down this year, and that'll be a big part of"

I wanted to follow-up on Andy's remarks about how you're using AI within the Amazon eCommerce experience. But I wanted to talk about the other side of the coin, and that's really the eCommerce discovery process that leads people to Amazon. There's a lot of companies rolling out agents and assistants, and I would love to hear how Amazon is planning for potential disruption in this funnel and what the plans are. You spoke about Rufus, maybe make that more prominent. But what do you think the changes coming to the eCommerce funnel over the next several years would be great."

You know, I think that it's an emerging space, and if you think about the investments we've made in our fulfillment network, in our website, in all the selection that we've built, how we organize it. You know, most retailers are gonna have, you know, kind of terms in which they're gonna interact with agents, and we'll be no different that way. And I think that I do think that Rufus, if you look at how it impacts the customer experience, and if you actually use it month to month, it continues to get better and better. It's already, if you're buying something and you're on a product detail page, our product detail pages provide so much information that sometimes it's hard if you're trying to find something quickly to scroll through and figure and find that little piece of information. And so we have so many customers now who just use Rufus to help them find a quick fact about a product. They also use Rufus to figure out how to summarize customer reviews, so they don't have to read a hundred customer reviews to get an idea of what people think about that product. If you look at the personalization, you know, really, most prominently today, your ability to go into Rufus and ask what's happened to an order or what did I just order or can you pull up for me this item that I ordered two months ago? The personalization keeps getting much better. And so we expect throughout 2025 that the number of occasions where you're not sure which you wanna buy and you want help from Rufus are gonna continue to increase more and more helpful to customers."

Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2024. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, May 1, 2025 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date, and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies, and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things. So, we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Andy."
AMZN,2025-05-01,2025-05-02,,2025-05-01,2025-05-01T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-05-01,prepared,,Andy Jassy,"Thanks, Dave. Today we're reporting $165.7 billion in revenue, up 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is $18.4 billion up 20% year-over-year and trailing 12 month free cash flow is $25.9 billion. We're pleased with our continued business progress, but more importantly with our pace of innovation and additional improvement in our customer experiences. In our stores business, we once again saw strong consumer resonance in our continued work on selection value and shipping speed. Our broad selection offers customers choice across their shopping journeys. We welcome well-known brands such as Oura Rings, Michael Kors, and The Ordinary, as well as a new shopping experience with Saks that offers a refined luxury assortment of fashion and beauty items from brands like Dolce&Gabbana, Balmain, Erdem, Giambattista Valli, and Jason Wu Collection. As always, we're working to keep prices low. And with this being an uncertain moment for consumers, it's even more important than it typically is. In Q1, we held deal events worldwide to help customers save over $500 million across the Big Spring Sale in the U.S. and Canada, Spring Deal Days in Europe, and Ramadan/Eid Sale events in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and UAE. Prime members will have more opportunities to save throughout the year including at our eleventh Prime Day event in July. Over the past few years, we've made significant progress in making our fulfillment network more efficient and cost effective. We've shared many times that an important turning point was regionalizing our national fulfillment network into regional hubs. By stocking items closer to where customers live, we're able to deliver more orders faster often in fewer packages and at lower delivery costs. The next challenge was getting as many items as possible into these regional nodes. Our inbound network which is how we get items to each fulfillment center hadn't been architected to leverage this new regionalization structure. So, we redesigned it and just rolled out a new inbound architecture that expands the share of products that we can place in each fulfillment center improving delivery speeds and lowering our cost to serve. In the first quarter, we once again set new delivery speed records with our fastest delivery ever for Prime members around the world and we delivered more items in the same day or next day in Q1 than any other quarter in our history. Looking ahead, we'll continue to refine our newly redesigned inbound network, build out our same day delivery sites and add additional robotics and automation throughout our buildings. You'll also see us expand the number of delivery stations that we have in rural areas of the U.S. So, we can get items to people who live in less densely populated areas much more quickly. I thought I'd share a few thoughts on the prospect of heightened tariffs on our stores business. Obviously none of us knows exactly where tariffs will settle or when. We haven't seen any attenuation of demand yet. To some extent, we've seen some heightened buying in certain categories that may indicate stocking up in advance of any potential tariff impact. We also have not seen the average selling price of retail items appreciably go up yet. Some of this reflects some forward buying we did in our first-party selling and some of that reflects some advanced inbounding our third-party sellers have done, but a fair amount of this is that most sellers just haven't changed pricing yet. Again, this could change depending on where tariffs settle. Amazon is not uniquely susceptible to tariffs. As it relates to China, retailers who aren't buying directly from China are typically buying from companies who themselves are buying from China, marking these items up, rebranding and selling to U.S. Consumers. These retailers are buying the product at a higher price than Chinese sellers selling directly to U.S. consumers in our marketplace. So, the total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China Direct Sellers. It's also sometimes easy to forget what Amazon sells. We're not mostly selling high average selling price items, but we certainly sell a bunch. In the first quarter, our Everyday Essentials grew more than twice as fast as the rest of our business and represented one out of every three units sold in the U.S. and Amazon. Even if you exclude Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh, Amazon is one of the largest grocers in the U.S. with over $100 billion in gross sales last year. People are buying a lot of their everyday essentials at Amazon. We also have extremely large selection, hundreds of millions of unique SKUs, which means we're often able to weather challenging conditions better than others. When there are periods of discontinuity, substantial unexpected product trends emerge. Think about the pandemic, when items like masks and hand sanitizer became big sellers. When you have the broadest selection like we do and 2 million plus global sellers like we do, you're better positioned to help customers find whatever items matter to them at lower price points than elsewhere. Finally, when there are uncertain environments, customers tend to choose the provider they trust most. Given our really broad selection, low pricing and speedy delivery, we have emerged from these uncertain areas with more relative market segment share than we started and better set up for the future. I'm optimistic this could happen again. Moving to a few words on Amazon Ads, we're working hard to be the best place for brands of all sizes to grow their business. We are pleased with the strong growth on a very large base generating $13.9 billion of revenue in the quarter and growing 19% year-over-year. We're seeing strength across our broad portfolio of full funnel advertising offerings that help advertisers reach an average ad supported audience of more than 275 million in the U.S. alone. This includes our top of funnel efforts to drive brand awareness to bottom of funnel offerings where we measure outcomes at the point of conversion. Amazon Ads provides brands with tools to reach targeted audiences in our own entertainment properties such as Prime Video, Twitch and IMDB, in live sports such as NFL, NBA and NASCAR, audio content such as Amazon Music and Wondery and of course in our store as well as many other external sites such as Pinterest and BuzzFeed. All of our audience and measurement capabilities work for the ads we deliver across premium third party publishers through Amazon DSP and our secure clean rooms provide advertisers the ability to analyze data, produce core marketing metrics and understand how their marketing performs across various channels. We continue to see a lot of opportunity to further expand our full funnel capabilities for brands. AWS grew 17% year-over-year in Q1 and now sits at a $117 billion annualized revenue run rate. We continue to help organizations of all sizes accelerate their move to the cloud, helping to modernize their infrastructure, lower costs and speed up innovation. We signed new AWS agreements with companies including Adobe, Uber, Nasdaq, Ericsson, Fujitsu, Cargill, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, General Dynamics Information Technology, GE Vernova, Booz Allen Hamilton, NextEra Energy, Publicis Sapient, Elastic, Netsmart, and many others. It's useful to remember that more than 85% of the global IT spend is still on premises, so not in the Cloud yet. It seems pretty straightforward to me that this equation will flip in the next 10 to 20 years. Before this generation of AI, we thought AWS had the chance to ultimately be a multi $100 billion revenue run rate business. We now think it could be even larger. If you believe your mission is to make customers' lives easier and better every day and you believe that every customer experience will be reinvented with AI, you're going to invest very aggressively in AI and that's what we're doing. You can see that in the thousand plus AI applications we're building across Amazon. You can see that with our next generation of Alexa named Alexa+. You can see that in how we're using AI in our fulfillment network, robotics, shopping, Prime Video and advertising experiences. And you can see that in the building blocks AWS is constructing for external and internal builders to build their own AI solutions. We're not dabbling here. We're very intentionally giving builders the broadest possible capabilities at every level of the AI stack cost effectively to use AI expansively across their businesses. At the bottom layer for those building models, our new custom AI chip Trainium 2 is starting to lay in capacity in larger quantities with significant appeal and demand. While we offer customers the ability to do AI in multiple chip providers and will for as long as I can proceed, customers doing AI at any significant scale realize that it can get expensive quickly. So, the 30% to 40% better price performance that Trainium 2 offers versus other GPU based instances is compelling. For AI to be as successful as we believe it can be, the price of inference needs to come down significantly. We consider this part of our mission and responsibility to help make it so. At the middle layer for those wanting to leverage frontier models to build Generative AI apps, Amazon Bedrock is our fully managed service that offers a choice of high performing foundation models with the most compelling set of features that make it easy to build high quality Generative AI applications. We continue to iterate quickly on Bedrock adding Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet hybrid reasoning model, their most intelligent model to date and Meta's Llama 4 family of models. We were also the first cloud service provider to make DeepSeek R1 and Mistral AI's Pixtral Large generally available as a fully managed model. And of course, we offer our own Amazon Nova state-of-the-art foundation models in Bedrock with the latest premier model launching yesterday. They deliver frontier intelligence and industry leading price performance and we have thousands of customers already using them including Slack, Siemens, Sumo Logic, Coinbase, FanDuel, Glean, and Blue Origin. A few weeks ago, we released the Amazon Nova Sonic, the new speech-to-speech foundation model that enables developers to build voice-based AI applications that are highly accurate, expressive, and human-like. Nova Sonic has lower word error rates and higher win rates over other comparable models for speech interactions. The technology was also abuzz by the potential of agents. To-date virtually all the agentic use cases have been of the question-answer variety. Our intention is for agents to perform wide-ranging complex, multi-step tasks by organizing a trip for setting the right temperature or music ambience in your house for dinner guests, or handling complex IT tasks to increase business productivity. There haven't been action-oriented agents like this until Alexa+. It was a technology to build these agents a still quite primitive and accurate, and requires constant human supervision. We just released a research preview of Amazon Nova Act, a new AI model trained to perform actions within a web browser, and it enables developers to breakdown complex workflows into reliable atomic commands like search, or checkout, or answer questions about the stream. It also enables them to add more detailed instructions to these commands, where needed, like don't accept the insurance upsell. Nova Act aims to move the current state-of-the-art accuracy of multi-step agentic actions from 30% to 60%, to 90-plus percent with the right set of building blocks to build these action-oriented agents. And the very top of the stack of the applications, this past quarter Q, the most capable generative AI assistance for accelerating software development, and leveraging your own data, plus a lightening-fast new agentic coding experience within the command line interface that could execute complex workflows autonomously. Customers are loving this. We also made generally available Give That Dudo with Amazon Q, enabling AI agents to assist multi-step tasks such as new feature development, code-based upgrades, or Java 8 and 11, while also offering code review and unit testing, all within the same familiar Give That platform. Our AI business has a multibillion dollar annual revenue run rate, continues to grow triple-digit year-over-year percentages, and is still in its very early days. While there is good reason for the high optimism about AI, I conclude my AWS comments with the reminder that there's still so much on-premises infrastructure yet to be moved to the cloud. Infrastructure modernization is much less actually to talk about the AI. The fundamental to any company's technology and invention capabilities to develop their productivity is speed and cost structure. If a company is to realize the full potential of AI, they are going to need their infrastructure and data in the cloud. I want to briefly mention a few other items. As I've referenced a couple of times, in Q1, we introduced Alexa+. Our next-generation of Alexa personal assistant was meaningfully smarter and more capable than our prior self, can both answer virtually any question and to take actions, and is free with Prime or available to non-Prime customers for $99 a month. We are just starting to roll this out in the U.S., and we'll be expanding to additional countries later this year. People are really liking Alexa+ thus far. We are excited and honored to be part of a joint venture that will be creating next-generation of the esteemed James Bond film franchise. We recently named the producer Amy Pascal and David Heyman to produce the next James Bond movie. Additionally, just a couple of days ago, Project Kuiper reached a significant milestone by launching our first satellite into orbit, with more being launched soon, and we expect to begin offering service to customers later this year. I'm proud of what our teams around the world have delivered. We are excited about what we are inventing and working on, as we speak. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for our financial update."
AMZN,2025-05-01,2025-05-02,,2025-05-01,2025-05-01T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-05-01,prepared,,Brian Olsavsky,"Thanks, Andy. I'll begin with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $155.7 billion, a 10% increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This equates to $1.4 billion headwind from foreign exchange year-over-year in the quarter. Worldwide operating increase was $18.4 billion, approximately $400 million above the high-end of our guidance range. These results include one-time charges that impact North America and international operating income that I'll discuss in a moment. First, let's start with the net sales results for these segments. In the North America segment, first quarter revenue was $92.9 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Our International segment revenue was $33.5 billion, also an increase of 8% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units were 8% year-over-year. Our priority is to provide value to our customers across our businesses. In the first quarter, we held multiple deal events around the world, which drove strong customer engagement. We saw broad-based strengths across our key business inputs, including record delivery speeds for Prime members, enabled by improved inventory placement. Our vast selection gives customers choice across various price points, particularly in categories like grocery, which includes everyday essentials. These are the items that people purchase most frequently. We partner with millions of independent sellers from around the world. These selling partners are important contributors to our broad selection, and worldwide third-party selling unit mix was 61% in Q1, consistent with Q1 of last year. Shifting to profitability, North America segment operating income was $5.8 billion, and international segment operating income was $1 billion, with operating margins of 6.3% in North America and 3% internationally. As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we've recorded one-time charges related to some historical customer returns that have not yet been resolved and some costs to receive inventory that was pulled forward into Q1 ahead of anticipated tariffs. Without these charges, North America and international operating margins would have been approximately 90 basis points and 70 basis points higher, with operating margins of 7.2% for North America and 3.7% for international. We are pleased with how our teams continue to execute and deliver for customers. In Q1, our newly re-architected inbound network drove productivity in our fulfillment and transportation network, leading to better inventory placement and higher units per package, and as a result, lower delivery costs. Beyond Q1, we have a number of initiatives underway to continue improving our cost structure, such as fine-tuning our inbound network, building out our same-day delivery sites, expanding our rural delivery network, and adding robotics and automation to our facilities. Better inventory placement remains a top priority. Better placement drives more in-stock selection, reduces travel distances, and speeds up delivery. And having inventory in the right place at the right time increases the likelihood that multiple items can be combined in a package, which helps reduce packaging and cost. Although progress won't always be linear, we have a good plan to continue to drive improvement over time. Shifting to advertising, advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North America and International segments. Advertising revenues grew 19% year-over-year. We're pleased with the accelerating growth on an increasingly large base. We're seeing strong adoption across our full-funnel advertising offering, as brands appreciate our ability to connect them with customers. We'll also continue to invest in other long-term opportunities. These efforts have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon in the future, including Kuiper, where we had our first launch of our production-designed satellites earlier this week. And we'll be launching more satellites throughout the year. We're closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment, including the impact of tariffs. We're planning for various outcomes, and we've taken a number of actions to protect the customer experience. We're doing everything we can to keep our prices low for customers in a way that makes economic sense. Moving next to our AWS segment, revenue was $29.3 billion in Q1, an increase of 17% year-over-year. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of more than $117 billion. During the first quarter, we continue to see growth in both Generative AI business and non-Generative AI offerings. As companies turn their attention to newer initiatives, bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premises to the cloud, and tap into the power of Generative AI. AWS operating income was $11.5 billion and reflects our continued growth, coupled with our focus on driving efficiencies across the business. As we've said before, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. We plan to bring on an increasing amount of capacity in the back half of the year. Now, turning to our cash CapEx, which was $24.3 billion in Q1. The majority of the spend is to support the growing need for technology infrastructure. This primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI services, and increasingly in custom silicon like Trainium, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. We're also investing in our fulfillment and transportation network to support future growth and improve delivery speeds and our cost structure. This investment will support growth for many years to come. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd like to point out that our first quarter net income of $17.1 billion includes a pre-tax gain of $3.3 billion, included in non-operating income, and it relates to our investment in Anthropic. This activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations, but rather the result of the conversion of a portion of our convertible notes to non-voting preferred stock. Turning to Q2 guidance, as a reminder, our guidance considers a range of possibilities and takes into account Q1 results, trends in quarter day results, and expectations around the macroeconomic environment. Q2 net sales are expected to be between $159 billion and $164 billion. We estimate the year-over-year impact of changes in foreign exchange rates based on current rates, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately 10 basis points in the quarter. As a reminder, global currencies can fluctuate during the quarter. Q2 operating income is expected to be between $13 billion and $17.5 billion. This estimate includes the impact of our seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense in Q2, driven by the timing of our annual compensation cycle. The external environment remains complex, and as we have done throughout our history, we are focused on the inputs that we can control to protect the customer experience. We will work hard to remain the place customers trust for sharp prices, broad selection, and convenience. We'll remain focused on driving a better customer experience, and we still believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions."

So, Andy, it seems like you've been bringing on a lot more P5 GPU instances since February from what it looks like to kind of support all these new AI workloads. So, how would you characterize in the first quarter and maybe here in the second quarter, the kind of supply/demand imbalance that you talked about before around AI workloads? And when do you think that AWS will be in a position to kind of capture enough AI revenue to drive acceleration? Is that something that could happen this year? Do you see that more like next year, given your capacity constraints? Thank you very much."
AMZN,2025-05-01,2025-05-02,,2025-05-01,2025-05-01T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-05-01,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Thanks, Ross. I would say that we've been bringing on a lot of P5s, which is a form of NVIDIA chip instances, as well as landing more and more Trainium 2 instances as fast as we can. And I would tell you that our AI business right now is a multi-billion dollar annual run rate business that's growing triple-digit percentages year-over-year. And we, as fast as we actually put the capacity in, it's being consumed. So, I think we could be driving -- we could be helping more customers and driving more revenue for the business if we had more capacity. We have a lot more Trainium 2 instances, and the next generation of NVIDIA's instances landing in the coming months. I expect that there are other parts of the supply chain that are a little bit jammed up as well at motherboards and some other componentry. And some of that is just because there is so much demand right now, but I do believe that the supply chain issues and the capacity issues will continue to get better as the year proceeds."

First, in terms of strategy Andy, how do you think about positioning the company for the medium term, given all the levels of uncertainty out there about how the global trade environment might shift in the coming months? What do you see as the key strategic priorities that will allow the company to sort of be able to capitalize one way or another, depending on various elements of outcome? And how do you prioritize those investments in the months ahead? And then with respect to the one-quarter forward operating income guide, is there anything in there from a cost side that we should be thinking about as purely aligned with those types of investments against the trade landscape that might not repeat either later into this year or next year? Thanks so much."
AMZN,2025-05-01,2025-05-02,,2025-05-01,2025-05-01T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-05-01,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Thanks, Eric. It's hard to tell what's going to happen with tariffs right now. It's hard to tell where they're going to settle and when they're going to settle. And so, a lot of what we're thinking about short and medium term actually turns out to be what we think about long-term too, which is, how do we actually have the broadest possible selection for customers at the lowest possible prices? And there's maybe never been a more important time in recent memory than trying to keep prices low, which we're heads down, pretty maniacally focused on, and then get things to people quickly and take care of customers. And that is the heart of what we're doing. And you can see different initiatives that we've taken within those priorities. We've done some forward buys of inventory where we're the first-party seller. Our third-party sellers have pulled forward a number of items so that they have inventory here as well. And those are all -- we're encouraging that because we're trying to keep prices as low as possible for customers. I think also, when you have as broad selection as we have, and we have much broader selection than other retailers, it means that when you've got this continuity, like we may potentially have, you're better able to help customers find what they want, no matter what those trends are. And I mentioned in my opening comments about what happened in the pandemic, and you can bet there are going to be things that we don't anticipate that customers really value and want that are different. It could be as simple, by the way, as just favoring other brands that maybe people didn't know about before, but where they have a more favorable price equation for customers. And I think when you've also got -- another thing that people forget is that when you've got 2 million-plus sellers, they're not all going to take the same strategy if there ends up being higher tariffs. I mean, there are going to be plenty of sellers that decide to pass on those higher costs to end consumers, but they're going to -- we have a lot of sellers in lots of different countries, and not all of them are going to pursue the same tack. And so, I think when you've got larger diversity like we have, we have a better chance of some of those sellers deciding that they're going to capture share, and they're not going to pass on all or any of those tariffs to customers. And so, I think customers are going to have a better chance of finding variety on selection and on lower prices when they come here. And the last thing I would say is that we have been in a number of our businesses, but just I'd say over the last 6 years or so, we have been diversifying where we produce things over a long period of time. We had, I would say, a meaningfully higher concentration of where we produced components for AWS or devices in China than we have now, where we've diversified meaningfully over that time. And we just thought that was wise to do so. And so, those are some of the ways that we're trying to make sure that we are protecting our customers over the short, medium, and long-term. But it turns out that most of those are the things that we focus most on, which is really broad selection for ultimate choice, really low prices, and very fast delivery."

I think that was your question, and the cost that might be in Q2. The thing I'd point to again is what I mentioned earlier, the stock-based comp always steps up generally in Q2 versus Q1, and then resets a rate that carries through for the next four quarters. You can look at historic trends to get an idea of that. Secondly, we do have some additional Kuiper launch costs in Q2. You saw a launch happen this week. And a reminder that we expense those launch costs until the point of commercialization, which a plan is to have that be later in this year."

AMZN,2025-05-01,2025-05-02,,2025-05-01,2025-05-01T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-05-01,qa,,Justin Post,"Great. Thanks. I'll go back to AWS. I know in the past you said revenues can be lumpy. Can you explain why they might fluctuate up and down if it's beyond just capacity? And you see the competitors with some pretty good growth rates. How do you think about the difference there? Obviously, your dollar growth is very good, but how do you think about the difference there versus some of your competitors? Thank you."
AMZN,2025-05-01,2025-05-02,,2025-05-01,2025-05-01T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-05-01,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Well, the first thing I would say is when we've historically said that revenue can be lumpy, we've been saying this well before what's happened with AI over the last couple of years. And the reason for that is the sales cycle, particularly for enterprises. It's true for startups. What you really want is you want to have the type of capabilities where startups want to primarily choose to run on top of your platform. And that's true. If you look in the startup space, the vast majority of successful startups over the last 10 to 15 years have run on top of AWS. And it's unpredictable when those startups are going to find product market fit and grow substantially. And it's hard for them to predict and even harder for us to predict. And the same thing goes on the enterprise side, but in a different way. When the sales cycle on the enterprise side is that you spend time trying to convince people that they should move from on-premises to the cloud, and then that you have the right solution for them. And then, you pick a set of projects that you get experience on. And sometimes they use systems integrators. Sometimes they use our own professional services. Sometimes they're doing it themselves. Then there's a next tranche migrations. And those migrations just take time. And some companies get through them really quickly and some companies take longer to get through them. And what happens a lot of times too, is that they get excited and enthusiastic about the cost advantages and the speed of innovation advantages they get moving to the cloud. And what was supposed to be a smaller next tranche turns into a much larger next tranche. And all of that has been true for a long time. It's very hard for us to predict because it really is contingent on what enterprises, how they want to sequence it and resource it. Then you throw in AI, which has its own very fast growth cycle, particularly in certain types of use cases. And those change. I mean, I'll give you just some examples. In the early days, of the earliest days, I should say, of AI, what you've seen the most amount of has been initiatives that get you productivity and cost avoidance. And we've seen that from so many of our AWS customers. And we're doing a lot of it ourselves inside of Amazon using AI. And then, you've also seen, I would say, large scale training with a lot of those are running on top of this as well, and as Anthropic is building their next few training models on top of our Trainium 2 chip on AWS. And then, you've seen a couple of really big chatbots. And then, what you've seen just in the last few months is really kind of the explosion of coding agents. And if you just look at the growth of these coding agents, the last few months, these are companies like Cursor or Vercel, both of them run significantly on AWS, but just look at the growth of that over the last few months. You just couldn't have predicted that sort of growth. And so, that's why it's lumpy. Sometimes you'll have very significant increases that you didn't predict and you couldn't forecast. And then, they'll grow at a good rate, but maybe not the same rate before the next big kind of explosive growth. And I would tell you that everything I just mentioned, what's interesting in AI is that we still haven't gotten to all the other customer experiences that are going to be reinvented and all the other agents that are going to be built, they're going to take the role of a lot of different functions today. And even though we have a lot of combined inference in those areas, I would say we're not even at the second strike of the first batter in the first inning. It is so early right now. And then, I would just say on how to think about relative growth rates, you always have to -- the year-over-year growth rate is really only a function of the percentage growth on the base with which you are operating from. And we just have a very meaningfully larger base on the technology infrastructure side than others. And so, when it's still think about 17% year-over-year growth on a $117 billion revenue run rate, it's still pretty significant growth. And as I said, I think we could be doing more, more if we had more capacity and I expect that the capacity to ease in the coming months."

One for Brian, one for Andy; Brian, just maybe to follow-up on AWS, but more on the margin side, we've seen a lot of fluctuation over the last couple of years and now hitting almost 40%. Maybe you can just talk about what's driving the outperformance and then how we should think about normalized margins going forward? And then, Andy, your comments on Alexa about moving to more complex tasks, can you talk about that more and just with Alexa, the products have been around for a long time, they've had different use cases. How do you get users to shift their behavior more with Alexa? Thanks."
AMZN,2025-05-01,2025-05-02,,2025-05-01,2025-05-01T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-05-01,qa,,Brian Olsavsky,"Thanks, Doug. I'll take your first question. We did a strong quarter in AWS, as you mentioned, the margin performance. I would attribute it to the strong growth that we're seeing coupled with the impact of some continued investment we're making in innovation and technology, give you some examples. So, we invest in software and process improvements and it ends up optimizing our server capacity, which helps our infrastructure cost. We've been developing more efficient network using our low cost custom networking gear. We're working to maximize the power usage in our existing data centers, which both lowers our costs and also reclaims power for other newer workloads. And we're also seeing the impact of advancing custom silicon like Graviton. It provides lower costs not only for us, but also for our customers, the better price performance for them. But you're right, margins are impacted by a lot of things, including our level of investment, competitive pricing, the mix of Generative AI services as they're ramping up will continue to evolve over the years to come. So, we do have a lot of investment in infrastructure going on and planned for the second-half of the year. So, that will -- we'll start to see the impact of that. But we're happy with the performance of the team with generating cost savings. And it's a big focus as well as expanding the services and features for customers."
AMZN,2025-05-01,2025-05-02,,2025-05-01,2025-05-01T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-05-01,qa,,Andy Jassy,"On the Alexa question, we're really excited about Alexa+. And as I mentioned earlier, it is -- she's much more intelligent, much more capable, and able to take real action. And to date, most of the agents that have been out there have really just been able to answer questions, which when it came out was very remarkable and -- but it's I think the future of agents is not just being intelligent, but also being able to take action. And that's actually, it requires a great model, but it also requires the ability to sync that model and to align that model with being able to take the right action and execute and implement the right APIs or you can have, very suboptimal results. And so, we've worked hard on that in Alexa+. We've been -- we started rolling out over the last several weeks. So, it's with now over 100,000 users, with more rolling out in the coming months. And so, far, the response from our customers has been very, very positive. People are excited about it. I think that it does a lot more things than what Alexa did before. And we're very fortunate in that we have over a half billion devices out there in people's homes and offices and cars. So, we have a lot of distribution already, but there will be to some degree, there will be a little bit of rewiring for people on what they can do because you get used to patterns. I mean, even the simple thing of not having to speak Alexa speak anymore where we're all used to saying Alexa before we want every, action to happen. And what you find is you really only have to do it the first time, and then really the conversation is ongoing where you don't have to say Alexa anymore. And I've been lucky enough to have the alpha and the beta, that I've been playing with for several months. And it took me a little bit of time to realize I didn't have to keep saying Alexa. And it's very freeing when you don't have to do that. And then, I think it's just experience in trying things. So, you can do things like you have guests coming over on a Saturday night for dinner and you can say Alexa, please, open the shades, put the lights on in the driveway and on the porch, increase the temperature five degree and pick music that would be great for dinner that's mellow. And she just does it. And like, when you have those types of experiences, it makes you want to do more of it. When I was in New York, when we were announcing, I asked her what were the -- we did the event way downtown. I asked her, what was great Italian restaurants or pizza restaurants. She gave me a list and then she asked me if she wanted me to make a reservation. I said yes and she made the reservation, confirmed the time. Like that, when you get into those types of routines and you have those types of experience, they're very, very useful. It is really like having a great personal assistant, which most people in the world don't have. And so, I think that the more and more that people get used to it, they will realize what she can do. And we're not going to be standing still. We have a lot more functionality that we plan to add in the coming months too."

AMZN,2025-05-01,2025-05-02,,2025-05-01,2025-05-01T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-05-01,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, Andy and Brian. So, I have one for each of you guys. So, Andy, you have a very complicated retail business with a lot of moving pieces to it. I imagine you have a lot of good data on what you expect demand to be over the course of the year and the holidays and things. As you kind of step back and analyze the business and the tariff uncertainty, can you just sort of walk us through the one or two key areas operationally that you're most focused on just to ensure that Prime Day, Thanksgiving and the holidays go as smoothly as they possibly can? And then, secondly, on Brian, just to kind of go back to Eric's earlier question, as we think about the 2Q EBIT guide, are there any onetime costs or sort of tariff related costs in there similar to that $1 billion that you called out in the first quarter? Thanks."
AMZN,2025-05-01,2025-05-02,,2025-05-01,2025-05-01T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-05-01,qa,,Andy Jassy,"Thanks, Brian. On the retail question, I would say that the areas that maybe we're most focused on to make sure we have not just a great Prime Day, but Prime Day is just one event as you know, and so is peak. We're trying to be great all year long for customers. The obvious ones are making sure that we help our sellers however we can, because there's uncertainty for our sellers as well. So, we're trying to make sure we provide a great experience. We're trying to make sure that we have the right diversity of sellers and low prices for our customers. I think all that you have to also be very thoughtful around how much inventory you bring into your fulfillment nodes at any one time, because you can imagine scenarios where either on your own when you're the first party seller or lots of third parties want to get as much inventory in as early as possible trying to beat a deadline on what may happen. And if you end up with too much inventory in your fulfillment network, it really slows down, your productivity and your ability to get things out as quickly as you want for customers at the cost structure you want. So, being able to manage that thoughtfully, we've learned that over the years, and I think the team is doing a really good job of balancing that right now."

We have stock based comp step up, which I think you can see the normal pattern for that if you look at our history. We have additional Kuiper expenses. Specifically, you asked about tariffs. We do have tariffs that we'll be paying on retail purchases based on current tariffs. It's not large in Q2. It's we had done a lot of pre-buying of inventory in Q1, as I mentioned earlier. But just generally, I think with the uncertainty, we've added a bit to the range that we've given you. We generally have a wide range, but just the general uncertainty that we're seeing and uncertainty of consumer demand and all the everything else is causing us to increase the ranges a bit. So, we'll see. We feel an informed view of Q2 right now. As Andy mentioned earlier, we saw, actually some strength in April based on what could end up being some pre buys of a number of things, but and advertising has been strong. So, we think there's a lot of positive trends, but certainly uncertainty right now for the quarter."

AMZN,2025-05-01,2025-05-02,,2025-05-01,2025-05-01T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-05-01,qa,,Brent Thill,"Thanks. On AWS, I'm curious if you could give us the backlog number? And Andy, to your point about many of these core workload still yet to come to cloud, can you just update us on what you're seeing, are you seeing enterprise spring back, or are you seeing some confusion with AI clouding that transition and the timing of that? Just give some perspective on what you're seeing on migration. Thank you."
AMZN,2025-05-01,2025-05-02,,2025-05-01,2025-05-01T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-05-01,qa,,Dave Fildes,"This is Dave. I'll just jump in on the backlog, and turn over to Andy. The backlog is $189 billion for Q1. That's up about 20% year-over-year. And the weighted average, meaning life on that is 4.1 years. And the AWS question around what we are seeing on the workloads that haven't moved, what I would say -- the way I would characterize it is that we were on a very aggressive March that was esthetical, but almost metronomic before the pandemic of enterprises deciding that they wanted to move off their on-premises infrastructure, because of the speed of innovation, the developer productivity, and the cost advantages of the cloud. And then, when you got into the pandemic, and the economy was concerned in the second-half of that few years, we had everybody trying to cost-optimize, including us by the way. And then, as we started to emerge from that trend, you saw generative AI explode, and everybody wanted to try to find a way to have a workload, or set a workload there, because people saw the potential, and it was also something that was generating a lot of interest publicly. And so, what we are seeing now over the last, call it, 16 to 18 months or so, is that enterprises realize they need to do both. And they want to do AI. Also to pilot at this point, AI, many of which will be successful, others will not be successful. The ones that are successful were scaled. But they also have a lot more initiatives that they still haven't gotten to on the AI side, either because the willingness skill set, where they're picking the first set to get experience with, or as they're waiting to see the cost inference continue to go down, which it will. I mean, you will not get the expensiveness that we all know is coming in AI until we keep getting the cost inference down, even though it's going like crazy right now. But at the same time, I would say that we see an increased resurgence, and understanding for enterprises that they're dropping the low-hanging fruit if they don't move their infrastructure to the cloud, for all the reasons I mentioned earlier. So, you're starting to see those plans pick up again. As I mentioned earlier to one of the questions, you know the side that you're going to transform your infrastructure from on-premises and cloud, and see it happen in there months. That is typically a multiyear process that some companies do it fast, some companies do it slower, but they do it cautious and they do it softly because they can't afford for their application not to work if they're making that transition. And we are having meaningful success in those conversations, and in companies choosing to transform their infrastructure on top of AWS, and I think you'll see that moving forward too. Thank you for your time joining us today, and for your questions. A replay will be available on the Investor Relations website for at least three months.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2024. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 31, 2025, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears; inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce cloud services and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Andy."

Today, we're reporting $167.7 billion in revenue, up 12% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $19.2 billion, up 31% year-over-year and trailing 12-month free cash flow was $18.2 billion. We saw good progress across our various customer experiences and businesses this past quarter. Starting with stores. We feel good about both the inputs and outputs of the business. At Amazon, we think of our business in terms of inputs and outputs. Outputs or metrics like revenue are operating margin. But of course, you can't manage at the output level, it's the inputs that drive the outputs. So we spent virtually all of our time internally talking about and goaling against inputs. The inputs that matter most to customers in our stores business are selection, low prices and speed of delivery. We've taken another step forward in selection these past few months headlined by the much requested return of Nike's products to Amazon's retail store. We've added premium brands like Away, Aveda, Marc Jacobs Fragrances and brands from Saks and Amazon like Dolce&Gabbana, Etro, Stella McCartney, Rosetta Getty and La Prairie. And we started expanding our very successful Perishables Pilot, where we offer customers perishables as a point of purchase when they're ordering other items that will be delivered same day from our same-day fulfillment nodes. We're seeing strong customer adoption as 75% of customers who viewed as service this year are first-time shoppers for perishables on Amazon, with 20% of customers who use the service returning multiple times within their first month. Our prices continue to be low and sharp for customers. It's one of the reasons our everyday Essentials growth outpaced the rest of the business globally and representing one out of every 3 units sold. It's also why well-known research firm Profitero has concluded for 8 years in a row that Amazon has the lowest prices of any U.S. retailer, but perhaps the clearest outputs are the rate at which our stores business grew this past quarter and the success we saw in our recent Prime Day event. This year's Prime Day was our biggest ever with record sales, number of items sold and number of prime sign-ups in the 3 weeks leading up to the Prime Day. Customers save billions of dollars in independent sellers, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses saw their best sales performance of any Prime Day event yet. There continues to be a lot of noise about the impact that tariffs will have on retail prices and consumption. Much of it thus far has been wrong and misreported. As we said before, it's impossible to know what will happen. Where will tariffs finally settle especially China? What happens when we deplete the inventory we forward bought or that our selling partners who were deployed in advance of the tariffs going into effect. If costs end up being higher, who will absorb them, but what we can share is what we've seen thus far, which is that through the first half of the year, we haven't yet seen diminishing demand nor price is meaningfully appreciating. We also have such diversity of sellers in our marketplace over 2 million sellers in total with different strategies of whether to pass on higher cost to consumers, the customers are advantaged shopping at Amazon because they're more likely to find lower prices on the items they care about. Further improving delivery speed remains a key focus, and we continue to make progress. We've previously shared how we rearchitect our U.S. inbound network into a regional structure, allowing us to place inventory and ship from locations closer to customers, improving speed and low run costs. That work is delivering tangible results. In Q2, we increased the share of orders moving through direct lanes where packages go straight from fulfillment to delivery without extra stops by over 40% year-over-year. We've also reduced the average distance packages traveled by 12% and lowered handling touches per unit by nearly 15%. We've made progress on order consolidation with more products positioned locally, we're able to pack more items into each box and send fewer packages per order. That has helped drive higher units per box and improved overall cost to serve. Taken together, these improvements are making the network faster and structurally more efficient. We've also set another global speed record in Q2 delivering to prime members at our fastest speeds ever. In the U.S., we delivered 30% more items same day or next day than during the same period of last year. Items customers used to pick up locally and nearby physical stores are now arriving at their door often within hours. And we're working to further improve delivery speeds no matter where customers live, we've recently announced plans to expand our same-day and next-day delivery to tens of millions of U.S. customers and more than 4,000 smaller cities, towns and rural communities by the end of the year. Today, it's already available in more than 1,000 of these communities across the U.S. The early response from customers in these areas have been very positive. They're shopping more frequently and purchasing household essentials and meaningfully higher rates. Automation and robotics are also important contributors to improving cost efficiencies and driving better customer experiences over time. We deployed our 1 millionth robot across our global fulfillment network and unveiled innovations in our last-mile innovation center, such as automated package sorting and a transformative technology that brings packages directly to employees in an ergonomic height. We rolled out DeepFleet, our AI improves robot travel efficiency by 10%. At our scale, it's a big deal. DeepFleet acts like a traffic management system to coordinate robots' movements to find optimal paths and reduce bottlenecks. For customers, it means faster delivery times and lower costs for our team members, our robots handle more of the physically demanding tasks, making our operations network even safer. This combination of robotics and generative AI is just getting started. And while we've made significant progress, it's still early with respect to what will roll out in the next few years. Moving on to Amazon ads. We're pleased with the strong growth, generating $15.7 billion of revenue in the quarter, growing 22% year-over-year. We continue to see strength across our broad portfolio of full funnel advertising offerings that in the U.S. alone help advertisers reach an average ad-supported audience of more than 300 million across our own properties. These are properties like our retail marketplace, Prime Video, Twitch and Fire TV in live sports, such as NFL, NASCAR and the NBA as well as third-party websites and apps. Another area we're excited about is our demand side platform, or Amazon DSP. Our DSP enables advertisers to plan, activate and measure full funnel investments. Our trillions of proprietary browsing, shopping and streaming signals paired with extensive supply side relationships and our secure clean rooms provide advertisers the ability to optimize advertising, deliver greater precision and drive efficient and effective advertising outcomes. And in June, we announced a momentous partnership with Roku, giving advertisers access to 80 million connected TV households. The largest authenticated connected TV footprint in the U.S. exclusively through Amazon DSP is a giant leap forward for advertisers bringing best-in-class planning, audience precision and performance to TV advertising. We also announced an integration between Disney's real-time ad exchange and Amazon DSP. This collaboration allows advertisers to gain direct access to Disney's premium inventory across platforms like Disney+, ESPN and Hulu while allowing them to leverage insights from both companies. When advertisers work with Amazon, they're not just buying ad space they're benefiting from exceptional programming, innovative technology and unrivaled signals, measurement and audience development that provide strong relevancy for consumers and return on investment for brands. Moving on to AWS. In Q2, AWS grew 17.5% year-over-year and now has over $123 billion annualized revenue run rate. We continue to help organizations of all sizes accelerate their transition to the cloud, signing new agreements with companies, including PepsiCo, Airbnb, Peloton, NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange, Nissan Motor, GitLab, SAP, Warner Bros. Discovery, 12 Labs, FICO, Iberia Airlines, SK Telecom and NatWest. In the rapidly evolving world of generative AI, AWS continues to build a large fast-growing triple-digit year-over-year percentage multibillion-dollar business with more demand than we have supplied for at the moment. A few points to make. First, on the hardware side, our custom AI chip, Trainium2 is landing capacity in larger quantities and has impressively emerged as the backbone for Anthropic's newest generation Claude models and many of our most essential offerings like Amazon Bedrock. We've also launched Amazon EC2 instances powered by NVIDIA Grace Blackwell Superchips, AWS' most powerful NVIDIA GPU accelerated instance. Second, in Bedrock, we've recently added Anthropic's Claude 4 and is the fastest-growing model ever in Bedrock. We've also continued to see strong adoption of Amazon Nova, our own frontier model, and it's now the second most popular foundation model in Bedrock. New features in Nova allow customers to customize their Nova models in ways they can't and other foundation models, allowing organizations to infuse these models with their unique expertise while optimizing for cost and speed. As people have become excited about building agents, they're realizing they lack the tools to build them. In May, we released Strands, an open-source way to more easily build agents has taken off with a wide range of customers with already 2,500 stars on GitHub and over 300,000 downloads on [indiscernible] PI. Customers are also struggling with deploying agents into production in a secure and scalable way. It's holding up enterprises scaling agents. To help solve that problem, Bedrock just released AgentCore. AgentCore is a set of building blocks that gives customers the industry's first secure serverless run time to provide both synchronous and asynchronous execution, aging identity and boundaries, a memory service a gateway to translate services to MCP compatible interfaces, built-in code execution and web browser tools and an observability service. Customers are excited about AgentCore, and it frees them up to start deploying agents more expansively. Third, you're starting to see AWS release more powerful applications at the top layer of the AI stack. AWS transform as an AWS agent that dramatically reduces mainframe modernization time lines from years to months completes VMware TC2 conversions up to 80x faster, it makes it simple to move from .NET windows to .NET Linux implementations, reducing licensing costs for .NET applications by up to 40%. We've also just released Kiro, our new Agentic integrated development environment coding agent. There's a lot of buzz around Kiro with several hundred thousand developers using and requesting access in the first couple of weeks, 100,000 used in the first 5 days of the preview. What struck a cord for developers is that Kiro allows them to do Vibe Coding where developers use natural language to chat with a coding agent to build code. But unlike other coding agents, where developers don't really have any structure to build on top of, Kiro allows developers to use natural language to build spec and then automatically updates that spec as they continue to vibe code or interact with Kiro. This makes it much easier to go from prototyping to production. Customers also like Kiro's event-driven agent hooks that act like an experienced developer catching things developers might miss. When developers save a react component, hooks update that test file. When they modify API endpoints, Hooks refresh readme files. When they're ready to commit security hook scan for leak credentials. It's still very early for Kiro, but it seems clear we're on to something customers love and Kiro has a chance to transform how developers build software. I say this frequently, but remember that 85% to 90% of worldwide IT spend is still on-premises versus in the cloud. In the next 10 to 15 years, that equation is going to flip, further accelerated by company's excitement for leveraging AI. So AWS has significantly broader functionality, stronger security and operational performance a much deeper experience helping enterprises modernize their infrastructure bodes well for the AWS business moving forward. We're also seeing momentum in a number of our other areas across Amazon. I'll mention just a few. We're excited about our progress with Alexa+, our next-generation assistant powered by generative AI. We've been rolling out early access to U.S. customers to start millions of customers have access now. We're seeing very positive feedback, and we'll continue to iterate on the experience. We've recently completed our third successful launch of Project Kuiper. We haven't launched this service commercially yet but already have an impressive amount of enterprise and government customers who have signed agreements to use Kuiper. In Prime video live sports, our first season of NASCAR drew about 2 million viewers per race and the youngest audience among NASCAR broadcasters in more than a decade. We've recently announced our stellar broadcasting crew for our upcoming first NBA season, including in Eagle, Stan Van Gundy, Kevin Harlan, Dwayne Wade, Taylor Rooks, Blake Griffin, Dirk Nowitzki, Steve Nash and Candace Parker. We also announced Denis Villeneuve, an Academy Award nominee, as the Director for the next James Bond film, James Bond is in the hands of one of today's greatest filmmakers, and we cannot wait to get started on 007's next adventure. Finally, we continue to be very pleased with the growth and residence of Amazon Pharmacy and it's grown 50% year-over-year, year- to-date on an already significant size base. A lot of good things happening across the company. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update."
AMZN,2025-07-31,2025-08-01,,2025-07-31,2025-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-31,prepared,,Brian T. Olsavsky,"Thanks, Andy. Let's start with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $167.7 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Foreign exchange had a $1.5 billion favorable impact to revenue in the quarter as foreign currencies generally strengthened versus the U.S. dollar. As a reminder, our Q2 revenue guidance had anticipated an unfavorable impact of approximately 10 basis points or $100 million. Worldwide operating income was $19.2 billion, which was $1.7 billion above the high end of our guidance range. Across our segments, we continue to prioritize cost-effective innovation that delivers value for our customers. In the North America segment, second quarter revenue was $100.1 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. International segment revenue was $36.8 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units grew 12% year-over-year. We remain focused on inputs that matter most to our customers. In the second quarter, we saw broad-based strength across our key performance metrics. This includes sharp pricing and more in stock availability as well as record delivery speeds for Prime members. Our millions of global sellers continue to be an important contributor to our vast selection. This helps customers find the items they need and does so at a competitive price. Our investment in tools, services and fast delivery speeds help our selling partners reach more customers and further scale their businesses. In Q2, worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 62%, the highest ever, up on 100 basis points from Q2 of last year. We're also closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment, including the impact of tariffs. As Andy mentioned, our Q2 plan factored in a range of assumptions, not all of which materialized. We will continue to consider a range of assumptions going forward. Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $7.5 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion year-on-year. North America operating margin was 7.5%, up 190 basis points year-over-year. International segment operating income was $1.5 billion, up $1.2 billion year-over-year. International operating margin was 4.1%, up 320 basis points year-over-year. We're pleased with the strong execution of our operations teams and the positive experience they delivered for customers. In Q2, we saw productivity gains in our transportation network, driven by improved inventory placement, strong leverage on high unit volumes and higher levels of in-demand inventory from both first-party and third-party selling partners. These factors contributed to faster delivery speeds and lower costs. Outbound shipping costs were up 6% year-over-year and continue to grow at a meaningfully slower pace than unit growth, which as I mentioned earlier, was up 12% year-over-year. We're committed to initiatives that further improve our cost structure. Strategic inventory placement drives multiple benefits, including better in-stock availability, shorter delivery routes and faster customer delivery times. When we optimize inventory location, we can consolidate more items for package, reducing packaging materials and costs. To achieve this, we will continue to improve upon our inbound network, expand our U.S. same-day delivery facilities, including rural communities and implement robotics and automation across our facilities. While year-over-year improvements in operating margin may fluctuate, we have a purposeful strategy to achieve sustained progress over time. Shifting to advertising. Advertising revenue grew 22% year-over-year, driven by sponsored products as we saw strong traffic in our stores. Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North American International segments. Our full funnel advertising approach of connecting brands with customers is resonating. Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $30.9 billion, an increase of 17.5% year-over-year. AWS now has an annualized revenue run rate of more than $123 billion. During the second quarter, we continue to see growth in both our generative AI and non- generative AI businesses as companies turn their attention to newer initiatives bring more workloads to the cloud, restart or accelerate existing migrations from on-premise to the cloud and tap into the power of generative AI. AWS operating income was $10.2 billion. We did see AWS segment margins decline from a record high of 39.5% in Q1 to 32.9% in Q2. The largest quarter-over-quarter driver of the decrease or about half is due to the seasonal step-up in stock-based compensation expense, driven by the timing of our annual compensation cycle. AWS margins also saw headwinds from higher depreciation expense as well as unfavorable impacts from year-over-year fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The depreciation expense is a result of our growing investments in capital expenditures in AWS. As we've said in the past, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time driven in part by the level of investments we are making at any point in time. We will continue to invest more capital in chips, data centers and power to pursue this unusually large opportunity that we have in generative AI. Now turning to our cash CapEx, which was $31.4 billion in Q2. We expect Q2 CapEx to be reasonably representative of our quarterly capital investment rate for the back half of this year. AWS continues to be the primary driver as we invest to support demand for our AI services and increasingly in custom silicon, like Trainium, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. Additionally, we continue to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support growth of the business, improve delivery speeds and lower our cost to serve by investing in same-day delivery facilities as well as robotics and automation. Collectively, these investments will support growth for many years to come. Moving on to our third quarter financial guidance. As a reminder, our guidance considers a range of possibilities, which take into consideration Q2 results, trends we see quarter-to-date and expectations around the macroeconomic environment, including tariffs. Q3 net sales are expected to be between $174 billion and $179.5 billion. We estimate the year-over-year impact of changes in foreign exchange rates based on current rates, which we expect to be a favorable impact of approximately 130 basis points. As a reminder, global currencies can fluctuate during the quarter. Q3 operating income is expected to be between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion. In this dynamic environment, we'll focus on what matters most, delivering exceptional customer value through product selection, competitive prices and unmatched convenience. We remain focused on driving a better customer experience and believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions."

AMZN,2025-07-31,2025-08-01,,2025-07-31,2025-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-31,qa,,Douglas Till Anmuth,"I have two. First, can you just help us understand with some more granularity how tariffs are being absorbed across suppliers, Amazon and consumers and whether you anticipate any change going forward? And then second on AWS, we're seeing significantly faster cloud growth among the #2 and #3 players in the space. I totally appreciate that AWS is coming off of a bigger base. But beyond that, do you think the output gap is due more to customer demand or infrastructure supply for both?"
AMZN,2025-07-31,2025-08-01,,2025-07-31,2025-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-31,qa,,Andrew R. Jassy,"Yes. I'll take both of those. I'll start with the tariffs. I think what we said a number of times, and we still believe it is we just don't know what's going to happen moving forward. It's hard to know where the tariffs are going to settle, particularly in China. It's hard to know what will happen when we deplete some of the prebuys that we did on our own first-party retail and then some of the forward deploying that we saw of our third-party selling partners. And if costs go up over time, it's -- we're unsure at this point who's going to end up absorbing those higher costs. What we can tell you is what we've seen so far in the first half of the year, in the first half, we just haven't seen diminished demand. And we haven't seen any kind of broad scale ASP increases. And so that could change in the second half. There are a lot of things that we don't know, but that's what we've seen so far. On the question on AWS, the first thing I'd say is it's -- as you said, Doug, in your question, you -- year-over-year percentages and growth rates are always a function of the base in which you operate. And we have a meaningfully larger business in the AWS segment than others. I think the second player is about 65% of the size of AWS. And we -- when we look at the results over the last number of quarters, there are sometimes where -- as far as we can tell, we're growing faster than others and sometimes others are growing faster than us. But it's still like if you look at second place player you're talking about, it's a -- it's still a pretty significant segment market segment leadership position that we have. And regardless, these are all really just moments in time. The last week is a moment in time too where -- the reality of what really matters is what customers' experiences are in operating on these platforms. And if you look at what matters to customers, what they care a lot about what the operational performances what the availability is, what the durability is, what the latency and throughput is of the various services. And I think we have a pretty significant advantage in that area. They care a lot about security. If you have data that matters. And for most companies, they're putting data that they really care about in the cloud. The security and the privacy of that data matters a lot, and there are very different results in security in AWS than you'll see in other players. And yes, you could just look at what's happened in the last couple of months, you can just see kind of adventures at some of these players almost every month. And so a very big difference, I think, in security. And then I think a really significant difference in functionality where not just in the core infrastructure, do we have a lot more functionality in our services. But I think if you look at our end-to-end offering in AWS in AI from the bottom of the stack all the way to the top, it's pretty different. So I feel good about the inputs and the services that we're offering to customers across AI as well as non AI and we have more demand than we have capacity right now. So we could be doing more revenue and helping customers more, and we're working very hard on changing that outcome and how much capacity we have, but it's still like if you look at the business, it's $123 billion annual revenue run rate business and it's still early. I mean how often do you have an opportunity that's $123 billion of annual revenue run rate where you say it's still early. It's a very unusual opportunity that we're very bullish about."

AMZN,2025-07-31,2025-08-01,,2025-07-31,2025-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-31,qa,,Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,"Okay. I'll stick with AWS to start with. Could you just disclose the backlog number? And then in the past, I know you've talked about the supply constraints and hoping that they will sort of resolve themselves by the back half of the year. Is that still your intention? Anything that suggests that the supply constraints are going to get resolved earlier or later? And then a long-term question on Alexa+ and I've been experimenting with it for a while. Just Andy, when you think about the potential that, that has in terms of increasing engagement, maybe tapping into some services revenue, advertising, maybe a little bit more retail sales per household, you're just reducing friction. Just talk about what -- from a financial perspective, how you think that could play out, how we would maybe see that in the numbers."
AMZN,2025-07-31,2025-08-01,,2025-07-31,2025-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-31,qa,,Dave Fildes,"Mark, this is Dave. I'll just start off to give you the backlog figures. So at the end of the quarter, at June 30, that was $195 billion, so that's up about 25% year-over-year."
AMZN,2025-07-31,2025-08-01,,2025-07-31,2025-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-31,qa,,Andrew R. Jassy,"On the supply constraints as it relates to AWS and what we see there, as I mentioned, we have more demand than we have capacity at this point. And I think that -- and you see some of the constraints and they kind of exist in multiple places, the single biggest constraint is power. But you also see constraints off and on with chips and then some of the components that -- once you have the chips to actually make the servers, the sometimes you have new generations of chips that are a little bit later than they're supposed to be and sometimes you get the chips and they yield you get in making servers isn't what you expect when you get to ramp. So there are a bunch of those pieces today that we're working on. It's really true across the industry today. I don't believe that we will have fully resolved the amount of capacity we need for the amount of demand that we have in a couple of quarters. I think it will take several quarters. But I do expect that it's going to get better each quarter, and I'm optimistic about that. I think on the Alexa question, I think I'd start by saying the Alexa+ experience is so much better than I think our prior Alexa experience. She's much more intelligent than her prior self. She's much more capable and I would say unlike the other chat bots that are out there today who are good at answering questions, but really can't take any action for you. Alexa+ can take a lot of action for you, which is very compelling. So I can ask Alexa to play music for me or play video for me to move my music from one device to another or if I'm listening to a song, that's on -- that's in a movie, I can ask Alexa+ to actually put that movie scene on -- of the song I'm playing, and it will put it on my Prime video on Fire TV or if I have guests coming over. I can say, Alexa draw the curtains, put the light on the porch and the driveway, increase the temperature by 5 degrees and put on music that would be great for a dinner party. And she does all that just through using natural language. So she could take a lot of actions and it's compelling. And what we see so far, we've been rolling out Alexa+ starting in the U.S. It's with millions of customers now. The rest in the U.S. coming in the next couple of months and it's starting the international rollout more broadly later in the year. And customers really like the experience. They recognize how much better it is than what it was before. The ratings are very high. The usage is much more expansive than what they were using before and the number of calls they're making is meaningfully higher. And I think there are a number of different areas where we'll see benefit. I think first, if you build the world's best personal assistant, that has a lot of utility for customers, and therefore, it gets used a lot. So it means everything from people are excited about the devices that they can buy from us that has Alexa+ enabled in it. People do a lot of shopping and it's really -- it's a delightful shopping experience that will keep getting better. I think over time, there will be opportunities as people are engaging more multiturn conversations to have advertising play a role to help people find discovery and also as a lever to drive revenue. And I think over time, you could also imagine, as we keep adding functionality that there could be some sort of subscription element beyond what there is today. Today, Prime members get Alexa+ for free and non-Prime members pay $9.99 a month for Alexa+. So I think it's very -- it's still very early days, but we're very encouraged by the experience we're providing and you can bet we're going to be iterating on it constantly."

I was hoping you could add maybe some color on the drivers of each of those and the sustainability of the improved efficiency in those markets. And then, Andy, you mentioned Kuiper’. We haven't heard as much about that of late. So maybe if you could review where things stand relative to next year's launch target timing of the service rollout and maybe any perspective you have on the longer-term ambitions for the satellite network."
AMZN,2025-07-31,2025-08-01,,2025-07-31,2025-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-31,qa,,Brian T. Olsavsky,"Colin, this is Brian. I'll start with the international segment question. So a very strong quarter for International segment, both on revenue growth and also on operating margin. Operating margin was up 320 basis points year-over-year to 4.1%. And if you look, that's the continuation of a strong progression we've seen quarter-by-quarter over the last 10 quarters in total, we've seen an increase of close to 700 basis points during that time period. So really, it's a tale of 2 pieces of segment -- or excuse me, sections within international. One is the the established countries like U.K., Germany and Japan, already at similar margin profiles to the U.S. So we'll -- as they continue to grow their contribution of profit will grow over time, and that's what we're seeing. In the quarter, we saw strong productivity in our transportation network in those countries, much like we saw in the U.S., and that's led to higher units for package and faster delivery speeds at lower cost. So again, the theme of lower cost to serve and also increased speed and better selection for our customers continues to grow internationally as well. In our emerging countries, we're pleased with the progress we're making there. We've launched 8 countries, of course, in the last 5 years. And there are all varying degrees of upfront investment in different point in times in their journey to profitability, but they're all making very nice improvements quarter- over-quarter in growing selection, adding prime members and expanding our customer offerings. So I think what you're saying, again, is sustained improvement in those areas. I feel very good about it. The established countries are continuing to grow and develop and very much look like the United States and the emerging countries, again, are all very different stages of growth right now."
AMZN,2025-07-31,2025-08-01,,2025-07-31,2025-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-31,qa,,Andrew R. Jassy,"On the Project Kuiper question, so Project Kuiper's or low Earth orbit satellite constellation that we're putting up and launching and there's 400 million to 500 million households worldwide who don't have broadband connectivity. And it means they can't do a lot of things we take for granted, like education online or business online or shopping or entertainment. There is really a digital divide, and it's much needed. And it's also true for enterprises and for governments that they have assets or needs to have visibility or connectivity that they can't get today given the lack of broadband and a bunch of places around the world. So there's a high need. I would say that as we get our constellation into space, there will really be 2 players that have what I would consider the modern technology in low Earth orbit satellite. One is the incumbent in the market today and the second will be Project Kuiper. I think that we will have a pretty meaningful differentiation here in performance. If you look at the performance of what I expect on the uplink and downlink, I think Project Kuiper will be advantaged. I also think the pricing is going to be very compelling for customers. And then I think if you think about the 3 key customer segments who want low Earth orbit satellite, consumers enterprises and governments. We have very strong relationships with all 3 customer segments given our consumer businesses and our AWS business, and I think if you think about enterprises and governments, a lot of what they want to do when they take the data down from space as they actually want to put it into a cloud to do analysis, analytics and AI and various operations on top of it. And the fact that Project Kuiper and AWS are so seamlessly connected is very attractive to enterprises and to governments. And I'm kind of amazed we haven't launched Project Kuiper yet. But the number of enterprise and government agreements that have been signed already to use Project Kuiper is impressive. So we're working very hard to get the satellites into space. We have some delays with some of the rocket providers, but we have most of the available rocket launches over the next couple of years and were very helpful to get the service into commercial -- into commercial data later this year or early next year."

So there is a Wall Street finance person narrative right now, that AWS is falling behind in GenAI with concerns about share loss to peers, et cetera. Can you just sort of address that? What is your rebuttal to that? And talk to us about your and the team's most important focal points. Just to ensure that AWS stays on the nice edge of innovation versus hyperscaler peers? And then secondly, I know AWS is a big business. But is there any reason to assume it shouldn't accelerate in the back half and into '26 given the size of the opportunity and all of the GenAI capabilities that are going to sort of come to us in the next 12 months?"
AMZN,2025-07-31,2025-08-01,,2025-07-31,2025-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-31,qa,,Andrew R. Jassy,"Yes. So on the first one around AI. The first thing I would say is that I think it is so early right now in AI. If you look at what's really happening in the space, you have -- it's very top heavy. So you have a small number of very large frontier models that are being trained that spend a lot on computing, a couple of which are being trained on top of AWS and others are being trained elsewhere. And then you also have, I would say, a relatively small number of very large-scale generative AI applications. The one category would be chatbots with the largest by a fair bit being ChatGPT, but the other category being really, I'll call it, coding agents. So these are companies like Cursor, Vercel, Lovable and some of the companies like that. Again, several of which run significant chunks on top of AWS. And then you've got a very large number of generative AI applications that are in pilot mode -- or they're in pilots or that are being developed as we speak and a very substantial number of agents that also people are starting to try to build and figure out how to get into production in a broad way, but they're all -- they're quite early. And many of them that are out there are they're significant, but they're just smaller in terms of usage relative to some of those top heavy applications I mentioned earlier. We have a very significant number of enterprises and startups who are running applications on top of AWS' AI services and then -- but they're all -- again, like the amount of usage and the expansiveness of the use cases and how much people are putting them into production and the number of agents that are going to exist. It's still just earlier stage than it's going to be and so then when you think about what's going to matter in AI, what's going to -- what are customers going to care about when they're thinking about what infrastructure use, I think you kind of have to look at the different layers of the stack. And I think for those that are -- both building models, but also just -- if you look at where the real costs are, they're going to ultimately be an inference today, so much of the cost in training because customers are really training their models and trying to figure out to get the applications into production. But at scale, 80% to 90% of the cost will be an inference because you only train periodically, but you're spinning out predictions and inferences all the time. And so what they're going to care a lot about is they're going to care about the compute and the hardware they're using. And we have a very deep partnership with NVIDIA and will for as long as I can foresee, but we saw this movie in the CPU space with Intel, where customers are anchoring for better price performance. And so we built just like in the CPU space, where we built our own custom silicon and building Graviton which is about 40% more price performance than the other leading x86 processors. We've done the same thing on the custom silicon side in AI with Trainium and our second version of Trainium2 is really -- it's become the backbone of Anthropic's next Claude models they're training on top of, and it's become the backbone of Bedrock and the inference that we do. So I think a lot of the inference, it's about 30% and 40% better price performance than the other GPU providers out there right now, and we're already working on our third version of Trainium as well. So I think a lot of the compute and the inference is going to ultimately be run on top of Trainium2. And I think that, that price performance is going to matter to people as they get to scale. Then I would say that middle layer of the stack are really -- it's a combination of services that customers care about to be able to build models and then to be able to leverage existing leading frontier models and then build high-quality generative AI applications that do inference at scale. And we see it for people building models, they continue to use SageMaker AI very expansively, and then Bedrock, when you're leveraging leading frontier models is also growing very substantially. And as I said in my opening comments, the number of agents of scale is still really small in the scheme of what's going to be the case, but part of the problem is it's actually hard to actually build agents. And it's hard to deploy these agents in a secure and scalable way. And so I think the launches we made recently in strands that make it much easier to build agents and then AgentCore that make it much easier to deploy at scale and in a secure way are being very well received and customers are excited is going to change what's possible on the agent side. And then I think that it's -- you've got a very large number. I mean, remember, 85% to 90% of the global IT spend is still on-premises. If you believe that equation is going to flip, which I do, and we do. You have a lot of legacy infrastructure that you've got to move. These are mainframes. These are VMware's instances and when we build agents like AWS Transform to make it much easier to move mainframe to the cloud, much easier to move VMware to the cloud, much easier to move .NET windows to .NET Linux to save money, those are compelling for enterprises or things like Kiro that allow customers to develop in a much easier way and in a much more structured way, which is why I think people are excited about it. So I think I really like the inputs and the set of services that we're building in the AI space today. Customers really like them and it's resonating with them. I still think it's very early days in AI and in terms of adoption. But the other thing I would just say is that. Remember, because we're at a stage right now where so much of the activity is training and figuring out how to get your generative AI applications into production. People aren't paying as close attention as they will and making sure that those generative AI applications are operating where the rest of their data and infrastructure. Remember, a lot of generative AI inference is just going to be another building block like compute, storage and database. And so people are going to actually want to run those applications close to where the other applications are running, where their data is. There's just so many more applications and data running in AWS than anywhere else. And I'm very optimistic about as we get to a bigger scale what's going to happen to AWS on the AI side. And I think we have a set of services that is unique top to bottom in the stack. I think on the last part about what do we expect with respect to acceleration, we don't give guidance by segment. So I'm not going to try and give you guidance. But I do believe that the combination of more enterprises who have resumed their march to modernize their infrastructure and move from on-premises to the cloud, coupled with the fact that AI is going to accelerate in terms of more companies deploying more AI applications into production that start to scale, coupled with the fact that I do think that more capacity is going to come online in the coming months and quarters, make me optimistic about the AWS business."

AMZN,2025-07-31,2025-08-01,,2025-07-31,2025-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-31,qa,,Ronald Victor Josey,"That was really helpful. Maybe taking that same question, but focusing internally on Amazon, I think you penned an article or a blog post back in June, just talking about the ability or potential with GenAI agents and improving efficiencies and speed to market internally. So would love to hear your thoughts as you think about how Amazon is adopting generative AI internally, how perhaps you've seen improving speed to market as a result of everything you've just talked about."
AMZN,2025-07-31,2025-08-01,,2025-07-31,2025-07-31T17:00:00-04:00,0,2025-07-31,qa,,Andrew R. Jassy,"Yes. I think that AI is the biggest technology transformation for a lifetime, which is saying a lot because even in some of our relatively short lifetimes, we've been through the cloud, mobile and the Internet itself. But I think it's going to be the biggest transformation technically in our lifetime. And I think it's going to not only change every customer experience that we know and enable customer experience we really only dreamed about before, but it's also going to change very substantially the way we work. And if you think about it, the way that we do coding, the way that we do analytics, the way that we do research, the way that we do finance and measure -- I mean, really, the way we do business process automation, the way we do customer service. Every single area that I can think of in the way we work is likely going to be impacted in some meaningful way by AI. And I think when you have a big shift like that, you have 2 macro choices. You can either decide that you're going to embrace it. And you're going to help shape it and you're going to figure out how to build the right tools to allow you to take advantage of the technology or you can wish it away and have it shape you. And the posting that you're referencing, Ron, that I made was just really being clear with the team that we're going to pursue that former approach. We are going to embrace it. We're going to try and shape it. So we have a number of tools and agents that we've built already inside the company. These are things like if you think about Kiro and the opportunity to have coding agents do a lot of a coding that's very compelling. It's going to allow our teammates to be able to start from a more advanced starting spot and to be able to invent for customers much more quickly and much more expansively. If you think about services like Connect, which is our AWS service, it does call center software that has a lot of AI built into it that changes the productivity of all your customer service agents. And you can just imagine across the board, the types of things we're going to do to make it easier to get software out to build high- quality software to do operations to automate a lot of the business process coordination that happens inside the kind. We're going to work on a whole bunch of those areas to allow ourselves primarily to be able to invent for customers much more quickly and expansively. But also, I think it's going to make all of our teammates jobs much more enjoyable because they won't have to do as many of the road parts of the job that we all do right now, and they're going to be able to own more pieces of what they're trying to solve for customers. And we want deep owners that want to own as much end-to-end as possible."

I know you won't say whether AWS is expected to accelerate. But could you talk about some of the drivers and what kind of tariff and other contingencies you've put in there? And then maybe any thoughts on how you're thinking about how the Q4 is shaping up.

And we -- excuse me, $179.5 billion is a typo. We feel good about the growth rate in Q2 that we had and the acceleration in a number of areas, including units. And we had a very successful Prime Day earlier this month. So there is uncertainty on where tariffs will settle and maybe the ultimate impact on consumers, as Andy mentioned earlier. But we feel really good about the key inputs we control price selection and convenience. We've talked about delivery speeds increasing. We've talked about selection increasing high-end stock levels, well dispersed inventory close to customers. So we think that all works in our favor. So I would say we're cautiously optimistic I'm not going to give any guidance for Q4 at this time, but we'll talk about that next time."

Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated. All comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2024. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 30, 2025 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears; inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce cloud services and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Andy."
AMZN,2025-10-30,2025-10-31,,2025-10-30,2025-10-30T00:00:00-04:00,0,2025-10-30,prepared,,Andrew Jassy,"Thanks, Dave. We saw strong growth across our business in Q3, and we're reporting $180.2 billion in revenue, up 12% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $17.4 billion, but would have been over $21 billion, if not for 2 special Q3 expenses, $2.5 billion for an FTC settlement and $1.8 billion for estimated severance costs. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $14.8 billion. I'll start with AWS. AWS is growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022, reaccelerating to 20.2% year-over-year, our largest growth rate in 11 quarters. It's worth remembering that year-over-year percentage growth is a relative term. It's very different having 20% year-over-year growth on a $132 billion annualized run rate and to have a higher percentage growth rate on a meaningfully smaller annual revenue, which is the case with our competitors. Backlog grew to $200 billion by Q3 quarter end and doesn't include several unannounced new deals in October, which together or more than our total deal volume for all of Q3. AWS is gaining momentum. Customers want to be running their core and AI workloads in AWS given its stronger functionality, security and operational performance and the scale I see in front of us gives me significant confidence in what lies ahead. I'll share a little more detail on why. It starts with AWS having much broader infrastructure functionality. Start-ups, enterprises and governments want to move their production workloads to the place that has the broadest and deepest array of capabilities. AWS has more services and deeper features within those services than anybody else and continues to innovate at a rapid clip. These are key building blocks for anything that customers want to create, and they're a big part of why Gartner has named AWS leader in its strategic cloud platform services Magic Quadrant for 15 consecutive years. We're bringing the same building block approach to AI. SageMaker makes it much simpler for companies to build and deploy their own foundation models. Bedrock gives customers leading selection of foundation models and superior price performance to deploy inference into their next-generation applications. A lot of the future value companies will get from AI will be in the form of agents. AWS is heavily investing in this area and well positioned to be a leader. Companies will both create their own agents and use agents from other companies. For those building their own, it's been harder to build than it should be. It's why we launched strands to make it much easier to create agents from any foundation model that builders desire. For companies who successfully built agents, they've hesitated putting them into production because they lack secure scalable runtime services or memory or observability built specifically for agents. It's why we launched AgentCore, a set of infrastructure building blocks that allow builders to deploy secure, scalable agents. Ericsson used AgentCore to deliver AI agents across their workforce, Sony used it to build a agentic AI platform with enterprise-level security, observability and scalability. And Cohere Health is using AgentCore to deploy agents that will reduce medical review times by up to 30% to 40%.  AgentCore's SDK has already been downloaded over 1 million times, and our builders are excited about it. It's an enabler. Companies will also use other agents, and AWS continues to build many of the agents we believe builders will use in the future. For coding, we've recently opened up our agentic coding IDE called Kiro. More than 100,000 developers jumped into Kiro in just the first few days of preview and that number has more than doubled since. It's processed trillions of tokens thus far, weekly actives are growing fast, and developers love its unique spec and tool call and capabilities. For migration and transformation, we offer an agent called Transform. Year-to-date, customers have already used it to save 700,000 hours of manual effort. The equivalent of 335 developer years of work. For example, Thomson Reuters used it to transform 1.5 million lines of code per month, moving from Windows to open source alternatives and completing tasks or a times faster than with other migration tools. Customers have also already used Transform to analyze nearly 1 billion lines of mainframe code as they move mainframe applications to the cloud. For business customers, we've recently launched QuickSleep to bring a consumer AI-like experience to work, making it easy to find insights, conduct deep research, automate tasks, visualize data and take actions. We've already seen users churn months long projects in today's get 80% plus time savings on complex tasks and realize 90% plus cost savings. And for contact centers, we offer Amazon Connect which creates a more personalized and efficient experience for contact center agents, managers and their customers. Connect has recently crested $1 billion annualized revenue run rate with 12 billion minutes of customer interactions being handled by AI in the last year and is being used by large enterprises like Capital One, Toyota, American Airlines and Ryanair. These are real practical results for customers, and there are many more examples like them. Because of its advantaged capabilities, security, operational performance and customer focus, AWS continues to earn most of the big enterprise and government transformations to the cloud. As a result, AWS is where the preponderance of company's data and workloads reside and part of why most companies want to run AI and AWS. To enable customers to do so, we need to have the requisite capacity, and we've been focused on accelerating capacity the last several months, adding more than 3.8 gigawatts of power in the past 12 months, more than any other cloud provider. To put that into perspective, we're now double the power capacity that AWS was in 2022, and we're on track to double again by 2027. In the last quarter of this year alone, we expect to add at least another 1 gigawatt of power. This capacity consists of power, data center and chips, primarily our custom silicon, Trainium and NVIDIA. We've recently brought Project Rainier Online, our massive AI compute cluster spanning multiple U.S. data centers and containing nearly 500,000 of our Trainium2 chips. Anthropic is using it now to build and deploy its industry-leading AI model, Claude, which we expect to be on more than 1 million Trainium2 chips by year-end. Trainium2 continues to see strong adoption, is fully subscribed is now a multibillion-dollar business that grew 150% quarter-over-quarter. Today, Trainium is being used by a small number of very large customers but we expect to accommodate more customers starting with Trainium3. We're building Bedrock to be the biggest inference engine in the world and in the long run, believe Bedrock could be as big a business for AWS as EC2, and the majority of token usage in Amazon Bedrock is already running on Trainium. We're also continuing to work closely with chip partners like NVIDIA, with whom we continue to order very significant amounts as well as with AMD and Intel. These are very important partners with whom we expect to keep growing our relationships over time. You're going to see us continue to be very aggressive in investing in capacity because we see the demand. As fast as we're adding capacity right now, we're monetizing it. It's still quite early and represents an unusual opportunity for customers in AWS. I'll now turn to stores. Where the team continues to deliver and innovate for customers across our key priorities, selection, low prices and convenience, particularly fast delivery, we're offering 14% more selection since last quarter from popular brands like The North Face and Charlotte Tilbury, and we've added hundreds of thousands of items from popular brands this year. Everyday Essentials continues to grow quickly, and year-to-date is growing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the business. We continue to make it easier for customers to order low-priced perishable groceries from Amazon, and customers in more than 1,000 cities and towns now can shop fresh groceries alongside millions of Amazon.com products with free same-day delivery. This is a game changer for customers who can now order milk alongside electronics, check out with one cart and have everything delivered to their doorstep within hours. The team also invented a new add to delivery button that lets customers add items to previously scheduled orders and it's been used more than 80 million times since launch, and it's just launch. It's an example of one of those seemingly simple but powerful innovations that make customers' lives easier. We remain committed to staying sharp on price and meeting or beating prices of other major retailers. In July, we had our biggest Prime Day event ever, with customers saving billions of dollars across more than 35 categories. We continue to break records on speed. We're on track to deliver at our fastest speeds ever for Prime members globally once again this year, and we've started rolling out 3-hour delivery in select U.S. cities. We're also continuing to invest in infrastructure to speed up rural deliveries and serve more customers in more communities. That includes committing over $4 billion to expand our rural delivery network across the U.S. These are small towns where people want fast delivery, but where other companies have been backing out and reducing service. In contrast, we've already increased the number of rural communities with access to our same-day and next-day delivery by 60%, reaching roughly half of the total communities we plan to expand to by the end of the year. The stores team is also innovating rapidly with AI. For example, Rufus, our AI-powered shopping assistant has had 250 million active customers this year with monthly users up 140% year-over-year, interactions up 210% year-over-year and customers using Rufus during a shopping trip being 60% more likely to complete a purchase. Rufus is on track to deliver over $10 billion in incremental annualized sales. Here are the highlights. Our generative AI-powered audio feature that combines product summaries and reviews to make shopping easier has expanded from hundreds of products at launch to millions of products and millions of customers have used it streaming almost 3 million minutes. In Amazon Lens, an AI-powered visual search tool that lets customers find products with their phones camera, a screenshot or a bar code, now includes Lens Live, which instantly scans products and shows real-time matches in a swipeable carousel. Tens and millions of customers are using Amazon Lens each month. Moving on to Amazon ads. We're pleased with the continued strong growth, generating $17.6 billion of revenue in the quarter and growing 22% year-over-year. We see strength across our broad portfolio of full photo advertising offerings that helps advertisers reach an average ad-supported audience of more than $300 million in the U.S. alone. We also continue to be excited about our demand side platform, Amazon DSP, which lets advertisers plan, activate and measure full funnel investments. Last quarter, I mentioned our partnership with Roku and we've built on that with a partnership with Netflix, providing advertisers using Amazon DSP with direct access to Netflix's premium ad inventory. We announced integrations with Spotify and SiriusXM. With Spotify, we provide advertisers with direct programmatic access to a global audience of more than 400 million monthly ad-supported listeners. And with SiriusXM, brands can reach 160 million monthly digital listeners across services like Pandora and SoundCloud and we're excited about the advertising opportunity around prime video live sports. Live sports got a lot of interest from advertisers in upfront negotiations for 2025, '26, and we exceeded our own expectations for upfront commitments with significant growth across the board. Finally, we're continuing to invade for advertisers with AI. For example, in September, we announced an agentic AI tool and creative studio that plans and executes the entire creative process in a matter of hours instead of weeks. We're also inventing and seeing strong momentum in several other areas, and I'll mention just a few. In Prime Video live sports, NBA on Prime tipped off last week and our opening night doubleheader averaged 1.25 million viewers in the U.S., a double-digit increase over last season on cable. You'll see us bring the same constant innovation here that we brought to our NFL broadcast. We're adding golf with The Masters in 2026 and new skins competition with the PGA Tour on Black Friday this year. And we've added Peacock and FOX One to Prime Videos add-on subscription offering of over 100 channels in the U.S. We continue to be energized by the response to Alexa+ compared to what we call the classic Alexa experience, Alexa+ customers are talking to Alexa 2x more. Those interactions are much longer, and they're covering a broader range of topics. So using Alexa+ and Fire TV at 2.5x the rate of classic using natural conversation to discover audio content 4x more, engaging with photos 4x more and customers are completing 4x more shopping conversations that end in a purchase. We've expanded the number of project hyper satellites and space to more than 150 and delivered over 1 gigabit per second speeds and test with our enterprise-grade customer terminal, the first commercial phased array we know of to clear that threshold. Finally, Zoox robotaxis are available to riders in Las Vegas, and we've announced Washington, D.C. as the eighth testing location. We're excited for these to continue rolling out to more riders. Q4 is one of our busiest and most energizing times of the year, and we're excited about the continued demand for AWS. The innovations will announce the reinvent in December, the positive customer response to our AI-powered experiences, all the guests will be delivering throughout the holiday season and a lot more. Thanks in advance to our teammates around the world who are gearing up to deliver for customers once again. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update."
AMZN,2025-10-30,2025-10-31,,2025-10-30,2025-10-30T00:00:00-04:00,0,2025-10-30,prepared,,Brian Olsavsky,"Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $180.2 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year, excluding a 90 basis point favorable impact of foreign exchange. In Q3, we reported worldwide operating income of $17.4 billion. This operating income includes 2 special charges, which reduced operating income by $4.3 billion. The first charge of $2.5 billion is related to a legal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which impacts the North America segment and is recorded in the other operating expense line. The second charge of $1.8 billion relates to severance costs for roll eliminations and impacts all 3 of our segments. The severance charge is recorded primarily in the technology and infrastructure, sales and marketing and general and administrative expense line items. Excluding these 2 charges, worldwide operating income would have been $21.7 billion or $1.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range. Moving to our segment results. We remain encouraged by the innovation our teams are delivering for customers across all 3 segments. In the North America segment, third quarter revenue was $106.3 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. International segment revenue was $40.9 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units grew 11% year-over-year. We continue to prioritize the inputs that matter most to our customers. In the third quarter, our sharp pricing, broad selection and fast delivery speeds continue to resonate with customers. Customers appreciate the ability to quickly receive items essential for their daily needs, including perishable groceries and have them delivered in the same day. Our millions of global third-party sellers continue to be important contributors to our vast selection, which helps customers find the items they need at competitive prices. We're committed to building innovative services and features for our sellers, including our ongoing advancements in generative AI. Today, more than 1.3 million sellers have used our generative AI capabilities to more quickly launch high-quality listings. Better listings translate into better traction with customers. And in Q3, worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 62%, up 200 basis points from Q3 of last year. Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $4.8 billion, with an operating margin of 4.5%. Excluding the $2.5 billion charge related to the legal settlement with the FTC, North America segment operating income would have been $7.3 billion with an operating margin of 6.9%. North America segment operating margin also includes a portion of the severance charge. International segment operating income was $1.2 billion, with an operating margin of 2.9%. Excluding the impact of the severance charge International segment operating margins expanded year-over-year. Globally, our progress on key inputs is delivering a better customer experience while driving a more efficient cost structure. For example, we're making notable strides in improving inventory placement to speed up delivery to customers. And as a result, for the third year in a row, we are on track to deliver our fastest speeds ever for Prime members in 2025. We continue to tune and improve our fulfillment operations and our regionalized network is operating at scale. We see many benefits of our inbound process improvements, including a reduction of U.S. inbound lead time by nearly 4 days compared to last year. This allows us to be more efficient with our inventory purchasing, which benefits working capital. We're also placing inventory more strategically throughout the network. And by leveraging our existing infrastructure, we're now offering U.S. customers the ability to order perishable groceries and receive them the same day and as little as 5 hours. We're seeing positive early results since launching in January, when customers start shopping groceries on Amazon, they are visiting the site more often and returning twice as often as nonperishable shoppers. Looking ahead, we see further opportunity to improve our activity in our global fulfillment and transportation network. We continue to improve inventory placement to drive down distance travel and touches for package. We will also build on the gains from our regionalized network through algorithmic improvements as well as launching robotics and automation. Operating margin may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we have a delivered approach to achieve sustained progress over the long term. Shifting to advertising. Advertising revenue was $17.7 billion and growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. We continue to see strong growth on an increasingly large base, as our full funnel advertising approach of connecting brands with customers is resonating. Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $33 billion, up 20.2% year-over-year. This is an acceleration of 270 basis points compared to last quarter, driven by strong growth across both our AI and core services and more capacity, which has come online to support customer demand. AWS revenue increased $2.1 billion quarter-over-quarter and now has an annualized revenue run rate of $132 billion. AWS operating income was $11.4 billion, and reflects our continued growth, coupled with our focus on driving efficiencies across the business. We are expanding our data center footprint, largely to accommodate Gen AI. And to the extent those assets were placed into service related to depreciation does impact our margins. As we've long said, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. Now turning to our cash CapEx, which was $34.2 billion in Q3. We've now spent $89.9 billion so far this year. This primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI and core services and in custom silicon, like Trainium as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. We'll continue to make significant investments, especially in AI, as we believe it to be a massive opportunity with the potential for strong returns on invested capital over the long term. Additionally, we continue to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support the growth of the business, improve delivery speeds and lower our cost to serve. These investments will support growth for many years to come. Looking ahead, we expect our full year cash CapEx to be approximately $125 billion in 2025, and we expect that amount will increase in 2026. I'll finish up my remarks with net income. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, our third quarter net income of $21.2 billion includes a pretax gain of $9.5 billion related to our investment in Anthropic. This investment activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations and is included in nonoperating income. We're encouraged by the start of the peak season and we are ready to serve customers in the coming months. I want to thank our teams across Amazon for their hard work as we get ready to delight customers during the holiday season. Our commitment to elevating the customer experience is the only reliable way to drive sustainable value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions."

AMZN,2025-10-30,2025-10-31,,2025-10-30,2025-10-30T00:00:00-04:00,0,2025-10-30,qa,,Justin Post,"I'll ask on AWS. Can you just kind of go through how you're feeling about your capacity levels and how capacity constrained you are right now? And then in your prepared remarks, you mentioned Trainium3 demand and maybe broadening out your customer base. Can you talk about the demand you're seeing outside of your major customers for Trainium?"
AMZN,2025-10-30,2025-10-31,,2025-10-30,2025-10-30T00:00:00-04:00,0,2025-10-30,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes. On the capacity side, we brought in quite a bit of capacity, as I mentioned in my opening comments, 3.8 gigawatts of capacity in the last year with another gigawatt plus coming in the fourth quarter and we expect to double our overall capacity by the end of 2027. So we're bringing in quite a bit of capacity today, overall in the industry, maybe the bottleneck is power. I think at some point, it may move to chips, but we're bringing in quite a bit of capacity. And as fast as we're bringing in right now, we are monetizing it. And then on the Trainium demand, outside of our major customers. So first of all, as I mentioned on Trainium2, it's really doing well. It's fully subscribed on Trainium2. We have -- it's a multibillion-dollar business at this point. It grew 150% quarter-over-quarter in revenue. And you see really big projects at scale now, like our Project Rainier that we're doing with Anthropic, where they're running their next version of -- they're training the next version of Claude on top of Trainium2 on 500,000 Trainium2 chips going to 1 million Trainium2 chips by the end of the year. As I mentioned, we have -- today, with Trainium2, we have a small number of very large customers on it. But because Trainium is 30% to 40% more price performance than other options out there, and because as customers, as they start to contemplate broader scale of their production workloads, moving to being AI-focused and using inference, they badly care about price performance. And so we have a lot of demand for Trainium. Trainium3 should preview at the end of this year with much fuller volumes coming in the beginning of '26, we have a lot of customers, both very large, and I'll call it, medium-sized who're quite interested in Trainium3."

AMZN,2025-10-30,2025-10-31,,2025-10-30,2025-10-30T00:00:00-04:00,0,2025-10-30,qa,,Brian Nowak,"Congrats on the quarter, guys. So maybe 2. One, Andy, sort of a philosophical chip question. There's a lot of questions in the market about Trainium and sort of its positioning versus other third-party chips. So how do you think about the key hurdles of Trainium3 need to overcome to really make Trainium adoption broader, to your point on the last question and continue to drive Trainium as opposed to satisfying what could be broader demand with third-party chips in the near term?"
AMZN,2025-10-30,2025-10-31,,2025-10-30,2025-10-30T00:00:00-04:00,0,2025-10-30,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes. Well, first of all, we're always going to have multiple chip options for our customers. It's been true in every major technology building block or component that we've had in AWS. Really in the history of AWS, it's never just one player that over a long period of time has the entire market segment and then can satisfy everybody's needs on every dimension. And so we have a very deep relationship with NVIDIA. We have for a very long time. And we will for as long as I can foresee the future. We buy a lot of NVIDIA. We are not constrained in any way in buying NVIDIA, and I expect that we'll continue to buy more NVIDIA both next year and in the future. But we're different from most technology companies in that we have our own very strong chip team, and this is our Annapurna team. And you saw it first on the CPU side with what we built with Graviton which is about 40% better price performance than the other x86 processors, and you're seeing it again on the custom silicon on the AI side with Trainium, which is about the same amount of price performance benefit for customers relative to other GPU options. And our customers to be able to use AI as expansively as they want. And remember, it's still relatively early days at this point. They're going to need better price performance and they care about it deeply. And so I mentioned earlier the momentum that Trainium2 has. And I think that for us, as we think about Trainium3, I expect Trainium3 will be about 40% better than Trainium2 and Trainium2 is already very advantaged on price performance. So we have to, of course, deliver the chip. We have to deliver it in volumes and deliver it quickly. And we have to continue to work on the software ecosystem, which gets better all the time. And as we have more proof points like we have with Project Rainier with what Anthropic's doing on Trainium2, it builds increasing credibility for Trainium. And I think customers are very bullish about it. I'm bullish about it as well."

But can you just talk a little bit about the architecture of Project Rainier and how it's differentiated and what that means for customers and for AWS? And do you expect Rainier to expand beyond Anthropic? And how do you replicate Rainier with Trainium3 chips?"
AMZN,2025-10-30,2025-10-31,,2025-10-30,2025-10-30T00:00:00-04:00,0,2025-10-30,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes. I think what is compelling for entropic around Project Rainier is really is the Trainium2 chip, which we built a very -- first of all, we built a very large cluster that they can use in a very expansive way. And it's not simple to be able to build a cluster that has 500,000 plus chips going to 1 million. That's an infrastructure feet that's hard to do at scale. And so some piece of it is the infrastructure capabilities that we've built over a long period of time in AWS that is unusual in the industry. But it's just also the performance of the chip and the price performance, both of which matter. And I think that Project Rainier is something that is specific for anthropic, but we have a lot of other customers who are interested in employing large clusters of Trainium chips that we're going to hopefully give them a chance to do so with Trainium3."

And on groceries, I want to -- the perishables, I think last quarter, you talked about 70% or something of users had never purchased from perishables from Amazon before. Just talk about whether you -- I think you used the term, Game Changer, before. Does this mean that maybe we don't -- you no longer need to Amazon Fresh stores. You always had this DVD delivery van density advantage. And have you kind of reached a point you think of scale and speed that you really can change people habit and really have them consider Amazon as one of their first grocery options? Do you really feel like you're at that point? And then secondly, just on the head count, some of the recent news. Just talk to us about how you think about head count going forward? Are you seeing -- is the level of efficiencies that you're getting from AI such that you can keep head count relatively flattish for the foreseeable future? Just talk about the pros and cons or the wins and losses in terms of that head count going forward?"
AMZN,2025-10-30,2025-10-31,,2025-10-30,2025-10-30T00:00:00-04:00,0,2025-10-30,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"Yes. So I'll start with grocery, Mark. We have a very large grocery business. If you look at our entire grocery business, if I don't even count Whole Foods Market and Fresh, in the last 12 months to over $100 billion of gross merchandising sales, which would make us a top 3 grocery in the U.S. A good chunk of it is a lot of the items that you'd find in the middle aisle so consumables and canned goods and pet food and health and beauty, very significant and continues to grow at a very good clip. But then we also have Whole Foods Market, which is the pioneer in organic foods, which is also growing at a faster clip than most grocery companies with an attractive trajectory on profitability, and we'll expand our Whole Foods physical presence over the coming years here. And I'm also very excited about this new concept, daily shop that we have, which is a smaller version of Whole Foods in urban settings, which we have 3 that we've launched that are off to very good starts that you should expect to see more of as well. And we have always been -- as you referenced, we've talked a lot about having a larger mass physical presence. And we continue to experiment with various formats. But the one that we are most excited about is what you referenced, which is the ability to provide perishable groceries with same-day deliveries. And if you think about how many of our customers are buying from us multiple times a week and who are buying things like shampoo or detergent or paper cups or water, where the ability to add milk and eggs and yogurt and other perishables to their order and have it live in the same shop in cart and then show up a few hours later, is very compelling. And we started with a few markets about a year ago, and we were really taken aback at the adoption, not just the number of people that started buying perishables from us very quickly but how often they came back downstream to buy perishables and groceries from us in the future. And so we've now expanded that to 1,000 cities around the U.S. and will be in 2,300 by the end of the year. And it's really changing the trajectory and the size of our grocery business. And I also believe that this many years tradition of the weekly stock up grocery stock up is changing. And I think we're a big part of that. And I think there's a lot of potential there for the grocery side. It doesn't mean that we won't continue to experiment with other physical formats, but we're on to something very significant with what we're doing with perish both from our same-day facilities. And then on your head count question, what I would tell you is the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now, at least. It really -- its culture. And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers. And when that happens, sometimes without realizing that you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who own most of the 2-way door decisions, the ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line, and it can lead to slowing you down. And as a leadership team, we are committed to operating like the world's largest start-up. And that means removing layers. It means increasing the amount of ownership that people have, and it means inventing and moving quickly. And I don't know if there's ever been a time in the history of Amazon or maybe business in general with the technology transformation happening right now, where it's important to be lean, it's important to be flat, and it's important to move fast, and that's what we're going to do."

And how should we be thinking about that as a driver of potential efficiencies, but also as a driver of the ability to possibly reinvest back in the business over the long term?"

We have over 1 million robots in our fulfillment network at this point. And I would say that while that's significant, we have a lot of invention in flight. So I expect that we'll have more over a period of time. Robotics are very important for us and for our customers and for our teammates because they improve safety, they boost productivity, they increased speed, and they let our human teammates focused on problem solving and what they do best. And we expect that our people remain at the heart in the center of our fulfillment network as they have from when we first started working the robotics. And we expect that over time, we will have a fulfillment network where robots and humans complement each other and work together. But I think you're going to continue to see us advance invest very significantly in robotics. It's going to help on the safety, the productivity, the speed and ultimately some of the cost pieces, which will allow us to continue to improve the customer experience."

AMZN,2025-10-30,2025-10-31,,2025-10-30,2025-10-30T00:00:00-04:00,0,2025-10-30,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"I'm very excited about -- and as a business, we're very excited about in the long term the prospect of agentic commerce. And it has a chance to be good for customers has a chance to be really good for e-commerce. And I think if you're -- if you know what you want to buy, there are a few experiences that are better than coming to Amazon. But if you don't know what you want, it's a physical store with a physical salesperson still has some advantages. Obviously, lots of people do it on Amazon all the time. But you very often want to ask questions and help get help narrowing what you're going to look for. And as you keep asking new questions, having a whole bunch of different options presented to you. And I think AI and agentic commerce are going to change the experience online where that experience where you're narrowing what you want when you don't know is going to get better online than it even is in physical environments. Now we obviously have our own efforts here in agentic commerce. We have Rufus, which I talked about in my opening comments, which is continuing to get better and better and used more broadly. And we have features like Buy for Me where we will surface on Amazon, even items that we don't stock that other merchants have. And then if customers want us to go and buy it for them on those merchants websites, we will do that. And both of those have been successful for us. But we're also having conversations with and expect over time to partner with third-party agents. And I think that it reminds me in some ways of the beginning of search engines many years ago being sources of discovery for commerce. And you had to kind of figure out the right way to work together. And today, search engines are a very small part of our referral traffic and third-party agents are a very small subset of that. But I do think that we will find ways to partner. We have to find a way, though, that makes the customer experience good. Right now, I would say the customer experience is not -- there's no personalization. There's no shopping history. The delivery estimates are frequently wrong. The prices are often wrong. So we've got to find a way to make the customer experience better and have the right exchange value. But I do think that the exciting part of this and the promise is that AI and agentic commerce solutions are going to expand the amount of shopping that happens online. And I think that's really good for customers, and I think it's really good for Amazon because at the end of the day, you're going to buy from the outfit that allows you to have the broadest selection, great value and continues to deliver for you very quickly and reliably. And I think that bodes well for us."

AMZN,2025-10-30,2025-10-31,,2025-10-30,2025-10-30T00:00:00-04:00,0,2025-10-30,qa,,Colin Sebastian,"I guess first on AWS, following up there. How much of this acceleration is driven by core infrastructure versus AI workload monetization? And I think part of it is trying to understand how important newer services like AgentCore are becoming and bringing enterprises to AWS to build agents? And then I guess, secondly, regarding the acceleration in advertising, if you could potentially disaggregate the core advertising contribution versus DSP and Prime video. That would be helpful as well."
AMZN,2025-10-30,2025-10-31,,2025-10-30,2025-10-30T00:00:00-04:00,0,2025-10-30,qa,,Andrew Jassy,"I'll start on the AWS side, we are seeing -- we're really pleased with the results from this quarter, 20% year-over-year on a annualized run rate of $132 billion is unusual. And we have momentum. You can see it. And we see the growth in both our AI area, where we see it in inference. We see it in training. We see it in the use of our Trainium custom silicon. Bedrock continues to grow really quickly. SageMaker continues to grow quickly. And I think that the number of companies who are working on building agents is very significant. I do believe that a lot of the value that companies will realize over time and AI will come from agents. And I think that building agents today is still harder than it should be. You need tools to make it easier, which is why we built strands, which is an open source capability that lets people build agents from any model that they can imagine. But even more so, when you talk to enterprises or companies that care a lot about security and scale. They're starting to build agents, and they don't really feel like they've got -- they've had building blocks that allow them to have the type of secure scalable agents that they need to bet their businesses and their customer experience and their data. And that's why -- that was really the inspiration behind AgentCore was to build another set of primitive building blocks like we built in the early days of AWS, where it was compute and storage and database. We defined a set of building blocks that you needed to be able to deploy agents securely and scalably that we provide in AgentCore. And then when we talk to our customers, it really resonates. There is not anything else like it, it's changing their time frame and their receptivity to building agents, and it's very compelling for them. So I do think the combination of what we're doing to enable agents to be built and run securely and scalably as well as some of the agents that we're building ourselves that our customers are excited about are compelling for them. And I think the other place we see a lot of growth in AWS also is just the number of enterprises who are -- who have gotten back to moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. And we continue to earn the lion's share of those transformations. And I look at the momentum we have right now, and I believe that we can continue to grow at a clip like this for a while. I think on the advertising side, that is also an area where I think collectively, we feel very pleased about the progress. Every single one of our advertising offerings this quarter grew in a meaningful way. I think there's a few things going on for us. We have what I think of as a pretty unusual full funnel offering. And if you look at the top of the funnel, which typically tends to be awareness building and broad scale to be able to use our own Prime Video and our live sports capabilities as well as going all the way down to the bottom of the funnel at point of sale being able to use sponsored products, that's -- most people don't have a full funnel offering as robust as that. And then when you layer on top of it, the combination of the audience curation and development we can do, along with the advantage measurement, it just all leads to a return on advertising spend is very unusual. And I think there are multiple places where we can expect to continue to grow. One is in our stores business. I still think if you look at the worldwide market segment share of retail, still 80% to 85% of it lives in physical stores. And that equation is going to flip over time. And I think AI is going to only accelerate that. So I think we have an opportunity -- a significant opportunity still in our existing stores. And then I think video, we've only been at this for a little bit of time, but it's already a very large amount of advertising revenue, and we're still relatively early stage. I think that will continue to be a big area of growth. And then as you referenced, the amount -- their demand-side platform or Amazon DSP, that is growing really quickly as well. And some of it had to do with the fact that we had some features. We always had a number of the core components people wanted around some of our properties, the measurement capabilities, Amazon Marketing Cloud, but we lack some features for a while as we were building out our DSP that customers told us mattered and the team over the last 20 months have closed those gaps in a very significant way so that now people feel like our DSP is fully featured. And then you look at some of the partnerships that we've done, the Roku partnership gives us the largest connected TV footprint in the U.S. And you layer on top of that, what we've recently done in providing our DSP customers, the opportunity to integrate with the ad inventory in Netflix and Spotify and SiriusXM, it's powerful. And so we are growing very quickly on the demand side platform. So very optimistic about what we're doing there. We've continued work to do, obviously, but I don't think we're close to being able to grow there."
