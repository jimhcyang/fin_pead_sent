Consumer Health Consumer Health worldwide adjusted operational sales increased 3.9%* predominately driven by over-the-counter (OTC) products. Major contributors to growth in OTC were TYLENOL and MOTRIN analgesics, as well as upper respiratory products and digestive health products in the international markets. Additionally, Skin Health/Beauty adjusted operational growth was primarily driven by NEUTROGENA outside the U.S. Growth was partially offset by Oral Care in the international markets. Pharmaceutical Pharmaceutical worldwide adjusted operational sales grew 6.8%*, driven by DARZALEX (daratumumab), a biologic for the treatment of multiple myeloma, STELARA (ustekinumab), a biologic for the treatment of a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, ERLEADA (apalutamide), a next-generation androgen receptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer, TREMFYA (guselkumab), a biologic for the treatment of adults living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and for adults with active psoriatic arthritis, and INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA (paliperidone palmitate), long-acting, injectable atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. This growth was partially offset by declines in sales of REMICADE (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib), an oral, once daily therapy approved for use in treating certain B-cell malignancies, a type of blood or lymph node cancer, and ZYTIGA (abiratone acetate), an oral, once daily medication for use in combination with prednisone for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. MedTech MedTech worldwide adjusted operational sales grew 6.1%*, driven primarily by electrophysiology products in Interventional Solutions, contact lenses in Vision, and wound closure products in General Surgery.

Consumer Health Consumer Health worldwide adjusted operational sales increased 3.9%* predominately driven by over-the-counter (OTC) products. Major contributors to growth in OTC were TYLENOL and MOTRIN analgesics, as well as upper respiratory products and digestive health products in the international markets. Additionally, Skin Health/Beauty adjusted operational growth was primarily driven by NEUTROGENA outside the U.S. Growth was partially offset by Oral Care in the international markets. Pharmaceutical Pharmaceutical worldwide adjusted operational sales grew 6.8%*, driven by DARZALEX (daratumumab), a biologic for the treatment of multiple myeloma, STELARA (ustekinumab), a biologic for the treatment of a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, ERLEADA (apalutamide), a next-generation androgen receptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer, TREMFYA (guselkumab), a biologic for the treatment of adults living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and for adults with active psoriatic arthritis, and INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA (paliperidone palmitate), long-acting, injectable atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. This growth was partially offset by declines in sales of REMICADE (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib), an oral, once daily therapy approved for use in treating certain B-cell malignancies, a type of blood or lymph node cancer, and ZYTIGA (abiratone acetate), an oral, once daily medication for use in combination with prednisone for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. MedTech MedTech worldwide adjusted operational sales grew 6.1%*, driven primarily by electrophysiology products in Interventional Solutions, contact lenses in Vision, and wound closure products in General Surgery.
