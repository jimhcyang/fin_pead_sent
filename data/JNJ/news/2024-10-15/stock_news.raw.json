Sensitive or highly visible areas affected by PsO, including the scalp, face, skin folds and genitals, are considered \"special sites\" and can have significant impact on patients' daily lives, yet systemic treatment is infrequently provided and this group of patients remains largely undertreated.1 Data from the Phase 3b SPECTREM study, the first prospective, large-scale, randomized-controlled, double-blind clinical study to measure skin clearance and other treatment outcomes in low BSA moderate PsO with involvement across four special sites (scalp, face, skin folds and genitals) and previous topical treatment failure, were presented today at the 2024 Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference.",
