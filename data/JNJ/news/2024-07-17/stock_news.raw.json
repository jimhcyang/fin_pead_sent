Yuvanci® is a single tablet combination therapy of macitentan 10 mg and tadalafil 40 mg (M/T STCT) as a substitution therapy for the long-term treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients of WHO Functional Class (FC) II to III, who are already treated with the combination of macitentan and tadalafil given concurrently as separate tablets.1 PAH is a rare, progressive and life-threatening disease characterised by the constriction of small pulmonary arteries and elevated blood pressure (hypertension) in the pulmonary circulation that eventually leads to right heart failure and death.2 ,3 The 2022 European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS) pulmonary hypertension (PH) guidelines have strengthened recommendations on initial double combination therapy with macitentan and tadalafil for PAH patients without cardiopulmonary comorbidities.4 However, this requires patients to take multiple pills as no single tablet that targets two or more PAH-specific pathways is available for these patients in Europe.",
