This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our Company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 and our financial outlook for 2021. Joining me on today's call are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there's significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that results could change at any time and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business results and outlook is a best estimate, based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings including our 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. Alex will provide perspective on our overall results and business highlights for the year. I will review the fourth quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three business segments. Joe will conclude by providing insights about our cash position, capital allocation deployment, and our guidance for 2021. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 90 minutes. I would now turn the call over to Alex to share our overall results and business highlights.",375.0,197.0,3.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.015228426395939087,0.01015228426395939,0.04060913705583756,0.0,0.0,0.005076142131979695

And thank you everyone for taking time to join us today to discuss our full year 2020 results and outlook for 2021. At the start of last year, no one could have imagined just how drastically our lives were about to change because of a virus that would impact billions of people around the world. By any measure, 2020 was a year dominated by uncertainty, yet the pandemic also helped to clarify both our priorities and our values. And within Johnson & Johnson, it has illustrated the power and importance of our credo in guiding our actions to meet the needs of all our stakeholders. Now because of COVID-19, we now have a deeper appreciation on just how pivotal good health is to our safety, security, and prosperity as a society. We have a profound respect and gratitude for all the doctors, nurses, and hospital staff serving on the frontlines of care, for the everyday heroism of the essential workers who show up every day to keep the world's critical infrastructure up and running, and expectations that companies can and should help drive positive change in the society are higher than ever. As the world's largest and most broadly based global health care company, Johnson & Johnson was built for times like these. We've been leading through the world's biggest public health challenges for over a century. And today, our diversified businesses touch so many parts of people's lives. We had both the ability and the responsibility to act when the COVID-19 outbreak turned into a global pandemic. Within weeks of the DNA sequencing of the COVID-19 virus, Janssen scientists were working 24/7 to identify the most promising lead candidate for a vaccine. I'm proud of the progress of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and the fact that we moved so quickly while maintaining the highest level of science and safety standards. This is truly a remarkable accomplishment and a testament to the ingenuity and determination of our vaccine and supply chain teams. We look forward to sharing further details from our Phase 3 study by early next week. Additionally, I'm just as proud of the ways that each of my Johnson & Johnson colleagues have gone above and beyond the call of duty to provide uninterrupted access to our medicines, embrace radically new ways of working, and use the full breadth and depth of our expertise to deliver our important medicines and products to patients and consumers and support health care systems that have been overwhelmed by the pandemic. The fact that we've been able not just to weather this crisis but bring our broad-based capabilities to support this crisis and deliver on a shorter term top and bottom line business goals, while increasing our investments in innovation at record levels is a remarkable testament to our purpose-driven culture and the core strengths that characterize our Company for over a century; execution, innovation, and people. Our relentless focus on excellence and execution is key to meeting the needs of all our stakeholders today and tomorrow. The performance of our business in 2020 reflects the continued confidence from patients, physicians, customers, and consumers in our life-saving medicines and products. Our Pharmaceutical business performed well above market, kept pipeline submissions and approvals on track, and exceeded patient enrollment in clinical trials compared to 2019. Our Consumer Health business also performed above market for the year, and our Medical Devices business demonstrated resiliency and agility leading to a strong second half recovery. Our unparalleled scientific expertise allowed us to create life-enhancing innovation. Our R&D colleagues across Johnson & Johnson have continued to advance our robust pipeline of innovative and transformational new products. Of note, we initiated our U.S. filing for our BCMA Car-T in multiple myeloma in December. In addition, we filed amivantamab for the treatment of Exon 20 mutations in non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. and Europe. Our Medical Devices business has made strong progress advancing our pipeline, despite the pandemic, achieving and even accelerating certain key milestones throughout the year. As you heard from Ashley, Dr. Moll and the team at the Medical Devices Update in November, we are developing an end-to-end digital ecosystem across three robotics platforms, and we achieved a significant milestone this month receiving FDA clearance for our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution. We believe the industry is just starting to unlock the full potential and benefits of robotic and digital technologies. Johnson & Johnson is well-positioned to bring innovative, differentiated solutions to the surgery suite over the next 10, 20, and 30 years. I'm also very proud of the great work from our supply chain colleagues in driving improvements and efficiencies over the past year. Gartner even honored Johnson & Johnson with a number 3 ranking across all industries on its Annual 2020 Supply Chain Top 25 Index. That's up five spots from our 2019 ranking. Gartner also awarded Johnson & Johnson the number one spot on its 2020 Health care Supply Chain Top 25, citing our commitment to continuous improvement while putting innovation into practice, particularly in a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. And finally, we are powered by our people, purpose, and value system. More than 75 years since it was authored, our credo continues to guide all 135,000 of us at Johnson & Johnson. So, with that in mind, I want to highlight a recent appointment to our Board of Directors, an incredibly high honor awarded to one of our own directors. In December, Johnson & Johnson appointed retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General and former U.S. Army Surgeon General, Dr. Nadja West to our Board of Directors. Dr. West’s accomplished healthcare background in addition to her deep strategic leadership experience are strong additions to our Board of Directors. In October, Johnson & Johnson’s Board Director, Dr. Jennifer Doudna, along with her colleague, Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the revolutionary discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology, considered to be one of the most significant breakthroughs in molecular biology in the past decade. We are truly proud of her recognition for this incredible work. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in both, our workforce and the communities at which we serve has always been an important part of our culture. However, the past year has also shown a spotlight on the fact that we can all do more. To that end, I am proud of our Race to Health Equity platform launched in November. Our Race to Health Equity aims to help improve racial equity by eliminating health inequities for people of color and our $100 million commitment to invest in and promote health equity. I'm excited to be part of this progress and for Johnson & Johnson to play a part in impactful, lasting change. And most importantly, the talented and committed people at Johnson & Johnson drive our success by putting the patients and consumers we serve around the world at the forefront of all we do. We think and rely on them to continue to innovate, execute and focus on our shared purpose to deliver better health for everyone everywhere. I look forward to addressing your questions during the Q&A portion of the webcast. Right now, I'll turn the call over to Chris to share details related to our performance for the quarter. Thank you.

JNJ,2021-01-26,2021-01-26,,2021-01-26,2021-01-26T08:30:00-05:00,0,2021-01-26,qa,,Chris DelOrefice,"Thanks, Alex. Now, to recap the fourth quarter. Worldwide sales were $22.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 8.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.1% as currency had a positive impact of 1.2 points. In the U.S., sales increased 9.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 7%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 4.3% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 7.3% worldwide, 9.6% in the U.S. and 4.8% outside the U.S. As referenced on prior calls, I would like to remind everyone that our 2020 fiscal year included an additional week. Since this week occurred during a holiday period, it does not represent a full week of sales but rather a few more shipping days with these additional shipping days adding approximately 4 points to the quarterly sales growth rate and 1 point to the annual growth rate. This can be roughly applied across all segments. The additional sales were more heavily skewed to the U.S. For the enterprise, offsetting this sales benefit was the estimated negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, while these few shipping days added to sales, we also had a full week's worth of operating costs. Therefore, the impact to earnings was negligible. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $1.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $0.65 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.50 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.86, representing decreases of 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 3.2%. For the full year 2020, consolidated sales were $82.6 billion, an increase of 0.6% compared to the full year of 2019. Operationally, full year sales grew 1.2% with currency having a negative impact of 0.6 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 2.5%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year change was negative 1.3%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. declined by 0.2% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 1.1 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 1.5% worldwide, 2.8% in the U.S. and 0.2% outside the U.S. Net earnings for the full year 2020 were $14.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $5.51 versus diluted earnings per share of $5.63 a year ago. 2020 adjusted net earnings were $21.4 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $8.03, representing decreases of 8.1% and 7.5%, respectively, versus full year 2019. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased by 7.8%. Beginning with Consumer Health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the fourth quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. While not part of the prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2020 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models. Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.6 billion and grew 2% with growth in the U.S. of 2.7% and 1.5% outside of the U.S. Consumer Health delivered strong above-market growth due to our Oral Care, Wound Care and OUS Skin Health/Beauty businesses partially offset by the negative impact of COVID-19, primarily in our OTC business and the SKU rationalization program, which predominantly impacted Baby and Skin Health/Beauty outside the U.S. E-commerce growth continues to be strong across regions and franchises. Over-the-counter medicines had a decline of 1.5%. In the U.S., OTC sales were flat and the OUS declined by 2.9%. Globally, results were negatively impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, resulting in lower cough, cold and flu incidences, impacting children's TYLENOL, global cough and cold and digestive products. Offsetting these declines was strong adult TYLENOL market and share growth attributed to elevated demand, driven by COVID-19, ZYRTEC share growth, partially due to competitive out-of-stock and strong market growth in anti-smoking aids in EMEA. The Skin Health/Beauty franchise experienced recovery with a 2.6% increase, driven by strong performance of OGx due to share gains and OUS growth for Dr. Ci Labo, partially offset by NEUTROGENA declines as retailers carry less inventory, coupled with market declines, primarily in the makeup category due to fewer use occasions driven by COVID-19 restrictions and SKU rationalization. As consumers continue to focus on products related to personal health and hygiene, Oral Care grew by 12% on continued growth of LISTERINE mouthwash due to new flavor and product innovations and the increased demand globally related to COVID-19. Wound Care grew 12.2%, primarily due to strong performance across NEOSPORIN and BAND-AID brand adhesive bandages in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. In the baby franchise, we saw AVEENO baby strength, offset by our planned SKU rationalization program, primarily outside the U.S. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.3 billion grew 14.6%, enabled by strength in all regions, with U.S. sales increasing by 15.3% and OUS sales increasing by 13.5%. The business realized double-digit growth in 8 key products across our portfolio, supporting growth in all therapeutic areas except for cardiovascular metabolism, other, which experienced a decline of 1%, primarily driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver our ninth consecutive year of global adjusted operational growth at above-market levels. Our oncology portfolio delivered another robust quarter with worldwide growth of 23.7%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance, growing 49%, led by share gains globally with the U.S. market share up about 4 points across all lines of therapy. Furthermore, the U.S. and European markets continue to exhibit increased adoption of the subcutaneous formulation launched in the second quarter as feedback continues to be very positive on the ease and reduced time to administer the new formulation. Also, we continue to advance the DARZALEX innovation pipeline with the recent U.S. approval of DARZALEX FASPRO for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed light chain amyloidosis. IMBRUVICA grew 25.3% globally, mainly driven by market growth and our strong leadership position in all key indications. We continue to progress the development of IMBRUVICA to further differentiate this BTK inhibitor, as evidenced by the robust data presentation at the American Society of Hematology Conference in December. ERLEADA continued its strong growth momentum with sales of just over $240 million in the quarter, driven by market share and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 15.3%, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA. STELARA grew 30.3%, driven by global demand increase in Crohn's Disease with over a 5-point share increase in the U.S. and continued growth in ulcerative colitis. TREMFYA grew 39.3% and is up about 3 points of share from the fourth quarter of 2019 in the psoriasis market in U.S. TREMFYA continues to strengthen its leadership position as the most prescribed IL-23 inhibitor for patients worldwide through its differentiated data package in both, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We also continued to advance TREMFYA’s pipeline as evidenced by Phase 2 Crohn's Disease data that was presented earlier this year. In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio performed well, growing 9%, driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. In 2020, we filed submissions in the U.S. and EU for paliperidone palmitate six-month formulation for the treatment of adults diagnosed with schizophrenia. And if approved, it will be the first and only long-acting injectable medication with a twice-yearly dosing regimen. Our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved strong growth of 37.4% with OPSUMIT growth of 36.7% and UPTRAVI growth of 44.1%, both driven by market penetration and share growth, as well as a onetime benefit of about 10 points each, resulting from the U.S. distributor model change we communicated in Q4 2019. I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.6 billion, declining 2.2%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales decline was 1.5% worldwide. Onetime items positively impacted the current quarter by about 200 basis points. The net benefit from these onetime items is comprised of the benefit of the extra shipping days associated with the 53rd week, partially offset by the anticipated inventory contractions in China across our portfolio, and in our U.S. contact lens business, as communicated last quarter. Adjusting for the impact of these onetime items, Q4 results were in line with Q3 2020 performance. COVID-19 remains a dynamic variable within the medical device market. In Q4, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations reached their highest levels in certain parts of the world while cases remain relatively stable in others. This did lead to some softening in recovery trends late in the quarter. However, impacts varied across geographies and procedure types. Looking geographically, China, where COVID-19 cases have continued to remain more stable, delivered double-digit growth within the quarter. Excluding the benefit of the additional shipping days, the U.S. declined low single digits, due to COVID-19-related restrictions occurring late in the quarter. Sales also declined in Europe, where some of the strictest restrictions were deployed to curb the increases in COVID-19 cases. As we have noted previously, health care systems continue to demonstrate their resiliency and dedication to treating both, COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, resulting in significantly less disruption during this recent surge of cases versus the impact seen earlier this year. Interventional Solutions continue to demonstrate strong performance, delivering another quarter of double-digit growth. Electrophysiology grew 12.7% globally led by market recovery and share gains from new products. CERENOVUS returned to double-digit growth with strong sales in China. Worldwide orthopedics declined 5.3% versus prior year, driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 where procedures deem to be more elective in nature. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 3.6% globally. U.S. growth of 10% for the quarter reflects market recovery as well as success of our new products, such as the cannulated compression headless screws. Declines of about 6% outside the U.S. reflects slower procedural volumes due to COVID-19 restrictions as well as contractions in inventory in China worth around 400 basis points. Worldwide hips declined 2.7%, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on the market. U.S. declined 0.7% versus prior year and continues to benefit from our leadership position in an interior approach and strong demand for the active stem and enabling technologies, helping to partially offset the negative COVID-19 impact. We continue to introduce innovation in this space, and in December, we entered the modular dual mobility market with the first implant of PINNACLE dual mobility, which is planned for a full U.S. market launch this year. These declined 13.9% globally as we continue to see procedures in this space highly impacted by COVID-19, especially revision procedures, where we have a higher share than primary. The 20.6% decline outside of the U.S. reflects the impacts of COVID-19 on procedures, especially in markets like the UK and India, where we hold higher share positions. We are very excited about the FDA clearance of our VELYS orthopedic robotic system and bringing this to the U.S. market in 2021. The combination of the differentiated robotic system with our ATTUNE knee platform are expected to drive enhanced performance in this segment. Worldwide decline in spine of 7.1% reflects the impact of COVID-19 on the market as well as inventory reductions in China impacting global performance by about 350 basis points. Offsetting this decline is the growth we continue to see from the success of recent launches of new products such as SYMPHONY and CONDUIT. For the quarter, U.S. price remained consistent with historical levels, down low single digits. Moving to the results for the surgery business. Advanced surgery returned to growth with a 2% increase versus prior year, led by strong performance in U.S. biosurgery, which grew 12.1% in the quarter. U.S. biosurgery growth is due to the strength of SURGIFLO and the continued recovery from the previously disclosed 2019 stopped shipment. Endocutters delivered 1.6% growth, mainly driven by the success of new products in China, offsetting impacts from COVID-19. Energy declined by 3.1%, reflecting the negative impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures in the U.S., partially offset by the strength of new products outside the U.S. This month, we received FDA 510(k) clearances for both, the ENSEAL X1 Curved and Straight Jaw Tissue Sealer instruments, which will further strengthen our portfolio of advanced energy devices. Global wound closure grew by 1.5% through the strength of STRATAFIX barbed suture and PRINEO topical skin adhesive products in both, the U.S. and OUS markets. Inventory dynamics in the quarter added about 350 basis points to the U.S. growth of 8.5% and negatively impacted the OUS decline of 2.9% by about 150 basis points. The vision business declined 6.6% globally. U.S. contact lens declined 7.1%. However, after adjusting for the impact of both, the additional shipping days this quarter and the impact of the anticipated channel inventory correction communicated last quarter, worth about 9 points, the underlying U.S. contact lens business grew and continues to deliver competitive performance. While surgical vision declined 10.1% globally, this represents an improvement from Q3 where the business declined 16.4% with the most notable improvement in the U.S. This improvement is due to both, improvement in the cataract and refractive markets as well as new products like TECNIS Toric II IOL for astigmatism. Now, regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020, please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported earlier, our adjusted EPS of $1.86 reflects a reported decrease of 1.1% and an operational decrease of 3.2%. I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold delevered slightly, primarily driven by COVID-19 period costs and fixed cost, impacting the medical device business, partially offset by favorable enterprise portfolio mix and portfolio mix within the Pharmaceutical business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins improved for the quarter as a result of favorable segment mix and expense leveraging in the Pharmaceutical and consumer businesses, partially offset by the negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Devices sales. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 17.9% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 by 230 basis points, driven by portfolio progression, including the COVID-19 vaccine in the Pharmaceutical business. The other income and expense line showed net expense of $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net expense of $16 million last year. This was primarily driven by higher litigation expenses related to a Missouri Supreme Court verdict on talc in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was previously disclosed in our November 3 8-K filing and we intend to seek review of that decision by the United States Supreme Court. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate decreased from 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to a 5.5% benefit in the fourth quarter of 2020. This decline was primarily driven by the tax benefit associated with the fourth quarter 2020 litigation expenses. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 11.4% versus 10.7% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-K for further details on specific tax matters. Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2020, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 27.1% to 24.9%, primarily driven by the COVID-19 impact this quarter. The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment. Medical Devices declined by 900 basis points, driven by COVID-19 impacts on the business, including fixed cost deleveraging associated with sales declines. Consumer margins improved by 430 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio and investment optimization, including execution of our SKU rationalization program. The decline in Pharmaceutical margins of 90 basis points was primarily driven by investment in R&D associated with portfolio progression, including the COVID-19 vaccine. This slide provides our full year consolidated statement of earnings. Please direct your attention to the box section at the bottom of the schedule, where again, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported today, our full year 2020 adjusted EPS of $8.03 reflects a reported decrease of 7.5% and an operational decrease of 7.8%. The decline is primarily related to COVID-19 impacts realized predominantly in our medical device business, along with increased R&D investment, including the investment associated with our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Moving to the next slide. Our full year 2020 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise decreased by 360 basis points versus 2019. Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment, Medical Devices declined from 35.4% in the previous year to 17%, primarily driven by COVID-19 impacts on the business, including fixed cost deleveraging associated with sales declines. 2019 also includes approximately $2 billion related to the divestiture of the Advanced Sterilization Products business. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 200 basis points to 42%, driven by favorable product mix and sales, marketing and administrative expense leveraging. Consumer margins improved by 240 basis points to 23.8% driven by portfolio and investment optimization, including the execution of our SKU rationalization program. Moving on to important developments. For your reference, here is a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the fourth quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments. For your planning purposes, we plan to host a business review, featuring our Pharmaceutical business on November 18th of this year. The format and location will be announced at a later date, but we hope that you're able to join us for this event, where we look forward to sharing the details about our robust pipeline and differentiated capabilities, that gives us the confidence in our ability to sustain growth in Pharmaceuticals at above-market levels. That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter and full year 2020.

As you heard, Johnson & Johnson's results reflect the strength and resilience of an agile, broad-based business predicated on innovation, despite unique challenges throughout 2020. The unwavering commitment of our 135,000 global colleagues was on full display, delivering trusted, life-saving, life-enhancing products to patients and consumers around the world. Their efforts resulted in sound shareholder returns while advancing value-creating opportunities that benefit all of our stakeholders now and over the long term. Alex stated on this call and really throughout 2020 that Johnson & Johnson is built for times like this. Our disciplined, long-term focus yields a financial strength that affords us the ability to quickly act to address the COVID-19 pandemic in many ways, most notably on our ongoing vaccine development, but to also continue investing in innovative solutions to better the future of health care even when short-term uncertainty exists. I am very pleased today to share our financial guidance for 2021, which reflects these principles. But, first, let me review our cash position and capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of $20 billion, surpassing last year's record high. We did benefit by having our fiscal year-end lapse into 2021, as Chris noted, and we are now planning for a payment related to the anticipated final opioid litigation agreement in principal in 2021 versus the previous planned 2020 payment. In terms of our cash position at the end of 2020, we had approximately $10 billion of net debt, comprised of approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $35 billion of debt. One element of our business that we're particularly proud of that despite the challenges of 2020 offered, we maintained our long-term approach to drive growth and value creation across the enterprise. From an innovation standpoint, the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine was certainly a top priority throughout the year. Yet, as I said earlier, we continued to make other strategic investments that fortified our pipeline and further enhanced our competitive advantage even during the pandemic. Our level of R&D investment reached an all-time high of $12.1 billion, $800 million more than our 2019 R&D investment. On the transaction front, we continue to evaluate opportunities that strategically complement our portfolio and where our scientific expertise or commercial capabilities can create unique value. Over the course of 2020, we invested over $7 billion in such opportunities. As discussed on our third quarter earnings call in October, we acquired Momenta Pharmaceuticals and a lead therapeutic candidate, nipocalimab, which is in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of rare autoantibody-driven diseases. We believe nipocalimab encompasses a pipeline and a product opportunity that can treat a broad range of devastating autoantibody-driven diseases. In December, we expanded our retina pipeline by acquiring the rights to Hemera Biosciences investigational gene therapy, HMR59, a onetime outpatient intravitreal injection to help preserve vision in patients with geographic atrophy, a severe form of age-related macular degeneration, where currently, there are no other approved therapies. And as shareholders in Johnson & Johnson have come to expect, we continue to prioritize our dividend by announcing last April a 6.3% increase. This translated in returning $10.5 billion to investors in 2020, approximately 50% of our free cash flow. Let's now turn to our full year 2021 guidance. Given our full year 2020 performance in this unprecedented environment and the underlying strength of our broad-based business, we are well positioned to continue delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. We continue to monitor and work with health care systems around the globe as they balance surges in COVID-19 cases with treatment for non-COVID-19 patients. I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the tremendous efforts of health care providers around the world that have society in a much better place today with improved treatment protocols and resource allocation compared to the start of the pandemic. We are also encouraged by the recent availability of COVID-19 vaccines that will provide added reassurance to people in need of medical procedures. From a macroeconomic perspective, our outlook assumes stabilizing employment levels and a reduction in social restrictions as the year progresses. From a legislative standpoint, we are not assuming significant changes in current tax policy, and consistent with the past four years in our Pharmaceuticals business, we expect net price decreases at similar levels. We will continue to focus on providing access to more patients for our innovative products, resulting in growth being volume-driven. So, let's get into the details for full year 2021 guidance for you to consider in updating your models. I'd like to note upfront that our guidance excludes the financial impact from the potential distribution of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. As Alex noted, we remain committed to provide a safe and effective vaccine. Being in the final stages of a robust 45,000-person study, analytics will be completed, and we plan to report out the results by early next week. Therefore, it would be premature to speculate. We will let the science play out. Once we have the data, obtain regulatory authorization and finalize agreements to supply, we will provide financial updates, as warranted, likely during our first quarter earnings call in April. Starting with sales. We expect adjusted operational sales growth for the full year 2021 of between 8.0% and 9.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage our business performance. We estimate the negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points and as such are comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth in the range of 7.5% to 9.0%, or $88.8 billion to $90.0 billion. As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movement. But for some context, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.21, there is an estimated positive impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 200 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth of between 9.5% and 11.0% or 10.3% at the midpoint compared to 2020 or $90.5 billion to $91.7 billion. Let's now turn to earnings per share. This slide illustrates the components of our 2021 EPS guidance. Roughly half of our EPS growth is attributed to the robust operational sales growth and the other half is attributable to strong net income margin improvement, driven by expected operating margin improvement of more than 200 basis points versus 2020. The medical device COVID-19 recovery and other cost improvement initiatives are planned to more than offset our continued investment to accelerate our business and further strengthen our pipeline of new products for the long term. As a reminder, included in our 2021 guidance is the dilution from the recent acquisition of Momenta, negatively impacting EPS by about $0.15 or $0.10 versus 2020. Considering these items, results in adjusted operational EPS in a range of $9.25 to $9.45 or $9.35 at the midpoint, reflecting a 16.4% year-over-year increase. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share of $9.50 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 18.3% versus the prior year. Continuing with EPS guidance. This slide provides a summary of what I just shared along with some additional P&L items, to give you more insight into the drivers of our full year guidance. Beginning with other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses related to the items such as investments by our Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, litigation and write-offs. As I discussed on previous earnings calls, we will continue to be rigorous regarding portfolio management, but going forward, we will not include the impact of significant divestiture gains in adjusted EPS. Given those considerations, we would be comfortable with your models for 2021, reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as net income ranging from between $600 million and $700 million. We continue to actively evaluate external value-creating opportunities, but for purposes of your financial models, we are not assuming any major acquisitions or other major uses of cash at this time. Therefore, we are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense of between $150 million and $250 million. We are also projecting a higher effective tax rate for 2021 in the range of 16.5% to 17.5% or a midpoint of 17% due to beneficial onetime items in 2020 related to the closeout of audits in several jurisdictions that will not repeat in 2021. Let me spend a few minutes providing some qualitative context about 2021, although not intended to specifically provide segment or quarterly guidance. Given variability that occurred due primarily to COVID-related dynamics, this slide, while not to scale and meant to be illustrative, offers some perspectives on the quarterly phasing across our businesses. From a sales perspective, as Chris noted earlier, we benefited from additional selling days in 2020 that will not repeat in 2021. That should be applied to both, the full year and the fourth quarter for the enterprise and by segment. I'll address each segment starting with Pharmaceuticals, where we anticipate another strong year of above-market growth. Throughout 2020, we saw COVID-19-driven fluctuations, and most pronounced was the first quarter when, as we noted, we benefited from longer script durations. We continue to invest in COVID-19 vaccine development, impacting the first quarter while we pursue authorization. For 2021, we expect more balanced quarter-to-quarter growth. Lastly, while we expect to continue to face pricing pressures and the ongoing negative impact of generic and biosimilar competition, we do not expect any significant new generic or biosimilar entrants in 2021. Turning to our Medical Device segment. As mentioned earlier, we observed instances of nonemergency procedure postponements late in the fourth quarter, but health care systems continue to meet the needs of both, COVID and non-COVID patients, resulting in less COVID-19 market disruption as we progressed through 2020. While macro market dynamics such as vaccine deployment, unemployment and health care coverage remain fluid, we are anticipating some moderate procedural disruption to carry into the first quarter but expect continued medical device market improvement throughout 2021 fluctuating by quarter. As you heard during our Medical Device update in November, our core platforms continue to strengthen, driven by enhanced execution and improved cadence of innovation and filling critical portfolio gaps, including and most notably, advancing our future digital surgery offerings. We believe the combination of the expected market recovery and the actions taken to strengthen our device business positions us to drive revenue growth each quarter versus 2020 with some continued headwinds due to COVID-19 tempering growth in the first quarter and the highest growth rate expected in the second quarter, given the significant market disruption realized in the second quarter of 2020. Our Consumer Health segment yielded solid performance throughout the pandemic, resulting in above-market growth. But as noted on our third quarter earnings call, that performance is likely to yield negative COVID-related sales comparisons in the first quarter of 2021, primarily in over-the-counter products. We also plan that our continued SKU rationalization program will have a negative impact on sales in the first half of 2021 while we continue progressing our margin expansion. For the second half, we would anticipate more normalized growth as consumers return to more typical usage patterns for products in areas like Skin Health and Beauty. Therefore, although not linear, for the full year, we anticipate growing competitively with the markets in which we compete. We are confident in the strength of our broad-based business and its underlying fundamentals. We are positioned to deliver meaningful value to all of our stakeholders, not just in 2021, but over the long term. Alex and I look forward to addressing your questions. So, I'm now pleased to turn the call back over to Chris to initiate the Q&A session.

Thanks again for all the work you're doing to combat the pandemic and looking forward to the vaccine data next week. I was just wondering, with respect to the vaccine trial, if you can remind us what percentage of participants were enrolled in South Africa and Brazil, and if you're gathering sequencing data from these participants that become infected. And when you report the data, are you going to break out results by geography? And hence, will we have any insight in terms of the vaccine efficacy against some of these new variants?

Look, maybe before I answer this -- your question, let me just back up for a higher level, and once again, note, what I think has just been the tremendous contributions and performance of our 150,000 approximate associates around the world, 50,000 of whom have been going to work every day in our factories and our laboratories to ensure the products and services could continue to flow to patients and hospital systems around the world, let alone the important work that we're doing on the vaccine. Next, I also just think it's very important to reflect on the tremendous impact that COVID-19 has had around the world. You've heard some of the numbers that we mentioned earlier today, whether it's almost 100 million cases around the world, let alone 2 million deaths globally or right here in the United States, almost 25 million people and over 400,000 deaths, that's taken a tremendous cost on certainly families, individuals, businesses, our economy on just so many different aspects of our life that all the more important for us to be doing everything we can to make a difference during this pandemic. Last but not least, I'm just very proud of the performance that we had, not only in the fourth quarter but throughout 2020. If you look at the various segments, in almost each of our sectors, all of our major platforms, what you saw is us ending the year in a better position than where we started. And that wasn't only for what I would call the near-term financial performance where we saw things like market share gains and position improvements, but also if you look at the investment that we made in research and development, in sales and marketing preparing for the future not only 2021, but that and beyond, again we think we're well-positioned and stronger as we finished the year than even when we began. Now, getting back to your specific question regarding the breakouts, we're going to have much more information in the coming days. We think it's very important to follow the data, to follow the science. At that time, we think it will be more appropriate to provide you with all of the various cuts of the data that we anticipate having. Consistent with the statements that we made from the very beginning, we want to ensure that we've got a very robust program not only geographically, but also by ethnicity, gender, as well as a number of other different parameters, all as part of an effort to give us the best possible understanding of the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine, so stay tuned. As Joe alluded to in his earlier comments, and Chris we expect to have these results in the coming days. And our scientists, Dr. Mathai Mammen, Dr. Paul Stoffels, and others will be providing much more detail once we have those results.",499.0,221.0,8.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,0.03619909502262444,0.013574660633484163,0.03619909502262444,0.0,0.0,0.02262443438914027

And Joe, do you still expect to produce 1 billion doses in 2021? And just lastly, I know you said that you're not going to give any financial guidance until I think your next call.

As I mentioned earlier, I think it would be inappropriate for us to speculate in any significant way, given the proximity that we are today versus when we expect the results. What we said from the very beginning is that we put a lot of work and thought and very strong science and review into the selection of our lead candidate. I think, the Phase 1 and 2a results, particularly those that were recently published, we are hopeful that's a good precursor to the kind of efficacy and safety that we'll see in larger population, of course, until we see this final data. We won't know for certain, but look we remain optimistic, and we're going to remain very diligent as we go through this final review.

I would say with respect to supply, consistent with the comments that were made earlier, we intend to meet all of the firm order commitments that we have, whether that be to the United States, to the European Union or to developing countries through the Gavi organization. And right now, we're well on track to do that. As Alex alluded to, there is still some fluidity with respect to timelines. And I think what we're seeing happening with a little bit of confusion is people are trying to parse this down into weeks. I think, the definitive statement here is that we are very comfortable in meeting our commitments to those respective countries or organizations that I just outlined. In terms of financial implications and pricing, as you can imagine once countries get a chance to see the data, we're in active negotiations for other countries and other organizations, and the volume will impact the selling price. So, it's somewhat of a fluid situation, and that's why we're kind of projecting or leading folks to think about the April first quarter earnings call as a good time when many of those pieces will be in place, and we can give you some credible information to bank on for the balance of 2021.",226.0,99.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.020202020202020204,0.020202020202020204,0.0,0.020202020202020204,0.010101010101010102

The one would just be just in general, as you think about new variants in the marketplace and the need for a booster. I wonder if you could just comment on number one, when can we expect the dual dose data, and what are your thoughts about the booster relative to the mRNA-based platforms? And then, I guess, just on earnings strength for next year, '21, Joe, just 200 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion, just seems like given the earnings upside relative to consensus estimates, you probably need a margin number that is maybe closer to 300 basis points of year-on-year upside versus 200. So just give us any sense of what's driving margin strength, some of that's medical device recovery. I'm sure some of that's pharma strength as well.

Look, we -- as I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to pull together all of our data. We're enrolling, as we speak, in the dual dose information. We would expect that -- to have that in the back end of this year. And again, as we -- just as we try to be very transparent and very thorough in the disclosure that we're releasing, we certainly will plan to follow that course with that trial as well. And again, we'll get out information as soon as we can. Regarding some of the variants, obviously, we're watching that closely, based upon some of the regional, the geographical differences that we've seen. And look, our scientists are already anticipating, as you heard from some of the other companies, about what are potential scenarios to ensure that we're prepared. But look, I think, it starts with taking a look at the data that we currently have that we should have shortly. And I think Dr. Paul Stoffels and Dr. Mathai Mammen, once we have that, will be able to give a much more comprehensive review on exactly how we think our vaccine will work against the current strains and variants and our plans for the future.

With respect to kind of the earnings outlook and specifically, the operating margins, you're correct. And not to get cute, but the words were actually greater than 200 basis points. So, that could gravitate upward. We certainly want to keep the flexibility that we've had even during 2021 and all that uncertainty to continue to invest in innovative ideas that really fortify, not just this year, but well beyond. In terms of some of the programs we have that are improving our operating margins, I'd point you to this consumer SKU rationalization. That is certainly something that will have an impact on consumer sales in the first half of the year, but again, with this objective of improving profit margins, and that team has done a great job under Thibaut’s leadership with respect to improving the margin profile over the last two years. You may also recall a few years back made significant investments in our supply chain infrastructure. Some of those are starting to pay off in 2021 as well. And then, like it or not, we are working differently, and there are efficiencies that correlate to some of this working differently. I'm not suggesting that we found a steady state in terms of the balance between virtual work and work in the office, but there are some efficiencies that are being realized that I think will actually sustain long term as we move forward.

Regarding durability, again, we're going to have to see how some of the early data in some of the preclinical work that we have done plays out in the actual large-scale trials. We're certainly hopeful that you're going to see a durable and a sustainable and patent response, particularly from our vector approach. We have seen that in other programs that we run. So, we're hopeful that we'll see it here, but we would expect that to play out. We are pleased with not only the antibody response that we saw but also some of the cellular level response that would be in T cells. But again, more information will be available once we have our other final results. Secondly, more broadly, about health care, I do think that -- and we do feel that COVID-19 has had a very profound effect on health care systems, both near term and short -- and longer term. I think, in the near term, what we've learned is frankly the importance of innovation and science. And if you reflect back on where we were, just 11 or 12 months ago at the beginning of COVID-19 and where we are now in the number, not only of very innovative vaccine candidates, but therapeutics and the differences that they made. If you take a look at the way hospital protocols very rapidly and quickly started to using data sciences and information to better understand what was going on with patients entering those facilities, how they should be treated, what led to better outcomes, how that's impacted the reduction in morbidity, I think clearly, another example. Third, we've seen a rapid expansion in telehealth, and that's in primary care offices but also specialty offices. The way that companies like ours actually communicate and engage and educate physicians and health care systems, we would see that lasting for some time as well. And clearly, on the public health side, we think that's also a very important dynamic for us to consider going forward. I mean, I think it's clear from this that the world now has a much better understanding of the importance of well-established, well-funded global public health programs, without which we're at significant risk around the world, whether it's our economies, society, just at a number of different levels. So, those are perhaps some of the longer term trends. And last but not least, I'd like to do a -- just a shout out for the partnership and collaboration that we've seen with not only within industry and across industry but also with regulators around the world. And it's certainly our hope that we can take some of that and apply it to other advancements, whether it's cures for cancer, neuroscience, other conditions. If we can take some of those same paradigms and accelerations and apply them there, that would be great news, not only for patients, certainly in health care systems, but for the industry as well.",516.0,232.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.034482758620689655,0.004310344827586207,0.008620689655172414,0.004310344827586207,0.0,0.03017241379310345

What I would say is we've been around for 135 years. It's I think 24 different administrations from both, Republican and Democrat. We're going to continue to do what we do best, and that's to innovate.

So, we're seeing the benefit of innovation, whether it be for the COVID-19 vaccine or other solutions in immunology, oncology, pulmonary hypertension and neuroscience.

And I think we saw very good signs of that actually over the course of 2020, where we saw the medical device market drop anywhere from 30% to up to 70%, depending on which category you're looking at, to return to mid-single-digit drops in the third quarter as we went through the rest of the year. As Joe and I believe Chris alluded to earlier in some of their commentary, we would expect see continued impact certainly in the first quarter of 2021, although the early signs, we're encouraged by what we're seeing in hospitals' ability to manage through some of the current patient demands. There are certainly regions and hospitals around the world, let alone in the United States, where you see a tremendous strain on the systems. But overall, we're seeing hospital volumes decrease no more than about 10% or 15% in areas such, for example, in the UK, a couple of other places in Europe. But overall, the resiliency and the ability of the hospital systems that continue with elective surgeries has improved quite significantly. And as you -- as I'm sure you would project, if we look at second quarter, in particular, the year-on-year comparison should return. As we look at our team's performance and consider 2021, we're actually looking at 2019 as more of a benchmark to -- and to use that as an indicator more of what a baseline or normal would be. But again, we can -- we would expect to continue to see expansion over the course of 2021. And beyond that again see a return to a market that was growing in the mid-single-digits previously, and we would expect that to continue going forward as well.",303.0,141.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.03546099290780142,0.0070921985815602835,0.014184397163120567,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,0.028368794326241134

I mean, if you look at the performance in the fourth quarter, it was about 30% growth for the full year. We are looking at 20% growth. And what's really important to remember about STELARA is just the diversity of indications now that we have with that compound, especially in GI conditions, where we think it's particularly differentiated and unique, both in terms of its efficacy and now a very robust safety profile as well, based upon the years of experience. It is a competitive category. There are a number of new agents.

Joanne, regarding VELYS, look, we were very excited about the approval with the FDA. As we were able to share with you during our Innovation Day with our Medical Device group, if we look at the flexibility, the accuracy, the reduced footprint that it provides the surgeon and surgical teams, we think that it just has tremendous potential. Again, this is a market that is still -- we think has a significant opportunity for growth in terms of penetration. We also think it will be a nice complement to our ATTUNE fixed bearing cementless knee. And remember, we also have plans to expand VELYS significantly beyond just knee replacement but to other areas as well. So, when you combine that, we think it will be very competitive. And more importantly, we think it will be a great new option for physicians, for orthopedic surgeons and ultimately for patients and their families. I'm not going to get into all of the launch plans. But, what I will tell you is the team has got an aggressive agenda lined up, and they're completing all the other associated testing as we speak. But, we look forward to launching that over the course of 2021 and again, expanding our overall position. Regarding Vision Care, you're right. There are a lot of dynamics that we certainly saw in the past year, in the contact lens market, significant contraction as well as in the surgery market. We believe that our position overall in the contact lens has continued to strengthen. And we did see improvement as we went quarter-to-quarter and ended the year, and we think we'll be well-positioned as we enter 2021. We've also made a number of changes regarding our surgical business. We're excited in 2021 about the TECNIS Symfony launch with a depth of focus lens. It's got improved near-term focus. And we also have a TECNIS Synergy IOL, a first-in-class product, combining a number of different technologies, to really deliver a great range with high contrast. We expect that in '21.

In contact lens, as we have noted in prior quarter, if you remember, in the U.S., there was double-digit growth, and some of those were some of the retail dynamics as it related to inventory and stocking that you noted, adjusting for that contact lens did grow. It was worth almost 9 points. And we do view our growth is still competitive versus the market. And then, on the surgical side, it was actually good. We did see some recovery in the market there. So, it's good to see the trend. While we're still declining, it's improving sequentially, and we remain optimistic, including the innovation that Alex mentioned.",120.0,52.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.09615384615384616,0.019230769230769232,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693

You've made some great progress in 2020, closing the gap on digital surgery and abdominal surgery, orthopedics and lung. And just curious, sort of following on to Joanne's question around the VELYS rollout is, how to think about this -- you get recovery in volumes generally in the market, in some of these end markets, and then, you've got sort of the benefit of these new digital surgery sort of launches. And is that -- do we see that in back half of the year? Do we start to see ortho this year and Ottava maybe the following year?

Look, we were -- I think, it's important to put maybe perhaps some additional perspective on it. If we really go back to 2017, where I believe the growth rate of our Medical Device division was about 1.5-point, and if you look at the expansion as we went through 2019 to where it was growing at almost a 4% rate. And as we've articulated a number of times, our goal is to grow at or faster than the markets where we compete. We believe the markets where we compete overall in surgery and orthopedics and vision care and others, cardiovascular, are in the 4% to 5% range. And that's the goal for our businesses. As we -- of course, with 2019 -- or 2020, excuse me, and the effect of COVID, that had a very significant impact. But again, here too, if we normalize out our trends for third and fourth quarter, we think that overall, those quarters were pretty consistent, down about 3.5% after you pull everything else out, and will put us on a good rate, as we mentioned earlier, over the course of 2021 and beyond. Regarding VELYS, as I mentioned earlier, we think it does offer a number of unique advantages. We think it can enhance the surgeon's ability to really personalize total knee arthroscopy. At the same time, it has certain features that will make it easier for use potentially in the operating room. And again, we think it's going to be a great complement to not only our ATTUNE system, but further down the line to our hip procedures and others as well. We do feel that the overall knee market will recover in 2021. It will take place over the course of the year as hospitals are able to continue to get their capacity back, as patients get increasingly confident. The knee market was perhaps hit more than others just because many of those procedures can be delayed, perhaps versus a hip procedure. But, we would expect that to return over the course of this year as we see the pandemic dealt with in a more effective way and things hopefully return to a more normal state. And by the way, we think the outlook for that longer term, given some of the pent-up demand that we're likely to see, will be quite significant. As you saw in our review back in November, we're very excited about Ottava. We truly think it's going to offer a next-generation digital and robotic surgery. As you just mentioned, the team made great progress over the last 12 months. As we brought the various technologies together, we continue to do the build-outs and when -- we remain on track with all the time lines that we have previously committed to. And we're confident that here too is a market that we think is very -- has very low penetration, less than 5% or 10%, certainly on a global basis, more so in certain categories here in the United States. But, whether it's penetration or the ability just to expand those kind of options to surgeons here in the United States around the world, based upon the technology that we'll be bringing, we think it will offer significant upside on the time lines that you just mentioned.",551.0,247.0,9.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,1.0,0.03643724696356275,0.004048582995951417,0.02834008097165992,0.0,0.004048582995951417,0.032388663967611336

Yes, we were able to do that in Q1 because there was an early impact. And then, what we did was as we provided guidance throughout the year, we kind of gave you a range of expected impact by quarter, based on what our original guidance would have been at the beginning of the year. If you look at what we shared in Q4 ahead of this earnings, we'd anticipated that we could be anywhere from down 10% or flat versus our original thinking, which would have contemplated some growth year-over-year, plus a 53rd week. If you look at where we landed, we basically landed at the low end of that range, given some of the additional softness that the market experienced in the December timeframe where procedures were probably down more around that 10% range.

What we saw in North America in Q4 was it down just about -- or excuse me, up about 2%. And again, there were regions around the country where we saw a differential impact. But, I think it's fair to say that we were pleased to see the ability of the majority of systems in the United States being able to continue to provide elective procedures, even in spite of some of the later surges where we saw even more significant impacts were in Europe and LatAm during that period. And because of our stronger position in certain places in Europe that had a differential impact on us. And again, as hopefully, we see improving trends with the virus in Europe over the course of 2021, we would expect to see that return. And so, regarding your questions on volumes in the back end, look, it's hard to predict based upon where we currently are. As we said earlier, we think the most significant impact this year will be certainly in Q1. As we continue to deal with some of the ongoing surge, we would expect the year-on-year comparisons to change pretty significantly in Q2 and Q3. And again, assuming much improved vaccine distribution, better overall control of COVID-19, we would then expect to see volumes come back to more normalized levels as we finish the year.

Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that the results could change at any time and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is at best estimate, based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings including our 2020 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or license from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three business segments. Joe will provide insights about our cash position, capital allocation deployment and we'll spend some time on 2021 qualitative commentary, and we'll outline our updated guidance for 2021.

In regions outside the US, our reported growth was 12.2%. Operational sales growth outside the US was 7.3% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 4.9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 6% worldwide, 3.9% in the US and 8.2% outside the US. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $6.2 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.32 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.17 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset, amortization expense and special items for both periods adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.59 representing increases of 12.5% and 12.6%, respectively compared to the first quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.3%. I would now comment on business segment sales performance highlighting items that build upon the slide you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2020 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with Consumer Health, Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.5 billion and declined 3.3% with declines in the US of 7.4% and modest growth of 0.5% outside of the US. The Consumer Health results reflect negative comparisons due to prior year pantry loading and increased COVID-19 demand, particularly in over-the-counter medicines. Excluding the prior-year COVID-19 comparison, the Consumer Health segment grew low-single-digits in the quarter. Over-the-counter medicines declined 14.8%. Globally results were negatively impacted by the prior-year comparisons, I previously mentioned, coupled with continued impacts of social distancing restrictions resulting in lower cough, cold and flu incidences. Partially offsetting declines were US share gains, primarily in TYLENOL, ZYRTEC and PEPCID as well as strong performance of NICORETTE outside the US. The Skin Health/Beauty franchise grew by 2.8% driven by strong performance outside the US for NEUTROGENA and AVEENO due to new product innovations and strength in e-commerce. Results were partially offset by US COVID-19 related market contraction in makeup removal wipes. Consumers continue to focus on products related to personal health and hygiene, including oral care, which grew 4.5% from continued growth of LISTERINE mouthwash due to category growth and strong promotions partially offset by divestitures. Worldwide growth excluding divestitures was approximately 8%. Additionally the Baby Care franchise grew by 9.5% as a result of strength in Johnson's outside the US, primarily in Latin America and Asia Pacific regions across all categories coupled with AVEENO baby growth in e-commerce globally. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.2 billion grew 7.1% with strength in both the US, increasing by 6.4% and OUS with sales increasing by 7.9%. Sales in the quarter included a small contribution in the US from Janssen's COVID-19 vaccine, following its emergency use authorization in February. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continues to enable us to deliver strong adjusted operational growth at above-market levels with seven key products realizing double-digit growth in the first quarter. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 5.5%, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA, offset by continued declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. STELARA continue to show strength in all regions growing at 15.4%, driven by increased market growth and share gains. US share increased roughly four points in Crohn's Disease and nearly 10-points in ulcerative colitis. STELARA growth was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison to a prior period pricing adjustment in Q1, 2020, and an unfavorable comparison to increased sales in Q1 2020 resulting from COVID-19 related longer scrip durations in the US and Europe. TREMFYA grew 37.8% with strong double-digit growth in both the US and OUS driven by share gains in psoriasis of 2.7 points in the US, continued global expansion into new markets and continued penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication that was approved in 2020. Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 14.6%. DARZALEX continued its strong performance growing 42.2%, driven by share growth across all lines of therapy and increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the US and EU. DARZALEX continues to penetrate the frontline setting aided by recently approved line extensions that penetrate new patient populations, posting nearly three points of share growth in Line one in the US this quarter. ERLEADA continued its global momentum with growth of 79.7% in the quarter driven by market share and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication. IMBRUVICA grew 5.6% globally with increased volume growth driven by our market-leading share and increased persistency as patients extend the duration of therapy. However, this was partially offset by the market contraction due to temporary COVID-19 impacts on new patient starts. Growth was also negatively impacted by one-time items including the increased demand in Q1 of 2020 related to longer-term scrip durations in anticipation of pandemic-related restrictions and higher levels of clinical trial volume in the same quarter last year. Excluding the impact of these one-time events, global growth for IMBRUVICA would have been double-digits. In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio grew 6.9% driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. Cardiovascular/metabolism/other declined 4.1% this quarter driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT and competitive pressures in INVOKANA which was partially offset by growth of 11.7% in XARELTO driven by continued demand and a one-time favorable prior period pricing adjustment in the current quarter which contributed over half of XARELTO's growth in the quarter. Lastly, our total pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved strong growth of 13.7% with OPSUMIT growth of 13.5% and UPTRAVI growth of 20.9% both driven by market penetration and share gains. I'll now turn your attention to the medical devices segment. Worldwide medical devices sales were $6.6 billion growing 8%. Growth versus prior year was primarily driven by market recovery from procedures impacted by COVID-19 along with continued momentum driven by commercial initiatives and our recently launched new products that are further enhancing our competitiveness across several areas of the business. Additionally, selling days positively impacted worldwide growth by 190 basis points. We expect the full-year impact from selling days excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2020 will be minimal. While recovery dynamics continue to vary across procedure type and geography, our results reflect continued momentum with nine of our 11 priority platforms delivering global growth in Q1 with six of these delivering double-digit worldwide growth. As you consider regional dynamics, Asia Pacific was the first region to be impacted by COVID-19 and experienced the most significant sales declines in the first quarter last year. Asia Pacific realized strong market recovery, primarily in China against this low sales base from the prior year. So that coupled with our commercial efforts to expand into Tier 2 and Tier 3 hospitals in China resulted in strong double-digit growth in this region. COVID-19 remains a dynamic variable in the US. However, the market has been resilient and continues to recover resulting in growth of 5.4% in the US. Sales declined in Europe and Latin America where there continues to be a higher level of COVID-19-related mobility restrictions and procedure deferrals. Looking at results for each of our platforms. Interventional solutions delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth. Electrophysiology grew 25.7% in the quarter, primarily driven by recovery in the market coupled with the strength of our broad-based portfolio, focus on commercial execution and introduction of new products such as an update to our CARTO 3 System and the CARTO PRIME Mapping Module which further enhanced our market position globally. These new product introductions support improved mapping capabilities and reduced ablation times during atrial fibrillation procedures. Worldwide orthopedics grew 1.2% versus the prior year with continued COVID-19 impacts of procedure recovery. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 9.5% reflecting market recovery and success of our newer product introductions that continue to support our market-leading position in trauma such as the most comprehensive Cannulated Compression Headless Screw system on the market and the RIA 2 system designed for long-bone grafts. Hips returned to worldwide growth this quarter increasing 3.2% driven by market recovery and our continued leadership position in the interior approach and demand for the ACTIS Stem aided by our other enabling technologies in hip navigation. Knees declined 9.9% globally, primarily due to slower market recovery in these more deferrable procedures in addition to some softness stemming from business mix dynamics. We are on track for the commercialization of our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution for total knee procedures in the U.S. We believe the combination of this launch along with our differentiated VELYS Digital Solutions and Attune platform including some cementless offerings will enhance our portfolio and support improve performance, as procedures continue to recover. Spine declined 0.6%, reflecting the continued impact of COVID-19 on this market coupled with some one-time stocking reductions in China resulting from the consolidation to a national distribution model, worth about 250 basis points globally. The decline was partially offset by the success of the recently launched products such as, Symphony, Conduit and Fibergraft as well as partnerships which further enhance our offerings such as, the X-Pac Expandable Cage. Advanced surgery grew 14.3% versus the prior year with double-digit growth globally in endocutters, biosurgery and energy, primarily from robust growth in Asia driven by market recovery and market share gains due to new product launches, globalization of our portfolio, including biosurgery, Surgiflo Plus Thrombin launch in Japan, and commercial investments to expand our coverage in China. In general surgery, wound closure, grew 12% globally with a growth of 6.6% in the U.S. and 15.7% in OUS. Results were driven by recovery in the markets as well as continued strength of our market-leading suture portfolio including the STRATAFIX barbed suture family. The U.S. contact lens growth of 7.2% reflects the strength of our commercial execution and our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, including the recent launch of Acuvue Oasys, multi-focal lenses which were designed to provide clear vision at all distances. Channel inventory increases related to continued COVID-19 volatility and support of this new product launch contributed about 400 basis points to growth. Growth outside the U.S. of 0.9% reflects a slower market recovery in Japan and Europe. The global surgical vision grew 11.2% due to a combination of a recovery in both cataract and refractive procedures as well as the continued strength of recent product introductions, including Tecnis Toric II and early success of Tecnis Eyhance driving improved share momentum in both the U.S, and OUS markets. Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2021, please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning our adjusted EPS of $2.59 reflects a reported increase of 12.6%, and an operational increase of 8.3%. I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed the misstatement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. The cost of product sold improved versus 2020 as a percent to sales due to favorable product mix in the pharmaceutical business, and favorable volume and mix in the medical devices business. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2020, medical devices results included the establishment of COVID-19 inventory reserve which did not repeat in 2021. Selling, marketing and administrative margins improved due to leveraging the medical devices business, resulting from the recovery of sales from the prior year's negative COVID-19 impact. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels investing 14.2% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the first quarter of 2020 by 170 basis points, driven by portfolio progression in the pharmaceutical business. The other income and expense line showed net income of $882 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to net income of $679 million in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher acquisition, integration and divestiture related activity. However, as a reminder, we treat significant gains as a special item and these gains are therefore excluded from adjusted earnings. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate increased from 11% in the first quarter of 2020 to 16.6% in the first quarter of 2021. This increase is driven primarily by the impact of one-time items in 2020 that did not repeat. Excluding special items the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 15% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-Q for further details on specific tax matters. Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 35% to 37.1%. The following are the main drivers of change to the adjusted income before tax by segment. Medical devices margin improved by 640 basis points driven by inventory reserves recorded in 2020 associated with the impact of COVID-19, which did not repeat in the current quarter and overall expense leveraging in 2021 resulting from the medical devices sales recovery. Consumer health margins improved by 150 basis points, primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies including the benefit from our SKU rationalization program. Pharmaceutical margins improved by 30 basis points primarily driven by favorable product mix partially offset by increased investment in research and development. That concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.",2643.0,1540.0,66.0,33.0,19.0,0.0,3.0,9.0,4.0,19.0,0.04285714285714286,0.02142857142857143,0.012337662337662338,0.0,0.001948051948051948,0.02142857142857143
JNJ,2021-04-20,2021-04-20,,2021-04-20,2021-04-20T08:30:00-04:00,0,2021-04-20,qa,qna_heading,Joe Wolk,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. When we spoke with you this time last year, we updated our full-year 2020 outlook with perhaps the highest level of uncertainty Johnson & Johnson had ever faced much like every other company in every other industry. COVID-19 cases were on the rise, worldwide lockdowns were in effect and most were adapting to new ways of working while maintaining productivity. No one knew how long the pandemic would last and demand forecasts were ambiguous at best. However, what was crystal clear, what we did know was that the resilience of our business, the strength of our financial position and an unrelenting long-term focus to develop and deliver our lifesaving medicines and products to patients and customers around the globe would likely lead to a better future. We are stronger as a business than before the pandemic and our first-quarter 2021 results give us even more confidence in our ability to continue delivering compelling performance in the future. Let me begin with our cash position and capital allocation priorities. We ended the first quarter of 2021 with approximately $9 billion of net debt, consisting of approximately $25 billion of cash in marketable securities and approximately $34 billion of debt. While our capital allocation priorities remain intact, the past year has reinforced the importance of managing our business for the long-term through a disciplined approach and a focus on investments for innovation to further enhance our competitive positioning. In addition to disproportionately investing competitively in our R&D pipelines, we continue to evaluate and capitalize on acquisition opportunities when appropriate to create value over the long-term. Paying our dividend and increasing it annually remains a key priority. Earlier this morning, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly dividend for the 59th consecutive year by 5%. The dividend increase to $1.06 per share per quarter reflects our recent performance, strong financial position and confidence in the future of Johnson & Johnson. An indication that our capital deployment is fortifying the foundation for our future is in part illustrated on this next slide, which details pipeline developments that have occurred since our last call. I'll highlight a few starting with our pharmaceutical business. First, we received US approval and a positive opinion from the CHMP in the EU for Ponvory in multiple sclerosis, our first EMEA approval this year. In addition, we completed our BLA filing for Cilta-Cel, a BCMA Car-T for the treatment of multiple myeloma and we anticipate US approval later this year. As you know, we are rigorous in focusing on differentiated transformational medical innovation. Despite showing proof of concept in initial phases of the study, we decided to discontinue the phase 2 development of Tesnatilimab, an anti-NKG2D monoclonal antibody for Crohn's disease based on insufficient efficacy in the trial. Within our medical devices portfolio, the FDA granted approval for Tecnis Eyhance, a next-generation intraocular lens. This represents the first significant innovation in monofocal technology in over 20 years. Johnson & Johnson Vision also announced a collaboration with Menicon to deliver therapeutic contact lenses that manage the progression of myopia in children. We expect the commercialization of this product by the end of 2021 under the brand name, Acuvue Ability, pending health authority approval. We are excited to accelerate our entry into this growing and important space for patients, while we continue to advance our myopia pipeline. As Chris commented to earlier, we are pleased by the enterprise's first-quarter results. I'll now provide some insights into how we are thinking about the remainder of 2021. So, let's start simply with, we remain confident in our business. Our pharmaceutical segment is on track with our expectations and in 2021, we expect to deliver a 10th consecutive year of operational above-market growth. Importantly, this growth is volume-driven not dependent on price. You may have noticed that we issued our fifth annual Janssen US Transparency Report last week. While I'm admittedly biased, this is a very informative read and you'll not only see the average price for our products declined by nearly 6% in 2020, but how more than t$29 billion of rebates and discounts were allocated. In consumer health, prior-year comparisons will be choppy by quarter throughout this year due to the COVID-19 pantry loading and demand surges experienced in 2020. However, we continue to expect to grow with the market for the year in those areas in which we compete, driven by our strong iconic brands that consumers rely on every day. We will also continue to focus on maintaining our enhanced margin profile, driven by our SKU rationalization and investment optimization programs. In medical devices, better execution, new innovative offerings, and market recovery led to growth in the first quarter. However, market variables such as patient willingness to seek care, insurance coverage, and unemployment rates along with the easing of mobility restrictions will influence the rate of recovery as we progress through the year. Despite those uncertain dynamics, we remain confident in the full-year outlook we had in January. Let me say a few words related to our COVID-19 vaccine. Our goal has always been to bring our scientific capabilities and resources to develop a safe, effective vaccine that would complement other measures to end the global pandemic. To ensure broad access, we announced early on that we would supply the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis during the crisis period. Given the not-for-profit commitment, as previously stated, we never anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue would have a significant upside impact to 2021 adjusted EPS, already projected to grow at 18%, or 1.8 times greater than sales growth. Paul will say a few words at the conclusion of my remarks on our COVID-19 vaccine. Regarding vaccine financials, please know that we commit to providing timely updates to actual results and guidance as warranted. Considering the qualitative factors I just referenced, here's what we expect for the full year 2021. Starting with sales, on an adjusted operational basis, we are increasing our guidance and tightening our range to reflect the ongoing confidence in the business to a range of growth to 8.7% to 9.9%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we manage our business performance. We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in operational sales of $89.3 billion to $90.3 billion, or 8.2% to 9.4%. While we don't offer predictions on currency movement, utilizing the Euro spot rate relative to the US dollar as of last week at 1.19, results in a still favorable, but to a lesser degree currency impact of $1.3 billion, or a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points, resulting in estimated reported sales in the range of $90.6 billion to $91.6 billion, an increase of 9.7% to 10.9%, or 10.3 at that midpoint versus 2020. Regarding the balance of the P&L, we are maintaining the guidance we offered in January for all other items for which we routinely provide guidance. We are however comfortable tightening our range by raising the lower end resulting in increasing the midpoint of our adjusted operational EPS by $0.03. Therefore, our new adjusted earnings per share guidance range is $9.30 to $9.45 on a constant currency basis. While not predicting currency movement, but to provide some direction on the impact of currency fluctuations on our reported adjusted EPS, the estimated benefit is now $0.12 versus $0.15 for the full year. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.42 to $9.57 or a midpoint of $9.50 to a range of 17.3% to 19.2%. We don't provide quarterly guidance, but do appreciate that you find value in us providing some qualitative considerations to keep in mind as you update your models. This slide looks rather similar to what we shared in January with the most noteworthy callout being the negative impact of COVID-19 experienced in the second quarter of 2020, particularly in medical devices. It is reasonable to infer that the second quarter of 2021 should have highly favorable comparisons in medical devices. Let me close our prepared remarks by acknowledging the Johnson & Johnson colleagues and all they have overcome, but more importantly accomplished over the last year. Driven by our credo their unrelenting dedication to continue meeting our commitments to all stakeholders has been inspiring. On behalf of the entire executive team to all 135,000 employees around the world, thank you. Paul, Chris and I are pleased to be joined by Alex and Joaquin to address your questions. But before we begin the Q&A, let me turn the call over to Paul.",1434.0,748.0,31.0,14.0,18.0,0.0,6.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,0.04144385026737968,0.01871657754010695,0.02406417112299465,0.0,0.008021390374331552,0.022727272727272728

From the very beginning, we have worked to develop and deliver a single-shot easily transportable COVID-19 vaccine to help protect the health of people everywhere and reach communities in need globally. We are committed to equitable access and to bringing in affordable COVID-19 vaccine to the public on a not-for-profit basis for the emerging pandemic use. In the last quarter, we announced results from our multi-country phase 3 ENSEMBLE study that demonstrates the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied and showed protection against COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths, beginning day 28 of the vaccination. The vaccine has demonstrated protection across all countries studied and with multiple variants of the virus including the B.1.3.5.1 variant. Based on the robust data, we submitted to health authorities, we received emergency use authority -- authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration, a conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency and Emergency Use listing from the World Health Organization. We began US distribution in March with plans to begin shipping to Europe in April. In addition, given the threat of variants, we collaborated with the South African Medical Research Council on the Sisonke study, an open-label phase 3b vaccine implementation study among 500,000 frontline healthcare workers in South Africa, where the B.1.3.5.1variant has become dominant and where there is limited supportive care of wide -- or wide availability of COVID vaccines. This variant now makes up more than 60% of cases across the African continent and has been detected in more than 60 countries globally. A single-shot vaccine with demonstrated protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death can be critical tool for fighting the global pandemic, particularly with protection across countries with different variants. Last Tuesday, the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or ACIP reviewed the reports of an extremely rare disorder involving blood clots in combination with low platelets observed in a small number of individuals following vaccination with a Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. Out of an abundance of caution, the CDC and FDA recommended a pause in the use of their vaccine in the US. ACIP will reconvene this Friday and we look forward to their review and the outcome of the meeting. Johnson & Johnson made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of their vaccine in Europe and paused vaccinations in all of COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, while we've updated guidance for investigators and participants. The safety and wellbeing of the people who use our product is our number one priority. And we strongly support awareness of the signs and symptoms of this extremely rare event to ensure the correct diagnosis, appropriate treatment and expedited report by healthcare professionals. We continue to believe in the positive benefit-risk profile of our vaccine. And in view of the raise -- raging pandemic, that continues to devastate communities around the world, continue to collaborate with medical experts and global health authorities, including the CDC, FDA, EMA, the WHO and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority, SAHPRA to work toward continuing vaccination to end the global pandemic. We welcome the recent recommendation of SAHPRA to lift the paused in the investigator-led collaborative Sisonke study, provided that specific conditions are met. SAHPRA based this decision on a review of the availability -- of available safety data from Sisonke study as well as adverse event reports in the United States. We look forward to partnering with the South African Ministry of Health to resume vaccinations of healthcare workers in South Africa soon. We are looking forward to the outcome of -- from today's meeting of the European Medicines Agency, Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, the PRAC, as it is called and are looking forward to working with EMA to ensure appropriate awareness of this extremely rare event and guidance on diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Johnson & Johnson stands ready to resume shipment of its COVID-19 vaccine in Europe. In addition, we will work with member states to resume vaccinations in all Janssen COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in Europe. We remain committed to supplying 200 million doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the European Union plus Norway and Iceland. Moving on to manufacturing, the quality and safety of our COVID-19 vaccine is paramount. On April 3, we announced we would increase our oversight of drug substance manufacturing at the Emergent BioSolution's Bayview facility. Since then, we have worked closely with the U.S. government and with the FDA, including during the ongoing FDA inspection at Emergent Bayview. We will work closely with Emergent and the FDA to address any inspection findings. Our goal remains ensuring all drugs and drug substance for our COVID-19 vaccine meets a high-quality standards and securing emergency use authorization for the drug substance manufactured at Emergent Bayview. We remain committed to delivering 100 million single-shot doses of our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. government and helping to bring an end to this global pandemic. In conclusion, I want to note that, COVID-19 is the most severe global health challenge we have seen in our lifetimes. Johnson & Johnson is committed to help the world win the fight against COVID-19 and be even better prepared for possible future pandemics.

I just have two questions, centered around, the vaccine I guess, first how do you see this clotting risk issue being addressed. Is this going to be just some sort of safety warning to physicians? Or do you think that's going to be a way to identify certain populations where this might not be an appropriate vaccine? And maybe tied to that, how are you thinking about addressing public safety perceptions, given what seems to be a very rare side effect if in fact [indiscernible] once vaccinations resume. If I could just slip another quick one on vaccines in there, just want to make sure I'm clear as well. On the guidance for 2021, are there vaccine sales beyond Q1 reflective of that guidance?

Joe, can you talk a little bit you know medical device sales came in better than our expectations? Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the end markets with regard to the recovery? And can you also secondly talk about the quarterly EPS phasing. Why didn't you raise EPS guidance more despite the beat Q1 EPS is usually about 24%, 25% of full-year EPS whereas the guidance implies Q1 EPS is about 27% using that midpoint. So why not raise the guidance more?

Why don't I go first and look before I respond directly to your question, I just want to give a special shout-out to all of our frontline heroes, especially the 50,000 plus or minus associates of Johnson & Johnson who have been consistently going to work putting on their masks on the supply room floor, on the shop floor manufacturing and really enabling us to continue to serve patients and consumers around the world throughout this pandemic. Two; a very special recognition to the doctors, the scientists, the engineers who have not only been working diligently on our approach to COVID-19, but also to keep our ongoing innovation portfolio on track, and we're very thankful to them. And last but not least, all of our associates who really worked in a very agile flexible and dedicated way throughout this period. I think our results overall today demonstrate that in spite of a lot of variability, unpredictability the Johnson & Johnson remains a very consistent and in fact stronger performer today than we were even a year ago. If you look at our competitive position whether its market share on all of our major $28 billion plus platforms, if you look at our pipeline, progress and development, we clearly have continued to make progress in spite of a lot of other dynamics. So giving specifically to your question on medical -- or medical device marketplace what we would say is, we're seeing continued improvement through the first quarter. If we look at the last couple of weeks of March in the United States, most of the major systems were somewhere in the range of 90% to 105% of their performance back in 2019. If we look across Europe, of course, there's a bit more variability. Markets in Italy, for example, have lagged given the outbreak of COVID-19. In the UK, where you're seeing other markets return more than 90% to 100% range, although, we have continued to see month-to-month and even week-to-week progression across those major markets. As was alluded to in the earlier comments, we would expect that to begin to change in a pretty significant way in the second quarter. Not only as we see more vaccinations, but of course the year-on-year comparisons. And again, what I'd like to highlight is the strong performance across almost all of our medical device platforms. If you take a look at vision surgery up 11%, if you take a look at our EP business up 26%, our surgery business was well up in the double-digits across whether it was energy, biosurgery or endomechanical. Orthopedics particularly large joints, we saw lags slightly, but we know that these are more elective procedures. We feel we remain competitive and we're quite excited about our VELYS launch as well as our fixed-bearing cementless options as well. So we remain confident and actually quite optimistic for our ongoing improvement performance in our medical device sector, as we head through the remainder of the year. Joe, I'll hand it over to you for the question on EPS phasing.",527.0,250.0,12.0,7.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.048,0.028,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.02

So I think I got them all down. But I think the real short story is that I would say, on 10% sales growth, we're going to grow earnings about 18%. And so given the early nature of the year, we challenged our leadership teams and each of our segments and across our functions to see what we can invest today to benefit the future. So I'd much rather hold back $0.05 today in hopes of giving $0.10 or $0.15 next year or the year after. And that's really how we're looking at it. As we -- we have many great opportunities -- and hopefully, you noticed in our P&L, the increase in R&D investment year-over-year by $600 million. You saw the same trend last year for the full year. We're going to look to see that those opportunities, given we already started the year with very strong expectations, if some of those opportunities don't come to fruition, we'll certainly be happy to revise guidance upward later on this year.

The first one is in Vision Care. And I'm trying to parse through, how much of the delivery is easy comp share loss and/or gain and just recovery in elective procedures? And then I want to sort of put the second one on the table, which is, it sounds like orthopedics, particularly, is lagging. Do you have a view on when that may recover?

Look, in Vision Care overall, we think our performance was solid. We have seen the contact lens business in the surgery business be significantly impacted over the course of 2020. We have seen gradual improvement in the back end of last year and as we started out the first part of this year. We think our Vision Care, our contact lens business is in very good shape. We think our share position is stable to increasing. And we think we've seen, definitely, an improving position in our vision surgery business, part of that being comps, but also part of it due to new innovation launches that were mentioned earlier in Chris and Joe's comments. And we believe that our lineup for new lenses, whether it's our anti-allergy lens or multi-focal and contact lenses, and the improvement that we're seeing in our surgery business will continue to bear out in stronger performance and share gains through the year. Regarding orthopedics, as noted in our comments, we saw very strong performance, for example, in our trauma business, growing in excess of 9%. We saw good rollout in our hip business at about 3.5%. And as I mentioned in my comments, knees, which we think are, perhaps, the most elective of the procedures in terms of being able to delay, we're lagging somewhat. But the indicators are that we would expect and based upon some of the surgical planning reports that we saw, especially through the end of first quarter, that looks as though performance for second quarter and third quarter should be on good trends. And we expect that to improve as patients gain confidence to go back into the hospitals and we see systems work their way through backlogs and, of course, in our business being global, as we see Europe come more back online as well following vaccinations as we move through the second and third quarters.

With respect to the impact of, I'd say, COVID-19 vaccine investing, in the quarter, it was, let's call it, between $0.05 and $0.10 for the quarter. I'm not overly concerned about that because, as you heard from Paul, we are going through the rigor of the scientific reviews. It appears that there is a very path forward that we'll find out about here in the next couple of days. And we're going to do all we can to make sure that that important solution to address the global pandemic gets back into the marketplace.

You have -- consumer is up about 8% this quarter versus first quarter of 2019. So again that suggests a strong underlying business. Pharmaceuticals is up about 17.5% and medical devices is approaching 4% on that same comparison. But I would say that's a very strong 4% when you consider we still have as you heard in our commentary many delayed procedures or paused elective procedures in the marketplace which simply didn't exist in the first quarter of 2019. So across all three parts of our business, I think, there's a real good takeaway there that the business is healthy and strong.

Obviously that's a fluid situation. Then I'll turn it over to Joaquin and Paul for your other questions. With respect to tax reform, we've shared a lot of rhetoric about a race to a bottom. I don't know why folks are anxious to have a race to the top in terms of rates either. And I can give you one example in one industry and that's Johnson & Johnson where when tax reform was passed in 2017 we committed to increasing our investment in the US by 15% over the upcoming four years versus the preceding four years. We are on track to actually invest about 25% more in the US over that four year period. And that's more than $30 billion. Now what does that mean in terms of the US economy? It means more jobs. I mean, we -- as Johnson & Johnson employ 3,000 more people today than we did before the passage of the 2017 act. So, I think when you look at where the US sits with respect to OECD countries, right now we're at the middle of the pack, maybe even skewing a little bit toward the bottom in terms of competitiveness. If we were to raise rates even to 25% and you include tax from states, we become the highest-rated developed country in the world with respect to tax rates. So, I think it's something that we need a little more fact-based dialogue on and making sure that we remain competitive, that the US becomes a source of innovation across all industries. And we don't floor the innovation and competitive spirit that has been successful over the recent times, even in addressing many of the concerns and solutions with respect to COVID-19 we've seen in the past year where many US-based companies have stepped up.

So we continue to expect that there will be pressure to do something to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs. And in that context, the industry could potentially be seen again as a pay-for in another budget reconciliation package for ACA reform or infrastructure legislation. We believe that the negotiations in that regard could be collaborative and that the overall value that innovation -- it's bringing to society, as highlighted by our contributions in COVID-19, will be understood. So that's the way we see it. Now, we think that the most important thing in any price bill or any price reform is to be sure that patients experience an reduction in the out-of-pocket costs and Johnson & Johnson will be a constructive partner in that regard. We think that also that patient cost setting should be based on the net price of medicines, and in that sense we continue to support that type of reform. I also want to take a step back and look at our Pharmaceutical business in the context of pricing reform. I believe that the type of portfolio and growth that we have plays out very well in this situation. Our growth has been based on volume. Our net price declined in 2020 5.7%, and this is the fourth consecutive year that we have net price declines. And we are able and ready to grow in that environment based on having a very broad-based portfolio with 11 products of more than $1 billion, and an R&D-based model that allow us to have a very differentiated pipeline. In the -- in 2020, we invested $9.6 billion in R&D, which is about two times what we invest in sales and marketing. So, we believe that these negotiations could be collaborative and that in that context the Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical business is especially well-positioned based on our ability to drive growth based on volume and in our very broadly diversified portfolio. So, about our BCMA CAR-T that we filed in the first quarter of 2020 that was an important milestone in our pipeline. Our initial indication, it's going to be for patients with multiple myeloma that have progressed on available established therapies. Over time, we see BCMA CAR-T, and our BCMA CAR-T specifically progressing into earlier lines of therapy. You could see a moment in which young and fit patients may have BCMA CAR-T as a first-line therapy in an intent to build regimens that are curative.

Look as Paul said, our goal remains ensuring that all drug substance for our COVID-19 vaccine meets our high-quality standards and at the same time that we secure Emergency Use Authorization for the drug substance manufactured at the Emergent Bayview facility. At this time, as we continue in discussions with the FDA, it is premature to speculate on any potential impact that this may have on our timing of our vaccine deliveries. So we will expect to work with the FDA, to work this inspection this -- to close this inspection this week and then we will work with the FDA and Emergent to address those inspections findings.

And then just real quick to build on Alex's comment maybe just to give you a little bit of color. We're obviously looking at procedures closely surgical procedures imaging as well. Diagnostics is actually outpacing surgical procedures accelerated through the quarter. It's almost in line with where we were pre-pandemic. So that's a positive sign, although the situation of course remains fluid. And then many important procedures such as colorectal again sequentially improved through the quarter and actually grew year-over-year. So again, we're seeing positive signs across. And I think you saw that in our results and pockets of our businesses advanced surgery for example growing over 14%. So we're continuing to look at everything. The situation remains fluid, but there's definitely positive signs on the trends that we're seeing. Thanks, Danielle.

So I've got one sort of utilization-related question on procedure trends and then I have a follow-up for Alex, if I could on digital strategy. So first, device is up 8.8%, stronger than The Street was expecting. The mix also a bit stronger than expected on advanced surgery and maybe a little bit slower as it's come up in the Q&A here than expected in knees which you mentioned Alex is a couple of times being more deferrable. The question is should we read through this as a bit of a shift to higher acuity procedures at least within your portfolio? And then maybe how should we see the recent rise in hospitalizations potentially affecting the trajectory of recovery over these procedures over the next months and quarters? And then as I mentioned, I have one follow-up on digital.",147.0,64.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.03125,0.046875,0.046875,0.0,0.0,-0.015625

Look Matt, overall, I wouldn't read too much into just these recent results regarding a significant shift overall in our portfolio. I mean, we remain very committed and optimistic about the underlying unmet need and demand across our surgical portfolio, our orthopedics portfolio and our vision care portfolio. But as we alluded to earlier, there are some procedures that in terms of your ability to defer and how elective they truly are that may have a near-term impact on timing. So look overall, if we look at our underlying trends not only versus 2020, but as was noted earlier also versus 2019, we're seeing growth rates consistent overall with what we see for this market. We think this market has the opportunity to grow at about the 5% range over the long-term. And we've been very explicit in our goal to grow at or faster than the markets where we compete. That's number one. Number two, we're actually very excited about some of the opportunities that we have for launches. I think, in total, we have more than 21 major launches lined up in our medical device business for this year. We mentioned specifically in the knee area VELYS as well as our ATTUNE cementless fixed bearing, which we think will offer us a real competitive opportunity to generate additional growth in that area. The QDOT MICRO is another great add-on in our EP business that is already growing in excess of 20%. And if you look across our EndoMech, our energy business here too we've got really nice add-on innovations as well as throughout our vision care portfolio. And of course, longer-term the significant opportunity that we see in digital surgery that team has continued to make very solid progress. And we're excited about the long-term prospects there as well. So, now overall, we see a lot of opportunity across our medical device portfolio.",331.0,163.0,10.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.06134969325153374,0.012269938650306749,0.006134969325153374,0.0,0.006134969325153374,0.049079754601226995

You mentioned robotic knee system's on track. Monarch, obviously leading the market in robotic-assisted lung and Ottava is sort of tracking through clinicals and validation. The question is, is what else -- you've built out this portfolio artificial -- in some artificial intelligence robotic surgery applications and technology, what are the white spaces? Where else do you see investments within digital?",77.0,40.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.025,0.0,0.0,0.0

And first of all, if we just look at the overall penetration rate of digital surgery, it's about 10% in the United States. It's just a couple of percent on a global basis. And so we think, if you consider the overall trends of how technology can be utilized in some of these procedures, if you take a look at our global footprint, we think we will be well positioned there in the long-term. As you mentioned our team has continued to make good progress. We said from the very beginning, look we're building this for the decades, we're not just building this for the next quarter. And we're optimistic about the progress that team has been making to ensure that we've got a platform that one can truly make a difference for patients in surgery; that two that's differentiated; and three that also allows us to integrate not only the robotics aspect, but also the digital component that we think long-term can truly help show very significant differences in surgical outcomes. And also just to give you one example of an application. We mentioned this before, but in Johnson & Johnson right now, I think this exemplifies the unique nature of our diverse portfolio. Several years ago we embarked on something that we call the lung cancer initiative. And as we know, unfortunately, lung cancer continues to kill more people than just about any other type of cancer. And we know that -- all too often patients are diagnosed far too late in the process. And we are quite excited about an early application with Monarch where we're not only able to go out and potentially do a diagnostic procedure through bronchoscopy to identify for example lung nodules, but we're working right now on how can we deliver oncolytic agents, viruses and other immune-type agents locally. And how could we really think about the treatment paradigm being shifted in the way that we fundamentally think about lung cancer by combining pharma, medical device some of these technologies in very new, unique and innovative ways. So still much more work to be done, but we're very excited about some of the early prospects that we've seen thus far. And again, I think, it exemplifies, kind of, our unique position to bring these different clinical development, discovery as well as regulatory capabilities and eventually commercial together.",424.0,201.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.03980099502487562,0.004975124378109453,0.009950248756218905,0.004975124378109453,0.0,0.03482587064676617

Recently there's been some new post-marketing data reported for Xeljanz and the FDA pushed out the PDUFA dates of several JAK inhibitors. You guys are developing a pan-JAK inhibitor for IBD.

Look, I'm not going to comment on the safety of the oral JAK inhibitors. What I can tell you is that we have a very strong and robust pipeline in immunology driven by our three existing assets; Symfony, Stelara and Tremfya. Stelara and Tremfya had very strong quarters with close to 40% growth in Tremfya and 15% in Stelara. In Stelara, we continue to grow share in GI both in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And Tremfya is the first and only IL-23 that does have both indications PSA and PSO and it's continued to gain share in both areas. Moving forward, we are excited about our possibilities in immunology with our oral agents. As you mentioned one, we have two in Phase 2. One of them is a pan-JAK oral that we think could be important. We'll have to see the data. And broadly in immunology, we also are excited about the possibilities of nipocalimab, which is our FcRn antibody in pathways that are auto antibody-mediated with very rare diseases that could create a pipeline in a product. So for us, immunology remains a core area of growth and focus and we believe we are in a very strong position to continue to drive growth in the coming years, but even beyond 2025 too.",225.0,86.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.06976744186046512,0.011627906976744186,0.05813953488372093,0.011627906976744186,0.0,0.05813953488372093

So you can see that R&D investment incrementally paying off. With respect to your second question regarding supply, I want to be respectful of the process by which the regulators are going through.

This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our Company's review of business results for the Second Quarter and our updated financial outlook for 2021. Joining me on today's call is Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.  Also joining Joe and myself during the Q&A portion of the call will be Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Pharmaceuticals, Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Consumer Health, and Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Medical Devices.  A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson and Johnson web site at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules.  Please note that today's presentation includes Forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the Company's actual results, to differ materially from those projected.  In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means the results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business results and outlook, is a best estimate, based on the information available as of today's date.  A further description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures, utilized for today's discussion, to the most comparable GAAP measures are also available at investor.J&J.com.  Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. I will review the second quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments.  Joe will provide insights about our cash position and capital allocation deployment, and will outline our updated guidance, inclusive of the COVID-19 vaccine for 2021. Then we will begin the Q&A session with each of the segment leaders providing a brief update on their respective businesses.  The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 75 minutes.  Now, let's move to the second quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.3 billion for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 27.1% versus the second quarter of 2020.  Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 23% as currency had a positive impact of 4.1 points. In the U.S., sales increased 24.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 29.5%.  Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 20.9%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 8.6 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 23.8% worldwide, 25.1% in the U.S. and 22.4% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings.  For the quarter, net earnings were $6.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.35, versus diluted earnings per share of $1.36 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.6 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.48, representing increases of 49% and 48.5% respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2020.  On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 44.9%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you.  Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2020, and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.7 billion and increased 9.2%, with increases in the U.S. of 12.4% and growth of 6.3% outside of the U.S.  Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 10%. Year-to-date adjusted operational growth was 3.3% and is more reflective of performance given the quarterly fluctuations of COVID-19 impacts.  The over-the-counter medicines grew 8.9% globally, driven by strong growth in ZYRTEC, due to both the timing of and increased incidents in the allergy season. Digestive Health grew double-digits driven by U.S. PEPCID, new SKU stocking in the Club Channel, coupled with share growth and increased COVID-19 related healthcare professional recommendations for the hydration benefit offering, ORSL, in the Asia Pacific region.  The skin health beauty franchise grew 12.9% globally, with the U.S. increasing 23% and OUS increasing 1.4%. Skin health beauty outside the U.S. was negatively impacted by approximately 300 basis points due to divestitures.  Worldwide growth was driven by market recovery in key markets, increased U.S. stocking for new products, and comparisons to COVID -19 related destocking dynamics. NEUTROGENA and AVEENO delivered strong performance in the U.S., primarily due to market recovery, new product innovation, and higher stocking due to the NEUTROGENA rapid firming product launch, partially offset by competitive pressures. OGX and [Indiscernible] growth was driven by share gains and market growth in hair care.  Oral Care grew 2.5% globally due to strong OUS performance for LISTERINE, reflecting accelerated category and increased demand from continued successful promotional campaigns. Divestitures in the quarter, negatively impacted results by 310 basis points.  The Baby Care franchise grew by 5% as a result of market recovery and OUS strength in Johnson's and AVEENO Baby in eCommerce. Wound Care delivered strong growth of 13.4%, driven by U.S. market growth with increased consumer behaviors focused on preparedness and infection prevention, and seasonal stocking versus prior year COVID-19 destocking dynamics.  Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.6 billion grew 13.6%, with strength in both the U.S. increasing by 12.2% and OUS with sales increasing by 15.4%. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 14.1%. Global sales in the quarter included a $164 million contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine.  Additionally, as a reminder for comparison purposes, Q2 of 2020 was negatively impacted by access-related constraints due to COVID-19, resulting in a decrease of roughly 300 to 350 basis points in total across key brands. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continues to enable us to deliver strong adjusted operational growth at above market levels.  Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 17%, driven by strong double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. STELARA continued to show strength in all regions, growing at 30.5% driven by increased market growth and share gains, with U.S. share increasing roughly 4 points in Crohn's disease and nearly 8 points in ulcerative colitis. TREMFYA was up 36.8% with strong double-digit growth worldwide due to share gains, continued global expansion into new markets, and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication that was approved in 2020.  U.S. share increased over 2 points in psoriasis and nearly 3 points in psoriatic arthritis in the quarter. Our oncology portfolio delivered another strong quarter with growth of 21.5%. DARZALEX continued its exceptional performance trajectory growing 53.8%, driven by share gains and increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU.  DARZALEX continues to grow share across all lines of therapy, with nearly 4 points of share growth in Line 1 in the U.S. this quarter. ERLEADA also continued its global momentum with growth of 73.7% in the quarter, driven by market share, which increased by nearly 2 points across indications, and penetration gains, especially in the metastatic indication.  IMBRUVICA grew 12.5% globally due to volume gains driven by our market-leading share, but was partially offset by modest share losses in the U.S. to novel oral competition and a market that remains slightly depressed due to temporary COVID-19 impacts on new patient starts.  In neuroscience, our paliperidone long-acting portfolio had strong double-digit growth of 10.6%, driven by market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency. Cardiovascular, metabolism, other declined 7.3% this quarter, driven by continued biosimilar competition for PROCRIT and competitive pressures in INVOKANA, which was partially offset by growth of 1.8% in XARELTO due to continued demand strength.  Lastly, our pulmonary hypertension portfolio achieved growth of 8.7% with OPSUMIT growth of 11.9% and UPTRAVI growth of 9.8%, both driven by market penetration and share gains. I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment.  Worldwide medical devices sales of $7 billion grew 57.2%, with the U.S. increasing 77.2% and OUS increasing 41.9%, primarily due to the recovery of procedures from COVID-19 restrictions that occurred in the second quarter of 2020, coupled with the success of recently launched products and commercial activities across the business.  Selling days had a minor positive impact on growth this quarter. We expect the full-year impact from selling days, excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2020, to be minimal. Given the extent of the procedure disruption from COVID-19 in 2020, I thought it may be helpful to provide context for our current quarter performance versus the second quarter of 2019.  Worldwide Medical Devices grew about 7% versus Q2 2019, with 8 of our 11 billion-dollar platforms showing growth versus 2019. The pace of market recovery in knees, spine, and vision-surgical, has been slower than the other markets in which we compete as these procedures are perceived to be more deferrable by patients.  Geographically, both the U.S. and Asia-Pacific markets surpassed Q2 2019. While EMEA and Latin America markets have been slower to recover, and Q2 results remained at or below 2019 levels. Looking at results for each of our platforms, Interventional Solutions delivered another strong quarter with worldwide growth of 71.3% and strong double-digit growth versus the second quarter of 2019.  Electrophysiology reinforced our global market share leadership position growing 74.4%, driven by recovery in the market coupled with our market expansion activities, the strength of our broad-based portfolio, and new products.  Worldwide orthopaedics delivered 48.6% growth versus the prior year, driven primarily by market recovery and success of newer product launches. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 24.8%, reflecting market recovery, strength of our comprehensive portfolio, and success of newer product introductions.  This quarter, we expanded our market-leading portfolio of products with the launch of a next-generation Variable Angle Clavicle Plate System designed to enhance plate to bone fit on a broad range of patients and simplify implant selection for the surgeon.  And we launched an advanced tibial nailing system, designed to provide a more stable implant solution and create efficiency within the healthcare system by streamlining instrumentation across our portfolio.  Worldwide hips grew 68.1% this quarter, driven by market recovery, our continued leadership position in the anterior approach, demand for the ACTIS Stem, aided by our other enabling technologies, such as VELYS Hip Navigation and innovative commercial programs focused on expanding coverage and access for hip fracture patients in parts of Europe and Latin America.  Knees returned to growth this quarter, increasing 94.6% globally, primarily due to market recovery. Results reflect continued COVID-19 challenges and the related impact on procedures in markets like India, Japan, and Australia, and other dynamics, including faster recovery trends in primary knee procedures compared to revisions.  This quarter, we began commercialization of our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution for total knee procedures in the U.S. We believe this launch, along with our differentiated VELYS Digital Solutions and ATTUNE knee platform, including the second half 2021 launch of ATTUNE Cementless Fixed Bearing Knee with AFFIXIUM 3D Printed Technology, will enhance our portfolio and competitiveness as procedures continue to recover.  Spine returned to worldwide growth this quarter, increasing 51.7%, reflecting market recovery and positive impact from recently launched products, SYMFONY, CONDUIT and FIBERGRAFT, as well as strategic partnerships which further enhance our offerings, such as the X-Pac Expandable Cage.  Advanced Surgery grew 44.3% versus prior - year. In addition to the positive impact of procedure recovery, Biosurgery delivered sales growth of 48% and positive share momentum driven by new products and commercial strategies to expand market penetration and adoption. Endocutters and Energy both grew around 40% globally, primarily due to procedure recovery, new product introductions, and China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion activities, partially offset by competitive pressure in the U.S.  We also achieved a significant milestone within the quarter with our Monarch robotic platform, surpassing a 100 customers and 8,000 procedures. General surgery grew 67.8% globally, with Wound Closure growing 50.1% globally, driven by recovery in the markets, continued strength of our market-leading suture portfolio, including our Plus sutures and STRATAFIX Barb suture family, and a change in channel inventory levels in the U.S., contributing about 6 points to global growth.  Global General Surgery sales were positively impacted by 23 points due to a prior-year unfavorable pricing adjustment in the U.S., we communicated last year. Worldwide Vision grew 66% this quarter, primarily driven by market recovery. U.S. Contact Lens growth of 73.6% reflects the strength of our market-leading ACUVUE Portfolio.  Commercial initiatives, such as our Prioritize Your Eyes campaign, launched to raise awareness around the importance of routine screenings, new products, including early success from ACUVUE Multifocal, and an inventory build contributing about 5 points. Growth outside the U.S. of 43.1% reflects market recovery and strength of ACUVUE 1-DAY, and recent Asia-Pacific ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH Beauty launch.  Global Surgical Vision delivered growth of a 115.8%, driven by market recovery and positive momentum related to new products like TECNIS Eyhance, TECNIS Synergy, which both launched this year in the U.S. market, and VERITAS, our next-generation phacoemulsification device.  Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the Second Quarter of 2021, please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. You will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As reported this morning, our adjusted EPS of $2.48 reflects a reported increase of 48.5% and an operational increase of 44.9%.  I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Cost of products sold improved by 340 basis points, primarily driven by the recovery in Medical Device from prior-year COVID-19 related inventory impacts and fixed cost deleveraging.  Selling, marketing, and administrative margins improved 110 basis points due to the recovery of Medical Device sales from the prior year's negative COVID-19 impact. We continue to invest in Research and Development at competitive levels, investing 14.6% of sales this quarter.  The $3.4 billion investment was a 25% increase versus the prior year due to portfolio progression. The Other Income and Expense Line showed Net income of $488 million in the Second Quarter of 2021 compared to net expense of 24 million in the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to reduced litigation-related items, partially offset by lower unrealized gains on securities.  Regarding taxes in the quarter, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate declined from 8% in the second quarter of 2020 to 5.8% in the second quarter of 2021, primarily driven by a one-time tax benefit the Company recognized in the second quarter 2021, resulting from an internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. In the second quarter of 2020, the Company recorded additional tax benefits related to the transitional provisions of Swiss tax reform, which benefited the 2020 tax rate.  Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 14.8% versus 16.7% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our 10-Q for additional details on specific tax matters. Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment.  In the second quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 29.1% to 33.4%. The following are the main drivers of change to the adjusted income before tax by segment.  Medical Devices margin improved from 1.2% to 28.6% driven primarily by overall expense leveraging, resulting from the COVID-19 related sales recovery. Consumer health margins improved by 380 basis points, primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies, including the benefit from our SKU rationalization program, partially offset by increased investments in brand marketing expenses.  Pharmaceutical margins decreased by 450 basis points, primarily driven by increased research and development investment, inclusive of the COVID-19 vaccine net costs, and general portfolio progression. Moving to important developments, here is a slide summarizing notable developments occurring in the second quarter.  I'll highlight a few, starting with our Pharmaceutical business. We continue to make positive progress advancing our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and therapies. As we've shared previously, we are rigorous and focusing on differentiated, transformational medical innovation.  In the quarter, we announced our decision not to continue the collaboration and license agreement for Cusatuzumab, an investigational therapeutic antibody that targets CD70. The decision is based upon Janssen's review of all available data and in consideration of the evolving standard of care for the treatment of AML.  We received EU approval for PONVORY in relapsing multiple sclerosis, and also U.S. approval of RYBREVANT for the treatment of patients with locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor Exon 20 Insertion Mutations.  In addition, we completed our EU filing for Cilta-Cel, a BCMA CAR-T for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We anticipate U.S. approval for our BCMA CAR-T later this year, which will represent a third NME approval this year.  Within our Medical Device portfolio, we continue to make meaningful advancements in our innovation pipeline, launching 17 major first-country launches in the first half of 2021, including 8 products this quarter. As noted earlier, we received FDA approval and launched TECNIS Synergy and TECNIS Synergy Toric II intraocular lenses in the U.S.  These are next-generation presbyopia correcting lenses, and deliver the widest range of continuous vision, and the best near vision among leading PC IOLs. Finally, within the surgery business, the ENSEAL X1 Curved Jaw Tissue S sealer launched in the U.S., expanding the Ethicon advanced bipolar energy portfolio.  That concludes the sales P&L and pipeline highlights for Johnson & Johnson 's Second Quarter. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.",2963.0,1716.0,84.0,27.0,22.0,1.0,2.0,13.0,7.0,30.0,0.04895104895104895,0.015734265734265736,0.01282051282051282,0.0005827505827505828,0.0011655011655011655,0.033216783216783216
JNJ,2021-07-21,2021-07-21,,2021-07-21,2021-07-21T08:30:00-04:00,0,2021-07-21,qa,qna_heading,Joseph Wolk,"Thank you, Chris. Good morning. And thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our strong first half of 2021, specifically the high growth we experienced in the second quarter, and our updated outlook for the balance of the year. I hope everyone is having a safe, healthy, and enjoyable summer.  As Chris referenced, Johnson & Johnson 's businesses remain leaders, or are better positioned, within the markets in which they compete. While the pandemic makes it difficult to reliably gauge what results will be in any given quarter, you likely noticed that all three segments beat your expectations.  We continue to be poised for further growth and value creation not just in 2021, but more importantly for 2022 and beyond. Over the past 18 months, our people have been a driving force behind our success. And guided by our credo, they have demonstrated resilience and agility while remaining committed to ensuring our life-saving medicines and products reach patients and consumers around the world.  Thanks to the efforts of our 136,000 colleagues across the world, Johnson & Johnson continues to make significant strides towards our mission of improving human health and well-being of everyone, everywhere. Foundational to any healthy business is a focus and commitment to broader stakeholder stewardship.  We are proud to share the progress we are making in a transparent and accountable manner. A few weeks ago, we held our annual ESG Investor Update following the publication of our 2020 Health for Humanity report and our 2025 goals. Through these goals, we aim to deliver even greater long-term value to our broad set of stakeholders.  I hope you had the opportunity to view this webcast. If you have not, the replay is still available on the Johnson & Johnson website. Let's get into the results with an update on our cash position. We continue to generate strong free cash flow, with approximately $8 billion year-to-date.  We ended the second quarter with approximately $25 billion of cash in marketable securities and approximately $33 billion of debt, resulting in $8 billion of net debt. Our financial position and balance sheet remains strong. As we enter the back half of the year, we are well-positioned to continue to deploy capital in a strategic, value-creating way that will benefit stakeholders over the long term.  Our dividend remains a key priority. And during the quarter, we distributed $2.8 billion to shareholders. Regarding M&A, we continually evaluate strategic opportunities that have the potential to further enhance our business, while also driving better health outcomes for patients and consumers.  Since Chris covered highlights from our second quarter performance and our worldwide shares will provide sector-specific commentary to open the Q&A session. I will now move directly to providing the update to our full-year 2021 guidance, which reflects our strong year-to-date performance.  For clarity, I will first comment on our core business revenue and then remark on our anticipated COVID-19 vaccine revenue, which is now included in our enterprise guidance. For full-year 2021, we continue to expect our base business defined as excluding our COVID-19 vaccine to remain strong.  Based on this confidence, we are increasing and tightening our adjusted operational sales range to 9.5% to 10.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we manage our business performance.  We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, which accounts for previously completed divestitures in Medical Devices, Consumer Health, as well as within other oncology in Pharmaceuticals, resulting in an operational sales range of 9% to 10%, or $90 billion to $90.8 billion for a midpoint of 9.5% or $90.4 billion.  While we don't predict currency movements, utilizing the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.18, and in consideration of other currency movements, there is no change from our previous estimates, resulting in favorable currency impact of $1.3 billion or a year-over-year increase of 150 basis points.  This results in estimated reported sales in the range of $91.3 billion to $92.1 billion, an increase of 10.5% to 11.5%, or 11% at the midpoint versus 2020. Now, a few words on the expected contribution of our COVID-19 vaccine to our updated full-year 2021 guidance.  Our goal has always been to bring forth our scientific capabilities and resources to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine that would complement other measures to end the global pandemic. We are proud to have been part of the unprecedented collaboration in the healthcare industry that has led to a number of authorized vaccines in the marketplace.  Chris shared earlier that we recorded vaccine revenue in the quarter. Specifically, our COVID-19 vaccine contributed a $164 million in revenue in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $264 million. At this point, revenue from the first half of the year was provisionally recorded at $5 per dose, given that volumes during the pandemic period were uncertain. Currently, we expect the ultimate final not-for-profit price could be as much as $8 per dose.  The final not-for-profit price will fluctuate until the end of the year when we know precisely all the variables that go into the calculation, namely the net cost incurred, as well as, volumes produced during the pandemic period. Given the firm contracts we have in place, pending advanced purchase agreements, we expect to recognize vaccine sales of approximately $2.5 billion in 2021, with more than half of that revenue likely to occur in the fourth quarter.  Regarding vaccine manufacturing, we continue to expand our global network to include 10 manufacturing sites for various stages of production. On July 2nd, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use approved an expansion of our facility in the Netherlands increasing our capacity to produce active drug substance.  The FDA also released 5 batches of drug substance manufactured at the Emergent BioSolution's Bayview facility under the Emergency Use Authorization, and we continue to work with health authorities on the approval of additional drug substance manufactured at Emergent.  Now, I do appreciate that many of you are understandably looking beyond 2021-2022. It is simply too early to provide specific information on a 2022 outlook for our COVID-19 vaccine, given the uncertainty on the need for boosters and new variance. But as recent published clinical data indicates, our vaccine appears to have durability for at least eight months and is effective against the recent Delta variant and other highly prevalent viral variance.  At this time, I'd caution you to wait to include future-year vaccine projections in your models for our business. The COVID-19 vaccine market will continue to evolve, and we look forward to sharing additional details as more data become available, including the role our vaccine will play for you to forecast future years.  Given this and what I already provided on our base business, our new updated guidance expectations are reflected on this slide, reflecting an enterprise total revenue of $94.2 billion at the midpoint. Moving to other items of the P&L. We are now expecting our operating margins to be nearly a 200 basis point improvement over last year, slightly less than our prior guidance as we continue to invest for the long term.  We are increasing our other income estimate to a range of $800 million to $900 million. This increase is primarily attributable to increased investment returns related to our employee benefit programs. As a reminder, pension service costs are recorded in operating expenses, while any investment performance related to our employee benefit programs are recorded in other income net expense.  Moving to interest expense. Based on our year-to-date experience, we are lowering our estimate to a range of 100 million to 200 million. Finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate to a range of 16.0% to 17.0% based on certain one-time benefits realized in the first half of the year. The results of these updates translate to increasing our earnings guidance.  We are also tightening the guidance range. The new adjusted operational per share guidance range is 18.4% to 19.6%, or $9.50 to $9.60, with a midpoint of 19% or $9.55 per share. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some direction on the impact of currency fluctuations on our reported adjusted EPS, we expect a slight change from what we communicated on the Q1 earnings call.  Currency will now impact EPS by 1.2% or $0.10 per share. Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.60 to $9.70 or a midpoint of $9.65, increasing 20.2%. Consistent with what we shared before, given the not-for-profit nature of the vaccine, there is no significant EPS contribution in 2021, and therefore, the EPS guidance I provided is inclusive of the vaccine revenue.  I am now pleased and want to thank our worldwide shares, Jennifer Taubert, Thibaut Mongon, and Ashley McEvoy, for their participation in the Q&A portion of our call today. I know this audience values having these leaders on earnings calls from time-to-time.  Before we jump into the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to ask Jennifer, Thibaut, and Ashley, each to provide a brief business segment update and qualitative outlook for the remainder of 2021. Jennifer, let's start with the Pharmaceutical segment.",1526.0,808.0,19.0,7.0,20.0,1.0,2.0,10.0,4.0,5.0,0.023514851485148515,0.008663366336633664,0.024752475247524754,0.0012376237623762376,0.0024752475247524753,0.01485148514851485

I'd like to start by thanking my Janssen colleagues around the world for their relentless focus on delivering for patients. As a result, I'm proud to share that our Pharmaceutical sector had another strong quarter of above-market growth.  As you heard from Chris, our Pharmaceuticals business delivered $12.6 billion in worldwide sales in the second quarter, with adjusted operational growth of approximately 14%. Our base business, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, demonstrated robust growth at 12.6%. This is our third consecutive quarter with sales exceeding $12 billion, and our growth was broadly based across geographic regions and our therapeutic area.  We continue to maximize the value of our industry-leading portfolio, delivering double-digit growth for 9 key brands, including our oncology medicines, DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, and ERLEADA, our immunology medicines, TREMFYA and STELARA, our pulmonary hypertension medicines, OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI, and INVEGA SUSTENNA and TRINZA in our neuroscience portfolio.  Our leading commercial and market access capabilities enabled increased market penetration and share gains across our key promoted brands. And as we shared in our transparency report this year, our growth continues to come from volume gains and not price.  This is a strong indication that our life-changing medicines are reaching more patients each day worldwide. It's important to note, we continue to be a trough investor in research and development. This investment fuels our pipeline and builds the foundation for our long-term growth.  During the second quarter, we continued to deliver on our pipeline of transformational medicines. I'll highlight just a few of the key milestones and achievements. First, in May, the FDA approved amivantamab now known as RYBREVANT. This is the first by-specific antibody approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, characterized by EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.  This is our first approved treatment for lung cancer, which we hope will be an important area for us going forward. This is our second NME approval of this year. PONVORY, or ponesimod, was our first 2021 NME approval, and this was by the FDA in March, for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. In the second quarter, it was also approved by the European Commission and Health Canada.  We also advanced our BCMA CAR-T cell therapy program, Cilta-Cel, for patients with multiple myeloma. In the second quarter, the U.S. FDA granted our BCMA CAR-T priority review. A marketing authorization was filed with the European Medicines Agency, and submission was made to the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency.  We anticipate FDA approval of Cilta-Cel as our third NME approval later this year. In addition, our subcutaneous form of DARZALEX continues to benefit an increasing number of patients. In the second quarter, the European Commission approved DARZALEX for 2 additional patient populations; as combination therapy for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed systemic light chain amyloidosis, which is the first and only approved therapy for this rare and life-threatening blood disorder; and as combination therapy for adults with pretreated multiple myeloma.  Additionally, subsequent to the quarter, the FDA -approved DARZALEX FASPRO in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma after first or subsequent relapse, our sixth indication specific to our subcutaneous form of DARZALEX. I'm proud of our Pharmaceutical results in the second quarter and feel confident in our ability to make 2021 our tenth consecutive year of above-market growth.  Our outlook for the rest of the year remains strong. Before I close, I'd like to invite you to join us for our Pharmaceuticals business review on November 18. We look forward to sharing a comprehensive overview of our business, our robust pipeline, and our long-term growth outlook.  We'll cover our key therapeutic areas, including oncology and immunology, which are always areas of high interest, and we'll delve deeper into some of our newer areas, including our retina and gene therapy pipeline, and the details behind the breadth of our auto antibody program that came through our acquisition of MOMENTA last year.  I hope you'll be able to join us. So again, it's a pleasure to have this opportunity to connect with you today.

I would like to start by congratulating my Consumer Health colleagues for their continued focus on flawlessly executing against our strategy. Last year we focused on execution across our broad-based portfolio, delivered solid results, growing 3% operationally. And this year, we continue to demonstrate a strong level of performance.  The strategy we set a couple of years ago for the Consumer Health segment to be focused on personal health with science-based, professionally endorsed brands, and advancing our digital capabilities, continues to strengthen our ability to meet the needs of our consumers and customers worldwide, resulting in strong quarterly results and solid year-to-date performance.  Our Consumer Health sector grew 9.2% operationally in the quarter and 2.7% on a year-to-date basis. Our adjusted operational growth for Acquisitions and Divestitures was 10% in the quarter and 3.3% on a year-to-date basis.  And as Chris stated in his remarks, these year-to-date results are a better representation of our performance given the fluctuations we've seen in the market due to COVID-19 dynamics and seasonality overall. We saw strong year-to-date performance for brands in our two strongholds such as ZYRTEC, PEPCID, and NICORETTE in OTC, or AVEENO, NEUTROGENA, and OGX in Skin Health.  In our specialty areas, brands like LISTERINE, AVEENO Baby, and BAND-AID also contributed nicely to our year-to-date results. And from a geographic perspective, we are encouraged to see that we grew across all regions in the quarter. Now, if we look into the future, even if we will continue to see variability in categories depending on seasonality and local market conditions, we are confident that our strategy is working.  We have the right portfolio to continue to deliver solid results; well balanced, both in terms of categories we compete in, and in terms of geographic presence. And lastly, we have been able to achieve our solid sales results while simultaneously improving our margin profile. Our efforts on end-to-end profitability improvement, including portfolio optimization and network improvements, have delivered to plan.  Our year-to-date adjusted IBT is approximately 27%, or another 250 basis point improvement over last year. We have made great strides in increasing our profitability to become a leader within our peer set.  And we will continue to look for opportunities to improve our margin profile, while at the same time investing to grow the topline, launching new products, and Chris referenced some of them in his remarks, and managing through anticipated higher commodity and distribution costs in the back half of 2021.  So in a nutshell, Consumer Health delivered a strong quarter and a solid first half. Our strategy is working and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver profitable growth in line with the categories and market in which we compete.

Let me just begin with across JNJ, how privileged we feel to work in healthcare because we recognize that what we do matters, especially now. We're united by our purpose to profoundly change the trajectory of Health for Humanity and we're propelled by our MedTech aspiration to re-imagine the future of health today, in three ways. One is innovating across the continuum of patient care, two is prioritizing and modernizing health, and three is promoting health equity and wellness.  We continue to see strong evidence that our focus and actions to impact human health and improve our competitiveness is working. This quarter, MedTech delivered sales of $7 billion, representing adjusted operational growth of 59% versus 2020 and, as Chris mentioned, up 7% versus 2019, bringing our first half of 2021 revenue performance to just over 5% compared to 2019. Our sales reflect market recovery and our positive competitive momentum.  Eight of our $11 billion MedTech platforms grew versus the second quarter 2019. And quarter one '21 share trends show, that we have maintained or gained share in ten of these platforms. We have an exciting pipeline, and we've achieved some truly amazing results in the first half of this year which position us well to continue our growth momentum. We've launched 17 major products in the first half of 2021. This is the highest number of first-half of the year launches in 5 years for our business. These include products which will strengthen our core like TECNIS SYNERGY, our most advanced premier intraocular lens in surgical vision; and the ENSEAL X1 Curved Tissue Sealer, a next-generation advanced energy solution in our surgery franchise. We continue to focus on significant global health concerns, including myopia management, where we plan to have a portfolio of solutions for patients. And we are progressing all things digital with solutions covering the entire paradigm of care, including open and laparoscopic procedures, orthopedics, and illuminal, interventional and vision. Our Monarch platform achieved a significant milestone reaching over 100 customers and enabling over 8000 bronchoscopies, which is life-changing, and potentially life-saving, in the detection and treatment of lung cancer. VELYS, our robotic assisted solution for total knee procedures, launched in the United States and received regulatory approval in Australia this month. We're extremely pleased with the early customer engagement and feedback confirming the differentiation of this next-generation solution. And Ottava, our soft tissue digital surgery offering, continues to progress its key development milestones. We also recognize that the digitization of healthcare is happening and rapidly accelerating technology like this, making it possible to deliver new ways of care. An example of this is from our innovative team in China to develop the virtual solution powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning to more effectively train and expand the number of highly skilled electrophysiologists and provide broader access to high-quality care. Learning curves went from novice to experts from a year to 4 months. In the first 4 months of launch, 150 newly trained physicians delivered care to 7500 patients. It's no surprise our Electrophysiology business in China is so strong. And we continue to leverage science to influence industry trends and positively impact patient outcomes and human health. Just this month, the UK modified their NICE guidelines to recommend the use of PLUS SUTURES as a standard of care, giving the evidence supporting their role in reducing surgical site infections and are necessary cost to the healthcare system. Regarding the pandemic, we are seeing light at the end of COVID-19 tunnel, but this remains, as we all know, a very fluid situation. The pace of continued recovery will depend on multiple factors, including the speed at which global populations are vaccinated, healthcare capacity, and the ability to manage through surges, as well as the rate at which patients seek treatment. In closing, and I'd like to emphasize that our strong quarter 2 results and continuing momentum can be attributed to our purpose-driven, globally diverse team, which embody a winning spirit every day. Their resilience, agility, and creativity have taken us to the next level in our business, build stronger relationships with our customers and patients, and defined a clear vision of our future.

Orthopedics was down about a point. We were up in the United States about a point. Down about 3 points in orthopedics in OUS in quarter 2, really due to some of the slower moving countries like Japan and India in opening up in COVID.

There will be a little bit of benefit as we look into the third and fourth quarter. As you know, we don't provide guidance by quarter. But I really looking at the underlying strength of each of our businesses, improved share in the markets in which we lead and for those that which we don't lead. In addition to the -- what you heard from all 3 of our segment leaders, just an improved cadence of innovation; new approvals, new offerings that offer better healthcare solutions. That's how we're thinking about it. From an EPS perspective, we are challenging our teams to continue to invest. We think when we have 10% top-line growth, and EPS growth, that will approach 20%. We think that's very healthy to take it up today on top of what we delivered in January, which surprised to the upside as well.

Other geographies there standing out? I'm just trying to get a sense of like really what would've been the real upsides versus your initial expectations? If I can just slip a second quick one in, I think you mentioned the Pharma margins were impacted by increased investments in 2Q.

Chris, let me take a stab at that and maybe, Jennifer, you can chime in with anything that I might have missed. But with respect to the revenue guidance, Chris, I would say, coming into the year, just like every other Company and probably every other industry, we remained a little bit cautious with respect to how the recovery would unfold; would there be new variants? And so we took a, what I thought was a very responsible and prudent approach to our expectations at the beginning of the year. That being said, I don't want to undermine just the operational performance that each of the teams are executing upon as we go throughout this year. What we did learn, and it really is a credit to the leaders that you've heard from today and their teams, just how important it is reaching out to customers during the last 18 months, not only to find out what the status of COVID-19 was and how it was impacting the businesses, but also how Johnson & Johnson could help them in the recovery. And I think that is having some, I'll call it a goodwill factor, with respect to how we're approaching our business today. With respect to operating margins in R&D, I would say that the COVID investment for the vaccine specifically is a small part of it. What we're seeing, and really what we all take great pride in is there's not one big outlying expense item or investment item in the quarter or even year-to-date with respect to milestones. It's really just the maturity of the portfolio, again, across all three segments that really positions us well. Last year, you might recall we increased our R&D investment by $800 million above 2019 levels. Even with all the questions and uncertainty, and even though maybe competitors pulled back a little bit, we know the only right answer was to invest for the long term. We're actually at a pace this year through 6 months, about $1.3 billion above last year's level on a 6 month comparator. So we feel very well-positioned. And again, with how I answered Larry earlier on the EPS accretion, we think we're hitting the mark across all aspects.

Again, we've had the benefit to learn from how this virus manifests around the world, starting with China. Asia is a region that is above 2019 in terms of procedure volume, clearly really driven by China. We've seen that Japan 's in lockdown. We know that Australia went back to lockdowns recently. We know India is digging out. So some of those other countries are going to be slower to recover. EMEA, we've been -- which has been at a slower pace than the United States. We actually see a lot of acceleration happening right now in EMEA, with the vast distribution and uptake of vaccinations and quite frankly, the backlog of patients that really need to be cared for. As I mentioned, I share a little bit of the waiting list data in the U.K.. And then U.S. in quarter 2 has had significant recovery versus the first quarter. I look at data like in January, we were down. Medical procedures were down about 6% in January versus 2019. And in May that went positive to up about 3%. But as I mentioned, it's going to be not a vertical line, given the recent surges that are happening in hospital systems in the U.S., like Florida, like Michigan in the midwest.

So then, as it relates to DARZALEX, starting off with DARZALEX, we saw the very strong results that we had in the quarter. Also, the significance of the additional indications that continue to come through, and our 6th indication specifically for the DARZALEX FASPRO application. As we take a look so far across the business, already 60% of our DARZALEX business is in the subcutaneous form, and that's whether we look at the United States or whether we look outside the U.S. And so very, very rapid adoption as well as expanded into additional patient populations for DARZALEX. We're very, very confident in the uptake and this is really providing significant benefits from patients going from multiple-hour infusions down to a 3-5 minute injection. A lot of good things to come on DARZALEX. As it relates to IMBRUVICA, we're seeing very strong growth for IMBRUVICA outside the United States. Right now, a 22% growth in the quarter. As we take a look at IMBRUVICA overall, we had double-digit growth, but obviously less than that in the U.S.. In the U.S., we're still a bit impacted. The patient volumes and new patients starts are still down a little bit and CLL due to COVID. For these patient populations there can be more of a watchful waiting period or sometimes treatment with older therapies. And so we did see a slower growth rate, particularly in the U.S. in the quarter. but we do anticipate that to rebound as we move forward and more people get vaccinated. As it relates to the competitive dynamics, IMBRUVICA remains a number 1 prescribed treatment in CLL, and Relapsed/Refractory MCL, and also Waldenstrom. It's a number one BTKI wherever they are prescribed. It's also the only agent that's got demonstrated overall survival in first-line CLL, and a safety profile that's supported by over 5 years of follow-up in clinical experience.

I would tell you that what we've experienced is maybe some bookends like our Electrophysiology business, our AFib, treating cardiac ablation has recovered very expeditiously. And that team right now is just really working on refilling the patient funnel. At the other bookend, I would say would be cataract surgeries, which are -- procedure volumes are still below 2019. We would expect that one to significantly accelerate on a balance to go. So it really depends by procedure. They really are meeting the bell curve, if you will. And again, as I kind of come back to what's going to affect the pace. It's really the pace of vaccinations, pace at hospitals being able to match the capacity and keep a highly engaged, healthy workforce and manage through some of the surges that we're seeing right now in the U.S. and other pockets of the world. And then just really patients sentiment. There's been a lot of investment that JNJ has been doing to reassure patients to go seek medical care. And I think we've seen a lot of the facts, and data, and publications on the impact on non-COVID patients who haven't seek ed care. So we expect that to continue. We don't expect, again, a perfect linear line. I keep saying that because we learn every week, we take four steps forward and maybe a step back.

We are growing market share in EMEA in vision surgery and that market's had a lot of available premium intraocular lenses. We're pleased to bring that technology to the United States. We just launched in quarter 2, there's been very good pickup. It's also complemented, as Chris was mentioning, with our first innovation in the phacoemulsifier, the VERITAS. So the combination of those 2 with really our first advancement in Monofocals and the TECNIS Eyhance, which just launched earlier in quarter 1, the combination of those 3 innovations, I expect should improve our current run rate of revenue performance in the U.S. Surgical Vision. And as you heard in quarter 2, we did grow revenue versus 2019 in OUS.

One, could you sort of give us a little bit of update and color on the ORTHOTAXY adoption. You did provide some statistics on MONARCH, but anything else that you can sort of add in that bucket? And then my second question is, I might be reading the tea leaves a little bit here, but you sounded maybe just a little bit stronger on the idea or concept of M&A.

I'll start and then I'll turn to my colleagues to talk a bit about M&A and some of the other businesses as well. I would say we were very encouraged. We've had about 750 on-hand demonstrations with our VELYS knee digital surgery offering. We've done about 100 cases to date. What we keep hearing from customers who have been giving us really positive feedback on a couple of things.  The value of the system, smaller footprint, the image's interoperative capabilities, and really the ease of integration for surgeons and OR teams, the workflows, reducing the heavy physical and financial burdens of the currently available marketplace offering. It's new. We just got approval also in Australia, so we're going to start to do cases in Australia. And I would say very, very encouraging. We have several different commercial models that were assessing and we're seeing hospitals take really multiple archetypes, so stay tuned on that. And then I think you had a second question, Joanne, on M&A. And I would just say for MedTech point of view. You're seeing, we've invested over $10 billion of capital in M&A, really behind getting into iHealth. Getting more significant into digital surgery. And then really starting to invest in, I'll call it standard of care changing technology. It's like new ways in ablation. For liver ablation was the first indication. Right now we are under clinical trial to partner that technology with our endoluminal Monarch technology for lung cancer, the treatment of tumors -- bleeding tumor cells. We're also in first-in-human in oncolytic viruses and drug delivery using Monarch. As well as starting to get a stronger foothold in the fast-growing area of stroke. Our stroke business was up over 30% in quarter 2 relative to 2019. Again, a procedure that was less affected in the COVID environment that we continue to build down to.

So the win is having something that's really transformational and being able to get it to patients. It' not where it originated from. And so as a result, about 50% of our products come internally, 50% externally. So for example, late last year, we brought in [Indiscernible] we made the acquisition of MOMENTA, we brought in TARIS as a drug delivery device for bladder, a gene therapy for geographic atrophy and age-related macular degeneration from Hemera. And so we really do work very, very assertively to find the best technologies in our key areas of focus. And many times that's coming from our internal labs. Many times it's also coming externally.

A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor. jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the cautionary statements included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.  In particular, there is uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other marketplace dynamics. This means that results could change at any time. And the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures.  These materials are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review the third quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three segments. Joe will provide some additional business and financial commentary before providing an overview of our cash position and capital allocation, and then conclude with updated guidance on 2021 results. The remaining time will be available for your questions.  We anticipate the webcast to last up to 60 minutes. Now let's move to the third quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.3 billion for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 10.7% versus the third quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 9.9% as currency had a positive impact of 0.8 points In the U.S., sales increased 7.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 13.8%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 12.1% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 1.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 10.6% worldwide, 8% in the U.S. and 13.5% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings, for the quarter, net earnings were $3.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.37 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.33 a year ago.  Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.60, representing increases of 18.7% and 18.2% respectively compared to the third quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16.4%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance, highlighting items that build upon the side you have in front of you, unless otherwise stated, percentage is quoted, represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2020 and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation.  Beginning with consumer health, worldwide consumer health sales of $3.7 billion increased 4.1% with growth of 4.5% in the U.S. and growth of 3.7% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 5.7%. Although there is variability across the franchises due to the impact of COVID-19, the overall portfolio is performing well. When comparing to 2019, the consumer health business grew approximately 8% operationally in the quarter. Over-the-counter medicines saw strong growth of 18.2% globally due to share gains in the U.S., along with an increase of pediatric fever incidences and demand for vaccination symptom relief that drove increased sales of Tylenol and Motrin globally. Additionally, category recovery increased demand for cough, cold, flu, and Digestive Health brand such as IMODIUM.  Sales outside the U.S. benefited from prior-year comparisons, specifically prior-year reduction in consumption in China. Our skin health beauty franchise declined by 3% globally, largely due to the 330 basis point impact of the divestiture of Sedona, the salon-based portion of [Indiscernible] in Asia Pacific. Excluding this impact, the franchise experienced modest growth driven by strong performance in AVEENO and NEUTROGENA facial moisturizing and body care driven by COVID-19 market recovery and e-commerce growth, partially offset by external supply constraints and lost sales from the sun aerosol recall.  Oral Care declined 4.5% globally, largely due to the impact of divestitures worth approximately 300 basis points. Excluding this impact, the franchise declined due to external supply constraints for Listerine in the U.S. and negative comparisons to prior-year COVID-19 related impacts in EMEA, partially offset by strong performance in Asia-Pacific, driven by strong promotions and brand building behind Listerine's germ fighting ability. The baby care franchise declined 1.2% globally, resulting from Asia-Pacific COVID-19 lockdowns and competitive pressure, mostly offset by strong Aveeno performance, along with category and e-commerce growth in the U.S. Our Women's Health franchise grew 0.8% globally, primarily due to lapping prior-year COVID-19 impacts.  And finally, our Wound Care franchise declined 4.8% globally, driven by unfavorable comparisons to prior-year stocking in the U.S. and competitive pressure in Asia-Pacific. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13 billion increased 13.2% with growth of 12.2% in the U.S. and growth of 14.6% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 13.8%. Additionally, as a reminder, for comparison purposes, Q3 of 2020 was negatively impacted by access-related constraints due to COVID-19, resulting in a decrease of roughly 200 basis points in total across key brands. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities continue to enable us to deliver adjusted operational growth at above-market levels. The immunology portfolio delivered strong global sales growth of 11.7%, driven by double-digit performance of STELARA and TREMFYA, offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition.  STELARA continued to show strength in all regions, growing at 21.7% driven by market growth and share gains of roughly 4 points in Crohn's disease and nearly seven points in all sort of colitis in the U.S. TREMFYA was up 63.5% with strong double-digit growth worldwide due to continued positive share growth and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication. U.S. share increased over 2 points in psoriasis and over 3 points in psoriatic arthritis. Oncology also delivered another strong quarter with global sales growth of 16.5%. DARZALEX continued its double-digit performance with 42.9% growth in the quarter, driven by share gains, increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU, and continued launches globally.  DARZALEX grew share across all lines of therapy with nearly 5 points of share growth in the U.S. this quarter, as an example. ERLEADA also continued its global uptake with growth of 65.8% in the quarter, driven by global market share gains, which increased in the U.S. alone by nearly 2 points across all indications led by the metastatic indication. IMBRUVICA grew 2.5% globally due to the brand's market leading share position, but was partially offset by modest share losses in the U.S. and a market that remains constrained due to temporary COVID-19 impact on new patient starts.  In addition, growth was negatively impacted by a prior period adjustment in the U.S. that was worth nearly 350 basis points on worldwide IMBRUVICA growth. Neuroscience grew 4.6% globally, driven by paliperidone long-acting portfolio, posting market and share growth due to increased new patient starts and strong persistency in the U.S. The cardiovascular, metabolism, and other business declined 12.4% globally due to competitive pressures and INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT.  Pulmonary hypertension achieved strong growth of 16.1% driven by OPSUMIT growth of 17.1% and UPTRAVI growth of 18.8%, both driven by market penetration and share gains. And lastly, global sales in the quarter included a $502 million contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, bringing the year-to-date total to 766 million.  Through the first 9 months of the year, revenue has been recorded at a not-for-profit price of $7.50. I'll now turn your attention to the medical devices segment. Worldwide medical devices sales of $6.6 billion increased 7% with growth of 0.8% in the U.S. and growth of 13.3% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was 7.6%. In the medical devices segment, we have seen mixed marketplace recovery as the COVID-19 Delta variant and related factors impacted our sales across most of the categories in which we participate within the quarter with certain procedures such as spine and knees within Orthopedics deemed to be more elective in nature, continuing to lag in terms of recovery.  The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 13.2% driven by market recovery, success of new products in both electrophysiology and neurovascular, and strong commercial execution. Worldwide surgery grew 10.2%, primarily driven by recovering procedure volumes and market expansion in Asia Pacific. Advanced Surgery grew 12.6% globally, driven by the positive impact of procedure recovery, new product introductions, and China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion across Endo cutters, biosurgicals, and energy, partially offset by continued competitive pressure in Endo cutters and energy in the U.S. Building on the MONARCH robotic milestone communicated last quarter, we reached another significant commercial achievement, now enabling over 10,000 bronchoscopy procedures. General Surgery grew 8.1% globally.  Wound Closure is the largest contributor with growth driven by procedure recovery, China Tier 2 and 3 hospital market expansion, and continued competitive growth in both traditional and barbed suture markets. The Worldwide Orthopedics franchise declined 0.3% with U.S. declines of 4.5% reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on procedures within the quarter, partially offset by 6.8% OUS growth. Trauma grew 3.7% globally, 5.3% increase in the U.S., and a 0.9% increase outside the U.S.  Results reflect global market recovery dynamics and success of recent product introductions like our cannulated compression headless screws, advanced nailing systems and FIBULINK. Hips grew 2.3% globally, driven by recovery and procedures primarily outside the U.S. and continued leadership in the anterior approach supported by our robust portfolio of new products, such as ACTIS femoral stem, PINNACLE dual mobility and VELYS hip navigation. In Q3, we introduced new image guidance capability for VELYS hip navigation, which support surgeons who prefer the posterior approach in addition to the anterior approach.  Needs grew 2.1% this quarter, reflecting recovery of procedures, especially in markets outside of the U.S. Growth in the U.S. outpatient surgery channel and continued momentum from recently launched products, including the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution and our ATTUNE portfolio. Results in the quarter also benefited from the timing of international tender orders worth approximately 350 basis points of global growth. Lastly, within Orthopedics, Spine declined 11% globally, driven primarily by a deceleration in procedure volume related to COVID-19.  The Worldwide Vision franchise grew 10% this quarter, primarily driven by market recovery, commercial initiatives, and new products driving enhanced competitiveness. Contact lens global growth of 6.4% reflects continued positive momentum for our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, success of commercial initiatives, and recently launched products such as ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL, and ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH. The decline of 4.3% in the U.S. includes a negative impact of prior year stocking worth about 10 points. Surgical vision delivered global growth of 22.1% driven by market recovery across all regions and success of recently launched products continuing to enhance competitiveness, including TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy.  Now, regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2021, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold improved by 200 basis points, driven by recovery from prior-year COVID-19 related impacts and favorable enterprise mix from growth in Pharmaceuticals. We continue to invest strategically in Research and Development at competitive levels, investing 14.7% of sales this quarter. This $3.4 billion investment was a 20.5% increase versus the prior year due to portfolio progression. In process research and development reflects a partial impairment expense of $900 million for assets associated with the acquisition of Auris. The other income and expense line changed from a net expense of $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2022 to net expense of $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to an increase in litigation-related charges.  Joe will provide more details on both the IP R&D and litigation-related charges. Regarding taxes in the quarter, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 4.7% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 19.2% in the third quarter of 2020, mostly driven by unfavorable tax reserves and positions from the prior year, which did not reoccur. Along with lower income and higher tax jurisdictions driven by one-time current quarter special items. excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 13.5% versus 19% in the same period last year.  I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing For additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the boxed section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales remained fairly consistent to the prior year with some changes between our 3 segments.  Pharmaceutical margins declined from 46.4% to 43.9% driven by research and development investment to enable portfolio progression. Medical Devices margin improved from 21.6% to 25.5%, driven by recovery from prior-year COVID-19 related impacts and overall expense leveraging resulting from sales recovery. Finally, consumer health margins declined from 24.4% to 23.3%, driven by a 2020 one-time item and increased brand marketing expenses partially offset by COGS improvement. That concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson Third Quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.",2393.0,1392.0,47.0,36.0,21.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,6.0,31.0,0.033764367816091954,0.02586206896551724,0.015086206896551725,0.0021551724137931034,0.0035919540229885057,0.007902298850574713

We appreciate you joining us to discuss our third quarter results, which reflected continued strength in our Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health businesses, and solid growth in Medical Devices despite COVID-19 variability across geographies. How do we see the current medical device landscape? In the U.S., surgical procedures across most specialties in which we compete decelerated in late July and August with the highest impacts consistently in those procedures deemed to be more elective, such as knees and spine.  Globally, new cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations related to the Delta variant have gradually declined in recent weeks, and we are encouraged by more positive procedure trends in many Western European markets where restrictions are beginning to ease. Some hotspots still remain in parts of the U.S., the UK, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia, and the growing impact from reduced medical staffing are constraining procedure volumes. We continue to believe these variables are more short-term in nature and the Medical Devices market remains attractive as the long-term factors leading to the need for medical and surgical intervention have not changed due to COVID-19.  The segment leaders on the call will provide more insights into each of their businesses during the Q&A, but let me briefly touch upon some pipeline updates for the quarter. We continue to advance our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and products. This progress is supported by our commitment to investment in R&D that have increased $1.9 billion or 23% on a year-to-date basis. In the quarter, we received U.S. approval for INVEGA HAFYERA, the first and only twice yearly treatment for adults with schizophrenia, and we announced the start of a Phase 3 study of our investigational RSV vaccine in older adults. Subsequent to the quarter, the FDA granted [Indiscernible] drug designation for nipocalimab in Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy or CIDP, a rare neurological disorder of the peripheral nerves, characterized by gradually increasing sensory loss and weakness associated with loss of reflexes.  This represents nipocalimab 's fourth orphan drug designation. We also anticipate U.S. approval for our BCMA CAR-T later this year, which will represent a third new product approval in 2021. However, we are stopping further investigation in the Fontan-palliated population of macitentan 10 milligram in pulmonary hypertension as results from the RUBATO Phase 3 trial did not yield sufficient clinical benefit.  Regarding our COVID-19 vaccine, we are pleased that on Friday the FDA 's vaccines and related biological products advisory committee voted unanimously to recommend emergency-use authorization for a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for adults aged 18 and older, at least 2 months following initial single-shot vaccine. The recommendation is based on the totality of evidence with clinical and real-world data showing that while a single-shot offers strong and lasting protection, a booster increases protection, particularly against symptomatic COVID-19.  We are very excited to share more about the entirety of our robust pharmaceutical pipeline and long-term growth outlook at our business review on November 18th. In our Medical Device business, we built upon a record number of 17 significant product introductions in the first half of 2021 by introducing the enhanced shoulder system in the third quarter, a first to market fully integrated shoulder arthroplasty system designed to treat a broad range of cases in hospital or outpatient settings where economic value and operational efficiency are important considerations.  We also announced results from a real-world study showing that the ECHELON Circular powered stapler is associated with a major reduction in serious complications following colorectal surgery when compared with manual staplers, reinforcing clinical evidence as a meaningful differentiator in product selection. Let's transition to financials starting with commentary on special items for the quarter. Other income and expense in the third quarter includes a $2.1 billion charge of litigation expenses, primarily driven by an incremental $1.4 billion charge associated with a recently announced qualified settlement fund for current and future Talc claims. The qualified settlement fund is intended to facilitate a final equitable resolution of all Talc litigation in a structured manner through established bankruptcy law precedent.  Additionally, there is another $800 million legal expense in the quarter representing final resolution of outstanding claims related to RISPERDAL. Another special item worth noting is on the in-process research and development line. We have a broad offering across the digital robotic surgery landscape and continue to make meaningful progress in advancing differentiated solutions across our portfolio. We are very pleased with the adoption of our MONARCH platform for lung bronchoscopy, and are well on our way to expanding MONARCH indications, including initiating a clinical trial exploring the potential for localized drug delivery for the treatment of lung cancer, and submitting an application to the FDA for MONARCH to be used in the treatment of kidney stones.  Our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution for total knee replacement is commercialized in the U.S. has received several OUS approvals and we are experiencing higher utilization on the systems place to date than we projected. We continue to be committed to the development of a general surgery offering with Ottava. But as Sarah mentioned, we recorded a partial in-process R&D charge for $900 million in the third quarter. The accounting for this charge contemplates a first-in-human delay of approximately two years from our earlier projections of the second half of 2022, reflecting technical development challenges and COVID-19 related disruptions, including supply chain constraints being experienced broadly across all industries.  Clearly, we realize the importance that a differentiated digital robotic platform can have for patient outcomes and the market. We continue to invest in and be committed to the platform and will provide updates to the external community as warranted. Let's transition to a few comments on our cash position. We continue to generate strong free cash flow with $15 billion year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with $31 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $34 billion of debt, resulting in $3 billion of net debt. Our financial position and balance sheet remains strong, and we are well-positioned to continue to deploy capital in a strategic, value-creating way consistent with our priorities that will benefit stakeholders over the long term. Moving to our full-year 2021 guidance.  Given where we are in the year, our current assumptions around continued recovery in medical device markets and confidence in the business, we are tightening our adjusted operational sales range to 12.9% to 13.5%. This adjusted operational sales growth is on a constant currency basis, consistent with how we assess our business performance. This guidance also incorporates the estimated $2.5 billion of COVID-19 vaccine sales consistent with our July guidance. We are maintaining our estimate for the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 50 basis points, resulting in an operational sales range of 12.4% to 13%, or $92.8 billion to $93.3 billion for a midpoint of 12.7% or 93.1 billion.  As you know, we do not predict the impact of currency movements. But utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.16, there's an estimated positive impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 150 basis points consistent with our July guidance, resulting in estimated reported sales growth between 13.9% and 14.5% compared to 2020 where $94.1 billion to $94.6 billion. Moving to other items of the P&L, consistent with our previous guidance, you can expect our operating margins to be nearly a 200 basis point improvement over last year.  Given year-to-date trends, we are modestly increasing and tightening our other income estimate to be a range of $900 million to $950 million. Regarding interest expense, again, based on our year-to-date experience, we are also tightening the range of our estimate to $100 million to $150 million. And finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate to a range of 14.5% to 15.5% based on the occurrence of certain one time favorable tax positions and settlements both in the U.S. and abroad. Considering those updates, we are comfortable with adjusted earnings per share guidance ranging from $9.65 to $9.70 on a constant currency basis, a guidance increase of $0.13 at the midpoint. Well, not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS would be positively impacted by approximately $0.12 per share.  Accounting for that, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting reported adjusted EPS ranging from $9.77 to $9.82, an increase versus 2020 of 22% at the midpoint. Consistent with what we shared before, given the not-for-profit nature of the vaccine, there is no significant EPS contribution in 2021, and therefore, the EPS guidance I provided is inclusive of the vaccine revenue. As always, none of our achievements are possible without the hard work of our world-class team of employees around the globe, whose dedication ensures that we deliver for all our stakeholders.  We continue to make significant strides towards our mission of improving human health and well-being of everyone everywhere, and I am grateful for their efforts and commitment. I'd like to close my prepared remarks by briefly commenting on the CEO transition that was announced earlier in the third quarter. First, I want to acknowledge Alex for his leadership and contributions to Johnson & Johnson during his tenure. It has been my pleasure to work alongside him, particularly over the increases last three years, and to observe and to learn from him both professionally and personally.  I'm also pleased to congratulate Joaquin on his new role starting this January. I know firsthand that he shares the same commitment to patients, employees, and society that Alex considered core. Joaquin similarly values innovation that underscores our strategy for long-term success. Both gentlemen will be featured at the previously mentioned November 18th Analyst Day, sharing their thoughts on our business and plans for the future. I am pleased our Worldwide Chairs, Ashley McEvoy, Thibaut Mongon, and Jennifer Taubert are here with me today to address your questions. Jen McIntyre, from our Investor Relations team, will facilitate the Q&A portion of the call. So I will now turn it over to her to begin the Q&A.

I guess just first, can you just quantify or elaborate on the impact that the Delta variant head on 3Q results in your guidance. I guess I'm trying to get to was the impact you saw in the third quarter basically in line with what you had contemplated in guidance, or did we have upside elsewhere in the portfolio that offset some of those slowdowns that you mentioned that hit part of the businesses? And then just maybe building on that as we think out to 2022, I know you're not giving guidance yet, but is there more in the way of COVID recovery that can aid growth next year as you think about the portfolio as a whole? I guess I'm trying to get to this base pharma growth sustainable at these levels. And should we think about still Device growth, maybe above historic levels as we get COVID more in the rearview mirror a bit?

Let me answer some of it quantitatively and then maybe I'll hand it over to Ashley and Jennifer to discuss their outlook for their particular segments. In terms of the guidance for the balance of the year as it relates to where we ended the third quarter, if you look at what I guess has been labeled early morning here as a miss, I would say, I think about it in two categories. The vaccine, quite frankly. And as you saw, we did not change the full-year guidance. So that is simply timing.  We expect that to be fulfilled in the fourth quarter and we're still very much committed to the 2.5 billion of revenue and the supply that is correlated to that. With respect to medical devices, I think we're very pleased that we had above 7% growth in the quarter, given the different dynamics of Delta variant and hospital shortages. And we do anticipate that those procedures will be recovered. It's hard to say whether they'll be recovered in the fourth quarter or early next year, so that could provide some tailwind as you think about 2022. But let me turn it over first to Ashley to comment on medical devices and then to Jennifer to discuss pharmaceuticals.",220.0,91.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.01098901098901099,0.02197802197802198,0.04395604395604396,0.0,0.01098901098901099,-0.01098901098901099

When I look at quarter three as we share, procedures across most categories in which we participated did decelerate through the quarter, primarily due to obviously the Delta. So if I take you a little bit around the world, Asia-Pacific in aggregate continues to operate above pre - COVID levels. However, COVID does continue to be a challenge with like mobility restrictions being reinstated or remaining in places like Japan, Australia, Southeast Asia.  China clearly is setting a new pace for the world. When we look in the United States, we saw procedure trends decelerate in quarter 3. You'll recall on our quarter 2 call, we were feeling pretty good around 5% growth procedures in May. We saw a stabilization in June and July. In August, we saw the numbers of procedures dip around mid-single digit, and we saw that continue into the early part of September.  We are starting to see, qualitatively, recovery from hospital systems the past four weeks, where we look at early indicators of really filling the patient funnel. We look at diagnostic procedures and the past four weeks we're seeing diagnostic procedures in the United States flat relative to pre-COVID numbers. And as we talked about, we do expect some micro-surges in areas like the Northwest as well as the Midwest.  And then, in EMEA, rounding it out, we are encouraged that countries are beginning to ease its strict mobility restrictions and are really starting to resume procedures, given the vaccine deployment accelerations, the decrease in rates of new cases and hospitalizations, and overall, procedure volumes are gradually improving, like Spain, Italy, Germany are all above pre -COVID. The UK, where I was just there 2 weeks ago, clearly below 2019, long waiting list, really working to go, make progress on that patient funnel.

So we've got a real positive outlook on the pharmaceutical business, and if you take a look at our third quarter results, we had clear double-digit growth across a number of our key brands, including DARZALEX and ERLEADA in oncology, TREMFYA and STELARA in immunology, and OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI in pulmonary hypertension. Those areas we have seen strong recovery and we believe that the trajectory on those assets is really going to continue, so continued trajectory in '21 and into '22.  The area part of the market where we're still seeing a bit of a slower recovery, but we're starting to see it tick back, is really in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma, the market where IMBRUVICA is right now for IMBRUVICA, we just achieved double-digit growth ex-U.S. but in the U.S., it's actually been a little bit lower than that. And so I think that's one that, as you take a look and we move into 2022, we're anticipating to see some positive recovery there, but really strong results in 3Q and we anticipate continued strong trajectory through the rest of the year and into '22.",201.0,88.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06818181818181818,0.011363636363636364,0.03409090909090909,0.0,0.0,0.056818181818181816

Let me start this response by underscoring just our conviction in the safety based on decades of science that these products are safe. What we've done is acknowledge that there's an established process that allows companies facing abuse of toward systems to resolve claims in an efficient and equitable manner. We initiated this process specifically for our cosmetic talc claims, both for current and future. And while we believe the cases lack merit, and by the way, an overwhelming number of courts, juries, and judges who have opined on this to full adjudication ultimately agree with us.  We did establish a $2 billion qualified settlement fund. But as you note in your question Josh, it's really the bankruptcy courts that will ultimately decide this. It's not plaintiff's attorneys. It's not Johnson & Johnson. But we do know that based on prior experience precedent, that claimants are far better off and clarity and resolution is in the best interest of all stakeholders.

And before I get to quarter 4, let me just give a quick frame for quarter 3 just at a macro level. First is really the market. And while COVID-19 has temporarily disrupted the MedTech markets, we absolutely believe that the underlining foundation of these end-state markets continue to remain attractive really due to what we say are oodles of clinical unmet need and quite frankly, the overall state of the technology on the S-curve. Quick refresh is our standing and our competitiveness as the second largest MedTech Company with 11 platforms delivering at least a billion in annual sales, we are very much focused on competitiveness and innovation.  In quarter 2, almost all of our priority platforms held or gained share. Some notables include continuing to enhance our global market position in electrophysiology. Biosurgery gaining share and hips seeing the impact of recent innovation in surgical vision. Now seeing several sequential quarters of share gains and even seen stabilization in knees year-to-date. So this is really about our focus on commercial effectiveness and our ability to deliver innovation. As Joe mentioned earlier, in 2021, we had 17 new product launches year-to-date. And this is a significant amount over last year.  So year-to-date through 2021, Larry, we are tracking to 5% growth versus 2019. We did achieve 4% growth in quarter 3. Obviously, that's an improvement of how we exited 2019 the full year. And then last, I would just say, you heard us talk a lot about digital surgery. We're absolutely committed to leading in the future of surgery and making our medical innovation smarter, less invasive, and more personalized. Joe talked a little bit about our MONARCH reaching 10,000 patients this year, has a very rich pipeline.  VELYS Knees is now approved in 5 countries. Our smart digital tools continue to scale. And lastly, Ottava, our soft tissue offering, you heard us share we're experiencing a temporary setback in its development. Transformational innovation is all kinds of fun, I will tell you. It's highly complex, but sometimes we do experience technical challenges, but we are absolutely committed to resolving our challenges, continuing to invest and bringing to market a competitive differentiated offering as soon as possible.  When we look at quarter 4, we do expect to see continued improvement. We do expect hospitals are going to have to continue to continue to manage through labor shortages. I don't expect that to get better in quarter 4 nor in 2022, but they've been quite master rolling how to manage patient flows. We are when I talk to hospital systems over the past three weeks and particularly in United States, they are ramping up again and resuming elective procedures. We're keeping our eye on vaccination rates, patients sentiment, the cold weather. But we do -- we are planning for a strong recovery in quarter 4 versus how we exited quarter 3.",481.0,256.0,17.0,6.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.06640625,0.0234375,0.015625,0.0,0.0078125,0.04296875

What I would say is, first off, I'd probably repeat the words I had both to congratulate Alex, as well as Joaquin. Alex clearly on a stellar career, a great run as his tenure as CEO. And he'll be a very active Executive Chairman, I suspect. It's not as if he's riding completely off into the sunset. Joaquin values the same principles that have made Johnson & Johnson successful.  That's investing in innovation and making sure that we've got differentiated products and solutions to improve the standard of healthcare across the globe. The nice thing about the transition is, I don't expect any significant bumps. They've worked together for a number of years. The strategies that they have talked about and that you'll probably see in the early part of Joaquin 's tenure have been contemplated with Alex in mind and they've collaborated as Chair and Vice Chair over a number of years.  So I would expect as the organization does a very smooth transition. With respect to CSO, we have not had a chance to acknowledge just really the impact that Paul has had on the scientific community not just here at Johnson & Johnson, but across the globe. He was a pioneer in infectious diseases. When nobody had an answer for HID, Paul emerged as clearly a leader there. And then just most recently his notable leadership on the COVID-19 vaccine, again here at J&J but also on the global stage. I think the -- probably the greatest testament to Paul's legacy is the fact that our R&D investment this year is 23% higher through nine months than what it was last year, and last year was a record-setting year in terms of what we've invest in innovation. We've got a great team of scientists that Paul has assembled over the years across all of our therapeutic areas, across all of our franchises. And I just look forward to the success that they will continue to carry on that Paul has really, I guess, cemented in terms of how we approach our business.",369.0,145.0,9.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.06206896551724138,0.013793103448275862,0.020689655172413793,0.0,0.0,0.04827586206896552

So we are really looking forward to our upcoming PDUFA date in the 4th quarter for our BCMA CAR-T. This is going to be our first entry into cell therapy, and so the total team from R&D to supply chain to commercial has been really, really invested in this asset over the past couple of years preparing to launch. I think the results that you've all seen, and they're really deep and durable responses that have been proven through our clinical programs really highlight that this is going to be a really meaningful and transformational asset for patients.  As we have been planning the launch, we're really taking a thoughtful approach to scaling our global manufacturing, making sure that we're learning from those who come before us, and that we're really going to plan to deliver an optimal patient experience and patient treatment or provider treatment center experience as well as we scale up.  So the team has been working very heavily on this and we're gearing up for what we believe will be a very successful launch for patients hopefully later this year.

As Sarah shared in quarter 3, knees grew 2% versus 2020, and a lot of that was due to really two-folds. One is the state of innovation, so the VELYS knee robot is obviously getting some nice traction. As Joe shared earlier, the utilization rates are very encouraging from hospital systems that have adopted this new technology. That coupled with a very proven differentiated ATTUNE knee implant, with a revision offering, as well as the cementless rotating platform have all really helped [Indiscernible] up, I would say, our portfolio in knees.  And then you mentioned the channel and we are seeing really healthy growth in the ASC channel. We continue to be encouraged by our market share gains predominantly enjoined in ASC. And really we started to deploy what we call an advanced case management, which is really how you simplify the pre -op planning in ASC and that new advanced case management service is starting to really take effect.

I think what we're planning for quarter four is I think we'll still continue to see micro-surges in cases. There will always be little hot spots. Hospitals are still going to experience some labor challenges. We don't see that getting better in the near-term immediately. I will qualify that so to say that they have been quite frankly masters at understanding how to manage patient flow and procedure flow. When we look at diagnostic and routine screenings and surgical procedures, we expect the trends will continue to recover globally, similar to the trends we saw in quarter two where surgical procedures grew low single-digit above 2019 baselines.  As we've referenced, there are more procedural backlogs in the highly elective procedures like knees and spine. And we expect those to recover, although maybe not as in terms of hospital capacity, at levels significantly above 2019 in the near-term. But I would just say going into November, relative to where we were entering November last year, we are encouraged to look at the worldwide case data, to look at the worldwide hospitalization data and the freeing up of mobility restrictions.

Welcome to our company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021 and our financial outlook for 2022. Joining me on today's call are Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.  A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our future operating and financial performance and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other marketplace dynamics. This means that results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is the best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures. These materials are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review the fourth quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the 3 business segments and additionally, full year 2021 results for the enterprise. Joe will provide some additional business commentary, insights about our cash position and capital allocation deployment and our guidance for 2022. Joaquin will close the call by sharing his perspective on the healthcare environment and his strategic priorities as the new CEO of Johnson & Johnson. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 90 minutes. Now to recap the fourth quarter. Worldwide sales were $24.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 10.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 11.6% as currency had a negative impact of 1.2 points. In the U.S., sales increased 3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales growth was 18.5%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 21.2%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.7 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 12.3% worldwide, 3.1% in the U.S. and 22.4% outside the U.S. I would like to remind everyone that our 2020 fiscal year included additional shipping days, which negatively impacted 2021 fourth quarter growth by approximately 400 basis points and full year growth by about 100 basis points. These impacts can be roughly applied across all segments, but were more heavily skewed to the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $1.77 versus diluted earnings per share of $0.65 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.13, representing increases of 14.4% and 14.5%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17.2%. For the full year 2021, consolidated sales were $93.8 billion an increase of 13.6% compared to the full year of 2020. Operationally, full year sales grew 12.2%, with currency having a positive impact of 1.4 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 9.3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year sales growth was 18.2%. Operational sales outside the U.S. grew by 15.3%, with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.9 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 12.8% worldwide, 9.5% in the U.S. and 16.6% outside the U.S. Net earnings for the full year 2021 were $20.9 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $7.81 versus diluted earnings per share of $5.51 a year ago. 2021 adjusted net earnings were $26.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.80, representing increases of 22.2% and 22%, respectively, versus full year 2020. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 20.2%. Beginning with Consumer Health, I will now comment on business segment sales performance for the fourth quarter, highlighting items that build upon the slides you have in front of you. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2020 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. While not part of the prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional commentary on our website for the full year 2021 sales by segment to assist you in updating your models. Worldwide Consumer Health sales totaled $3.7 billion and grew 1.8%, with growth in the U.S. of 1.3% and 2.1% outside the U.S. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 2.9%. Consumer Health was negatively impacted by the 2020 additional shipping days worth approximately 400 basis points, which can be roughly applied to all franchises as well as industry-wide external supply constraints, primarily due to raw material availability and labor shortages largely reflected in our Skin Health and Beauty business worth approximately 360 basis points. Adjusting for these items, solid results were primarily driven by above-market growth in OTC. E-commerce continues to have strong double-digit growth. Finally, when comparing to 2019, Consumer Health grew approximately 4% in the quarter. When adjusting for acquisition and divestitures, sales growth was closer to 5%. Over-the-counter medicines globally grew 15.8% due to increased incidents in U.S. adult and pediatric fever and worldwide category recovery in cough, cold and flu and digestive health. The U.S. also saw share gains primarily in TYLENOL and MOTRIN. Strength was seen across multiple areas in the portfolio, including analgesics, upper respiratory, digestive health, naturals and anti-smoking aids. The Skin Health and Beauty franchise declined 7.1%, driven by external supply constraints, primarily in NEUTROGENA and OGX and divestitures worth approximately 230 basis points, primarily due to Sedona, the salon-based portion of Dr. Ci Labo in Asia Pacific. Declines were partially offset by market recovery and e-commerce strength. Oral Care declined globally 6.5% as compared to strong double-digit growth in the prior year, driven by the floss divestiture worth approximately 170 basis points and category declines in EMEA. Declines were partially offset by successful brand building and promotional campaigns in Asia Pacific. The Baby Care franchise declined 0.8% with U.S. declines of 7.5% and growth of 1.3% outside the U.S. Declines were driven by prior year retailer stocking and external supply constraints in the U.S., partially offset by e-commerce growth of AVEENO Baby and Asia Pacific. Wound Care declined 6.4%, primarily due to the divestiture of the professional tape business worth approximately 150 basis points, partially offset by strong performance of Band-Aid brand and adhesive bandages in the U.S. Women's Health grew 1.3%, driven by market recovery in Latin America. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $14.3 billion grew 17.9%, enabled by strength in all regions, with U.S. sales increasing by 4.2% and OUS sales increasing by 36.9%. Worldwide sales included a $1.6 billion contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide growth was 18.6%. Our strong portfolio of products and commercial capabilities has enabled us to deliver the tenth consecutive full year of worldwide above-market adjusted operational growth. Our immunology therapeutic area delivered global sales growth of 7.1% driven by strong performance of TREMFYA and STELARA, offset by declines in REMICADE due to biosimilar competition. TREMFYA was up 82.8% worldwide, with continued share growth and additional penetration into the psoriatic arthritis indication. U.S. share increased nearly 3 points in both the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis indications. STELARA grew 5.1% worldwide driven by strong share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with increases of roughly 4 points and roughly 6 points, respectively, in the U.S. Current quarter growth was impacted by a negative prior period rebate adjustment and reserve adjustment recorded in Q4 2021 in the U.S. worth approximately 700 basis points on worldwide growth for the quarter versus the prior year. Our Oncology portfolio delivered another robust quarter with worldwide growth of 12.3%. DARZALEX continued its double-digit performance with 33.4% growth in the quarter, driven by share gains, increased penetration of the subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and EU and continued launches globally. DARZALEX grew share across all lines of therapy with nearly 8 points of share growth in the U.S. this quarter. ERLEADA grew 61.3% worldwide, driven by strong share uptake, increased market penetration in the U.S. and new launches outside of the U.S. IMBRUVICA maintained its market leadership position, however, declined 3.1% worldwide due to competitive pressures from novel oral agents. U.S. decline was partially offset by growth in all regions outside of the U.S. Neuroscience grew 7.1% worldwide driven by the paliperidone long-acting portfolio posting market and share growth due to increased new patient starts, strong persistency globally and the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA in the quarter. The cardiovascular, metabolism and other business declined 13.8% worldwide due to competitive pressures in INVOKANA and biosimilar competition for PROCRIT. Our pulmonary hypertension portfolio was roughly flat, driven by COVID-19 market constraints and generic entrants and other pulmonary hypertension, offset by U.S. share uptake in both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. I'll now turn your attention to the Medical Devices segment. Worldwide Medical Devices sales were $6.9 billion, growing 5.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of ASP, adjusted operational sales grew 5.6% worldwide. The medical devices market continued to be impacted by COVID-19, with the Omicron variant contributing to a softening of recovery trends in medical and surgical procedures, especially late in the quarter. Consistent with prior COVID-19 surges, impacts were more acute in areas deemed to be more deferrable in nature, including spine and knees. Comparing to 2019, Medical Devices grew about 4% on an adjusted operational basis. On a full year basis, Medical Devices growth versus 2019 was just over 4.5%, building on the pre-COVID growth momentum. Interventional Solutions continued to demonstrate strong performance, delivering another quarter of double-digit worldwide growth at 15.3% driven by market recovery, successful penetration of new products and commercial execution across both electrophysiology and CERENOVUS. Advanced Surgery grew 7.6% worldwide, driven by market recovery; expansion into Tier 2 and 3 hospitals in China; and performance of newer products such as ENSEAL X1 in Energy, ECHELON+ in endocutters and SURGICEL powder in biosurgery. MONARCH system orders in the fourth quarter marked the highest number of orders in any quarter since launch. And more importantly, as a positive indicator of MONARCH technology adoption and patient treatment regimens, we continue to see strong growth in the number of MONARCH-enabled bronchoscopy procedures with total procedures since launch exceeding 12,000. In fact, 2021 MONARCH procedures more than doubled those performed in the prior year. General Surgery grew 1.7% worldwide, led by wound closure, primarily due to market recovery, coupled with innovation penetration. Inventory dynamics in the prior year negatively impacted wound closure U.S. results by about 350 basis points and positively impacted results outside the U.S. by about 250 basis points. Worldwide orthopedics declined 0.7% versus prior year, reflecting the continued impact of COVID-19 on procedures. Worldwide trauma delivered growth of 2.0%, driven by continued market stabilization and the success of recently launched products, partially offset by competitive pressures in China. The positive impact on growth from prior year inventory contractions in China was primarily offset by the additional shipping days in 2020. Worldwide hips grew 2.7%, driven by continued strength from our portfolio, including the ACTIS stem and technologies such as VELYS hip navigation, sustaining our leadership in the anterior approach. Growth in the outpatient surgery channel in the U.S. and market recovery outside the U.S. were additional contributors to growth. Worldwide knees was relatively flat with a decline of 4.2% in the U.S. and growth of 6.5% outside the U.S. The U.S. market was negatively impacted by COVID-19 and healthcare resource constraints on procedures. These impacts were partially offset by strong growth in the outpatient channel and positive momentum from recently launched products, including the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution and our ATTUNE portfolio. Growth outside the U.S. was driven by market recovery and success of products such as ATTUNE Revision. Lastly, in Orthopedics, worldwide spine declined 9.4%, primarily driven by a deceleration in procedure volumes related to COVID-19 and health system resource constraints. Partially offsetting this decline are the positive impacts from the continued success of new products such as X-Pac, CONDUIT and SYMPHONY and prior year inventory reductions in China contributing approximately 360 basis points to worldwide growth. Worldwide Vision grew 11%. Contact lens and other grew 7.1% worldwide. U.S. growth of 9.4% was driven by successful commercial campaigns and adoption of recently launched ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL for presbyopia. U.S. growth was impacted by inventory fluctuations in both the current and prior year worth about 550 basis points. Growth outside the U.S. of 5.8% was driven by market recovery, coupled with strength of new product launches such as ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH. Surgical Vision grew 22.1% globally, with both the U.S. and OUS businesses growing double-digits. These positive results were driven by market recovery and share gains from recent differentiated product launches across all Surgical Vision product lines, including TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy in our ocular lenses used in cataract surgery. Now regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2021, I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings compared to the same quarter last year. As reported earlier, our adjusted earnings per share of $2.13 reflects a reported increase of 14.5% and an operational increase of 17.2%. Cost of products sold leveraged by 270 basis points, primarily driven by favorable mix within the pharmaceutical business; a reduction in prior year COVID-19 related costs in the Medical Devices business; and favorable mix within the enterprise, with a larger portion of sales from the pharmaceutical business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins remained relatively flat, driven by increased brand marketing expense in the Consumer Health business, mostly offset by expense leveraging in the Pharmaceutical business. We continue to invest in research and development at competitive levels, investing 19% of sales this quarter. This was higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 by 110 basis points driven by portfolio progression in the Pharmaceutical business and higher investment in the Medical Devices business. The other income and expense line is a net expense of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to net expense of $2.4 billion last year. This was driven by lower litigation expenses. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate increased to 2.1% compared to a benefit of 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020. This increase was primarily driven by the prior year tax benefit associated with litigation expenses, partially offset by one-time tax benefits in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 10.4% versus 11.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2021 10-K for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2021, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 24.9% to 25.6%, primarily driven by the COVID-19 recovery. The following are the main drivers of adjusted income before tax by segment: Medical Devices improved by 160 basis points, driven by recovery of prior year COVID-19 production-related slowdowns and related inventory impacts; Consumer Health margins declined by 460 basis points, primarily driven by increased brand marketing expenses and inflationary pressure, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. The improvement in Pharmaceutical margins of 110 basis points was primarily driven by favorable product mix and selling, marketing and administration leverage. This slide provides our full year consolidated statement of earnings. As reported today, our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $9.80 reflects a reported increase of 22% and an operational increase of 20.2%. The growth is primarily related to COVID-19 recovery realized predominantly in our Medical Devices business. Lastly, I direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Moving to the next slide. Our full year 2021 adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved by 170 basis points versus 2020. Looking at the adjusted pre-tax income by segment, Medical Devices improved by 870 basis points to 25.7%, primarily driven by recovery of prior year COVID-19 production-related slowdowns and related inventory impacts. Pharmaceutical margins declined by 150 basis points to 40.5%, primarily driven by R&D portfolio progression. Consumer Health margins were flat at 23.8%, driven by increased brand marketing expense and inflationary pressure, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. We continue to advance our strong pipeline of innovative medicines and products. This progress is supported by our commitment to investment in R&D that have increased $2.6 billion or 21% on a full year basis. In the quarter, we received approval by the European Commission for the long-acting injectable antipsychotic therapy BYANNLI for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients. This approval makes BYANNLI the first twice-yearly treatment for adults living with schizophrenia, providing the longest available dosing interval for an antipsychotic medication to be approved in Europe. Additionally, RYBREVANT received conditional marketing authorization in EMEA. RYBREVANT, a bispecific therapy targeting both EGFR and cMet, is the first treatment approved for patients with non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations after failure of platinum-based therapy. Finally, we submitted a Biologics License Application to the U.S. FDA seeking approval of teclistamab for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and as aligned with our strategy to expand treatment options for multiple myeloma patients. Teclistamab is an investigational off-the-shelf T-cell redirecting bispecific antibody targeting both BCMA and CD3. Consistent with our disciplined approach to portfolio prioritization, we are discontinuing the SELECT Phase 3 study assessing the efficacy and safety of selexipag as an add-on to the standard of care therapy in patients with inoperable CTEPH, as the study did not meet its primary end point. Medical Devices announced a strategic collaboration with Microsoft to further develop a secure and compliant digital ecosystem with a goal of connecting devices across the entire portfolio. This collaboration will help enhance the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in order to generate insights leading to smarter, less invasive and more personalized solutions across the entire patient care continuum. This concludes the sales and P&L highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter and full year 2021. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.",3227.0,1887.0,62.0,49.0,31.0,2.0,7.0,9.0,4.0,36.0,0.03285638579756227,0.025967143614202437,0.016428192898781134,0.0010598834128245894,0.0037095919448860626,0.00688924218335983
JNJ,2022-01-25,2022-01-25,,2022-01-25,2022-01-25T08:30:00-05:00,0,2022-01-25,prepared,,Joseph Wolk,"Thank you, Jess, and thanks to everyone for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and our outlook for 2022. We continue to manage the implications of COVID-19 globally, but it is encouraging to see the resilience of our business, driven by the dedication of countless healthcare professionals and the 136,000 Johnson & Johnson colleagues around the world. Their collective commitment and focus on providing healthcare solutions enabled us to deliver another year of strong financial performance. Our Pharmaceuticals segment delivered a tenth consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth. Medical Devices continued to manage through the ongoing impact of COVID-19 to experience a partial recovery, and Consumer Health grew competitively while navigating industry-wide supply constraints. All of this culminated in Johnson & Johnson posting adjusted operational sales growth of 12.8% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 22% for the year, while also investing in our business for the future. We are well positioned as we head into 2022. Before we recap our year-end cash position and guidance for 2022, I'd like to touch on the announcement we made in the fourth quarter regarding our intent to separate our Consumer Health business to create 2 market-leading companies. As independent companies, the new Johnson & Johnson and the new Consumer Health company will each be better positioned to exercise more focused strategic and capital decisions. We intend for each company to possess compelling financial profiles that reflect the strengths and opportunities of each business, enabling each company to be in a position to enhance the strong results that you've come to expect. As far as where we stand in the process, we have established a very strong, largely separate team focused on advancing the separation. And the financial and operational work streams are well underway. As conveyed in November, the Board of Directors' intent is for the planned separation to occur through the capital markets, and there are multiple capital market separation pathways being considered. Depending on the pathway, there are different SEC requirements that must be adhered to. In order to preserve optionality on the various separation pathways, we cannot, at this time, disclose specific Consumer Health financial information not previously disclosed or that which is associated with the separation. As such, you can expect that Consumer Health as well as the rest of our business will be reported as it has been reported previously for the entirety of 2022. We can, however, provide a high-level time line for some nonfinancial items, which may be of interest. In the first half of 2022, we anticipate announcing key executive leadership appointments for the new Consumer Health company, with plans to provide the new company name and headquarters location around the middle of this year. In the second half of 2022, we plan to provide the updated path forward and applicable financial information such as refined standup cost estimates and potential short-term dissynergies. Finally, consistent with our previous communications we expect to execute the separation in 2023. You have our ongoing commitment, working within the regulatory framework to provide transparent updates for material decisions on a timely basis. Let's now discuss our 2021 year-end cash position and future capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of nearly $20 billion. At the end of 2021, we had approximately $32 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $34 billion of debt for a net debt position of $2 billion. We are pleased that 2021 was another record year in terms of R&D investment at $14.7 billion, a 21% increase over our previous all-time high recorded in 2020. We recognize that investment in innovation is critical to our future growth profile and remains a top priority from a capital allocation standpoint. Given that we are at our lowest levels of net debt in almost 5 years, progressing towards a net cash position, we anticipate leaning in on some of our other capital allocation priorities beyond internal R&D. This includes building upon the 59 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. It also includes, as Joaquin has mentioned in recent forums, utilizing our cash to complement the current portfolio with acquisitions that build upon our capabilities, address portfolio gaps and play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns. We will assess opportunities of all sizes. However, our preferred option is tuck-in deals, which typically offer greater value creation. It is also important to note that should we find the right opportunities, the Consumer Health separation work stream will not prevent us from forging ahead. And finally, with respect to capital allocation, modest share repurchases may be evaluated as part of our capital deployment actions. Let me provide a few comments regarding our guidance for full year 2022, which encompasses expectations for our 3 business segments. In our Pharmaceuticals business, we will continue to drive innovation and market-leading sales growth with continued expansion of existing brands such as DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA, ERLEADA and the recently launched RYBREVANT for lung cancer. We are particularly excited about the anticipated FDA approval for [CARVIC-T], our BCMA CAR-T therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We believe this medicine is best-in-class, showing unprecedented results in clinical trials. In our Medical Devices business, we expect COVID-19 and hospital staffing to continue to be a dynamic variable, likely more impactful in the first half of 2022 as we cycle through Omicron. Our 2022 guidance assumes continued medical devices market recovery, but it also assumes, as you have heard us say previously, enhanced competitiveness. Almost all of our priority platforms are holding or gaining share based on third quarter 2021 year-to-date information, illustrating the positive business momentum versus 2019 when only about 50% of our platforms were holding or gaining share. This improved market performance enables us to maximize the value of recently launched products. In Consumer Health, we are confident that our well-balanced portfolio positions us well. Consistent with current global macroeconomic trends, we are experiencing the impact of inflationary pressures, including higher input costs across our business and more significantly with respect to Consumer Health. These external challenges include availability and cost of certain commodities, labor and transportation. Similar to competitors, we are instituting price increases across our Consumer Health portfolio in 2022, enabling us to remain competitive as we continue to deliver the products that consumers love and trust. So with that backdrop, let's get into the details for the full year 2022 guidance for you to consider in updating your models. Starting with sales, we expect operational sales growth for the full year 2022 between 7.0% and 8.5%. This guidance is provided on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage our business performance. We estimate the negative impact from net acquisitions and divestitures to be negligible, and thus, are comfortable with your models reflecting the same range as adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 7.0% to 8.5% or $100.3 billion to $101.8 billion. Our 2022 sales guidance includes approximately $3 billion from our COVID-19 vaccine. The majority of this volume is outside of the U.S. for low and middle-income countries corresponding to previously signed advanced purchase agreements. As you know, we do not predict currency movement. But for context, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.14, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 150 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth of between 5.5% and 7.0% or 6.2% at the midpoint compared to 2021, representing a range of $98.9 billion to $100.4 billion for 2022. As done in the past, I will provide a few qualitative comments related to quarterly phasing. Starting with Consumer Health, the supply constraints that were mentioned as part of Jess' commentary for the quarter will continue into 2022. We estimate that the majority of that impact will be experienced in the first half of the year, primarily in the first quarter and primarily in Skin Health, Beauty. We, therefore, expect second half performance to outperform the first half. In Medical Devices, we expect some COVID-19 headwinds and hospital staffing shortages to continue into 2022, but anticipate market recovery as global health systems treat new patients and work through procedure backlogs. Given this, we expect market recovery to improve as the year progresses and greater contribution from the new products launched in 2021 for an overall better second half. Finally, in Pharmaceuticals, we anticipate our market-leading performance will be fairly stable throughout the year, with perhaps some modest adjustments for timing of events associated with alliance revenue or tenders. We are monitoring report surface by large insurers that recent office visits are slightly down in both primary care and specialists. I'll continue to go through the items on our P&L, starting with operating margin. We expect 2022 adjusted pre-tax operating margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points, driven by operating expense leverage, partially offset by continued inflationary pressures and cost of goods sold. Regarding other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income, the return on assets and actuarial costs associated with certain employee benefit programs, as well as gains and losses related to the items such as investments by Johnson & Johnson Development Corp., litigation and write-offs. We expect this to be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion for 2022, consistent with 2021 levels.  Finally, we are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense of between $0 million and $100 million. We are also projecting a higher effective tax rate for 2022 in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% based on current assumptions for geographic mix and certain international tax legislation changes for research and development expenses in 2022. Considering all these factors, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.60 to $10.80 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 8.2% to 10.2% or 9.2% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates previously referenced, our reported adjusted operational earnings per share for the year would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.20 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share in a range of $10.40 to $10.60 or $10.50 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 7.1% versus the prior year. We expect the company's COVID-19 vaccine to contribute approximately an incremental $0.20 to earnings per share in 2022. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'm now thrilled to welcome Joaquin Duato to his first earnings call as the CEO of Johnson & Johnson. Joaquin, as a colleague who has worked alongside you for the past several years, it's clear that healthcare and providing good health for everyone, everywhere is not just your business, but a passion. I am excited to welcome you in your new capacity and look forward to continuing to partner with you, the Executive Committee and our colleagues across the globe in our mission to change the trajectory of health for humanity.

It is a pleasure to join you all for my first earnings announcement as CEO of Johnson & Johnson. We appreciate everyone tuning in today, and thank you for your interest in our company. Despite continued and evolving impact from COVID-19 globally, Johnson & Johnson delivered another strong year of sales and earnings growth. Full year Johnson & Johnson adjusted operational sales growth of 12.8% reflects the tenth consecutive year of adjusted operational above-market growth from Pharmaceuticals, the ongoing positive growth momentum from Medical Devices and continued competitive growth in Consumer Health. These strong results contribute to my confidence in our ability to achieve 2022 operational sales and earnings per share growth in the high single digits, with EPS growth that is higher than sales despite macroeconomic factors such as inflation. This, coupled with our differentiated portfolio of pipeline innovation, further strengthens my confidence in our long-term growth potential. In recent months, I have been busy meeting and listening to our customers, partners and members of the Johnson & Johnson family around the world. As part of these conversations, I have thought about the underlying constant of our business, the secret ingredient to our success. It is our people, their dedication and their eagerness to ask the toughest questions and seek the boldest and bravest answers. I'm deeply optimistic about our future, and I feel energized about the potential for our business. In the last 2 years, COVID-19 has changed global perceptions and attitudes towards healthcare. It has shown us that there is significant opportunity for change and improvement in order to better serve patients, customers and communities around the world. The global response to the pandemic has also created a renewed sense of optimism about the power of science. Around the world, people are focused on personal and societal health in new and urgent ways. And importantly, people are demanding that companies deliver on their promises and act with purpose. Johnson & Johnson will continue to answer that call. We strongly believe the future ahead of us looks brighter and healthier for every patient and consumer. We are determined to achieve this future, grounded by the same mission and credo that always guided us. In 2022, we will run our business as we always have, with these segments, maximizing opportunities for each individually. And I would like to share a bit about our near-term priorities as we focus on successfully creating a new independent Consumer Health company as well as continuing to build on our individual global leadership in Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices while enhancing synergies, which uniquely position us to accelerate growth and bring differentiated therapies that span both segments. At the end of last year, I laid out my top 3 priorities for a new era for Johnson & Johnson, and those priorities remain unchanged. These priorities are equally important for our success and include driving Medical Devices to become a best-in-class performer. We continue to focus on improved execution as evidenced by market share momentum as well as our improved cadence of innovation and organic and inorganic expansion into higher growth markets and market segments. We have 11 platforms in Medical Devices, which are over $1 billion. And as we have shared previously, we are gaining or holding share in almost all of this. This includes building upon our global market-leading positions in areas like electrophysiology, biosurgery and contact lenses and gaining market share in areas where we have been more challenged like Surgical Vision. The team has also launched over 20 new products during 2021, including the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution in orthopedics and 2 new intraocular lenses in Surgical Vision. Next, delivering on our Pharmaceutical business commitments and long-term growth goals. We are continuing to build upon our promising pharmaceutical pipeline, which we expect to continue to deliver above-market growth rates and are focused on our previously announced long-term goal of growing to a $60 billion segment by 2025. We are continuing to maximize the value of our existing medicines with 13 marketed medicines across 6 therapeutic areas, each to exceed $1 billion in revenue by 2025. We expect to file 36 significant line expansions for these 13 products through 2025. Here, it is important to note that these expansions are largely derisked because the products are in the market today, so there is good insight into their overall profiles. In addition, we expect 14 novel therapy filings through 2025, each with the potential to exceed $1 billion in revenue and 5 of this with the ability to exceed $5 billion. We remain confident in our ability to manage through the potential patent expiries as we have done in the past and continue to grow at above market rates. And finally, ensuring the successful creation of the new Consumer Health company.  In the coming year, we will take the steps necessary to be in a position to separate our Consumer Health business from our Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device businesses during 2023. This will advance more targeted business strategies, accelerate growth and deliver improved outcomes for both patients and consumers, which ultimately will deliver greater value to shareholders. Our Consumer Health business is competitive in terms of growth and over the past few years has made significant progress improving the margin profile. And as we advance towards a successful new stand-alone Consumer Health company, we will continue to drive this business with the same focus we always have. Our best-in-class team is delivering science-backed innovation across OTC, Skin Health and our Specialty business with a focus on digital, consumer-centric solutions and seamless end-to-end customer experience. As Joe noted, we continue to believe that a fit-for-purpose corporate structure and a dedicated capital allocation strategy will provide the Consumer Health business with the agility and flexibility to continue to grow its iconic portfolio of brands and innovate new products in the fast-paced consumer market. And we expect this new and independent company, with nearly $15 billion in 2021 sales, will continue to be a global leader in the consumer health industry. And the new Johnson & Johnson at nearly $80 billion in sales in 2021 will continue to be the largest, most diversified healthcare company in the world and will retain the benefits of scale. We'll enhance our ability to be more focused with our operations, making the new Johnson & Johnson poised to bring integrated and comprehensive care to patients through the use of new technology and innovative science. As we continue to focus on our 3 sectors today, we have no intention of sitting on the sidelines. Our strong financial position, along with the clear priorities we have for our business, position us well to deliver near-term financial expectations and invest for the long-term value creation. We'll have the flexibility to continue to invest in innovation and maintain our track record of growing our dividend while aspiring to be bolder with strategic value-creating acquisitions that will enhance the new Johnson & Johnson in higher growth markets. At this critical time for healthcare and our global society, we understand the significant role we play, and we accept the responsibility and challenges of the future. I hope you will all join us as we step forward into this new era. Thank you.

As we commented, our strong financial performance in 2021 is enveloped in a very strong financial profile, giving us the latitude to manage both for the long-term while meeting the short-term expectations of the financial community. As Joe commented, too, we are about to turn from a net debt to a net cash position for the first time in over 4 years. So we'll have to -- we'll have the flexibility to continue to grow our dividend, be bolder in strategic acquisitions and enhance the new J&J position in higher growth markets. And if warranted, we also would consider share repurchase programs. I believe that these priorities position us well for the future. And I think it's important to consider that when we get into 2022, we'll continue to manage the business strategically, one. The separation and the creation of the new consumer company, it's not going to slow us down of any priorities. So we continue to think about how we are going to opportunistically deploy cash for both organic and inorganic initiatives. And in other words, I wanted to make clear that if the right opportunities are there, in medtech and pharmaceuticals, the work stream of the separation won't held us back from forging ahead. When it comes to Pharmaceuticals, as you mentioned, we presented our outlook for the business in our November R&D review. And we explained to you that we were anticipating -- we are anticipating above-market growth rates reaching $60 billion by 2025, growing every single year there. So when we think about those results, it's important to remember that we do not factor there any future acquisitions or collaborations and that we are confident to reach those goals without inorganic activity. That said, one of the pillars of our success has been our agnostic view related to innovation and our desire to lean in for the new Johnson & Johnson for opportunities to build our current portfolio and our current portfolio, both in pharma and medtech remains there, and we need to look for that to enhance our growth profile. In fact, over the past 5 years, our investments in organic R&D and externally sourced innovation have been about equal. We continue to look to opportunities to be able to enhance our pharmaceutical portfolio. And we have been very proficient in identifying opportunities that have a high probability of success very early on as we have done, for example, with Legend. And also, we have been good looking at the post proof-of-concept opportunities like we did with Momenta. In the future, we'll continue to look for all types of opportunities early on post proof-of-concept. And we also will look at other opportunities of large size that we'll have to fulfill higher from a financial perspective, given the higher operational complications that these opportunities may take. But yes, we are constantly looking at M&A as a key source of growth for our business. Our position in cash today makes us been more aggressive in that area, and we'll continue with our focus on taking acquisitions, but not excluding, if the situation is granted, to look at medium-sized also opportunities.",544.0,246.0,23.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.09349593495934959,0.016260162601626018,0.02032520325203252,0.0,0.0,0.07723577235772358

I would just say, maybe to further elaborate on Joaquin's points, With respect to your question on valuations, it's really hard to say whether there's been a capitulation or a recognition that values have come down. I think we probably need to see a little bit longer period of that. I don't think things are out there necessarily on sale. But I will say that it really just takes 2 parties to agree on a valuation that makes sense. And a lot of times, the valuation is driven by the capabilities, the skills, the scientific expertise that we have that maybe that potential partner or acquired asset does not have at that time. So that's the kind of the way we look at it. Again, I don't think there's a capitulation, but we are seeking to use some of the cash on the balance sheet in a very disciplined, responsible way, that compensate shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf where we can create great value.",185.0,78.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.05128205128205128,0.0,0.0,-0.02564102564102564

How has January '22 trended relative to January 2021? And how are you thinking about medtech market growth in 2022? Previously, I think you expected about 4% to 5% growth. Is that still the case with Omicron and J&J's growth relative to that? How are you thinking about that?",59.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

If you look at surgical procedure volume in the fourth quarter, it eroded over the months of October, November, December. I would say it was roughly flat in the early part of the quarter relative to 2019, which we think is a more appropriate comparison, to down about 5%. The most pronounced area was clearly Orthopedics, which is the most elective segment of our portfolio. However, there's probably some reason for optimism if you look at diagnostic volumes in the fourth quarter. So that average roughly, let's call it 7%. It was a little bit stronger in October than it was in December, but still very positive relative to levels that were experienced in 2019. So we think there is a backlog that is potentially building of diagnosed cases that have yet to be scheduled. That being said, as you've heard from a number of outlets at this point, it really is about the hospital staffing and being able to accommodate surgeries from that perspective. We are seeing reduced cases with respect to Omicron, and we think that will play favorably. The first couple of weeks in January and probably limiting this to a week, maybe 2, saw a little bit of a bleed over from what we experienced in December around surgical procedures. But I do think that's going to improve with each passing month and with each passing quarter as the year goes on. And then as you heard from Joaquin as well as Jess, we are favorably positioned to capitalize on a much more stable market, given our improved competitiveness from where we were just a few years ago, in addition to the enhanced pipeline. Last year, we introduced over 20 products, same expectation for this year as well. So once the market gets to be a little bit more stable, hopefully no more future variants, and hospital administrators who have done a great job through the pandemic continue to modify their plans to ensure appropriate staffing, we think we will be in a very good position to not only approach market growth, but hopefully exceed it.",367.0,161.0,11.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.06832298136645963,0.012422360248447204,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.006211180124223602,0.055900621118012424

It is very difficult to predict when Omicron is going to peak, but we are beginning already to see cases decreasing in areas where the surge began like, for example, in the UK, and some regions in the U.S. already nearing peaks. So while COVID-19 may temporarily delay necessary medical and surgical interventions, the vast majority of these procedures cannot be ignored completely. And at the same time, hospitals, as Joe was referring, are getting better dealing with these situations. So while the path is not going to be linear, we expect an improvement as the year starts to go on and the fundamentals of the medtech market remain intact with disease prevalence and the need for surgery and change. So we believe we are optimistic of the value of the market in the long term, and we are optimistic about our medtech business and its ongoing recovery and improvement in the overall competitive position. So when we are facing 2022 on the medtech side, both from a market perspective and also from a Johnson & Johnson perspective, we look at it optimistically.

So overall, as I have commented in our Pharmaceutical Analyst Day and also in the different conferences that I have participated, medtech, it's going to be a key priority for me in my tenure. I see medtech and pharmaceuticals being the core of the new Johnson & Johnson that, as Joe commented, will remain the largest and more diversified healthcare company. So clearly, medtech, it's going to be a key area of focus for us in every aspect. When it comes to medtech and its market performance, I have to highlight that we have seen a very clear ongoing recovery in our medtech performance. We went from 1.5% growth in 2017 to nearly 4% in 2019, and we are ending the year at 4.6%. And when you adjust for the 53rd week, we are in about 5%. So we are clearly improving our performance in the medtech space, driven by some market segments which are really delivering in a very strong way. For example, in interventional, our growth ending the year was 15.3%. Our ambition, our growth in the year was 11%. So we have clearly outstanding performance there. And in most of the platforms that we participate, we are gaining share or maintaining share, improving our position. It's difficult for me to bracket exactly what the growth is going to be and when it's going to happen. But our goal clearly is to make our medtech sector a best-in-class performer. So that's going to be a defining element of my tenure, and we are going to be working towards that. We are going to be improving our commercial execution as we are doing today. We'll continue to invest in our organic pipeline that is delivering. We have had the highest level of innovation in our medtech business in 2021 ever, and our pipeline today has the highest value as measured by net present value that we have ever had. And also, we recognize that we need to do and we need to continue to be active in external innovation in order to be able to participate in markets where growth is occurring that we are not participating today or to build upon adjacencies our existing businesses that are going to further our growth. So as in any business, when it comes to their business allocation, we'll continue to drive our winners, and we'll try to efficiently manage the areas in which we are more challenged. And we'll continue to look for opportunities externally that will complement our portfolio and will enable us to enter into higher growth markets. Overall, our past acquisitions suggest that we have been good in managing smaller deals and tacking deals, and that is our base case. But at the same time, we don't have an artificial ceiling in our deal size. We are always looking for any opportunity that exist in the marketplace. But as I said before, when I was commenting about pharmaceuticals, we do know that larger deals are much harder to make work, both financially and operationally, and they will always have a higher bar.

First, on operating margin leverage, you're talking about 50 basis points in '22. But as I think about longer term, I think about J&J, they got a broad pipeline of assets to invest in. Can we think about the company continuing to leverage its P&L over the next few years, I guess, particularly as you head into the STELARA LOE? Or should we think about a window of time longer term where some of the top line growth is maybe reinvested back in the business and margin expansion kind of is a bit more muted for a few years? And then, Joaquin, just following up on the M&A and Medical Devices. I just want to make sure I'm clear. As we think about business development and the role it's going to play within that division, should we be thinking about something very different than in the past? Or is it more about a tweak in the approach and the strategy from what you've been seeing recently? So is this a lot more deals, if they're smaller or something bigger?

With respect to operating margins, I think the 50 basis points is probably something that is reasonable to expect this year given some of the inflationary pressures that we've outlined, likely to be experienced in the first half of this year. That being said, given the size of our company, we do think we can always improve kind of the infrastructure, our operating model to find some leverage in the P&L. I won't commit to any -- to say it's each and every year. I think that's going to be very much dependent upon the opportunities that are presented to us in any given year. And if we've got an opportunity to invest disproportionately in R&D, on a particular asset, we will do that, and we just have to size up that opportunity. But I do think as a general rule, given the size of our company, that we should find some opportunity to operate where we can leverage. I would like to see us as we separate the company, maybe be relabeled as more of a growth company. And therefore, we may reposition that, taking that top line growth and putting that back into the business. But as you can see, even in recent years, we've had, I would say, significant operating margin improvement, but we have not starved investment. R&D was up over last year's record-setting year by $2.6 billion or 20%, as Jess mentioned.

Our aspiration in medtech is to be the first or the second in the markets that we participate. And if we are in markets that -- if we are not in markets that are growing, also have a path to get there, right? Recently, we have divested some of the businesses like diagnostics, pain, diabetes, where we came to the conclusion that it was difficult to get into this #1, #2 position, and that was better to sell that business in order to create value. So given the recent investment activity, what I want to emphasize and I have alluded at the outset is that my priority now is to be more on the acquisitive side and to be more aggressive on the acquisition side, identifying products that complement our portfolio but play in higher growth markets or market segments that we are today.

We've tried to address all the risks that are appropriate based on the information that we have as of January 26. And so we've taken into account, I think, a favorable outlook and an improving trend in Medical Devices, but also the fact that it's going to be a slower start to the year for some of the factors that we mentioned. The same type of position was taken with consumer and some of the supply constraints from some of our suppliers. So I think it's the right balance for where we stand today. We know from the last 2 years that things will likely change, and we'll adjust accordingly. In Pharmaceuticals, there's really not much of a change there. We expect that to be pretty stable. We enjoyed our 10th consecutive year of above-market growth, and we're planning for an 11th year in 2022.

At the same time, we remain very optimistic in multiple fronts. We remain optimistic on the fact that -- as I commented before, when I was talking about medtech, the strong underlying demand for healthcare is there. And there's still lots to do in multiple diseases in order to address suffering and death there. So there's a strong underlying demand for medical care. And at the same time, both in medtech and in biopharmaceuticals, you see significant opportunity for science progress in terms of new treatment modalities that will give us the opportunity to enrich our pipeline and get to more patients.

So Matt, let me start with some of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing and how we're offsetting those. So in consumer, there's, I would say, select products within the portfolio, think Skin Health and Beauty, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, where lubricants and things of that nature are in shorter supply. There are some, I'd say, probably increased labor costs with respect to third-party manufacturers, and we're obviously seeing heightened transportation costs. We are like the competitors in the consumer space, offsetting some of those costs with select price increases in our portfolio, where we can still provide those trusted brands and products to people without really impacting the elasticity or the demand of those products overall. We think we can strike that right balance as others have. In Medical Devices, I would say it's around the labor input costs and some of the staffing related to COVID-19, I would say, in the sense of overstaffing to some degree, but those are costs that are clearly managed. They're much like Pharmaceuticals are not prices that we can increase. And then, in fact, the stellar performance that you saw in pharmaceuticals was the sixth consecutive year where we actually had negative price. So the growth that you see is more than 100% of volume due to the innovation and the ability to address unmet medical needs. And then with Medical Devices, most of those specifically in the U.S. are contractual by nature. So there's limited opportunity there as well. So where we can, specifically in consumer, we're looking to pass some of those cost increases on.

So going into medtech, R&D and medtech innovation, let me start by the fact that during 2021, we launched over 20 significant products across each segment of the Medical Device business. Some examples of that, for example, in electrophysiology, we had a limited launch of our QDOT MICRO in Europe. QDOT is a first-in-kind smart micro catheter, which is designed to deliver about 2x to 3x the amount of energy; and at the same time, reduce the total patient exposure and provided exposure to fluoro and reduced total procedure time. And that's helping us in driving our position in electrophysiology. In Orthopedics, we continue our enhancements in orthopedic knees, both with the differentiated next-generation VELYS Robotic-Assisted system. And at the same time, we had the introduction in December of the ATTUNE Cementless fixed bearing base. So these introductions are making us more competitive in the knee space, in the knee arena. In advanced surgery, we have some augmentations to energy to our energy portfolio with our ENSEAL X1 Curved Jaw Tissue Sealer. And in Vision, we introduced our ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL contact lenses; and in Surgical Vision, our intraocular lenses, TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy. So great innovation, which is driving our better performance in market performance. When it comes to our pipeline, there are a number of exciting things coming up, for example, our next-generation diagnostic catheter in electrophysiology and also a potential solution in pulsed field ablation. So all these areas make us believe that we're going to remain extremely competitive in electrophysiology. We continue to prioritize the expansion of our VELYS digital surgery potentially into the hip space and also foot and ankle solutions in orthopedics. And specifically, to your question on digital surgery, that's a very important area for us. We have a bold ambition there, and we are already making progress. The first launch was our MONARCH robotic system. Our MONARCH robotic system, it's enabling in the luminal bronchoscopies. And we have already launched it in the U.S., and it's progressing really well. And we are also studying our MONARCH robotic system to deliver energy and also a payload of pharmaceuticals for being able to do local treatment of early lung cancer lesions. At the same time, we have also submitted a 510(k) expansion of MONARCH for a potential treatment in kidney stones that will give us an expanded market in this area. I commented on our successful launch of our robotic system with VELYS, and we recognize that we will have to continue to be committed to develop in Ottava and entering into the general surgery market with a highly competitive offering, and we are working through that as soon as possible, and we will provide updates as we progress.",468.0,220.0,11.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.05,0.004545454545454545,0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.004545454545454545,0.045454545454545456

Good to hear you on the call. Just a question on M&A. I mean that seems to be a hot topic, seems to be a more aggressive stance there. And specifically, in Medical Devices, just thinking about the commentary around preference and tuck-ins. But you have some larger players with a broader presence in areas where you guys actually have pretty significant gap. And these players do have the 1 or 2 position in most of these markets, albeit it's a mix of some higher growth versus some lower growth markets, but certainly gives you the scale that seems like is the direction that the market might be moving in. Just curious if you can comment on sort of how you're balancing the approach to building out further a competitive Medical Device portfolio versus sort of getting it with scale or doing a bunch of tuck-ins that ultimately get you there maybe 5, 10 years down the line? Just wanted to see if you guys could comment on how you're thinking about that.",189.0,87.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.011494252873563218,0.022988505747126436,0.06896551724137931,0.0,0.0,-0.011494252873563218

And that's where we have been successful, and we are always trying to look for opportunities in that context in market segments that are going to enable us to enter into higher growth areas or to complement through adjacencies our existing portfolio. So that is the way we have been creating value in a very significant way, both in pharma and in medtech. While our past history always suggest smaller deals, as I said before, we don't have an artificial ceiling as far as far as deal size. It has to be something that has to be workable financially and in terms of value creating for shareholders. And typically larger deals are harder to make work both financial and operationally. So that's where we make it more of an emphasis in areas where we have a higher chance of creating value. We are open to midsized and larger deals, and we have demonstrated that we have done that in the past like we did, for example, with Actelion, but we tend to prefer this small new molecule, new device that we can, as I said before, apply a lot of our scientific technology, regulatory expertise and ultimately create this $1 billion platforms that we have, both in medtech and in pharmaceuticals. So that's our preference. That's our strategy, but we always remain open to investigate any opportunity or possibility that may be out there.

The loss of exclusivity obviously coming up in September of 2023. Can you update us on your thinking about what the erosion curve could look like? I think that there's some underpinnings in terms of different indications that have been growing. A major competitor with a similarly year, a major blockbuster product in the I&I category has that.

We continue to deliver reliable growth and generate meaningful free cash flow, enabling us to invest and advance our pipeline, increase our dividend for the 60th consecutive year and continued to make a positive impact across the landscape of health care. It is, however, important to take a few moments to recognize the current events that are impacting the world we're living in. Today, while we're all still managing through the global pandemic, as evidenced by the current surge of cases in China, we also acknowledge the increasing hardship brought on by the war in Ukraine.

This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com, where you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. Please note that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our future operating and financial performance and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. We encourage you to review the cautionary statement included in today's presentation, which identifies certain risks and factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other marketplace dynamics. This means that results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results and outlook is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion to the most comparable GAAP measures. These materials are also available at investor.jnj.com. Several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review the first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and the three segments. Following, Joe will provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities and updated guidance for 2022. The remaining time will be available for your questions. During the Q&A portion of the call, Joe will be joined by, Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Medtech; Thibaut Mongon, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Consumer Health; and Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chair, Pharmaceutical. We have heard your feedback and are implementing a few enhancements this quarter. First, we are now providing select earlier phase clinical trial information on our pharmaceutical pipeline to streamline your data collection efforts from clinicaltrials.gov. Second, rather than sharing detailed business performance commentary on each part of the business, I will summarize the significant business drivers, leaving more time for Q&A. You can find additional detailed segment commentary in our earnings presentation. We anticipate the webcast will last up to 60 minutes. Now, let's move to the first quarter results. Worldwide sales were $23.4 billion for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 5% versus the first quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.7% as currency had a negative impact of 2.7 points. In the US, sales increased 2.7%. In regions outside the US, our reported growth was 7.2%. Operational sales growth outside the US was 12.6%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 5.4 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 7.9% worldwide, 2.8% in the US and 12.9% outside the US. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.93 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.32 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.1 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.67, representing increases of 3% and 3.1%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6.2%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2021 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning in 2022, certain over-the-counter products previously reported under the Pharmaceutical segment have been reclassed to Consumer Health. These products represent roughly $100 million of sales per quarter. Please refer to the supplemental sales schedules for prior year restatements. Also, as stated in our 2021 10-K, effective January, our Medical Devices segment is now referred to as MedTech. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.6 billion increased 0.8% with a decline of 3.4% in the US and growth of 4.1% outside the US. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, Worldwide growth was 1.6%. Consumer Health was negatively impacted by industry-wide external supply constraints, primarily due to ingredients and packaging availability as well as labor shortages largely reflected in our Skin Health and Beauty business, worth approximately 280 basis points worldwide and 500 basis points in the US. Adjusting for these constraints, Consumer Health delivered solid results, primarily due to above-market growth in OTC driven by increased TYLENOL, MOTRIN and upper respiratory product sales. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $12.9 billion increased 9.3% with growth of 2.9% in the US and 16.7% outside of the US. Base Pharmaceutical growth was driven by our broad portfolio of products paired with strong commercial execution, enabling us to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth, including six assets with double-digit growth in the quarter. Base business growth was due to strength from DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA, ERLEADA and our paliperidone long-acting portfolio. Growth was partially offset by LOE pressures from both REMICADE and ZYTIGA, along with decrease in IMBRUVICA and XARELTO sales. DARZALEX continues to drive very strong operational growth with sales increases of 40.3%, driven by subcutaneous formulation penetration and meaningful share gains across all lines of therapy and in all regions. IMBRUVICA sales declined 3.9% worldwide due to increased competition from novel oral agents, particularly in US. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide and continues to drive growth outside of the US despite ongoing competitive pressures. XARELTO sales declined 13.8% in the US, driven largely by a net unfavorable prior period price adjustment and increased cost for patient access, partially offset by continued demand and market growth. The COVID-19 vaccine also contributed approximately $500 million to sales in the quarter. Given these results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in 2022. I'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7 billion increased 8.5%, with growth of 5.6% in the US and growth of 11.1% outside the US. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 8.6%. We see strong performance in Q1 driven by market recovery, focused commercial strategies and differentiated new products driving enhanced or sustained market share across most of the 11 priority platforms. We continue to monitor potential impacts on elective procedures driven by COVID-19 resurgences across various markets. Before highlighting the financial performance for the segment, I'd like to share a few notable first quarter MedTech events that demonstrate our stated aspirations of entering higher-growth market segments and continuing to build upon digital technologies across the portfolio. Two acquisitions were closed in the quarter, CrossRoads Extremity with a differentiated portfolio of bunion and hammertoes solutions in the fast-growing elective foot and ankle market; and CUPTIMIZE, which will be a new addition to the VELYS digital surgery platform of connected technologies. The CUPTIMIZE solution is designed to give surgeons an easy-to-use tool to better understand and address the impact of abnormal motion between the spine and pelvis in some patients who require total hip arthroplasty and may help reduce the risk of dislocation related to pelvic tilt. I am also pleased to share that Fast Company selected Johnson & Johnson MedTech as one its top 10 World's Most Innovative Health Companies of 2022, recognizing MedTech's success and commitment to delivering breakthrough scientific innovation and reimagining health in an increasingly digital world. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 17.4%, with double-digit growth in both the US and OUS regions, driven primarily by success of new products in electrophysiology, commercial execution and continued market recovery. Worldwide surgery grew 5%, driven by strong performance in wound closure and biosurgery where we continue to gain market share. MONARCH-enabled procedures now exceed 14,000 since launch, providing continued evidence of the adoption of MONARCH technology in patient treatment regimens. The worldwide Orthopedics franchise grew 5.6%, reflecting COVID-19 recovery, continued penetration in the US ambulatory surgery center channel or ASCs; and penetration of new product launches, such as enhancements to VELYS hip navigation, VELYS robotic-assisted solution and ATTUNE cementless knee system. Partially offsetting this growth was softness in spine procedures in the US. The worldwide Vision franchise continued its double-digit growth, growing 13.9% this quarter. Contact lenses global growth of 10.6% reflects continued positive momentum for our market-leading ACUVUE portfolio, success of commercial initiatives and recently launched products such as ACUVUE OASYS MULTIFOCAL and ACUVUE DEFINE FRESH. Surgical vision delivered global growth of 23.8%, with both the US and OUS posting growth above 20%, fueled by market recovery and share momentum due to the success of recently launched products, including TECNIS Eyhance and TECNIS Synergy. As a reminder, additional sales commentary for all of our segments can be found on the slides. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2022. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 70 basis points, driven by unfavorable mix in the MedTech business and commodity inflation in the Consumer Health business. Sales, marketing and administrative deleveraged by 110 basis points, driven by higher brand marketing expenses in Consumer Health and timing of brand marketing expenses in the Pharmaceutical segment. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.8% of sales this quarter. The $3.5 billion investment was an 8.9% increase versus the prior year, primarily due to portfolio progression in Pharmaceutical and MedTech. In process, research and development reflects an impairment expense of $610 million for certain indications associated with bermekimab, the investigational compound acquired from XBiotech Inc. as disclosed in our previous SEC filings. This impairment was driven by the termination of development of bermekimab for atopic dermatitis based on efficacy data. The other income and expense line was net income of $102 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to net income of $882 million in the first quarter of 2021. This decrease was the result of lapping prior year gains on the divestiture of Doxil, Calyx and EBRA in 2021, higher unrealized losses on securities and Consumer Health separation costs. This was partially offset by favorable returns associated with our employee benefit plans. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 12.2% versus 16.6% in the same period last year. The decreased tax rate was primarily driven by lower US income due to higher unrealized losses on securities and the impairment of bermekimab IP R&D compared to prior year divestiture gains. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 13.3% versus 16.5% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 37.1% to 35.1% due to product mix, commodity inflation, increased brand marketing expense, portfolio progression in R&D and comparisons to gains from prior year divestitures. Pharmaceutical margin declined from 45.5% to 44.1%, primarily driven by timing of brand marketing expenses and general portfolio progression in R&D. MedTech margins declined from 30.6% to 27%, driven by unfavorable product mix. Finally, Consumer Health margins declined from 26.8% to 22.1%, due to commodity inflation and higher brand marketing expenses. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson first quarter results. I am now pleased to turn the call back over to Joe Wolk.",1999.0,1178.0,34.0,31.0,17.0,0.0,7.0,9.0,3.0,22.0,0.028862478777589132,0.02631578947368421,0.014431239388794566,0.0,0.005942275042444821,0.0025466893039049238

These external challenges include limited availability and rising prices of certain commodities; as well as increased costs for labor, energy and transportation. These impacts are pervasive across the enterprise, but most notable in Consumer Health. We expect these pressures will continue to some degree throughout the remainder of 2022. However, mitigation efforts are underway, including cost improvement initiatives, strategic price increases and contract negotiations with external supply partners. We are committed to sustaining supply of the products, medicines and treatments that consumers and patients want and need. Turning to our segments and notable events in the quarter. MedTech led our enterprise performance with nearly 9% adjusted operational sales growth. We continue to drive this business forward and are increasing the value of our pipeline through innovation, internally and externally. We were pleased to see a steady uptick in surgical procedures this quarter with the easing of COVID restrictions in many parts of the world, but we recognize that the situation is fluid, which requires monitoring. Building on more than 20 major new product launches in 2021, MedTech announced the addition of two new innovations to our ATTUNE portfolio, the ATTUNE cementless fixed bearing knee with AFFIXIUM 3DP Technology and the ATTUNE medial stabilized knee system. In our Pharmaceutical business, we continue to deliver above-market growth driven by volume as evidenced by our recently published 2021 Janssen US Transparency Report, which reflects our fifth consecutive year of price decreases across the portfolio despite inflationary pressures. We also continue to advance our Pharmaceutical pipeline. This quarter, we received FDA approval for Carvykti, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma developed together with our partner, Legend Biotech. We are partnering with clinics utilizing a phased approach to begin patient dosing, and the feedback to date has been positive. We also filed Teclistamab, our BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody seeking EMA approval, and we also received priority review from the FDA, potentially expanding our multiple myeloma portfolio further. In our Consumer Health business, we remain focused on delivering on our 2022 performance objectives, continuing to achieve above-market growth in our over-the-counter medicines business, while navigating industry-wide supply constraints that have primarily impacted our Skin Health/Beauty business. We continue to be excited about the activity related to the announcement we made in November on the creation of two new industry-leading companies, the new Johnson & Johnson and the new Consumer Health Company. For the new Johnson & Johnson, the portfolio will remain well diversified with 25 brands delivering over $1 billion in sales annually, holding market-leading positions across key therapeutic areas and franchises. The financial hallmarks of Johnson & Johnson will remain the same, including a well-defined capital allocation strategy, a disciplined approach to inorganic growth and a strong balance sheet, while also creating opportunities to sharpen focus on execution and clinically differentiated innovation. The new Consumer Health Company will also have a strong financial profile and be better positioned to drive incremental growth, realizing increased potential in new markets through a more agile operating model. The company will continue to deliver science-backed innovation and enhanced digital consumer-centric solutions. The Consumer Health separation team is making substantial progress related to our efforts in establishing the new independent company. As previously mentioned, we cannot disclose new financial information specific to Consumer Health in order to preserve optionality on the various separation pathways. Our time lines remain unchanged. We anticipate announcing key executive leadership appointments for the new Consumer Health Company in the coming months, with plans to provide the new company name and headquarters location around the middle of this year. In the second half of 2022, we plan to provide the updated path forward and applicable financial information such as refined standup cost estimates and potential short-term dissynergies. Finally, consistent with previous communications, we expect to execute the separation in 2023. You have our ongoing commitment adhering to the regulatory framework to provide transparent updates for material decisions on a timely basis. Turning now to cash and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow for the quarter of nearly $3.4 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $30 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $33 billion of debt for a net debt position of approximately $3 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Internal innovation remains critical to our future growth and a top priority. In the first quarter, we increased R&D investment by approximately 9% compared to the first quarter of 2021. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to complement the current portfolio with acquisitions that build upon our capabilities, address portfolio gaps or play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns. As I mentioned earlier, we were pleased to announce today that our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend for the 60th consecutive year from $1.06 per share to $1.13 per share, an increase of 6.6%. Moving to full year 2022 guidance and key considerations. I'll start with comments on our COVID-19 vaccine and foreign exchange impacts, essentially the only items with updates from our January guidance. As market demand for all COVID-19 vaccines is currently challenged by global supply surplus and vaccine hesitancy in developing markets, we have made the decision to suspend guidance for sales of our COVID-19 vaccine. This will enable investors to focus on the performance of our core businesses, which drive the current and future value for investors. We are maintaining the total adjusted operational earnings per share guidance we provided in January, absorbing, if need be, the modest income impact from the COVID-19 vaccine. Regarding foreign exchange, as you know, we don't offer guidance or predictions on currency movements. But to give you a sense of the impact currency may have on potential full year reported results, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar as of last week at 1.08, there is an incremental unfavorable currency impact of $1.1 billion on reported sales and an unfavorable $0.25 for reported adjusted earnings per share versus the calculation related to January's guidance. The full year unfavorable impact is now projected to be $2.5 billion on reported sales and $0.45 on reported adjusted earnings per share. All other line items for which we provide guidance remain the same as communicated in January. To reiterate, we are maintaining our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance. We don't provide quarterly guidance, but do understand that you find value in us providing some qualitative considerations as you update your models. In Consumer Health, we expect supply constraints to continue throughout the year but not to the same extent in the second half. As a result, we anticipate that the back half performance will improve over the first half. For MedTech, while the first quarter demonstrated faster recovery than we anticipated, our full year expectations remain fairly intact. We anticipate continued market recovery and uptake from recently launched products and are monitoring the ever-changing COVID dynamics, particularly the surging cases in China. Similar to Consumer Health, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half. As a reminder, with respect to growth rates, the second quarter was the strongest quarter for MedTech in 2021. The expectations for the Pharmaceutical base business remain the same. We anticipate delivering another year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth with relatively consistent growth throughout the remainder of the year. In summary, Johnson & Johnson had a solid start to the year despite managing macroeconomic headwinds, and we remain confident in our business. I would like to recognize the continued efforts of our 144,000 global colleagues focused on delivering our innovative healthcare solutions to our credo stakeholders. Their unwavering dedication and support continue to inspire. And on behalf of the executive team, I'd like to extend our gratitude. I am now pleased to welcome to the call, Ashley McEvoy, Thibaut Mongon and Jennifer Taubert, our Worldwide Chairs to address your questions.

But Joe, I'll start with M&A. You know, there were comments on the tape stating that you're eager to deploy cash to M&A, especially for devices. So maybe for you or Ashley, can you add more color to your thinking there and the types of opportunities to consider? You know, you've talked about reaching the top of the peer set in devices. That would seem to require a relatively large deal or a series of small to medium-sized deals to move the needle. Is that a fair way to think about it?

So Larry, I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to Ashley for some thoughts specific on Medical Devices. But before I answer, Larry, I do want to compliment you and your team for the foreign exchange report that you guys issued back, I think it was on April 13. That was just -- it's a tough topic to really grasp. And you guys did a fantastic job in assessing what it meant for the medical device industry. It was really a fantastic report. So well done. With respect to cash, as you heard us in January, we are reaching our lowest levels of net debt. And we remain very active. You could talk to Thibaut, Jennifer and Ashley, with respect to ideas that they are bringing forth. We continue to have the same principles that we've had historically. We want to make sure there's a strategic fit. And by that, I simply mean we've got capabilities. We've got scientific expertise. Perhaps it's just our scale that adds more value to that asset than where it currently resides. And then we want to make sure that we compensate risk -- compensate shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf when we do so. I would not get overly locked into size. Johnson & Johnson, quite frankly, have been built through a number of smaller acquisitions, and really the outliers are these larger acquisitions. But we look at really the strategic merit and then the financial value creation and don't get locked in to saying something is too small or too big with respect to adding to our already dynamic internal portfolio and pipeline.

I'm pleased with the results of the quarter. We saw positive signs of the market recovery. Clearly, while COVID has not disappeared, health systems around the world are becoming increasingly more resistant with each passing wave. And as we know, the world is -- is a lot more equipped to manage the pandemic, and quite frankly, so is Johnson & Johnson. So encouraged to see in quarter one that we continue to maintain our path to above-market performance. We referenced that this is kind of a growth at scale, if you will, 11, $1 billion platforms, really most of them growing or maintaining share. And we saw robust sales growth across all four of our franchises in all four of our regions. Some standout, encouraging to see both vision surgery and Vision Care, both double-digit performance and growing market share, really fueled by innovation in ACUVUE and TECNIS. We are the world leader in electrophysiology, still a category that has significant under penetration. We've had 11 consecutive years of double-digit performance and really significantly enhanced our share gain. We're the world leader in biosurgery. The business was up almost 10%, really driven by a clinically differentiated portfolio. And then finally, and enthusiastically, I say we had strong performance in joints really by penetrating some new sites of care like ASCs, both with hips and knees. So when I look forward, I'm encouraged by the organic agenda that we see in innovation, like with the likes of the FDA approval on ACUVUE Theravision, the first drug-eluting contact lens. As Joe mentioned earlier, around really shoring up high-growth segments in knees with ATTUNE fixed bearing, and then really with CERENOVUS the launch of EmboGad, the balloon catheter. So continue to advance robotics and digital surgery. You'll hear us talk about MONARCH 14,000 cases with a big pipeline of new indications, and then VELYS completing over 2,000 cases. So when I think about the future of M&A, Larry, we're going to continue to do tuck-ins and to really digitize the patient experience. You heard us talk about CUPTIMIZE as an example around really adding a precise delivery to hit navigation to improve outcomes. You're going to see us continue to penetrate fast-growing segments like what we have in neurovascular, as an example, 90% of our capital deployment has been to $1 billion or more, but we do intend to make sure that we are well positioned to be in the highest growth end state markets.",438.0,218.0,13.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,0.05963302752293578,0.0045871559633027525,0.009174311926605505,0.0,0.0,0.05504587155963303

Can you specifically comment on China in terms of the impact you're currently seeing to the business and your outlook for that market specifically, given some of the lockdowns that we're seeing there? And then my kind of core question was just on IMBRUVICA. It seems like prescriptions here are really starting to see some erosion. I'm trying to understand the dynamics you're expecting going forward. So is this -- especially maybe in the US market, are you expecting that this erosion continues?

We're the world – we are number one in MedTech in China. We have a very diversified portfolio from surgery to orthopedics to interventional as well as vision. We did experience an impact probably in the March time frame due to the recent surge of the viruses happening and the lockdowns, particularly in Shanghai and now other regions. We do anticipate that to continue in April and through the month of May. But like we've seen, I think China might come down a bit faster, but it comes back faster, too.

A few comments on the Pharmaceutical business, and then I'll get to the question on IMBRUVICA. First, for our pharm business, I was really proud that we delivered $12.9 billion in worldwide sales. We're definitely above-market adjusted operational growth of 9.3%. And this is our sixth quarter where we achieved worldwide sales exceeding $12 billion. And as I look across the globe, the growth was really broadly based across our portfolio in the regions, with particularly strong growth in EMEA, Asia Pac and Latin America. During the course of the quarter, we really continued to maximize the value of our key brands, so strong double-digit growth across six of them, including DARZALEX, ERLEADA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA, [Privado] (ph) and EDURANT. And we also had a number of important milestones, the first being the FDA approval of Carvykti, which is our first cell therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The teclistamab filing in the EU was mentioned. The FDA approved expanded label indications for CABENUVA to be administered every two months for the treatment of HIV in virologically suppressed adults and adolescents. And we presented great new data on TREMFYA in our approved indications of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, as well as from our Phase II studies, where we're evaluating the product in Crohn's Disease and also in UC. So if we take a look at IMBRUVICA more specifically, IMBRUVICA sales did decline for the quarter, 3.9%, and this really was a US story. Outside the US, our sales actually grew 4.5%. In the US, performance was impacted by both competitive factors with a number of new competitors in the market as well as market softness. We haven't seen that market fully rebound to the pre-COVID levels yet. As we take a look at IMBRUVICA, IMBRUVICA has really changed the standard of care for adults with CLL and other B-cell malignancies. And it is the only BTKI that’s demonstrated overall survival and a high rate of progression-free survival at five years with up to eight years of safety follow-up. So, we remain really confident in the efficacy and safety profile of the product. It's the market share leader and continues to be the most comprehensively studied and prescribed BTKI with over 250,000 patients worldwide. So we continue to work to develop the asset. We do see further growth opportunities through the introduction of new indications and new combination therapies, as we take a look at IMBRUVICA plus venetoclax that we're working to develop and we filed in the EU. We're also taking a look at first line [ph] and CL and really trying to bring that forward. So I think you can anticipate there will continue to be strong competition in that market. We continue to believe in and invest in IMBRUVICA.",482.0,219.0,7.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,0.0319634703196347,0.0091324200913242,0.0091324200913242,0.0,0.0,0.0228310502283105

With respect to operating margins overall, which is really, I think, at the heart of your question, in the front -- the first quarter, I should say, we do tend to adopt a little bit more of an aggressive approach to advertising and promotion and hopes of getting the full year benefit of that promotion to the topline lift throughout the year. And I would say on R&D, it's also a little bit front-end loaded this year, simply from the standpoint of the progression of our pharmaceutical pipeline, as well as digital robotic surgery. So in pharmaceuticals, think about nipocalimab, our RSV vaccine, those had very nice progression. Teclistamab may be moving a little bit faster than we anticipated, as well as being able to launch Carvykti. There was a healthy amount of inflation built into our P&L in the January guidance. What I think our teams have seen in the -- let's say, the first four months of this year is an uptick in that inflationary impact of about 10% or 15%. So still very manageable. Again, as you heard in some of the prepared remarks, we anticipate that that inflationary pressure as well as commodity scarcity will subside a little bit in the second quarter and then hopefully more pronounced in the second half of this year. If it doesn't, it's certainly something that will keep our attention. And we have the resources to adjust accordingly to make sure that we not only meet the needs of long-term value creation, but also meet short-term performance expectations. So we all think it's very manageable at this point in time, but it's something that we're not taking for granted. We're being very active with cost initiative programs. As we look to separate the two companies, we are looking at ways to streamline technology, processes, things that will lead to leverage on the P&L.",331.0,154.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.012987012987012988,0.01948051948051948,0.0,0.0,0.0

Perhaps directed at the Pharmaceutical segment for Jennifer. Two products I'd like to focus on, one being STELARA and the other on XARELTO. With STELARA, could you perhaps elaborate a little bit more in terms of some of the underlying dynamics across the various indications, i.e., the derm versus perhaps the IBD in terms of what the growth trends and outlook you're seeing and you expect there? And then for XARELTO, part of your commentary in the prepared segment discussed and mentioned about patient access.

So STELARA sales were $2.29 billion in the first quarter, and that was 9% growth. And we continue to see a lot of strength in STELARA. Ex-US, the product had nearly 18% growth. In the US, what we saw was growth around 3.6%. And what this really was due to, we saw an impact in the US due to the Omicron variant and the impact that it actually had on staffing resources that particularly impacted a number of areas where you had more resource-intensive delivery of care, and GI offices was definitely one. As we take a look at Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, our share positions remain strong and with very strong positive momentum. We actually gained over five share points in CD and six share points in ulcerative colitis. So really strong growth and momentum. And with -- in psoriasis, as anticipated with TREMFYA and a very strong growth in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, we expected the STELARA sales there to start tailing off, and that's in line with our expectations. So we continue to have a very strong positive outlook for STELARA going through the rest of the year in CD and in Crohn's -- excuse me, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, where we've really been realizing the growth. And likewise, when you take a look at TREMFYA, we saw 44.5% growth in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the quarter. So together, really, really nice performance there. Question on XARELTO. So XARELTO in the US, we did see sales decline. That was largely driven by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment. And most of this has actually been a positive adjustment that took place in 2021. So when you do the comparable, it was negative. And so that was really due to the vast majority of that. With Xarelto, we continue to see nice share gains and growth at a prescription level across the indications, whether we're talking about CAD and PAD, really the newest indication set, but also across AFib and VTE. And so it really was around the net unfavorable PPA and a little bit of channel mix as well with some of the mix shifting into 340B and Medicaid in some of the lower-priced channels.",383.0,169.0,11.0,6.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0650887573964497,0.03550295857988166,0.01775147928994083,0.0,0.0,0.029585798816568046

What I can say is that it is going well and it is on track with our expectations. We're real pleased. As you know, this is a customized therapy where the supply chain is literally built around each patient. We've got about a four week to five week period that goes from the collection of the cells, the processing and manufacturing and the return shipment of the final product and then ultimately the infusion back in to the patient at the treatment center. As we have mentioned before we really are taking a thoughtful and a phased approach to scaling this launch, to ensure a predictable and a reliable experience for the patients and for the treatment centers. We really tried to learn from the other launches in the market in this area. And so far, we're off to a really good start there and have been very pleased with the feedback that we're getting back from our customers. So we have activated our initial round of treatment centers. And we did this based on folks who were very well-experienced from our clinical trials and also very broadly dispersed throughout the US and help ensure patient access. We're working through all of the orders and the slots that we have and actually have product now that's been shipped back -- has been manufactured and shipped back to the patients for infusion into the patients. So we're going to continue in a planned and thoughtful responsible approach to this scaling, both in the United States as well as we do -- as we scale outside the US and throughout the world as well. Now we discussed before around lentivirus. Because there is an industry-wide shortage of lentivirus, that is something that we are also working and investing in to scale all of our internal capabilities to be able to meet the demand, both now in our initial launches in the relapsed/refractory setting as well as our ultimate goal to be able to move into first-line setting here. And so we would have an internal control on that as well.

Joe, since Joaquin made some public commentary on his commitment to support Ashley and her team to drive revenue growth acceleration in the Mega Devices unit, your focus has been on M&A opportunities. But how should we think about the level of internal investment to fuel growth of the devices franchise? You don't break out the percentage of R&D spend allocated to devices. But one data point we do have is from the 2019 pharma day when you related $8.4 billion of the $11 billion in R& D expense from 2018 went to pharma initiatives, so that's north of 75%.

You saw a record number of 20 plus new product launches last year that are considered meaningful. We're going to be very close to probably a very similar number this year.

I would say, Asia with the exception of China recently also bounced back, and then US really gained momentum. I always look at two data points in the US as an example. I look at like, how were diagnostic procedures performing in the US and then how are surgical procedures performing. And probably at our trough when Omicron was hitting in the US in January, we had about flat diagnostic procedures, and we were looking at surgical procedures down near double digit, down 10%. Encouragingly, as we exited March, we started to see diagnostic procedures tick up to high single digit and start to see a flattening of surgical procedures.

So as we take a look at the myeloma market despite the advances to date in therapies, there is still so much unmet need there, given the underlying heterogeneity of the disease. And so it's really important that there are treatment choices. And what we're really trying to do is to have a strong portfolio of highly effected -- highly effective treatments and actually ultimately shoot for a cure. And so as we take a look at the market with DARZALEX -- in DARZALEX FASPRO right now, we're really seeing this as a foundational therapy multiple myeloma. And so irrespective of others and LOE and those types of things, you noted, it's a lot of combination therapy and things like that. That does not fundamentally change the opportunity for DARZALEX and FASPRO. What I'm also really excited about is then you add in CARVYKTI that was recently approved, as we mentioned, for triple refractory multiple myeloma. And we really think that this will ultimately become a preferred treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We also mentioned teclistamab in the filing of teclistamab. And this really is the first-ever BCMA CD3 specific. And we think that this is going to be a great off-the-shelf option and for patients who really are triple-class exposed and who are really not eligible for CARVYKTI or don't have access. And then in the future, we're not stopping there. We're also working on Talquetamab, and this would be the first and potentially best-in-class GPRC5D bispecific that we think could be potentially sequenced combined to help transform outcomes. And so as we take a look at our portfolio, we really think that these assets are additive and complementary versus something where they would be cannibalizing each other. And we really think that these are the important advances that are going to really help transform multiple myeloma in the future and going forward versus any of the older therapies.",353.0,158.0,8.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.05063291139240506,0.0189873417721519,0.006329113924050633,0.0,0.0,0.03164556962025317

I think short term, we certainly have the credit rating to warrant more firepower should we need it. As you have observed, our cash flow generation over the last couple of years has ticked up to new levels, north of $20 billion or around $20 billion from when we were just maybe $17 billion a few years ago. As the consumer company operates, I think that's going to be actually liberating for both sides. We still have opportunities to improve our cash flow with inventory management and receivables. But as we move to a higher growth segment, we think we'll be able to generate similar cash flow with a higher level of sales growth, managing the P&L appropriately. So I've got every confidence that we'll be able to do small, medium and large scale acquisitions should the right opportunity present itself. I also think it's liberating for the Consumer Health segment because they'll be able to focus their cash flow generation to value-creating opportunities through their particular lens being fit for purpose in a digitized environment that Thibaut spoke to. So whether it's near-term or long-term, I think we're in a very good position to utilize today's cash and hopefully that which should we generate tomorrow.

We -- in US, the ASCs, I think, are -- it's still relatively low penetration, I would tell, from a macro US, less than 20%, but I think it's the fastest growing as we know. In a COVID environment, we've seen the model evolve to create a safe, more patient-friendly experience that addresses a patient sentiment of not wanting to go into a hospital setting. Certain procedures have gone there early sooner than later. I'd say hips or migraine and knees, less spine per se, less complicated. Obviously, trauma case is still happening in the hospital setting. We've done a lot of work recently to modify our business model to make it a capital-efficient flow, if you will, in inventory management, on the personalization of care using digital assets to kind of your pre-op and your post-op experience less full of friction. And we're taking a lot of experience in the US ASCs to really what we're doing in China in the Tier 2 and the Tier 3 cities as well as we deliver care.

Thanks for joining us today. I am accompanied by Joe Wolk and Jessica Moore and we have the privilege to share our second quarter financial results and answer questions you have regarding Johnson & Johnson’s business. During my first 6 months as CEO, I have had the opportunity to reconnect in person with colleagues, customers and stakeholders around the world. These conversations have energized me about the future of Johnson & Johnson. They have also made clear the critical role our company plays as a leader in bringing innovative healthcare solutions to patients and customers both today and long into the future. And they further validated that the three strategic priorities I outlined earlier this year will continue to guide us in 2022 as we deliver on our mission to transform the future of human health. Let me remind you of those priorities. First, we will continue to advance our industry leading success in pharmaceuticals by delivering the innovative pipeline we highlighted at our pharmaceutical business review last November. This includes our goal to grow this sector to $60 billion by 2025, with growth in every year, including years facing the STELARA loss of exclusivity and continuing to deliver above-market compounded annual growth of at least 5%. In the second quarter, we saw evidence of this plan coming to fruition with the launch of CARVYKTI in April. And in May, we received conditional marketing authorization in Europe. In addition, talquetamab was granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation in June. I have great confidence in the strength of our current portfolio, which remains underappreciated, and in our robust pipeline to meet our long-term goals and to deliver transformational medicines that help improve and save lives. Our second priority, continue to strengthen our performance in MedTech. Over the past several years, this acceleration in performance has been driven by the delivery of differentiated solutions as well as improved commercial execution. We expect this improvement to continue, enabled by our innovative pipeline as well as the potential for expansion into higher growth market segments. Currently, 11 MedTech platforms each delivered over $1 billion in revenue annually. And based on the most recent results, we are gaining or holding share in nearly all of these. With the positive momentum in this business and our improvement in competitiveness, MedTech has delivered 6% adjusted operational growth in the first half of 2022. We believe MedTech will continue to be a significant source of value for our investors and our stakeholders. Third, we are separating our Consumer Health business to create two market leading standalone companies. This separation can be a significant opportunity for value creation. The two new global entities will be well positioned to thrive in their respective markets and drive greater strategic and financial success. We are making excellent progress and remain on track to complete the separation in 2023. In the second quarter, we announced the global leadership team for the new Consumer Health organization led by Thibaut Mongon as CEO designate and Paul Ruh as CFO designate. Having worked with both Thibaut and Paul for many years, I am confident we have selected the right leadership team to lead the new Consumer Health company in its next chapter. The new Johnson & Johnson comprising our pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses will remain the largest, most diversified healthcare products company in the world, with over $80 billion in sales. With enhanced operational focus, the new Johnson & Johnson will be poised to bring integrated, comprehensive, disease-centric technology and innovative solutions to enhance patient care. Our balance sheet will remain strong, allowing us to pursue both organic and inorganic opportunities in higher growth markets across both segments, while maintaining our strong dividend distribution. With these clear priorities in place, we are confident in our ability to execute on both our short-term and long-term objectives. We are very pleased to have delivered solid sales and earnings growth through the first half of 2022, reporting adjusted operational sales and EPS growth of 8% and 8.5% respectively. Joe and Jess will share details reflecting above-market adjusted operational sales growth from pharmaceuticals and continued resiliency in both MedTech and Consumer Health results that stand out given the current global macroeconomic challenges. We are well positioned across the globe to sustain our leadership position in healthcare. We aspire to accelerate growth, while maintaining the diversification in our business and our discipline around capital allocation, which have been foundational to our success for over the past 135 years. I look forward to addressing your questions soon. But for now, I will turn the call over to Jessica Moore to discuss those details.

Worldwide sales were $24 billion for the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 3% versus the second quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 8% as currency had a negative impact of 5 points. In the U.S., sales increased 2.3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 3.8%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 13.9%, with currency negatively impacting our reported o-U.S. results by 10.1 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 8.1% worldwide, 2.4% in the U.S. and 14.2% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings, for the quarter, net earnings were $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per share, was $1.80 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.35 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.59, representing increases of 4.3% and 4.4% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 10.9%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2021 and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. As stated last quarter, we plan to keep our comments brief to leave more time for Q&A. Please refer to the slides for additional segment and franchise commentary. Beginning with Consumer Health, worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.8 billion decreased 1.3%, with a decline of 3.6% in the U.S. and growth of 0.6% outside the U.S. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 2.3% as currency had a negative impact of 3.6 points. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 2.9%. Results were primarily driven by strategic price increases; growth in OTC outside the U.S. due to a strong cold, cough and flu season and digestive health category recovery. This growth was partially offset by a weaker allergy season and supply constraints in the U.S., although these have improved from prior quarters. Furthermore, the Consumer Health business was negatively impacted by regional COVID-19 mobility restrictions, mainly affecting the Skin Health/Beauty franchise. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.3 billion increased 6.7%, with growth of 4.2% in the U.S. and 9.8% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 12.3% as currency had a negative impact of 5.6 points. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 12.4%. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth was 8.6%. Results in the quarter were impacted by unfavorable prior period adjustments offset by favorable discounts. Pharmaceutical growth was driven by our broad portfolio of products paired with strong commercial access and execution, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth, including five assets with double-digit growth in the quarter. Growth was due to strength from DARZALEX, STELARA, ERLEADA and TREMFYA, along with our paliperidone long-acting portfolio, which was partially offset by biosimilar competition for REMICADE, along with the decrease in IMBRUVICA sales. DARZALEX and ERLEADA continued to drive strong operational sales growth with increases of 46.1% and 56.9% respectively. STELARA growth of 18.6% was driven by strong market growth and meaningful share gains in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. This represents 5.4 points and 7.4 points of share gain, respectively, in the U.S. Results in the quarter benefited from favorable discounts partially offset by unfavorable prior period adjustments for a net favorable impact of approximately 400 basis points. TREMFYA grew 29.7%, driven by market growth and share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. This represents 2.3 points and 3.2 points of share gain respectively in the U.S. Results in the quarter were impacted by an unfavorable prior period adjustment of approximately 750 basis points in unfavorable patient mix. IMBRUVICA operational sales declined 7.2% worldwide due to increased competition particularly in the U.S. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide and continues to drive operational growth outside of the U.S. despite ongoing competitive pressures. Given these results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in 2022. I will now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $6.9 billion decreased 1.1%, with growth of 1.6% in the U.S. and declines of 3.6% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 3.4% as currency had a negative impact of 4.5 points. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 3.4%. Operational sales also grew sequentially versus the prior quarter despite headwinds related to regional COVID-19 mobility restrictions as well as labor and supply constraints. Drivers for growth across the MedTech business include procedure recovery, focused commercial strategies and differentiated new products driving enhanced or sustained market share positions in nearly all of our 11 priority platforms, each generating over $1 billion in annual sales. For additional context, all franchises were affected by regional COVID-19 mobility restrictions and selling days had an immaterial impact on results in the quarter. Now, turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2022. I’d like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 50 basis points, primarily driven by increased supply network-related cost with the COVID-19 vaccine and inflation, partially offset by favorable mix. We continued to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 15.4% of sales this quarter. The $3.7 billion invested was a 9.1% increase versus the prior year primarily due to portfolio progression in pharmaceutical and MedTech. The other income and expense line was an expense of $273 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to a net income of $488 million in the second quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by litigation, higher unrealized losses on securities and consumer health separation costs in the current year, partially offset by favorable employee benefit plan-related items. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 17.6% versus 5.8% in the same period last year. This was primarily driven by a 2021 one-time tax benefit from an internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 15.4% versus 14.8% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming second quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I will direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now, let’s look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 33.4% to 34%, primarily driven by favorable product and segment mix, partially offset by inflation and portfolio progression in R&D. Pharmaceutical margin improved from 39.4% to 42%, primarily driven by favorable product mix and brand marketing expense leverage. MedTech margins declined from 28.6% to 26.5%, driven by inflation, unfavorable product mix and increased investments to support new product launches and research and development. Finally, Consumer Health margins declined from 28.6% to 25.9% due to commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies and one-time favorable items in 2021. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson second quarter results. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.

JNJ,2022-07-19,2022-07-19,,2022-07-19,2022-07-19T08:30:00-04:00,0,2022-07-19,qa,,Joe Wolk,"Thank you, Jess. As Joaquin and Jess commented, our results remained solid across our three segments in the second quarter and through the first half of 2022, particularly in light of macroeconomic headwinds, such as inflation, select countries experiencing continuing impact from COVID-19 and geopolitical matters. Our sustainable, resilient business continues to deliver on the robust operational guidance that we set forth at the beginning of the year, while advancing breakthrough innovation and fostering patient access to make a positive impact across many areas of healthcare. As previously discussed, we did build in a healthy assumption to account for inflation in our January guidance, planning for increased costs in labor, energy and transportation. We noted in April, and are doing so again today, that these pressures will continue to impact margins in the third and fourth quarters and into 2023. As such, we continue to pursue mitigation efforts, including cost improvement initiatives, strategic price increases and contract negotiations with external supply partners. As for segment performance and key events in the quarter, in MedTech, you may recall that performance in Q2 2021 was the strongest of the year for most of the MedTech peer set, including Johnson & Johnson, making this second quarter our toughest comp. On a sequential operational basis and in line with our expectations, we did see an acceleration in sales, even considering the regional COVID-19-related mobility restrictions this quarter. As Joaquin noted, we are focused on continuing the strong cadence of innovation in this business, which includes launches such as the next-generation ECHELON 3000 Stapler, a digitally enabled device demonstrating improved patient outcomes based on clinical evidence. It also includes the EMBOGUARD balloon guide catheter, designed to optimize the removal of blood clots and reduce procedure time in the treatment of ischemic stroke. In Pharmaceuticals, we continued to advance our pipeline and delivered operational sales growth of 8.6%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine in the second quarter, notably above what we delivered in the first quarter of this year. We continue to outpace the market. During the second quarter, we recorded our first sales in the U.S. of CARVYKTI, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma developed together with Legend Biotech and received European Commission approval in May. We also presented new data across our broad oncology portfolio at the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Hematology Association in June. If you haven’t done so already, I encourage you to listen to the fireside chat with Peter Lee Woods, a global R&D Head of Oncology, about this promising new data, which can be found on our website. A quick update on our COVID-19 vaccine for which we suspended sales guidance last quarter, recognizing the global progress on vaccine development and distribution against COVID-19 and the amount of existing global supply, we are modifying our COVID-19 vaccine research programs and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all customer contractual commitments. This will result in incremental costs for the year, which will be reflected as a special item. We are proud of the role our vaccine continues to play in the fight against COVID-19. In our Consumer Health business, similar to MedTech, Q2 of 2021 was last year’s strongest quarter with 10% adjusted operational sales growth. We remain focused on our 2022 performance objectives of delivering above-market growth in our over-the-counter medicines business, while overcoming industry-wide supply constraints and inflationary pressures that are primarily impacting our Skin Health business. We continue to be excited about the creation of the new consumer health company. Great work is being done by our teams to effect this complex transaction. We look forward to sharing the new Consumer Health company’s name and branding as well as the headquarter’s location in the months ahead. Similarly, we look forward to sharing transaction options and further financial details, adhering to regulatory policies later in 2022. Finally, I would like to offer my congratulations to Thibaut, Paul and the rest of the leadership team regarding their recent appointments. Turning now to cash and capital allocation. We generated free cash flow of approximately $8 billion in the first half of the year. As of the end of the second quarter, we have approximately $32.6 billion of cash and marketable securities, approximately $32.6 billion of debt for a net neutral cash position. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Investing in innovation that delivers meaningful products to address unmet needs continues to be our top priority. In the first half of the year, we increased R&D investment by approximately 9% compared to the first half of 2021. The dividend priority Joaquin referenced translated to us distributing $6 billion to shareholders so far this year. We also continue to vigorously evaluate acquisition opportunities that would enhance the current portfolio, build upon our capabilities and enable us to play in higher-growth markets while yielding solid financial returns. Moving to full year 2022 guidance and key considerations, the major takeaway is we are maintaining the midpoints of our guidance for adjusted operational sales growth of 7% at $97.8 billion and adjusted operational earnings per share of $10.70 or 9.2% growth for the full year. Given our confidence in delivering full year guidance, based on what we know today, we are tightening the adjusted earnings per share range from $10.65 to $10.75 on a constant currency basis. Regarding the remainder of the P&L, there are a few updates. Due to the prolonged impact of inflationary pressures, we are updating our operating margins to be flat versus 2021. Regarding interest expense, based on our year-to-date experience, we have reduced the expense to a neutral position. Again, given year-to-date trends, we are increasing and tightening our other income estimate to be a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion to reflect the favorable impact of employee benefit-related items. That may appear light given the current run rate, but we have some one-time items such as real estate sales and Johnson & Johnson Development Corp. gains, which we don’t expect to repeat in the second half of this year. Finally, we are lowering our effective tax rate estimate, which is reflective of current law, to a range of 15.0% to 15.5% based on our year-to-date progression. As we always do, let me give you a sense of the impact currency may have on potential full year reported results, specifically the strengthening U.S. dollar. Utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.0, there is an incremental unfavorable currency impact of $1.5 billion on reported sales and an unfavorable $0.20 impact for the estimated reported adjusted earnings per share versus the projection utilized in April’s guidance. The full year unfavorable impact is now projected to be $4 billion on reported sales and $0.65 on reported adjusted earnings per share. As this chart illustrates, it’s not just that the euro and U.S. dollar have reached parity, something we haven’t seen in nearly 2 decades. It’s also the rapid pace at which the fluctuations are occurring, a dynamic only experienced a few times over that same period. In addition, while it’s much too early to comment on 2023, we do think it is helpful to point out what the currency impact maybe if current assumptions for our estimate holds. Of the current $0.65 unfavorable impact I just referenced, about $0.30 to $0.35 will carry over into 2023’s EPS. Certainly, there is a long way to go before we finalize next year’s outlook, but wanted to give you a sense of how to think about the foreign currency impact. Back to the current year. In terms of 2022 quarterly phasing considerations for your models, we continue to estimate that the back half will improve over the first half with a slight bias for higher growth in Q4 over Q3. In Consumer Health, we have seen quarter-over-quarter reduction in supply disruptions that we anticipate will continue. We also expect to see the benefit of recent strategic price increases in the back half of the year. Finally, the fourth quarter of 2021 had lower growth than the third quarter, resulting in an easier comparison. For MedTech, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half, driven by market recovery from continued enhancement of our competitive position through commercial execution and uptake from our recently launched products. We expect the fourth quarter 2022 to be slightly stronger than the third quarter. COVID-19 continues to be a dynamic situation regionally, and we continue to monitor any related impacts. For Pharmaceuticals, we anticipate delivering another year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in our base business, with sales modestly accelerating through the end of the year. To close out the prepared remarks, Johnson & Johnson has continued to post solid results as our teams navigate a challenging external environment. Our financial performance reinforces our confidence in our ability to grow and deliver near and long-term value. That is only possible because of our employees around the world, who we’d like to thank for remaining focused on delivering our innovative healthcare solutions and results for all of our credo stakeholders. Joaquin, Jess and I will now turn the discussion to the Q&A portion of the call.

And let me start giving you a perspective on our myeloma franchise, which is one of the areas of strength for our Pharmaceutical business. On one hand, we continue to have a great progression with DARZALEX with 47% growth in this quarter. And Jess will update you on the exact numbers of the conversion from subcu to – from IV to subcu.

So it continues to move in the right direction, given the enhanced convenience and ease of use for the patient that our subcu formulation offers. So DARZALEX is doing very well, and we feel very confident about the continuous progression of DARZALEX. On the other hand, we are also proud of the commercial launch of CARVYKTI in the U.S. following FDA approval and also the recent approval of CARVYKTI in EMEA. And together with that, to complement the strength of our myeloma franchise, we have received recently two breakthrough designations on our CD3 redirectors, one for teclistamab and another one for talquetamab. So we are proud to have a very comprehensive myeloma franchise that, due to its breadth, will enable us to award to try to convert myeloma into – from an uncurable disease to a chronic disease and potentially when they occur by sequencing and combining this treatment. So great idea of strength for the Pharmaceutical business of Johnson & Johnson, and it’s an area that connects on how we are executing in our pipeline and progressing and what we discussed in our November R&D Day, where we portray our Pharmaceutical pipeline as one of the important drivers of us being able to achieve a $60 billion number in 2025.

So Joaquin and Joe, at a high level, what are your assumptions for the macro headwinds in the second half? Joe, what’s getting better? What’s not?

The macro headwinds, I would say, I would classify it as kind of two categories. The first is really around supply constraints, some of what we commented to at the end of last year that kind of persisted into the first part of this year. I would say that was primarily in our Consumer franchise, where product supply and availability inputs, if you will, were somewhat constrained. We are seeing, I would say, an alleviation of some of those constraints, and that’s why we anticipate, specifically in our Skin Health and Beauty business to be much stronger in the second half. We know that point-of-sale demand continues to be strong for products like Aveeno and NEUTROGENA and we just didn’t have enough on the shelf in the first half. We do anticipate that we will have more availability on the shelf in the second half of this year. And then there is the input cost themselves. As you probably noticed, we did have higher cost of goods in the quarter relative to last year of about 50 basis points. That’s really across the board. So some of the raw materials that go into our product, they are certainly at a higher cost due to limited availability. There is some higher wage pressures, as you’ve noted. I would say that’s less within the world of Johnson & Johnson and our manufacturing entities and more around the third-party manufacturers that we contract with. But I would say those have stabilized. We did have a healthy assumption around inflation coming into the year. We think that has increased as we’ve progressed through these first 6 months by about 40%. So, some of that will play into next year’s thinking as well. As you know, the accounting is such where what we’re building today, some of that gets relieved to the P&L early next year. But we think we’re able to manage it, as you saw in our results, able to slightly beat. And we’re being much more selective in terms of our resource deployment. We’ve raised the bar on our selectivity of where we invest, but we’re very proud of the fact that we were able to increase what we believe our future depends upon, and that’s innovation by a 9% increase in R&D.",409.0,179.0,8.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0446927374301676,0.0111731843575419,0.03910614525139665,0.00558659217877095,0.0223463687150838,0.0335195530726257

Can I just get latest thoughts on business development for both Pharma and MedTech?

And then just a final one, just maybe following up on the last comment, for operating margins, I know they are flat this year due to inflation.

And let me start with the M&A question first, and then Joe will address the operating margin question. So M&A has always been an important component of Johnson & Johnson innovation, as I was talking in the past 5 years, we executed about 40 acquisitions, some major licensing agreements, investing over $16 billion. And specifically in our Pharmaceutical business, about half of our innovation, it’s coming sourced externally. So when we look at M&A, we took – we take a strategic approach. The first thing we try to look at is what is the improvement in the standard of care that we are looking in that particular opportunity and to what extent it enables us to get into higher growth markets. And we are agnostic about which sector. So we try to look at those opportunities in the context of the improvement in standard of care, entering to higher-growth markets and delivering a fair financial return. So as we look at the opportunities today in the market, we are not opportunistic about it, and we are still looking always at the fundamentals of these companies. And obviously, there are different opportunities in the market that are interesting and can complement our existing franchises or built into adjacencies. When it comes to MedTech, the focus continues to be strengthening our current strongholds and also accessing some high-growth market segments to accelerate growth. And the target areas are the ones that we are operating today: high health orthopedics, cardiology, surgery, Historically, it’s been a predictor of our success to the extent we were closer to the areas that we have capabilities. When it comes to pharmaceuticals, we are looking at our key therapeutic areas: immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pulmonary hypertension and also cardiovascular and metabolics. So we are agnostic, as you know, at the source of innovation, and we use multiple modalities to onboard innovation from acquisitions to equity investments to strategic collaborations. So down the road, we continue to see M&A as an important source of building our pipeline and also fortifying our current portfolio and we are now in a position that, for the first time, right, Joe, in the last 5 years, we’re in a cash-neutral position. And we continue to look at the opportunities that are out there, and we will continue to do it.",393.0,175.0,15.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.08571428571428572,0.017142857142857144,0.005714285714285714,0.0,0.0,0.06857142857142857

I don’t want to get too far out in front of my SKUs with respect to projecting next year at this point, but maybe some considerations that you should have in mind. We always look to streamline our business, where possible, look for inefficiencies and either let that fall to the bottom line or preferably put that into R&D. So as we close out the second half of the year, I’d like to see how our pipeline is progressing. If some of that’s accelerated, that’s going to be reason for additional investment. I do think these inflationary pressures will be here to stay. I don’t see a lot of decreases on the near-term horizon. I’d also ask you not to lose sight of the fact that we are separating out our Consumer Health business, and we are taking that opportunity to look at, I would say, how we support our business, the infrastructure that’s involved with a two-segment company versus the historical three-segment company we have. I’d like to see a little bit more of the separation time line play out before we commit to any of those efficiencies that may be gained there and exactly when the timing of those may be incurred, whether that’s the first half or second half of 2023.",237.0,107.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.037383177570093455,0.028037383177570093,0.037383177570093455,0.0,0.009345794392523364,0.009345794392523364

The first part, I want to just spend some time on hospital volumes, what you are seeing in terms of elective surgeries throughout the summer and then into the back half of the year.

And I am thinking not just in – across the board, but almost specifically in MedTech.

In consumer, that’s kind of keeping consistent with the peer set to offset the inflationary pressures. We do know that while folks are looking to more generally cut back spending that’s been in entertainment, dining out, when it comes healthcare, better health, looking better, products like AVEENO, NEUTROGENA, Tylenol, Listerine, they seem to do really well, and consumers will prioritize those. With specifically to MedTech, as you probably appreciate, a lot of our portfolio is really governed by contracts that are already in place with hospital systems. So, it’s difficult unless there is certain inflationary clauses within those contracts. That’s what we mean when we say targeted. It’s very selective and I would say it’s probably not the majority of the hospital volumes or hospital contracting that you may say.

Overall, our MedTech business delivered 6% competitive growth in the first half of 2022 and delivered just over 1% sequential operational growth Q2 versus Q1. So, that is in the middle of the market headwinds due to mobility restrictions inflation and supply challenges. So, a very resilient performance of our J&J MedTech business. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and competitive, and we continue to see market share positive trajectory in nearly all of our 11 priority platforms in which we are maintaining or gaining share in the most recent period of Q1 2022. And we see also good progression in our pipeline and new products launched. Overall, for the market, when we are talking about the market specifically, we saw improvements in procedure volume in North America, in EMEA and in Lat-Am. That remain above pre-COVID levels through the quarter. So, that was the positive side. On the other hand, we saw the impact of regional mobility restrictions in Asia Pacific. Moving forward, we estimate that we will have a continuous improvement in the second half of the year due to continued market recovery and also our own competitive momentum while, at the same time, we are going to continue to monitor the COVID-19 dynamics and the mobility restrictions in Asia Pacific.",226.0,105.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.009523809523809525,0.009523809523809525,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.05714285714285714

As a matter of fact, when we met with you in November, milvexian was one of the five medicines that we estimated we are going to continue peak sales of about $5 billion. That was together with CARVYKTI, milvexian, nipocalimab, amivantamab plus lazertinib and our Auris platform. So, those were the five medicines that we are going to contributing – to contribute more than $5 billion. And clearly, milvexian, it’s an important one in that context. We are developing milvexian, as you know, in collaboration with BMS, and we see this as an important opportunity to improve the standard of care in the current indications for oral anticoagulants, which are very large. And they are easily to be estimated because you know where they are used today, but also the potential to expand into areas in which today, oral anticoagulants are not used to bleeding concerns. So, we see a very significant market opportunity for milvexian as an improvement of this category versus the Factor Xa. So, there are two Phase 2 studies that are assessing the potential of milvexian to reduce their risk of cardiovascular events. One is the one of total knee replacement. Data on that one was presented earlier in 2021. And the second one, which I guess is the one you are referring to, is the one in secondary stroke prevention, which we want to determine whether the addition of milvexian through aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective than standard anti-plated [ph] therapy in secondary stroke prevention. The data, as you know, is already in-house, and we expect to present it in a medical meeting in 2022. Specifically, I think it’s at the end of August in a European cardiology meeting. And at that point, we shall see. But for us, if the data pans out, obviously, milvexian could have a very significant market opportunity that goes beyond the existing Factor Xa plus.",330.0,138.0,7.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.050724637681159424,0.028985507246376812,0.014492753623188406,0.007246376811594203,0.0,0.021739130434782608

And the first is, it’s just on the volume recovery. I think as we listen to hospital executives and insurers talk about the volume recovery, we consistently hear about this not getting back to pre-pandemic levels even as we sit in the first half of 2022. I just wanted to, kind of sanity check and, Joe, see, and Joaquin, if there is any kind of metrics you can give us in terms of where J&J’s volumes sit relative to 2019? While it’s not the most appropriate comp here as we are a couple of years out from 2019, but wanted to just get your views on where the disconnect is in terms of the revenue growth that we are seeing from your businesses off of 2019 versus volume growth. And why we are hearing some of this the commentary that we are not back to pre-pandemic volumes yet? And then the second question, I guess is for Joaquin and just thinking about your strategy and to accelerate momentum in the MedTech business had a nice start to 2022. But wanted to kind of get a better understanding of, I guess the plan and the roadmap in terms of the number of quarters, years that you envision assessing success and hitting your internal targets? Is this a 2-year to 3-year plan, or could you see acute strategic, new strategies implemented if you are not seeing the momentum that you expect to see over the next 6 months, 12 months, 18 months?

Let me try to answer the first part of that question, and then I will turn it over to Joaquin for the second part, the first part being around volume recovery. To your point, and it’s something that we struggle with internally, it’s really still clunky when it comes to comparative analysis versus prior periods. So, we do look back at 2019, I can tell you our operational sales growth for MedTech over the first six months is about 10% overall. I would say half of that is – maybe two-thirds is really attributable to just a great job that Ashley and her team have been doing with launching new products and better execution. So, our cadence of innovation has improved. We have got a lot of new offerings across really all four of those major franchises and we are picking up market share because of that. And then I would say probably the rest is procedure volume. Again, it gets really difficult to really draw comparisons around procedure volume because we still are dealing with the impact of COVID in the second quarter alone in China. That impacted growth and procedures were down roughly 25% with a little bit improvement towards the last month from what we saw in April and May. So, we continue to look at that as well. But I would say the improvement in MedTech is really come from the stated goals that you heard a couple of years ago from Ashley and team, and that’s a better cadence of innovation. I think we are going to – we had 10 new products launched in the first half of this year. Roughly the same amount is relied upon in the second half and then again, attracting market share with better effectiveness through our sales force and commercial efforts.",306.0,147.0,8.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.05442176870748299,0.013605442176870748,0.034013605442176874,0.0,0.0,0.04081632653061224

Thank you, Josh, and thank you for the question on MedTech because it gives me an opportunity to talk more about the performance of the MedTech business. And a couple of aspects there. One is the current performance and then how we are improving our market share and commercial execution and also our new product introduction and our pipeline progression. So, in the first half of the year, I just commented that our group has a competitive growth of 6%. It’s also underlying by our growth in the first quarter of 8.6%. We will see how the rest of the sector performs in this quarter, but our growth in the first half of the year was a competitive growth with 6%. So, in that sense, my view is that we are already getting competitive growth rates in MedTech with 6% in the first half of the year. The growth rate in the second quarter has to be also put into perspective in the fact that the comparison with the second quarter of 2021 is a difficult one. MedTech grew 59% in the second quarter of 2021. And also there was some impact of the mobility restrictions in Asia Pacific. So, we are improving our commercial execution and improving our pipeline. In the commercial execution, the data that we have from the first quarter shows that we are maintaining or gaining share in 10 of our 11 largest platforms. So, that’s a good indication that the recovery is in play. And on the new product pipeline, there is many exciting new developments that we are getting to market, starting with the fact that our MONARCH robotic platform has received 510 clearance for urology indications, which are going to open a new market for us in kidney stones. We have now enrolled the first patient in our electrophysiology pulse field ablation study, which is going to give us another innovation in our very successful electrophysiology business. We just launched our new Stapler ECHELON 3000, which is a digitally enabled device that comes also with significant evidence on how it improves patient outcomes in the cerebrovascular franchise. We just launched EMBOGUARD Balloon Catheter, which is designed to optimize the removal of blood clots in ischemic stroke and reducing time. So, there is a number of positive developments that are enhancing our ability to launch new products there. So, we feel optimistic about the combination of executing on our commercial priorities and at the same time, continue the good cadence of new product innovation that, that is going to take us to competitive growth as demonstrated by our 6% growth in the first half of the year.",434.0,200.0,16.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.08,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.005,0.07

A two-part question on the U.S. immunology market in general, and TREMFYA specifically. Across the category, what’s your view on the outlook for how the balance of the year will progress in the immunology category based upon what you are seeing in terms of patient volume trends year-to-date? And then specifically on TREMFYA, the performance and outlook there, you highlighted some share gains in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Where are these gains coming from?

Overall, we see a recovery in the immunology market with new patient levels already exceeding pre-COVID levels. So, we are optimistic about the recovery, specifically utilizing the metric of new patients. So, that’s progressing well for the immunology market. When it comes to TREMFYA, it continues to deliver strong growth worldwide, with net trade sales growing in the quarter about 30%, despite of headwind of a prior period adjustment that has reduced about 750 basis points. So, a strong performance of TREMFYA. When it comes to share, I think it was commented that we capture about 2.5 points incremental in psoriasis and about a larger amount in psoriatic arthritis, where we are already the market share leader. It was three points in psoriatic arthritis. It’s difficult to tell you where this is coming from. I mean we are assuming that this is going to be coming from older therapies that are there in the market, and that’s where it’s coming from. But clearly, TREMFYA is doing really well, both in psoriasis and in psoriatic arthritis. And psoriatic arthritis is the market-leading in new-to-brand share. We are also pleased with the fact that we have published recently first and best-in-class 5-year durability data, and also that we have been able to be the only IL-23 therapy to demonstrate inhibition of structural damage in PSA. So, we are very positive about the trajectory of TREMFYA, which is a reflection of the strength of our immunology franchise. Continuing with the future of TREMFYA, which I think it’s important for you to consider, we are now fully enrolled in our trial in ulcerative colitis, and we are nearing fully enrollment completion in our trial in Crohn’s disease. So, that predicates well for the growth of TREMFYA moving forward. Addition to that – in addition to that, we presented very encouraging and interesting data in IBD in combination of TREMFYA with SIMPONI, so guselkumab that show best-in-class results and best-in-class data, and we are very pleased with that. And also, if you look at our pipeline, we are also continuing to progress into Phase 2 with our own oral IL-23.

First, it’s difficult for us to comment on the content of the legislation or the feasibility of that legislation passing. There has been a lot of ups and downs there. While we are very closely following the dynamics, the situation is still fluid. So, it’s difficult for us to comment on the actual legislation or in the feasibility. Now, if we believe that the legislation is going to base on the language that we know from the Senate Finance Committee, as you pointed out, that will have a significant detrimental effect on the ability of the industry, of the companies to be able to invest in R&D and to develop new medicines. Just for perspective, the biopharmaceutical industry invested about $120 billion in R&D in 2020. Johnson & Johnson, ourselves, in our pharmaceutical business, we invested $12 billion in R&D in 2021. So, as a company that invests heavily in R&D, we can tell you that the type of legislation that was proposed by the Senate Finance Committee with Medicare price setting will have a chilling effect in innovation that will be translated in less new medicines for patients. Again, for perspective, since 2000, the pharmaceutical industry has introduced about 1,000 new medicines. The impact that this will have may affect the advances that we have in multiple areas that are still needed to be able to advance patient care. So, it’s a very seamless situation that will affect innovation, will affect our ability to invest in R&D and to develop new medicines. Now, we are also engaging with different stakeholders in trying to educate them about the impact of this type of legislation and innovation. But at the same time, we also want to sit at the table and participate in discussions to address what we believe is the major issue, which is patient affordability and patient access, specifically in Part D. So, we think that, that’s something that the industry has to address with the relevant stakeholders, and we are very willing to sit at the table and shoulder the consequences of being able to address the patient affordability issue. Now, I always have – I always need to remember to you that in a price-constrained environment, Johnson & Johnson performs relatively better than most of our peers and competitors based on a number of factors. First, our diversification. Second, we have about half of our sales that come outside of the U.S. And third, specifically in the pharmaceutical business, we have been able to deliver above-market growth in the face of mid-single digit niche price decreases. So, we know how to grow in a difficult pricing environment. As a matter of fact, all of our growth comes from volume. So, if you are thinking about where to be in these circumstances, Johnson & Johnson really, it’s a good place based on its diversification and our ability to drive growth through volume.",497.0,215.0,10.0,6.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.046511627906976744,0.027906976744186046,0.013953488372093023,0.027906976744186046,0.004651162790697674,0.018604651162790697

For the quarter, net earnings were $4.5 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.68 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.37 one year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.55, representing decreases of 2.7% and 1.9%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 5.8%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2021, and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Continuing with the streamlined remarks shared in the prior two quarters, we plan to keep our comments brief to leave more time for Q&A. Please refer to the slides for additional segment and franchise commentary. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.8 billion decreased 0.4%, with an increase of 2.1% in the U.S. and a decline of 2.3% outside the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 4.7%. And outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 6.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 4.8%. Results were primarily driven by strategic price increases; growth in OTC due to a strong cold, cough and flu season; and OUS growth in NEUTROGENA and AVEENO due to market growth and new product launches. This growth was partially offset by supply constraints in the U.S. and suspension of sales of personal care products in Russia. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.2 billion increased 2.6%, with growth of 3% in the U.S. and 2% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 9%; and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 16.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 9.2%. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth increased 8.9%; U.S. operational sales growth increased to 7%; and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 11.3%. Pharmaceutical growth was driven by strong commercial access and execution, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth, including five assets with double-digit growth. Growth was driven by DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA and ERLEADA as well as our paliperidone long-acting portfolio and was partially offset by biosimilar competition for REMICADE, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales. Within our Oncology business, DARZALEX and ERLEADA continued to drive strong sales growth with increases of 38.7% and 51.2%, respectively. IMBRUVICA sales declined 7.2% worldwide due to increased competitive pressures. In the U.S., the CLL market remains below pre-COVID levels, while in the EU results were negatively impacted by government clawbacks. Overall, IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. In our Immunology business, TREMFYA grew 41.9%, driven by share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with gains of 3.2 points and 1.7 points in the U.S., respectively, along with market growth. STELARA growth of 8% was driven by strong market growth and share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with gains of 5.2 points and 6.9 points in the U.S., respectively. Results in the quarter were partially offset by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment of approximately 600 basis points on worldwide growth. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth in 2022. I'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $6.8 billion increased by 2.1%, with growth of 7.7% in the U.S. and a decline of 2.9% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 8.1%, and outside the U.S. operational sales growth increased 8.5%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide growth was 8.1%. Drivers for growth across MedTech include procedure recovery as well as focused commercial strategies and differentiated new products such as ENSEAL X1 devices in energy; VELYS digital solutions across our orthopedic platforms; and additional solutions, enhancing our industry-leading electrophysiology portfolio. Based on our most recent share data, we continue to enhance or sustain market share positions in the large majority of our 11 priority platforms. As a reminder, these 11 platforms each generate over $1 billion in annual sales. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter is the impact of volume based procurement in China and timing of international tenders, primarily in orthopedics and supply challenges, primarily in surgical vision. Aligned with our previously communicated expectations, MedTech operational sales grew sequentially versus the prior quarter. And for additional context, selling days had an immaterial impact on results in the quarter. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2022. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 170 basis points, primarily driven by unfavorable currency impact in the pharmaceutical business and commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies in the MedTech and the Consumer Health businesses. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 15.1% of sales this quarter. The $3.6 billion invested was a 5% increase versus the prior year, primarily due to portfolio progression in the pharmaceutical business and increased investment across multiple franchises in the MedTech business. The other income and expense line was an expense of approximately $500 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to an expense of $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by lower litigation expense, partially offset by losses on securities, Consumer Health separation related costs and COVID-19 vaccine related costs in the current quarter. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.4% versus 4.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by 2022 tax costs incurred as part of the planned separation of the company's Consumer Health business due to the reorganization of certain international subsidiaries, a one-time special item in Q3 2021 that reduced taxable income in the quarter and unfavorable income mix. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16% versus 13.5% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 34.5% to 33.9%, primarily driven by unfavorable currency and commodity inflation impact on cost of products sold. Pharmaceutical margins declined from 43.8% to 41.9%, primarily driven by unfavorable currency and cost of products sold. MedTech margins remained flat at 25.5%. Commodity inflation and increased investment in research and development were offset by supply chain efficiencies in sales, marketing and administrative leveraging. Finally, Consumer Health margins improved from 24.2% to 24.3%, despite inflationary pressures, driven by price actions and investment prioritization. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson third quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.

As Jess just shared, we are pleased to report solid results across our business segments in the third quarter. We accelerated operational sales growth across all three segments, and we're able to meet earnings expectations despite significant inflationary impacts to input costs. This performance reflects the strength of our business and versatility of our operations despite persistent global macroeconomic challenges. Given Johnson & Johnson's 136-year history, we are no stranger to periods of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, but we have a proven track record of navigating through periods of challenge and volatility. With a diversified portfolio and strong balance sheet, we've repeatedly demonstrated our ability to deliver results in the short-term while executing against our long-term strategy, focused on improving health outcomes and access to care. Let me share a few enterprise highlights from the quarter. We continue to deploy effective strategies to provide the products, medicines and treatments that consumers and patients rely on in the face of supply chain pressures. Our teams have been working tirelessly to help mitigate the impact of these challenges by working with our partners to make sure we're meeting demand. We continue to invest for growth, driven by innovation, as demonstrated by the recent opening of our R&D campus in San Francisco, which will expand our R&D presence in the Bay Area. I had the pleasure of being at the opening for this campus. Seeing it in person only reinforces for me that the combination of science, technology and data analytics will be the future of medicine. We also made further progress in the separation of Kenvue, the name of the planned new Consumer Health company. In addition to announcing the name, brand, visual identity and purpose, Larry Merlo was named as the Non-Executive Chair Designate. Congratulations, Larry. Thibaut, Ashley and Jennifer will provide updates on notable events for their segments later in the call. Turning now to cash and capital allocation. Year-to-date, we generated free cash flow in excess of $13 billion. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $34 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $32 billion of debt for a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, and our strong balance sheet affords us the flexibility to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities concurrently. Investing in innovation and R&D is our top priority. And through three quarters, we have increased our R&D investment by approximately 8% over the same period last year. In addition to investing in organic growth opportunities, our team continues to evaluate strategic acquisitions and other external collaborations that would enhance our current portfolio, build upon our capabilities and enable us to play in higher-growth markets, while delivering strong financial returns. In mid-September, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase of up to $5 billion of Johnson & Johnson common stock. This program underscores our confidence in the business and our pipeline, while also delivering returns for our shareholders. This program, combined with our dividends, has yielded nearly $11 billion being returned to shareholders already in 2022. Moving on to full year 2022 guidance. As evidenced by the third quarter, operational sales growth across all three businesses, healthcare as well as our business continues to be rooted in strong fundamentals, despite various macroeconomic pressures. We continue to see a strengthening US dollar relative to other currencies. And as seen on this slide, inflation in the US remains at levels not experienced in decades and not unique to the US. You saw some of this impact reflected in this quarter's gross margin eroding in comparison to Q3 2021, attributable to both currency and higher input cost. Despite these pressures, we are reaffirming our operational sales and reported adjusted earnings per share midpoints and tightening the ranges. On sales, we are narrowing our base business operational sales range to $97.5 billion to $98 billion or a growth rate of 7% at the midpoint. While this full year operational sales guidance is an acceleration to our year-to-date growth, it does imply a slight deceleration when comparing to the third quarter growth, driven by the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in EMEA and during the month of September. We don't speculate on currency impacts. However, using the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 0.97, there is an estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 490 basis points, resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 1.8% to 2.3% compared to 2021 or $93 billion to $93.5 billion. Regarding other lines on the P&L. While we were able to absorb some of the inflationary pressures this year, we are lowering our full year operating margin projection due to the impacts of inflation across most spend categories to a decline of approximately 50 basis points. Given year-to-date trends on favorable employee benefit-related items, we are increasing our other income estimates to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Regarding interest income and expense, again, based on our year-to-date experience, whereby we have a higher cash balance earning at rates higher than previously anticipated, we are increasing the range of our estimate to $175 million to $200 million, of income. And finally, we are maintaining our effective tax rate estimate, which is reflective of current law, to a range of 15.0% and to 15.5%. Considering these revised estimates, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis of $0.03 at the midpoint. The updated range is $10.70 to $10.75 or a midpoint of $10.73, reflecting a growth rate over 2021 of 9.5%. While not predicting currency movements, but to provide some insights on the potential impact on EPS, our reported adjusted EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.68 per share. As a result, and by tightening the range, our reported adjusted earnings per share is $10.02 to $10.07, which maintains the previous midpoint of $10.05. I appreciate that, many of you are turning some of your attention to 2023. We are actively finalizing our plans for next year, but allow me to provide some preliminary qualitative perspectives to consider as you develop your models. We remain confident that we'll continue to grow our pharmaceutical business every year towards our goal of $60 billion in Pharmaceutical sales by 2025, despite the STELARA LOE, which is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2023 in the US. For MedTech, we expect our investments in innovation and commercial capabilities to continue to enhance our competitiveness. At this time, we anticipate positive procedure trends with the caveats that COVID-19 continues to be a dynamic situation regionally, lingering headwinds from hospital staffing and some impact from volume-based pricing in China. For Consumer Health, we are seeing the benefits of our strategic price increases, and a reduction in supply chain disruptions, although some challenges are expected to continue into 2023. We expect inflationary pressures and higher input costs to persist, and we are continuing to take actions to offset these challenges. While some inflationary pressures are improving, keep in mind that, certain products we manufacture in 2022 will be sold and flow through our P&L in 2023. As far as standing up Kenvue as an independent company, we expect to announce further details on the type of separation, as well as stand-up cost estimates, and how we are addressing stranded costs later this year or early in 2023. We remain on track to complete the separation in mid to late 2023 as indicated in the initial announcement we made in November of 2021. Finally, as previously mentioned, we don't speculate on currency movement, but utilizing the euro spot rate of last week, we estimate an unfavorable currency impact on 2023's adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.40 to $0.45 or $0.10 more than the $0.30 to $0.35 impact I referenced in July's call. 2022 has proven to be an active and unpredictable year, yet Johnson & Johnson continues to reliably meet the needs of patients while navigating the volatile global economic and operating environment. The executive committee could not be prouder of our team members across the globe for their commitment to excellence. We are continuously inspired by their dedication and unwavering focus on delivering growth for our stakeholders while staying true to our credo. I am now pleased to welcome our worldwide chairs, starting with Thibaut for Consumer Health, soon to be officially Kenvue.",1391.0,738.0,34.0,22.0,21.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,6.0,0.04607046070460705,0.02981029810298103,0.028455284552845527,0.0027100271002710027,0.0013550135501355014,0.016260162601626018

We are indeed very proud of the achievements we have completed so far in 2022. As we shared with you throughout the year, we told you that Consumer Health would deliver improved performance starting in the second half of the year and that is exactly what you saw with our good performance in the third quarter. Our strategy is working. Our pricing actions were realized, supply chain constraints eased, and we are also against easier prior year comparables. Our third quarter results reflect those dynamics and really demonstrate our ability to achieve results despite the macroeconomic environment that Joe referenced, and that continues to be volatile. And all of this, thanks to the strength of our brands and the quality of our teams. So, looking towards 2023 and in line with our results to-date, we do anticipate that the strength and resilience of our well-balanced portfolio, together with the consumer loyalty to our brands, will continue to position our business to perform competitively with the market. Now, regarding our future, as you just heard from Joe, we are making great strides towards the planned separation of the Consumer Health business, including our recent announcement of our new name, Kenvue. So, as you can imagine, a lot of thought and care was taken to ensure that the name was memorable, distinctive, easy to pronounce in multiple languages. We then applied our expert brand-building skills to create a brand identity that reflects our new name, but also leave space for iconic brands that touch the lives of more than a billion people around the world every day. Every element was chosen to truly represent us as a future stand-alone company with the core attributes demonstrating an association with trust, care, science, and positioning Kenvue as a modern digital-first company. We also unveiled our purpose this quarter, which is realize the extraordinary power of everyday care. And in these seven words, we reflect our heritage of caring, but also play back what the world expects of us and the role we need to fulfill in society. We indeed believe that daily self-care rituals add up over time and have a profound cumulative impact on well-being. And our work at Kenvue will be to put that power into the hands of consumers around the world. So, we're excited for the journey ahead. Now, with Larry Merlo, named as our designated nonexecutive Chair, and our teams are all focused on continuing to deliver results, while progressing towards realizing the full potential of Kenvue.

So, last year was clearly a banner year of our new product innovation and we are continuing that momentum in 2022 with four new products -- first-in-kind new products launched just in third quarter alone. And clearly, these launches are really contributing to our enhanced competitiveness. So in quarter three, we launched our next-generation TECNIS Symfony OptiBlue. It's our latest presbyopia-correcting intraocular lens; our ACUVUE OASYS MAX contact lens; the HELIOSTAR balloon ablation catheter; and the OCTARAY Mapping Catheter. So to just have a quick refresh on ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day MAX. All of us know, we live digitally intense lives, and this lens was custom designed to really meet those digitally intensive lifestyles. It builds upon our industry-leading portfolio. OASYS is ranked number one. It's the largest brand in the category, and it's unbeaten in comfort across 31 clinical trials. Moving over to our Biosense Webster business. We have a launch of our HELIOSTAR balloon ablation catheter. This catheter is unique. It's a one-shop balloon technology, and it enables PV isolation in 12 seconds with customized energy delivery and our one integrated 3D mapping solution. So we are already seeing the impact HELIOSTAR has resulted in an 86% freedom from documented atrial arrhythmia at 12 months. So this is our entry into the single-shot ablation. Really just a couple of the ways that our team is delivering differentiated solutions really through a focus on breakthrough science and a consistent focus on doctors' critical needs. So I'm very encouraged by the strong innovation to-date and even more excited about the potential of our pipeline to come. And when I start to think about 2023, we are very focused on our mission to make the future of health care smarter, less invasive and more personalized. You've heard me consistently say this is how we can show up in health care. We will continue, particularly in today's times, a little bit of uncertain times to prioritize programs that are strengthening our core, that are really getting us on the forefront of shaping the new frontiers and medical intervention and a consistent drumbeat of always improving our competitiveness. We know that health care has an unbelievable amount of humility, but also amazing purpose. And as Joe has mentioned, we are -- it's very clearly in a dynamic time. We're going to continue to manage through the macroeconomic factors like hospital staffing, like inflation, like supply constraints and some of the overhang of the pandemic. But we are encouraged with procedural volumes in many parts of the world. They're recovering quite nicely. Some parts of the world are still a little bit below pre-COVID levels, but we are confident in the resiliency and agility of the MedTech industry and our anticipated continued recovery across the world. So thank you, and I'm pleased to turn it over to Jennifer.",491.0,246.0,15.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.06097560975609756,0.0040650406504065045,0.008130081300813009,0.0,0.0040650406504065045,0.056910569105691054

I'd really like to start off by thanking my pharmaceutical colleagues for another strong quarter with operational growth of 9%. That was broadly based across our portfolio and our regions. As Jess noted, we continue to maximize the value of our diverse leading portfolio, delivering above-market growth with a number of key drivers: DARZALEX, TREMFYA, STELARA, ERLEADA, also UPTRAVI, XARELTO and our long-acting paliperidone portfolio. So, really great performance across the portfolio and throughout the globe. In addition to our strong performance, the Pharmaceutical business achieved some important milestones during the quarter, both in terms of approvals and new data readouts. So first, we're really pleased to announce our first approval globally for TECVAYLI. This is our first-in-class off the shelf bispecific antibody for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, and this approval was from the European Commission. And we are on track to receive approval from the US FDA before year-end. TECVAYLI is a really important addition to our multiple myeloma portfolio, particularly for this difficult to treat patient population. Also in multiple myeloma, the final analysis from our Phase 2 GRIFFIN study of a DARZALEX based investigational quadruplet regimen was presented, really highlighting the potential benefit of adding DARZALEX to this front-light treatment regimen in multiple myeloma in newly diagnosed transplant eligible patients. Separately, we received two approvals for IMBRUVICA. So European Commission approved an all-oral fixed duration treatment combination with venetoclax in frontline CLL. And the US FDA granted approval for pediatric patients with chronic graft versus host disease, marking the first pediatric approval for IMBRUVICA and making IMBRUVICA the only BTKi with 12 FDA approvals across seven indications. If we turn to solid tumors, data from our early-stage trials from our combination of amivantamab plus lazertinib were presented at WCLC. Importantly, these data demonstrated a benefit in frontline treatment of EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer, and we look forward to data from our Phase 3 MARIPOSA study in the future. And last, in immunology, we presented new data for TREMFYA from the Phase 3b GUIDE study, which demonstrated even higher rates of complete skin clearance in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were started earlier in the course of their disease. So it bodes well for earlier treatment for TREMFYA and continued growth. As I said, I'm really proud of our pharmaceuticals team and what we accomplished in the third quarter, and I look forward to finishing the year strong. As we look ahead, with our focus on transformational medical innovation, our pipeline of current medicines, our robust pipeline of new medicines and world-class capabilities, we remain really confident in our growth expectations. The ones that we outlined at our pharmaceutical business review last November, including the fact that we expect to be a $60 billion pharmaceutical company by 2025. So thank you very much.

Can you just elaborate a little bit more on 2023 operating margin dynamics? It seems like you're seeing some modest operating margin erosion this year due to inflation. Should we be thinking about a similar step down in 2023, or is there a better ability to manage some of these inflation pressures as I guess some of these start to ease as you go through the year? And maybe a second question, just as we think about 2023, just tying some of the segment comments together, and as we think about top line, is there any reason to assume a meaningful deviation from the operational growth trends that you're seeing in 2022 as we look out to 2023? And I guess maybe specifically in that, is the STELARA LOE, a large enough of a headwind next year that we need to start to think about that impacting growth, or is that more like a 2024 and beyond issue?

What I'll do is I'll give you some insights around 2023 op margin. And then maybe I think it might be productive to turn it over to each of the segment heads to talk about what their outlook is for 2023 in a qualitative way at this point. So for 2023 op margins, I think you have a couple of dynamics that we're facing. Clearly, the macroeconomic pressures that all industries and all companies are facing is something that we have to address as well. While healthcare is a very, very good business and more resilient than most, it's not as if we're immune to some of those dynamics. So as we finalize our plans for 2023, we will be looking at prioritizing our resource deployment to those initiatives, those projects, those services that deliver the most value for patients, which in turn is then healthy for our business. The other dynamic that's at play, Chris, and maybe why I'm a little bit hesitant to give you specific guidance at this point in time, is the separation of the Consumer Health business, so we're going through some of our plans now. We have the opportunity, as we said on prior calls, to rightsize our infrastructure for a two-segment company versus a three-segment company that we've had historically. And so we're looking at opportunities there as well. I think given the pressures from both of those fronts, we take it as our responsibility here at Johnson & Johnson's management to ensure that we mitigate those, we prioritize every dollar that we have that goes to securing our long-term future, specifically in innovation and R&D. And that's where we'll continue to focus. We know that, that has a proven track record of success when we do that, specifically when we focus on those precious few projects that matter the most. And that's what we'll continue to do in 2023. So more to come on op margins, but we will -- we're not oblivious, obviously, to the world around us, and we're going to manage those very, very effectively.

So for 2023, we anticipate another year of above-market growth for the Pharmaceuticals group.

So I have to, first, by giving a shout-out to the MedTech team, it was a really strong quarter of 8% and 7% year-to-date. And they just have really maniacal focus is what I would say on competitiveness and customer centricity. When we -- and Joe alluded to this, Larry, if you look at -- I'll go around the world a little bit. We are seeing procedures recovering. I think we're benefiting that, posting very strong September, but also a quarter-end of 8%. In the United States, we started to see surgical procedures tick up predominantly it did at the latter part of the quarter. We do see diagnostic procedures more in the mid-single digits, so colonoscopies as an example in quarter three. So we're expecting that to continue. Now, you'll recall that we're anniversarying Omnicron hitting kind of in the thanksgiving time frame in December, so that should be a healthy comp, but we also expect in a very focused micro surgeons in the winter surge. Europe is recovering nicely. August was a little bit of a slowdown given the holiday season, but really September picked up. Asia is in fast recovery, I would say, in India and Japan. And China is still on quarter three, recovered nicely versus quarter two, but they're still below pre-COVID levels. So we expect that bolus to continue. We are moving forward. We have a strong position in China. We have a very diversified position in China. We are moving through some of the VBP actions. That's what you saw in our Joints business, we were actually up 10% in our knees and our hips in the United States, but we had negative growth in the quarter, really due to the volume-based procurement wins on pricing actions that we'll come through that for next year.

Well, first of all, let me start with just reiterating the strong free cash flow that we have year-to-date, over $13 billion, also very proud of the fact that we've been able to distribute nearly a $11 billion to shareholders through the form of our dividend program, as well as the repurchase program that was announced just mid last month. So we feel really good on that front. But as you likely noticed in today's comments, we still hold $34 billion of cash, which positions us extremely well to continue exercising that level of capital allocation around acquisitions or significant collaborations going forward. So our priorities have not changed. In fact, maybe we're even a little bit more bullish and eager to do something. But as folks come to know us, we're not going to do anything haphazardly. We're not – the aspect of this company that is really enjoyable as being the CFO is we don't have to do anything out of desperation. We're going to find those assets that have a great strategic fit, and then make sense from a financial perspective with respect to returning to shareholders something that compensates them for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. The market is a little bit funny. The volatility actually doesn't help for a conducive M&A environment right now, because you have sellers – potential sellers holding on to 52-week highs, or all-time highs, which, quite frankly, aren't too distant in the rearview mirror. We're going to approach it with a very fundamental discounted cash flow analysis, to make sure we're bringing value forward. But the short answer to your question is our priorities have not changed. We're looking to complement the already strong portfolio you heard in the first round of responses.",313.0,159.0,7.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0440251572327044,0.012578616352201259,0.025157232704402517,0.0,0.0,0.031446540880503145

So, the projections that we gave you about the $60 billion in revenue by 2025 really is all based on our current portfolio and our current pipeline, so that doesn't have anything factored in right now in terms of M&A. Anything that we did there, we would look at to be additive. When we take a look at how we're going to get there, we really believe we're going to have a compound annual growth rate of at least 5%, with growth in every year, and that includes through the STELARA LOE. We think we've got eight key brands that we'll be able to post double-digit growth through 2025. And as we take a look through our pipeline and portfolio between now and then 14 novel therapies filed with potential to exceed $1 billion, and we've got five of which we think actually have potential to exceed $5 billion, so that's products like Novavax vaccine, which is in our partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb; amivantamab and lazertinib combination, which I mentioned for non-small cell lung cancer that we've got good data coming through; nipocalimab, which is progressing really nicely through the various stages of clinical development. That's the auto antibody asset that we brought in from the Momenta acquisition. We have our TARIS platform that is progressing nicely for bladder cancer, and we have CARVYKTI. While we're still in the early stages of launching and ramping that asset, based on the strength of the data and the clinical trials remain really bullish on what CARVYKTI is going to mean for patients with multiple myeloma around the world. And so I think based on our existing assets and the continued growth, I mean if you take a look at DARZALEX and the results that we just posted quarter, 39% growth, consistent with what we've been seeing as well as growth in assets like TREMFYA, ERLEADA, et cetera. You take a look at the existing portfolio, you layer in on top of that what's coming through with the pipeline, and that's what gives us the confidence to hit that $60 billion organically. That being said, in line with Joe, we're constantly looking for ways that we can continue to augment and further build our pipeline and to do so out of a position of strength. And so predominantly, we keep our innovation engine going, bringing in things in the earlier stages, which is usually our sweet spot because we can put our R&D machinery against it as well as our terrific regulatory and commercial and market access capabilities to really build things out. But that doesn't rule out later-stage acquisitions or in-market acquisitions as well.",463.0,198.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03535353535353535,0.010101010101010102,0.005050505050505051,0.005050505050505051,0.0,0.025252525252525252

I think the health of the end-state markets in MedTech are quite vibrant. As we've talked, there's been bumpiness because of COVID that we're still having some of that. But there is patient demand that is still yet to be met. And that's really what we're experiencing in quarter three, and we still think that will continue into 2023. And you're seeing procedures that are more insulated like the cath lab is more protected in a hospital environment. Volumes have been going quite nicely. I have to give a huge shout out to the BWI team in the US, grew near 24% growth in quarter three. So -- and we're continuing to invest, to your point, in cardiology. We have a very active program in post-field ablation and we have a clinical trial in Europe that just completed in quarter two. We're looking at a 12-month readout of that on safety and efficacy and to file this year. And we're also in clinical trial in the United States for our pulse field ablation we enrolled in May 2022. We actually think the combos are going to be quite complementary of radio frequency, coupled with pulse field ablation. But -- so that's a bit about the cath lab. We're seeing bariatric procedures, which are more elective in nature, really clearing through the backlog. The ones that tend to be laggards are things like spine and we're seeing cataract surgery at a certain point becomes less selective. And the pacesetters, if you will, are areas like stroke, like trauma that are much more less elective in nature. And then I would just say from a creating patient demand, there's been a huge initiative on behalf of Johnson & Johnson and the industry to kind of move to site to care that patients are really preferring. And those areas like ambulatory surgery centers in the United States, our team predominantly in joints as well as sports, they've grown market share 20% over the past two years in those emerging channels. In areas like Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in China with a population of 1.4 billion patients continue to grow and expand. So we're going to see some of those shifts that happened during the pandemic really start to, I think, pick up, where patients can get a sense of comfort and hopefully, we can kind of diffuse some of that, the scarcity of label into the right sites of care.",430.0,210.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.004761904761904762,0.0,0.004761904761904762,0.0,0.0,0.004761904761904762

We always talk about BWI because it is a market leader, and yet the category still has very low penetration. Less than 12% of eligible patients are actually getting cardiac ablation. And we love this example, because we think when we think of health care, we love to kind of intercept disease before it sets in. And if you can go manage cardiac arhythmia through cardiac completion, you can really prevent a stroke. So just a huge acknowledgment of how close that team is to customers really around the world. How -- the innovation cadence, they really have many first-in-kind. And if it's not first-in-kind, their second generation will ultimately become the standard-of-care is what they've shown and just a true sense of competitiveness. So, in quarter three, BWI was up about 19%, Joanne, and as I mentioned, about 24% in the US, but 13% OUS, and very healthy growth in Europe, a very healthy growth in Asia. That is a category that, like joint, is going to go through a bit of a VBP impact in some quarters to come, but we have very differentiated innovation, and we're building kind of local on-the-ground capability to endure through those. And when I think about the state of innovation, it's just making sure that we can, from an industry penetration, take that from 12% penetration and double that. And that really is the single-minded focus of all of the innovation is to locate better lesions, deliver better lesion, make it a safer, less fluoro in the procedure, make it safer for electrophysiologists and quite frankly, scale it. There's a shortage of electrophysiologist. So we invest a lot of money on market creation.

Yes, I mean the market will be experiencing a significant event, at least in the US with some competitive biosimilars coming in against other assets. We do anticipate that that will cause a bit of disruption. But when we take a look at our business and TREMFYA, so focusing on TREMFYA for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, I think based on what this has really the first IL-23 is delivering and delivering for patients. We can anticipate that there will still be strong continued growth for that asset. We're very, very confident in our excess positions there and being able to retain that even in the face of biosimilars to other products that are launching. Also put in a plug while we're at it. I'm talking about TREMFYA that we also feel really good about how our product TREMFYA is working through the Phase 3 clinical trials for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and look forward to hopefully getting that data in through the regulatory process and launching to bring even more benefit to patients with that. So we do anticipate continued growth there. And then on CARVYKTI, we're really pleased with how the product is performing for patients and the data that we're continuing to see, maybe if I start off on CARTITUDE-4 and then I'll come back on the launch. We do anticipate CARTITUDE-4 hopefully reporting by year-end. It's an event driven trial. So we have to wait until we have all of the events. But that’s currently what we're planning for now, so that everyone knows CARTITUDE-4 is our study that takes a look at CARVYKTI in one to three prior lines of therapy. We're really interested and looking forward to seeing those results. So if we take a look at the early launch for CARVYKTI, we've always talked about this being really planned and thoughtful approach to scaling it. And so we're in the process right now. We've really been working closely with the centers where we had done the clinical trials to work through the initial phases. I know everyone knows about the worldwide lentivirus shortage. We've made really good progress on that and have good line of sight to that not being something that we're dependent, that not being a rate-limiting factor in the future. We're also working towards really being able to scale this at a broad level to be able to accommodate what we're seeing is both great demand for the product right now, but also what we anticipate with CARTITUDE-4, as well as hopefully with CARTITUDE-5, which would be in frontline therapy. So we reconfirm this as really a big asset with a lot of growth potential and one of our potentially $5 billion-plus brands.",488.0,212.0,10.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.04716981132075472,0.018867924528301886,0.0330188679245283,0.0047169811320754715,0.009433962264150943,0.02830188679245283

So STELARA and TREMFYA, we're not -- we don't provide guidance by product or combinations of that. What I can say is that we do anticipate continued robust growth TREMFYA. Next year, as I indicated, TREMFYA in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is really showing very strong market share gains and penetration in that market. STELARA really competes, and its strong growth has been in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And so when you take a look at those two markets, we do anticipate both of those continuing to show really good growth, at least through the first three quarters of next year with STELARA, then post September being impacted by biosimilars. And then on nipocalimab, so I don't have really to share there yet for nipocalimab. Consistent with all of our processes when we finish our studies, we go ahead and submit them to major medical meetings and get them published. I remain really confident in nipocalimab as an asset, and we've really taken a look at, at building that out across 10 or 11 different indications, including the potential for RA, which we think could be a big one. So definitely more to come on that as we can share it.",209.0,90.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.011111111111111112,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.044444444444444446

I’m pleased to be here today to review our 2022 results and highlight my priorities for the business. I’m excited for the future of Johnson & Johnson. For over 135 years, people have counted on Johnson & Johnson to be at the forefront of healthcare innovation. This remains as true today as the day we were founded. And I’m honored to continue this legacy. In 2022, despite macroeconomic challenges, we delivered full year operational growth of over 6%. This is the result of the dedication and focus of our employees around the world, as well as the breadth and diversification of our business. There were many business achievements last year. Let me share some highlights. Our Pharmaceutical team achieved its 11th consecutive year of above market adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, delivering nearly 7% growth as we continue to advance our innovation pipeline. I’m particularly excited about the progress made across our multiple myeloma portfolio. This includes the launches of CARVYKTI, our first cell therapy; and TECVAYLI, our BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody, along with the recent filing of Talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific. In MedTech, we generated above 6% full year operational growth, anticipating our second consecutive year outperforming our competitive composite. In terms of innovation, we accelerated the cadence of new product launches and significantly enhanced the quality of our MedTech pipeline, including more than doubling the number of programs with over $100 million of net present value potential. Notably, we completed the acquisition of Abiomed, which positions us as the global leader in heart recovery and immediately enhances MedTech revenue growth. This transaction will become accretive to earnings in 2024. Finally, we made significant progress towards the separation of Kenvue. We have begun operating our consumer business as a company within a company, and we filed our Form S-1 with the SEC, giving us the option to pursue an IPO as a potential step in the separation. Looking ahead, while we expect some of the headwinds that impacted 2022 to continue, we have proven that Johnson & Johnson is resilient in times of macroeconomic challenges. In this environment, our approach to 2023 can be best described as prudent, and our priorities for the year are clear and remain consistent. First, we are finalizing our plans for Johnson & Johnson to operate as a two-sector company, dedicated to competitive performance, both in Pharmaceutical and MedTech. This change will enable us to become simpler, faster and more focused. In Pharmaceutical, we will continue delivering top line growth annually, while driving towards $60 billion in revenue by 2025. We believe we will be able to achieve our market growth in 2023 for the 12th consecutive year, even in the face of the STELARA loss of exclusivity and macroeconomic challenges. Growth will be driven primarily by our existing portfolio, including DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI, and also continued uptake from new launches, including SPRAVATO, CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. In MedTech, with the acquisition of Abiomed, we now have 12 platforms with over $1 billion in annual sales. We expect to continue to build on 2022’s momentum. We will do this by maximizing the commercial opportunity for recently launched innovations, continuing to advance the Abiomed pipeline and prioritizing investment in higher growth segments of our markets. This will be a transformational year for Johnson & Johnson, which brings me to my next priority, completing the successful creation of our new Consumer Health Company, Kenvue. We remain on track to complete the separation in 2023 as indicated in our initial announcement in November of 2021. As we look forward, our track record gives us the confidence that we can grow ahead of our peers and cement the foundation for long-term success. Following 2021, a year where we substantially increased R&D investment, we continue our commitment to organic innovation. We invested nearly $15 billion in R&D during 2022. Also, we increased our dividend for the 60th consecutive year. We instituted a share repurchase and we deployed over $17 billion in M&A, including the acquisition of Abiomed. Very few companies have the capability and the balance sheet to take such significant actions concurrently, especially in a year like 2022. I’m confident that we are well positioned for 2023 and beyond. In closing, I am energized about what is to come. As the largest and most diversified health care products company in the world, we will continue to use our scale and breadth to drive innovations, deliver for patients and shape the future of health care around the world. Now, let me turn it back to Jess.",752.0,372.0,28.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,2.0,2.0,0.07526881720430108,0.010752688172043012,0.010752688172043012,0.0,0.002688172043010753,0.06451612903225806

Worldwide sales were $23.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of 4.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 0.9% as currency had a negative impact of 5.3 points. In the U.S., sales increased 2.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales declined 11.5%. Operational sales outside the U.S. declined 1.1%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 10.4 points. Excluding sales from the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 4.6% worldwide, 4.7% in the U.S. and 4.4% outside the U.S. As you will find in our supplemental sales schedule, acquisitions and divestitures had an immaterial impact on our results in the quarter. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.5 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.33 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.77 one year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.2 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.35, representing increases of 9.5% and 10.3%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15.5%. For the full year 2022, consolidated sales were $94.9 billion, an increase of 1.3% compared to the full year of 2021. Operationally, full year sales grew 6.1%, with currency having a negative impact of 4.8 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 3%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year sales declined 0.6%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. grew by 9.1%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 9.7 points. As you will find in our supplemental sales schedules, acquisition and divestitures as well as sales from our COVID-19 vaccine had an immaterial impact on our results for the full year. Net earnings for the full year 2022 were $17.9 billion and diluted earnings per share was $6.73 versus diluted earnings per share of $7.81 a year ago. 2022 adjusted net earnings were $27 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $10.15, representing increases of 3.2% and 3.6%, respectively, versus full year 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 9.2%. While not part of our prepared remarks for today’s call, we have provided additional information and backup for our full year 2022 sales by segment, consolidated statement of earnings and adjusted income before tax by segment, which can be downloaded from our website. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights for the quarter. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2021 and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.8 billion increased 1%, with an increase of 10.9% in the U.S. and a decline of 5.8% outside the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 6.4% and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 3.2%. Results were primarily driven by strategic price increases, growth in OTC due to a strong cough, cold and flu season, and growth in NEUTROGENA as well as strong new product introductions in Asia Pacific and Latin America. NEUTROGENA growth contributed to the second consecutive quarter of 5% operational growth for Skin Health/Beauty. Growth across the portfolio was partially offset by continued, although reduced supply constraints in the U.S. COVID-19 impacts in China, portfolio simplification and the suspension of personal care product sales in Russia. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.2 billion decreased 7.4% with declines of 0.6% in the U.S. and 14.9% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales declined 2.5%, and outside the U.S., operational sales declined 4.5%. Excluding the COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth increased 3.9%, U.S. operational sales growth increased 2.4%, and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 6%. Pharmaceutical growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth for the 11th consecutive year, including 7 assets with double-digit growth. Growth was driven by DARZALEX, ERLEADA, STELARA and TREMFYA, and was partially offset by REMICADE and ZYTIGA, due to loss of exclusivity along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales. Within our oncology business, DARZALEX and ERLEADA continued to drive strong sales growth, with increases of 33.9% and 48.6%, respectively. ZYTIGA sales declined 43.6% worldwide, predominantly due to loss of exclusivity in Europe in September. IMBRUVICA sales declined 12.3% worldwide due to competitive pressures and a suppressed CLL market due to COVID-19. Despite competitive pressures, IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. In our immunology business, STELARA grew 6.2%, driven by market growth and share gains in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, with gains of 4 points and 5.4 points in the U.S., respectively, as well as a favorable prior period adjustment impacting worldwide results by approximately 460 basis points. Results in the quarter were partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and rebating in the U.S. as well as austerity measures in Europe and shipment timing in Asia Pacific. TREMFYA grew 12.5%, driven by share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with gains of 1.4 points and 2.9 points in the U.S., respectively, along with market growth. Q4 growth was partially offset by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment impacting worldwide results by approximately 1,150 basis points, unfavorable patient mix and a challenging prior year comparison. Beginning in Q1 2023, we anticipate that CARVYKTI, currently reported in other oncology, and SPRAVATO, currently reported in other neuroscience, will meet the threshold to be separately disclosed. I’ll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $6.8 billion decreased by 1.2%, with growth of 7.1% in the U.S. and a decline of 8.6% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 4.9%, and outside the U.S. operational sales growth increased 2.9%. Excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 4.4%. Q4 growth was driven by commercial execution, strong new product introduction performance as well as COVID-19 procedure recovery in many parts of the world. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of value-based procurement, COVID resurgence in China as well as supply constraints predominantly in vision. Strong growth continued in the U.S., with dollar sales sequentially improving each quarter throughout 2022. OUS performance was adversely impacted by dynamics related to COVID-19, especially given our strong position in China. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 15.1%, driven primarily by strong new product introductions performance, commercial execution and continued market growth in electrophysiology. Abiomed sales are also reported in Interventional Solutions, and financial results were reflected as of December 22, the date the acquisition closed. Contact lens global growth of 7.7% reflects strong performance of our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, including the recent launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, strong commercial execution and market appropriate price actions. Growth was tempered by continued supply challenges. In the orthopedics franchise, digital and enabling technologies reported in spine, sports and other continued to accelerate and drive pull-through sales in areas like hips and knees. For additional context, selling days had approximately a 60 basis points positive impact on results in the quarter. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022. I’d like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 70 basis points, primarily driven by onetime COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing-related costs, unfavorable currency impact in the Pharmaceutical business, inflationary pressures as well as unfavorable mix with the enterprise, with a lower portion of sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins leveraged by 150 basis points. This represents a 9% reduction versus the prior year, driven by phasing with higher spend earlier in the year as well as proactive management of costs given the current inflationary environment. We continued to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 16.2% of sales this quarter. The $3.8 billion invested was an 18.6% reduction versus the prior year, driven primarily by phasing with higher spend earlier in the year. Interest income was favorable to prior year by just over $100 million, driven by higher rates of interest earned on cash balances. The other income and expense line was an expense of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to an expense of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by onetime COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing-related exit costs, higher Consumer Health separation-related costs, higher costs related to the Abiomed acquisition and lower gains on securities. As we announced in Q2 2022, we continue to have commitments and obligations related to the COVID-19 vaccine, including external manufacturing network exit cost and required clinical trial expenses, associated with the Company’s modification of its COVID-19 vaccine research program and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all remaining customer contractual requirements. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 16.2% versus 2.1% in the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by more income in higher tax jurisdictions versus the prior year. Additionally, the Company benefited from onetime tax items in the fourth quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in the current year. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.2% versus 10.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2022 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I’ll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now, let’s look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 25.6% to 31.3%. Pharmaceutical margins improved from 33.9% to 38.2%, primarily driven by SG&A and R&D phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year, partially offset by the negative impact of currency and cost of products sold. MedTech margins improved from 18.1% to 25.3%, primarily driven by SG&A and R&D phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year, favorable portfolio mix and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by inflationary pressures. Finally, Consumer Health margins improved from 18.6% to 22%, driven by brand marketing phasing with higher spend earlier in the year and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by inflationary pressures. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. I’m now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.

As Jess shared, we reported solid results with competitive growth across our business segments in 2022. While macroeconomic challenges and lingering COVID-19-related impacts tempered our fourth quarter sales growth, we prioritized our top investments, while managing costs to yield slightly better margin performance than guided in October to meet our earnings expectations. The business is resilient, and we should be positioned well entering 2023. We are particularly proud of the advancements in our pipeline and portfolio to solidify the long-term, including the launch of TECVAYLI, the filing of Talquetamab in the U.S. and Europe, FDA clearance for our TELIGEN digital supply solution, the closing of the Abiomed acquisition and the tremendous progress made on separating our Consumer Health business. Let’s delve into the financials, beginning with our 2022 year-end cash position and execution against our capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of approximately $17 billion. And at the end of 2022, we had approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $40 billion of debt for a net debt position of $16 billion. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, we had a strong year deploying capital against all of our capital allocation priorities. These priorities remain unchanged. This past year, we invested more than 15% of sales for a total of nearly $15 billion in research and development. This investment has enabled the advancement of important programs, including strengthening our MedTech pipeline and progression of our multiple myeloma portfolio, which Joaquin referenced. Investment in R&D remains a top priority to support long-term growth and value creation. Our second priority is our commitment to dividends. 2022 marked the 60th consecutive year in which we increased our annual dividend. We know investors value our dividend. And as a part of the Consumer Health separation, we intend, at a minimum, to maintain that dividend. As you can appreciate, we will need more clarity on the type of separation to determine how that is best achieved. Our third priority is strategic acquisitions, which is intended to complement our organic activities. In 2022, we closed the acquisition of Abiomed, strengthening MedTech’s presence in higher growth segments, as well as more than 100 smaller early-stage acquisitions, licensing deals and partnerships. Finally, our Board authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter. And as of the end of the year, we’ve completed approximately 50% of that program. In combination with our dividend, we returned over $14 billion to shareholders in 2022. I’ll now provide our full year 2023 guidance. As we are still in the process of the Kenvue separation, our guidance represents the current Johnson & Johnson businesses, inclusive of Pharmaceuticals, MedTech and Consumer Health segments. We expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 in the range of 4.5% to 5.5% or $96.9 billion to $97.9 billion. This guidance is provided on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage business performance. We estimate a favorable impact from net acquisitions and divestitures associated primarily with the Abiomed acquisition, and thus, are comfortable with your models reflecting adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. Our sales guidance continues to exclude contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, which, as your models already correctly anticipate, will decline in 2023. As you know, we don’t speculate on future currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08 as well as other currencies, we estimate there would be no impact from foreign currency translation on reported sales for the year. Regarding other items on our P&L, we expect 2023 adjusted pretax operating margin to be flat driven by continued inflationary pressures and cost of goods sold, offset by continued operating expense leverage. Regarding other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income, the return on assets and actuarial costs associated with certain employee benefit programs as well as gains and losses related to items such as investments by Johnson & Johnson Development Corp., litigation and balance sheet write-offs. On an adjusted basis, we expect this to be $1.9 billion, $2.1 billion for 2023. The majority of this income is associated with our employee benefits programs aligned with accounting disclosure requirements, rising interest rates, return on assets and program actions the team has implemented to derisk the plans have lowered our projected future benefit obligations. And based on current trends, we expect this benefit to continue through the next couple of years. We are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense between $250 million and $350 million. These figures include increased financing charges versus 2022 associated with the Abiomed acquisition. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2023 in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses. Considering all these factors, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.40 to $10.60 on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 2.5% to 4.5% or 3.5% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted operational earnings per share for the year would be favorably impacted by approximately $0.05 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share in a range of $10.45 to $10.65 or $10.55 at the midpoint, growth of 4% versus the prior year. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I’d like to provide some qualitative considerations for your modeling. Some segment remarks, starting with Pharmaceuticals. We expect to again deliver above-market growth in 2023, driven by key assets such as DARZALEX, ERLEADA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI as well as continued uptake of recently launched products, such as CARVYKTI, SPRAVATO and TECVAYLI. This growth is despite lower Pharmaceutical market growth than experienced in recent years and considers the STELARA loss of exclusivity, which we anticipate occurring in late 2023 in the U.S. While we continue to expect volume growth for STELARA in the U.S. up to the LOE date, we expect this growth to be offset by pricing pressure. Further, we continue to expect a 2023 impact from other post-LOE products as well as potential increased austerity measures across Europe. In MedTech, we expect continued competitive growth fueled by market recovery and continued commercial uptake of recently launched products. We anticipate a relatively stable recovery in procedure volumes with health care staffing constraints remaining the most significant limitation on the pace of recovery. Specific to China, we anticipate continued pressure into 2023 related to the easing of the zero COVID policies as well as impacts from volume-based procurement. As we’ve said, we’re excited about the Abiomed acquisition, which accelerates our sales growth in 2023. In Consumer Health, we anticipate continued growth in line with the markets that we compete in. We also expect to continue to utilize strategic price increases across the portfolio to minimize the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures within the supply chain. Regarding quarterly phasing, it’s best summed up with a general theme that we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half and likely the second quarter is stronger than the first quarter. We are assuming the following to support these statements. In Pharmaceuticals, the first half of the year will be impacted by continued declines from LOE products in Europe that impacted Q4 2022 results, namely ZYTIGA and INVEGA SUSTENNA as well as continued pricing pressure. Also, we expect the ramp of new product launches will occur more prominently in the second half of the year. In MedTech, we expect second half operational sales growth to be higher than the first half of the year as we anticipate ongoing procedure recovery to improve as the year progresses. We also believe that some of the COVID impact felt in China in Q4 will carry over into early 2023. And similar to Pharmaceuticals, uptake of new product launches is assumed to be more pronounced in the second half. Given we are in the registration process, regulations limit what we can currently discuss around the planned Consumer Health Company. On the P&L, we also anticipate operating margin to be better in the second half than the first half. This is attributable to inventory built in 2022 at higher costs driven by inflation that will flow through the P&L in the first half of 2023 and a second half that accounts for cost leverage driven by mitigation efforts and higher sales reflected in the comments I just made. And finally, while we don’t speculate on future currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08 as well as other currencies, foreign exchange would have a negative impact on our results in the first half of the year, but potentially a favorable impact in the second half. Turning to key events in 2023. As mentioned, we are limited in the information we can provide around the planned Consumer Health separation. We publicly filed a Form S-1 on January 4th with the Securities and Exchange Commission, giving us the option to pursue an initial public offering as a potential first step in the planned separation, and we have started to operate Kenvue as a company within a company. Consistent with our initial announcement in November of 2021, we continue to expect to complete the separation in 2023. And we expect that any interim steps, such as an IPO, would be consistent with that timing, subject to market conditions. We are estimating $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion in after-tax Kenvue standup costs, with $1.2 billion having already been incurred through the end of 2022. These estimates are in line with industry average for transactions such as this one, given Johnson & Johnson’s market cap. In terms of dissynergies to be incurred following the completion of the separation, we are estimating between $500 million and $750 million of annual after-tax impact. We are already executing on plans to address these dissynergies and expect to have them fully mitigated by the end of 2024. As we separate new Johnson & Johnson, we’ll also continue to reevaluate the level of ongoing financial information provided based on discussions with investors. While our financials will become simpler as we move from a three-segment company to a two-segment company, we will continue to look for ways to enhance our disclosures, such as providing quarterly R&D by segment and a patent expiry table in our Form 10-K. We also expect 2023 to be an important year of scientific innovations and readouts across our segments. In our Pharmaceutical business, some examples include the potential approval of Talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific antibody in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Potential clinical data from CARTITUDE-4, a trial studying CARVYKTI, our BCMA CAR-T in patients with 1 to 3 lines of prior therapy. The potential for an interim analysis of the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations versus Tagrisso as well as potential clinical data from the PAPILLON study in frontline non-small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. Early clinical data from the Phase 2 SunRISe-1 study of TAR-200, our drug eluting device in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Starting Phase 3 clinical program for milvexian, a Factor XI anticoagulant in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Potential Phase 2 clinical data from nipocalimab, our FcRn antagonist in rheumatoid arthritis and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, potential Phase 3 clinical data from TREMFYA in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. And finally, TREMFYA, our IL-23 inhibitor, was recently added to the National Reimbursement Drug List in China, which will take effect later this year. In MedTech, we look forward to providing information on significant innovation programs across the business, including expansion of our digital solutions in orthopedics, our digital robotic solution, Ottava, our pulsed field ablation solutions for cardiac ablation and advancements in our pipeline and clinical studies for heart recovery associated with Abiomed. Overall, our approach to 2023 financial guidance should be viewed as responsibly cautious given the many external uncertainties. We are focused on delivering competitive growth for new Johnson & Johnson, while also completing a successful Consumer Health separation. We are confident that our current plans position us for long-term growth and value creation for shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks.

I’ll handle the first question, and then I’ll kick the question of CARTITUDE over to Joaquin. With respect to guidance, I would say, just given all the macroeconomic uncertainty, geopolitical uncertainty, we thought this was the right approach at this point in time to come out with guidance in the ranges that we did. I wouldn’t classify it as conservative per se. What I would say in terms of our outlook for the P&L, is that we’re assuming a lot of carryover, quite frankly, of the inflationary impact that we had in 2022. As you can imagine, the way the accounting would work, we built inventory at higher cost in 2022. That’s set on the balance sheet at year-end and will flow through mostly the first half of 2023. If there’s any element of conservatism, I would say, it probably resides in the fact that we’re not assuming any deflationary relief as we go throughout the year. So, we do think these costs will be at a higher level for some time. But as you saw with our fourth quarter results and really the outlook for 2023, we’re doing everything we can responsibly to prioritize our top investments for the long term as well as manage costs in the interim.",219.0,96.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.010416666666666666,0.020833333333333332,0.052083333333333336,0.0,0.0,-0.010416666666666666

And with respect to CARTITUDE-4 and CARVYKTI, our multiple myeloma portfolio, Terence, is the most important driver of growth for our Pharmaceutical group moving forward. It’s about DARZALEX continued progression in first line; CARVYKTI, our best-in-class BCMA cell therapy; the recently approved TECVAYLI, our BCMA CD3 bispecific; and also, we are excited about the filing of Talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific. So all in all, this portfolio enables us to do something very significant, which is changing the treatment paradigm from treating to progression to treating to cure. And we’ll see these medicines being used in combination and in different sequences in order to achieve this treating to cure. Specifically, what you mentioned, CARTITUDE-4, which is the study that evaluates CARVYKTI in patients who have received one or three prior lines of therapy, it’s very important in achieving that goal. CARTITUDE-4 is an event-driven study, and we look forward to have some results of CARTITUDE-4 in 2023.

I was hoping that you could please discuss the longer term prospects for the Pharmaceutical business. In the past, J&J has targeted $60 billion in Pharmaceutical revenue in 2025.

We continue to work towards accomplishing our previously stated goals of on one hand, delivering growth every single year in our Pharmaceutical group through 2025 despite of the loss of exclusivity of STELARA, at the same time, continue to advance our differentiated pipeline and achieving $60 billion in revenue by 2025. So, we continue to work towards these goals. As we have discussed multiple times, the growth by 2025 is going to be driven mainly through the strength of our currently marketed portfolio as well as new indications of this marketed portfolio. Some examples, continuous growth of DARZALEX in first line, TREMFYA, which is gaining share, both in psoriatic arthritis and in psoriasis, and we expect a readout of our IBD studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s in 2023 will provide a significant additional leg of growth for TREMFYA; ERLEADA, which is now in different indications in metastatic and non-metastatic prostate cancer will have some readouts of studies in high-risk localized prostate cancer in 2023, providing an additional leg of growth; our INVEGA SUSTENNA franchise in the U.S. as well as our pulmonary arterial hypertension franchise with UPTRAVI and OPSUMIT has been affected by COVID-19, but that we expect that will continue to deliver growth. So, that is the mainstay of our growth prospects towards 2025. And I will go later about the disconnect. Then connected with that, we are also excited about our new product launches, specifically growth of SPRAVATO, growth in CARVYKTI that I just mentioned before and also TECVAYLI, which we got the approval very recently; and as I commented, the filing of Talquetamab, everything in multiple myeloma. At the same time, we continue to make significant progress in some of the key products in our pipeline. A sample of them we commented that were opportunities of more than $5 billion. Example of them, milvexian, our oral anticoagulant, the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in non-small cell lung cancer, our TARIS platform in bladder cancer. And finally, nipocalimab in autoantibody-mediated diseases. So, those are the key drivers of our growth moving into 2025. If I think about the main disconnect between our forecast and the Street forecast, it’s our multiple myeloma portfolio. As I commented earlier, we see our multiple myeloma portfolio helping treat into cure rather than cannibalizing each other. And as a matter of fact, some of the studies that we have now in place show that ambition of combining our therapies. I mentioned CARTITUDE-4, moving CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy; TECVAYLI and Talquetamab, our two bispecific antibodies are being studied in combination with one another, and TECVAYLI or Talquetamab are also being a study in combination with DARZALEX. So, I see that as the major source of disconnect with the Street. Then further to that, I continue to see disconnects in SPRAVATO, our treatment for treatment-resistant depression; significant disconnects also in ERLEADA because of the indications in high-risk patients with localized prostate cancer that will read in 2023. We see a disconnect, as I commented in our pulmonary arterial hypertension franchise with UPTRAVI and OPSUMIT, which have been impacted by the pandemic, but we see strong growth moving forward. And then, finally, in the expectations for Xarelto loss of exclusivity, which we see that in the back half of this decade. So, those are elements that I have reflected as disconnect. So, as I said, we continue to drive towards our 2025 goal of $60 billion and posting growth every year. I think it’s a reflection of the strength of our current portfolio and how well we are executing in our pipeline.",610.0,271.0,12.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.04428044280442804,0.01107011070110701,0.007380073800738007,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.033210332103321034

So, let me start by -- as you know, we don’t provide guidance by quarter, but let me talk a little bit about market growth. With respect to MedTech, we anticipate pretty much what we typically see in any given year, 4% to 6%. As some of my earlier comments in the prepared remarks reflect, we anticipate that there will be a little bit of, I’ll call it, carryover from some of the COVID surges that we saw in the Asia Pacific region in the fourth quarter. But, other than that, a normal cadence of steady procedure recovery. The biggest challenge that hospital administrators are facing right now is really the staffing concern, but they’ve done a wonderful job in getting some sense of normalcy to that. With respect to Pharmaceuticals, again, we enjoyed our 11th consecutive year of above-market growth. We anticipate 2023 will be a 12th year, but it is off of a lower base. If you happen to see some of the IQVIA data from last week, they’re calling global and actually U.S. growth somewhere in that 2.5% to 4% range, depending on what region you’re looking at. So, while we will beat the market, we think it will be a lower number just by the dynamic of the market overall. And that’s kind of how we’re thinking of it. In terms of some of the cadence, maybe to elaborate on the comments that I had prepared earlier, we will see some of that generic erosion that we experienced in the fourth quarter in Europe with the long-acting injectables as well as ZYTIGA having a much more pronounced impact in the first and second quarter, bleeding over from the fourth quarter. And pricing measures likely will be consistent throughout the year. So hopefully, that helps give you a better sense of how we’re looking at it. But again, the general theme of second half stronger than first half and probably second quarter stronger than first quarter seems to hold intact based on top line as well as bottom line performance, given our expectations.",354.0,168.0,5.0,3.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,0.02976190476190476,0.017857142857142856,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.005952380952380952,0.011904761904761904

And regarding to your question, Larry, as we have discussed and commented, we see above market growth in 2023 for our Pharmaceutical group, which would be the 12th consecutive year of our market growth. And we continue to see positive growth in 2024 despite the loss of exclusivity in STELARA. And then we would see again pick up our growth above market in 2025. That’s the sequence that we will see.

I’m just trying to think through the balance of, I guess, on one hand, some of the inflation headwinds potentially decreasing as you work through some of this inventory, I guess balanced against the STELARA LOE and some of the dissynergies from the spin. So, I guess, as something kind of bigger picture about operating margins, is 2023 a decent proxy going forward, or could we see either modest erosion in margins or expansion, or is it too early to call? I’m just trying to get just some sense of how that plays out. And then my second question, which is just maybe a clarification on some of the immunology comments you made regarding 4Q. I think you mentioned unfavorable mix and rebate dynamics as headwinds. Should we expect those dynamics to continue in ‘23?

I’ll tackle the operating margin question, and then I’ll turn it over to Joaquin for some of the immunology references. So with respect to operating margin, I think, while we don’t give multiyear guidance, I think this year does portend to have a considerable achievement in terms of managing cost by the organization in addition to inflationary pressures. And again, that’s not combated with an assumption that we’ll see deflationary relief. We also have the dissynergies that come along with the consumer separation itself. As the comments indicated, we plan to address all of those, and we’ve already started in mid-2022 to mitigate some of those. They’ll be fully mitigated by 2024. So, I would think just looking out now qualitatively, ‘23 and ‘24 may look similar because you’ve got some different dynamics playing out, and we’ll certainly have to see how inflation plays out over the course of this year. And then, getting back on a more normal cadence, I would say, you would expect from Johnson & Johnson, you know that we like to grow income a little bit faster than sales growth. And you do that by improving your margin profile. We have $60 billion of resources in a given year.

First of all, I guess let me follow up to Terence’s question with respect to how he positioned, conservatism. I probably did miss an opportunity to speak about some of the things that maybe could go better on our behalf. And some of that could be a quicker rebound in China, whether that be in both MedTech or Pharmaceuticals. Right now, we’re assuming there is some carryover effect from the COVID surges we saw in the fourth quarter. The teams on the ground seem to indicate that it’s still persistent, but if that rebounded a little bit quicker. I think also looking at the multiple myeloma portfolio, and the performance of CARVYKTI or TECVAYLI could be significant and opportunities or pockets for upside. We’re obviously excited by the Abiomed acquisition and what that could possibly mean. And bringing the capabilities of Johnson & Johnson, both in terms of scale and reach, presents some opportunity that maybe isn’t in the current projections. So, there are some opportunities for outperformance. Right now, we like where the number is at with respect to that. China and VBP specifically, I would say that is a dynamic that’s not really a new phenomenon for us. We had won a number of tenders at the end of 2021 that were persistent throughout 2022, and we continue to win tenders. And we think over time that the volume and the opportunity to help many more patients will be persistent with that.

So, any color on this patent answer would be helpful. Thanks.",89.0,38.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.02631578947368421

There’s no approved biosimilars at this time, and we are going to continue to monitor the situation. As we have commented, we expect the erosion curve of STELARA to be likely steeper than that of REMICADE, given the evolution of the biosimilar market and the fact that STELARA is a self-administered product, as well as potentially to your point, potentially interchangeability in the label. So, that’s how we see the STELARA loss of exclusivity. In 2023, when we think about the STELARA in the U.S., we see the sales of STELARA flat to declining, obviously, given the price pressures. That will be offset also by continuous volume growth that we see in STELARA. So, that’s the perspective that we have for STELARA in 2023. Overall, we have a very strong immunology franchise. I commented on TREMFYA before, the continuous progression in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, the readout of our ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease studies, which is exciting. And also, in 2023, we may have some data from our Phase 2 study of our oral IL-23, which we think it’s a very exciting underappreciated opportunity in our pipeline, too.",210.0,79.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.06329113924050633,0.06329113924050633,0.012658227848101266,0.0,0.0,0.0

There’s a significant need for new therapies in this relapsed/refractory patient population. So, the demand for the products, the physicians and patient adoption has been really strong. So, that is really encouraging and pertains the unmet medical need for these types of patients. With CARVYKTI, we continue to scale our production capacity and expand our network of providers, and we are doing that in a phased approach. With TECVAYLI, we are off to a successful start and the early indications for this of the self-option are very, very positive, too, connected with the high unmet medical need that we see there. Moving into 2023, key elements of that would be, from a data perspective, the reading CARTITUDE-4, which would give us the opportunity to move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy. Also the filing of Talquetamab, which will give us another line of therapy, because some of the studies of Talquetamab are done in patients who have failed BCMA, either cell therapy or bispecifics, and the continuous data that we’ll continue to provide to guide how to use this incredible portfolio in multiple myeloma.",205.0,91.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.01098901098901099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06593406593406594

So I wanted to ask you about the timing of data readouts first half or second half and your expectations for a few products. First one is nipocalimab and rheumatoid arthritis. And then, your oral IL-23 I saw that a trial was finished and what your next steps are here and when you might have some data?

Again, this is an event-driven study, so it’s difficult for us to give you exact timing, Louise. Importantly, we have the potential for an interim analysis on the Mariposa study, which is the study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations in this study versus Tagrisso. And this is an important study for us. And also, we have the potential clinical data from the PAPILLON study, which is in frontline non-small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. So, those are important ones in non-small cell lung cancer. And then, staying in oncology, we also have the data for the -- from the Phase 2 SunRISe-1 study of our TAR-200 platform, our drug-eluting device in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. And we continue to work on our high-risk localized prostate cancer with ERLEADA. So, that’s key elements in our oncology side. As far as nipocalimab, we are expecting data from our Phase 3 studies in RA, in rheumatoid arthritis, which I know has created significant attention from you and also in hemolytic disease of the fetus and the newborn. It will be towards the later part of the year. That’s when you can expect those data to come up. And then, keeping with important date targets next year, we’ll also have the data reads in our 2 IBD studies, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease with TREMFYA. Finally, important progress in our pipeline is that we will be starting our Phase 3 clinical program with milvexian, our Factor XI anticoagulant with our partners at Bristol-Myers Squibb. So, I would say, a very important year for us in terms of data read. That will also include our Phase 2 study of our oral IL-23. It’s difficult for us to give you an exact time line, but we fully expect that to happen in 2023. So, many important data reads for us that will showcase the good execution that we’re having in our pipeline.",359.0,165.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.012121212121212121,0.012121212121212121,0.012121212121212121,0.0,0.0,0.0

Welcome to our company's review of the 2023 first quarter business results and full year financial outlook. Joining me on today's call are Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman of MedTech. Unfortunately, Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman of Pharmaceuticals is not feeling well and is unable to join us today. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that today's meeting contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, product development, market position and business strategy and the anticipated separation of the company's Consumer Health business. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of today's date and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2022 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda, I will review the first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to the three segments. Joe will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities and updated guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. Now let's turn to our first quarter results. Worldwide sales were $24.7 billion for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 5.6% versus the first quarter of 2022. Operational sales, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 9% as currency had a negative impact of 3.4 points. In the U.S., sales increased 9.7%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales increased 1.8%. Operational sales outside the U.S. increased 8.3% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 6.5 points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 7.6% worldwide, 7.4% in the U.S. and 7.9% outside the U.S. with all three segments growing sequentially over the fourth quarter. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net loss was $68 million and basic loss per share was $0.03 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.93 one-year ago primarily driven by the $6.9 billion charge related to the Talc Settlement proposal. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.1 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.68, representing a decrease of 0.9% and an increase of 0.4%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights for the quarter. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2022 and therefore, exclude the impact currency translation. Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.9 billion increased 7.4% with an increase of 11.4% in the U.S. and an increase of 4.4% outside the U.S. Worldwide operational sales increased 11.3% and outside the U.S., operational sales increased 11.3%. Results were primarily driven by global strategic price increases across all franchises. Volume growth in OTC was due to an exceptionally strong cough, cold and flu season most pronounced in Europe, coupled with one-time retailer restocking primarily in the U.S. related to low inventory levels due to tripledemic demand. Skin Health/Beauty delivered double-digit growth driven by price actions, lapping prior year supply constraints and current quarter restocking as well as strong NEUTROGENA and AVEENO e-commerce and club channel performance and new product innovations. Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.4 billion increased 4.2% with growth of 5.9% in the U.S. and 2.4% outside of the U.S. Worldwide operational sales increased 7.2% and outside the U.S., operational sales increased 8.6%. Excluding the COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales increased 4.9%, U.S. operational sales increased 7.1%, and outside the U.S., operational sales increased 2.4%. Pharmaceutical growth excluding the COVID-19 vaccine was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products with eight assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA with increases of 25.7% and 40.3%, respectively. STELARA grew 9.6% driven by market growth and share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with gains of 2.2 points and 4.8 points in the U.S., respectively, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and price. TREMFYA grew 11% driven by market growth and share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with gains of 0.9 points and 2.1 points in the U.S., respectively, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. Turning to newly launched products. We are excited to disclose CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO sales for the first-time this quarter. We continue to make progress on our thoughtful and phased launch of CARVYKTI and continue to expand access and reimbursement for SPRAVATO. Also, we are encouraged by the early success of our launch of TECVAYLI, sales of which are included in other oncology. This sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity in REMICADE and ZYTIGA, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. I'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.5 billion increased by 7.3% with growth of 16.6% in the U.S. and a decline of 0.6% outside of the U.S. Worldwide operational sales increased 11% and outside the U.S., operational sales increased 6.2%. Abiomed contributed 4.6% to operational growth. Excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 6.4%. Sales in the first quarter accelerated sequentially from Q4 for all four MedTech businesses, driven by global procedure growth, continued uptake of recently launched products, and commercial execution. As anticipated, in China, procedure volumes improved as the quarter progressed. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of volume-based procurement in China as well as supply constraints. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 41.9%, which includes $324 million related to Abiomed. We are excited about the progress of the integration to which Joe will provide additional context. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, this franchise delivered another quarter of double-digit worldwide growth at 12.3%. As we continue to increase our reporting transparency, beginning this quarter, we are providing visibility to electrophysiology sales. Electrophysiology continued to deliver double-digit sales growth in all regions with the exception of Asia-Pacific, which reflects impacts related to volume-based procurement in China. Orthopaedics operational growth of 5.1% reflects the strong procedure recovery and success of recently launched products especially digital and enabling technologies driving pull-through sales in areas like hips and knees. Growth was partially offset by the impact of volume based procurement in China, primarily in hips and spine. Global growth of 9.3% in contact lens and other reflects continued penetration of our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, including the recent launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, strong commercial execution and strategic price actions. Growth in contact lens and U.S. surgical vision was tempered by continued supply challenges. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2023. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 150 basis points driven by one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs in the Pharmaceutical business and commodity inflation and acquisition-related items in the MedTech business. Selling, marketing and administrative margins leveraged by 60 basis points driven by proactive management of costs given the current inflationary environment. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 14.4% of sales this quarter. The $3.6 billion invested was a 2.9% increase versus the prior year. The other income and expense line was an expense of $7.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared to net income of $100 million in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in expense was the result of the $6.9 billion charge related to the Talc Settlement proposal recorded in the first quarter of 2023 as previously disclosed. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 90.8% versus 12.2% in the same period last year, primarily driven by the $6.9 billion accrual for the Talc Settlement proposal. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 13.3% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at the adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 35.1% to 34.2%. Pharmaceutical margins declined from 44.1% to 43.2% driven primarily by mix, partially offset by proactive management of costs. MedTech margins remained flat at 27% driven primarily by inflationary impacts, offset by proactive management of costs. Finally, Consumer Health margins improved from 22.1% to 22.3% driven primarily by strategic price actions, partially offset by input cost inflation. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson first quarter 2023 results. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.

We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operational performance across our business. The results reflect the strength and versatility of Johnson & Johnson and our commitment to improving health care outcomes around the world. 2023 has many important catalysts that can drive meaningful near- and long-term value for Johnson & Johnson shareholders. We remain focused on the successful separation of our Consumer Health business, Kenvue, which will position both companies to be more agile, focused and competitive. We are also expecting a number of pipeline advancements that will provide increased confidence in our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. Our Pharmaceutical segment delivered a strong first quarter. Growth from our Pharmaceutical business continues to be driven by key assets in our existing portfolio, including DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI as well as uptake from new launches such as SPRAVATO, CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. 2023 is an important year of scientific innovation for our Pharmaceutical business. And in Q1, we announced that CARVYKTI, our BCMA cell therapy, met its primary endpoint in the CARTITUDE-4 study, a Phase 3 trial in multiple myeloma patients who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. We look forward to presenting these results in an upcoming major medical meeting. Additionally, our partners at Protagonist Therapeutics announced positive top line results from the Phase 2b FRONTIER 1 study of our Oral IL-23 in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. We look forward to sharing this data and future development plans at an upcoming medical meeting. Finally, as we continually review our portfolio to prioritize the most transformational assets for ongoing investment and an assessment of the RSV vaccine landscape, the company made the decision to discontinue its investigational RSV adult vaccine program. This decision is part of a broader effort to make strategic choices for our pipeline and R&D investments to focus on medicines with the greatest potential benefit to patients. Looking at the rest of the year, we expect important data from key pipeline assets such as Nipocalimab and TREMFYA as well as the potential approval of Talquetamab. Importantly, I want to mention two additional highlights. First, the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer remains on track with the potential for final analysis later this year. We are also excited to present data from the SunRISe-1 study of TAR-200 in muscle invasive bladder cancer at the American Urological Association's Annual Meeting this month, which demonstrated a promising complete response and safety profile. Regarding our Pharmaceutical business, I'd like to reiterate some comments I recently made at the Cowen Investor Conference in March related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the impact on the 2025 Pharmaceutical sales goal the team put forth during the 2021 Investor Day. While we don't speculate on currency, based on the current rates, the 2025 sales target of $60 billion is approximately $57 billion on a constant currency basis. In 2022 alone, FX had a negative impact of roughly $3 billion in Pharmaceuticals. While that is the math qualitatively since 2021, a number of things have changed in our portfolio. On the plus side, we've seen acceleration of some current and potential upcoming launches like TECVAYLI and Talquetamab. But (ph) to be balanced, we've also experienced competitive pressure on IMBRUVICA above what was anticipated in 2021. So many push and pulls, but we are striving to attain our operational goals. We are confident in our ability to exceed 2025 estimates The Street has out there today of approximately $54 billion. MedTech delivered a strong quarter of sales growth. We continued to advance key pipeline programs. For example, within our electrophysiology business, we reached a few milestones this quarter related to our pulse field ablation pipeline programs, including the European clinical study inspIRE, which achieved early success by meeting both primary safety and efficacy endpoints. Additionally, we announced completion of the first procedures in the European SmartfIRE clinical study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of our investigational dual energy catheter, which combines both pulse field and radio frequency ablation capabilities. As you know, we continue to prioritize investment in high growth areas, as demonstrated by our acquisition of Abiomed, which closed this past December. With Abiomed, MedTech now has 12 platforms with over $1 billion in annual sales. While it is still early days, we are pleased with the integration and performance of Abiomed. Patient utilization of Abiomed technologies grew mid to high-teens in both Europe and the United States and over 30% in Japan. We continue to see strong adoption of newer technologies, such as Impella 5.5 and we achieved record quarterly enrollment in both the STEMI-DTU and PROTECT IV pivotal trials as we continue to advance efforts in pursuit of Class I guidelines. For perspective, operational sales growth compared to the same quarter last year reported by Abiomed as a standalone company was 22%. In Orthopaedics, just this month, we obtained CE Mark for the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution, positioning us to expand our international footprint with this differentiated solution in total knee. Finally, the MedTech team is excited by the progress being made in regards to the Ottava general surgery robotic solution, and we remain on track to share more information in the second half of this year. Our Consumer Health business delivered double-digit first quarter sales growth driven by strategic price actions, strong demand and some stock replenishment. We remain on track to complete the separation of this business in 2023, assuming accommodative market conditions. Since the start of the year, we have been operating our Consumer Health business as a company within a company and continue to update our Form S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, giving us the opportunity to pursue an initial public offering as a potential first step in the separation. Standup cost and stranded costs remain consistent with what we have stated previously with an active program well underway to reduce the stranded costs. Turning to notable enterprise events. I'd like to briefly touch on LTL's re-filing for bankruptcy on April 4. Neither LTL's original filing nor this re-filing is an acknowledgment of wrongdoing nor an indication that the company has changed its long-standing position that its talcum powder products are safe. Our goal continues to be for an equitable and efficient resolution of the cosmetic talc litigation against the company, and we believe this refiling represents progress towards that goal. As a reminder, LTL's bankruptcy filing will not have an impact upon the Kenvue separation, and the talc liabilities in the United States and Canada will remain with Johnson & Johnson. As part of the re-filing, we have proposed a reorganization plan that had significant support from Claimants and includes a payment of $8.9 billion in present value over a 25-year period. LTL will continue to work through the process set forth by the bankruptcy court and expects to present the reorganization plan to the court in mid-May. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. And in 2022, we successfully executed against all pillars. R&D investment remains our number one priority and driver of long-term growth and value creation. We know the value our investors place on our dividend, and we were pleased to announce this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a 5.3% increase, marking our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases. In addition, we continuously evaluate strategic business development opportunities that enable Johnson & Johnson to create value for patients, customers and shareholders. Our final priority is share repurchase programs when appropriate. In fact, this past quarter, we completed the $5 billion share repurchase program announced late last year. We are confident in our strong financial position, including our AAA-rated balance sheet and our ability to deploy capital across all strategic priorities. We believe this strength differentiates Johnson & Johnson and enables us to pull the appropriate levers to set us up for long-term success. Moving on to our full year 2023 guidance for the enterprise. Based on our strong start to the year, we are pleased to raise our guidance. We now expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 up 1 percentage point in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%, or up $1 billion in a range of $97.9 billion to $98.9 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth up 1 percentage point in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. Our sales guidance continues to exclude contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we noted that we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar at 1.08. The euro spot rate as of late last week was 1.10. We continue to estimate there would be minimal impact from foreign currency translation on reported sales for the year as the dollar has strengthened versus other select currencies. We are maintaining the guidance we provided in January for our adjusted pre-tax operating margin, other income and expense, interest expense and tax rate. We are also increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 per share and tightening the range to $10.50 to $10.60, or $10.55 at the midpoint on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 3.5% to 4.5%, or 4% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year would be favorably impacted by approximately $0.05 per share. This favorable currency impact, coupled with our strong operational outlook, results in an increase to our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year by $0.10 per share and tightening the range to $10.60 to $10.70, or $10.65 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of approximately 4.5% to 5.5%, or 5% at the midpoint. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations for your modeling. In Pharmaceuticals, we maintain our expectation of delivering above market growth in 2023 driven by key assets and continued uptake of our newly launched products. This growth considers the potential composition of matter patent expiry of STELARA, which we currently assume will occur in late 2023 in the United States. Further, we continue to expect 2023 impact from other post-LOE products, including REMICADE, ZYTIGA and XEPLION as well as increased austerity measures across Europe. Regarding our COVID-19 vaccine, we do not anticipate material sales beyond that which were recorded in the first quarter as our contractual commitments are complete. In MedTech, we expect continued competitive growth fueled by increased procedures and commercial uptake of recently launched products. We anticipate relatively stable procedure volumes and health care staffing levels for the remainder of the year with normal seasonality. Regarding quarterly phasing, given the strength of our first quarter results, we now expect relatively consistent performance throughout the year from our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. When modeling Consumer Health growth rates in 2023, it is important to take into consideration prior year comparisons as well as the robust cough, cold and flu season and the one-time restocking that occurred in the first quarter. As a reminder, the first half of 2022 was impacted by supply constraints. A few brief announcements before we take your questions. Continuing our efforts to increase our transparency and assist with your modeling, we are planning to post a patent table, including U.S. pharmaceutical patents, to our investor website in the quarter. In addition, please mark your calendars for December 5, as we will be hosting an enterprise business review at the New York Stock Exchange focused on the new Johnson & Johnson, highlighting both our Pharmaceutical and MedTech businesses. We will provide additional details about the event in the coming months. Before we turn to your questions, let me state how proud we are regarding our team's continued hard work and unwavering commitment. Our sights are set on the future, focused on delivering competitive growth for the new Johnson & Johnson. We are confident that our current plans position us for near-term success, long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders. I'll now turn the discussion to the Q&A portion of the call.

First, on the $57 billion target for pharma, I think your comments are very clear in terms of your confidence of exceeding consensus of $54 billion. Are you still confident though in that $57 billion target as we think about kind of the pushes and pulls that you just outlined there? And then maybe just a specific question on RYBREVANT. Just want to make sure the comments correctly there. I think you mentioned there's a final analysis of MARIPOSA later this year. Does that mean the interim has passed at this point? And maybe just put some context of what you think you need to show in that study to dislodge share from TAGRISSO.

I wanted to make sure that I was clear on the record since I had the opportunity to do that about a month ago that everybody understood the message around the math component of it. We feel very good about our pipeline. We continue to work towards some really good data that came out this quarter around multiple myeloma, MARIPOSA, which we'll talk about in a minute. We continue to see some uptake of some of our newer products and the goal is still that for us. But you'll have a much better and much more informed and probably timely update once we hit the December 5 meeting at the New York Stock Exchange, so stay posted on that. What I do feel comfortable though is that we're moving certainly in the right direction. I wanted to take out the unclarity that maybe was created by currency and the dramatic movements that occurred over the last 18 months. So for MARIPOSA, I would say the study of RYBREVANT and Lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer versus TAGRISSO remains very much on track. It's an event-driven trial. So there's the potential for final analysis later this year, which is actually two quarters ahead than what we had originally expected, was originally expected to be second quarter of 2024. The accrual to the study we can say is very rapid as there was tremendous interest. And the interim analysis was specified in the protocol with a significantly limited follow-up and supported the continuation of the study. We were blinded to that interim analysis. And as far as what we need to show, I think we’re just going to let the science dictate, let the trial results come out. But we feel pretty comfortable where we’re at now and pleased with how quickly the trial enrolled.",324.0,148.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.04054054054054054,0.006756756756756757,0.013513513513513514,0.0,0.006756756756756757,0.033783783783783786

I have, if I could, just one question on knees and a quick follow-up, kind of a general strategy question on STELARA and pharma if I could. So on knees in the U.S., obviously, very strong growth. And just wondering if you could, and I think expectations have been strong throughout Q1. I just was wondering if you could maybe give a little bit of color as to what's driving that strength?

And before I turn it to Joe on STELARA, it's really nice to see 12% growth in the U.S. for knees. We haven't seen that in a while. But before I get into specifically knees, maybe just a quick frame on like the quarter. Obviously, first, the industry I think continues to remain strong and growing. Procedures are well in recovery mode. It's awesome to see an 11% operational performance and 6.4 adjusted ops for the first quarter. It was our first quarter with Abiomed. So if you look at them on like-for-like periods, it's a standalone of 22% growth. But I think when I look at all of the math, if you will, for the quarter, what I'm most pleased about is really the balanced growth. And we had our BWI business up 13%. Our global vision, up 8%. And our U.S. business, the largest market, growing north of 8% really fueled by ortho performance, up 6% as well as surgery up 6%. And you hear us talk about this 12 $1 billion platform, but six of those grew double-digit in the United States in the quarter. EMEA was strong, and Asia was a little bit softer again by China. Obviously, Jan and Feb was a bit softer. We were encouraged with March procedures recovered in March. But I would call it three specific innovations, and then I'll go deeper into knees. One is our pulse field ablation. So we're very pleased with the data that an AFib that it's promising. We have four clinical trials ongoing. Two out of the four, we've completed enrollment, and we shared the data from the INSPIRE trial where we met the primary endpoint for both safety and efficacy. Our Abiomed, as we've talked about we're about 90 days in. They continue to advance the innovation pipeline. They're in clinic in four clinical trials to expand new products and to expand indications to get designation. And last, I would say, Matt, we are in all things robotics. So let's talk about VELYS. We just received CE Mark positioning it for expansion to more global markets. Right now, we're in five. But I'm pleased to say that it's now the fastest growing knee robotic system in the United States. We've completed over 20,000 procedures. And we're taking a systems approach to our business in hips to shoulders and the spine. Our Monarch platform is the first and only multispecialty flexible robotics solution with FDA clearance in bronchoscopy as well as endo-urology. We've completed 25,000 procedures and are in clinic right now combining the Monarch Endoluminal navigation with ablation treatment technology on new wave. And just recently, in February, we were -- the first patient received robotic-assisted removal of kidney stone. We're trying to get a higher kidney stone clearance rate than the standard of care. And last, as we talked about our team in Ottava is really progressing significantly, really looking forward to a back half of the year update with the team. So VELYS is really a combination of having access to cementless, both on fixed bearing and rotating platform, revision, our new introduction of the medial stabilized knees and most importantly, not just coupled with the robotic system, VELYS, but coupled with the most modern knee implant in the world.

Thanks for that and congrats on all the innovation and the significant change in momentum across all those businesses. Just a quick question, I guess, I had on pharma was -- I mean, it's a big question, and I think it's on a lot of investors' minds is if we turn into the end of the year and you think about STELARA, and you think about sort of the actions that you expect to take whether organic, the pipeline that you have and as it comes through, and some of these new products launch and get bigger. And then strategic, if you could maybe give a sense of what are your goals over the next 12 months, 18 months as you sort of whether that LOE and what sort of mix of action should we expect you to take to kind of manage through that?

But let me first start with our base assumption, the guidance, which has the underlying assumption that in the U.S., STELARA will lose exclusivity in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter of this year and that's kind of the assumption that we're going on. What I would say is that's somewhat fluid. At this point, there are currently no biosimilars approved. In terms of our planning, we are expecting -- despite learning a lot over the last few years with REMICADE, we're expecting a steeper erosion curve than what was experienced there because this is a self-administered subcutaneous product. There will be multiple competitors on the market at some point, and they may have the affordability of interchangeability. But we may remain committed to growing through the patent exploration. One of the, the great things about our portfolio, whether we're talking within Pharmaceuticals or across the broader businesses, we've got 30 products or platforms that generate over $1 billion in annual revenue. So we're not dependent on one product the way others may have. In terms of unpacking your question maybe a little bit further, I got the sense you were heading towards M&A. Certainly, we always remain vigilant and look at a number of opportunities, making sure there's a strategic fit before we act. If there's a strategic fit, then we're going to look to deploy capital in the way that returns to shareholders to compensate them, quite frankly for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. But we're not going to do anything out of desperation based on the breadth of our product portfolio. We are lucky in that we've got a strong balance sheet to do whatever we'd like, but we want to make sure it makes good strategic and financial sense. So that's probably the best way to answer that. I know Jennifer and the team are very committed to growing through the loss of STELARA whenever that may occur. And the pipeline data that we’re generating now as well as really the early success we’re having in some of these newer products, I think, positions us well to meet those goals.",388.0,187.0,7.0,5.0,14.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0374331550802139,0.026737967914438502,0.0748663101604278,0.0053475935828877,0.016042780748663103,0.0106951871657754

Let me start with the second one first with respect to the Oral IL-23, where our partners at Protagonist announced some, for very encouraging data out of the Phase 2 FRONTIER 1 study. So we do plan to present data from various pre-clinical and clinical studies on this compound at medical conferences beginning in the second quarter of this year. We believe this could be very much an important and underappreciated asset within our immunology portfolio. With respect to the litigation, we thought that this could come up as a question. So we're very pleased to have Andrew White, our Assistant General Counsel, here with us today. But let me say a little maybe a couple of qualitative things from my seat, and then we can have Andrew either clean it up or give you some more specifics. But it is important to note that these cases and we stand by the safety of the product, there's decades of independent research conducted by reputable government agencies, patient advocacy groups as well as academic institutions that support the safety of cosmetic talc. Furthermore, it was only two years ago, [indiscernible] hearing where the judge really restricted the use of many of the claims, supposedly scientific claims that were being made by the plaintiff attorneys in this case and many pundits even classified it as junk (ph) signs at that point. Here, we have the support of 60,000 to 70,000 claimants that would vote for the proposal as it's currently presented. But curiously, we've got a small number of plaintiff's attorneys who don't even want to give their claimants, the right to vote. So we're simply asking that they get the right to vote. Now from my chair as CFO, it is unfortunate that we've got to put dollars towards, quite frankly, baseless scientific claims. However, litigation is inherently costly when it's protracted and it's also inherently uncertain. And when court (ph) proposal really aims to bring certainty in a very efficient manner for all really involved, something that would otherwise take probably decades to resolve. So let me turn it over to Andrew in terms of maybe any of the specifics that you can add.",377.0,185.0,4.0,12.0,7.0,13.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0.021621621621621623,0.06486486486486487,0.03783783783783784,0.07027027027027027,0.005405405405405406,-0.043243243243243246

I heard you on CNBC this morning, and you said you turned from cautious in January to optimistic now about 2023. So I was curious about two things. One, on the guidance you previously expected second half to be better than the first half in MedTech and Pharma because of the growth drivers you outlined on the Q4 call, so what changed there? Why do you expect growth to be more stable through the year? And second, Joe, on the margins. Q1 was up about 60 basis points year-over-year in Q1 on the operating margin, but you expect -- and you expect gross margins to improve through 2023 as inflation wanes.

Responsibly was in front of both cautious as well as optimistic. So we've moved from responsibly cautious to responsibly optimistic. Why do I say that? It's because we did see some dynamics within our P&L, the team's great ability to really manage our resources effectively with the backdrop of really a company separation that could lend itself to some stranded costs. We're managing those extremely well. There is still inflation within the P&L. I don't think we should say that it's now behind us. We have a good data point with respect to where we landed Q1. I'm very pleased with the first quarter results and the strength of that and why we've maybe moved from a little bit more of a consistent approach throughout the year versus a stronger second half from the first half is really around the first quarter results. So in terms of Pharmaceutical pricing, it was still unfavorable as you might expect with respect to Pharmaceutical, but not as unfavorable as we anticipated. And then maybe Ashley can talk here, too.

We're very much looking forward to the data that may read-out later this year with respect to that. In terms of new areas, I know that the teams are looking very much. I would say some of the new areas that we're coming into now would be some of the bispecific antibodies with respect to multiple myeloma rounding out that portfolio. We know how I want to say almost personalized that disease is and having multiple options for treatments and maybe even someday potentially cures certainly lends itself with the multiple options that we have. We're going to be focused on multiple myeloma, obviously, prostate cancer, lung cancer. We're very excited about some of the data that could read out on what I'll call the MedTech, Pharma combo of -- for bladder cancer and with the TARIS device with the drug eluting BALVERSA. So there's multiple plays within oncology, which is now our biggest franchise with immunology in terms of sales contribution to the pharmaceutical success.",221.0,108.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.009259259259259259,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.0,0.009259259259259259

Had a question for Ashley just on the [indiscernible] PFA platform. I was hoping that just get an update on commercial time lines. Anything you can share just in terms of CE Mark and then FDA approvals. And then maybe digging a little bit deeper, just helping us understand. I mean, our expectation is that [indiscernible] will be third to market in the United States, but what percentage of [indiscernible] revenues are levered to the ablation catheter segment within the EP industry? And then what drives your optimism that [indiscernible] will maintain -- be able to maintain [indiscernible] position in the ablation catheter segment?

And we always say at J&J, we're always trying to intercept disease before it advances. And this is one example of managing atrial fibrillation, which is the leading cause of cardiac arrhythmia (ph) and unmanaged, that could lead to a stroke. So what gives us confidence that we can lead and compete and have a source of differentiation, I would say kind of the following. I'd say, one, we have a 20-year track record of being a world leader in cardiac ablation. We have 5,000 plus installed base. We do see the promise of PSA. We are actively engaged in four clinical trials. Two of those trials have completed enrollment. The European and INSPIRE as well as the U.S. We've shared data in February in the international AFib symposium that we met the primary endpoint. And I would tell you, our approach is really what's differentiated, Josh. So we're kind of leveraging a deep expertise and the insights into the various ablation strategies. So we have a portfolio of PFA catheters, which are fully integrated into the [indiscernible] system and it's powered by kind of our true pulse generator. So we really underscore the importance of how important mapping is and vision to know where operators are and what they're doing in the heart anatomy. And kind of the bottom line for us is, we actually think access to radio frequency, which has like 20-plus years of safety and efficacy coupled with the newer generation of PFA is really going to be the winning combo for electrophysiologists. It's really why we are in clinic right now with the dual energy solution because we think it could offer the relative safety of the PFA and really the proven durability of radio frequency. So we're not issuing specific timelines, but you can know that we've completed enrollment in two of those four clinical trials.",334.0,156.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.01282051282051282,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232

So on IMBRUVICA, how do you guys view the impact from the indication withdrawal and is there a risk of other non-CLL indications like follicular being pulled?

So with respect to IMBRUVICA, I would say that we're not expecting any more withdrawals at this point. It is obviously based on our performance, encountering competitive pressures. But it's really the competition that's been the biggest driver in terms of the performance that we're not seeing there, quite frankly. But it's -- the withdrawal was a very small part of our business to begin with, but we don't anticipate other withdrawals at this point. With respect to your second question and supply on CARVYKTI, I would say that you probably did read the announcement recently that we did sign on for additional capacity to scale up some production and increase availability moving forward. The manufacturing is ramping up to supply markets. We have really tremendous demand given some of the data that supports this CARVYKTI, the CAR-T for Johnson & Johnson. And we’re committed to doing everything we can to accelerate our manufacturing abilities to meet that demand. We work in our facility and again continues to progress.

Procedures are accelerating, particularly like even as recently as March in China, as an example, U.S. working through some of the backlog. So I do think that the market is in our favor. But at the same time, I have to give huge acknowledgment to the Orthopaedics team, who has really built a very differentiated portfolio. And they are now participating in the fastest growing segments within the Orthopaedics category. So if the category is going three to four, they're competing in areas that are high-single digit. And what are those areas? It's all things robotics. It's around new sites of care like, ASCs. It's around extremities. I'm very pleased with our recent acquisition of [indiscernible], a foot and ankle. It's what we talked about around revision needs and cementless needs.

This was a strong quarter for Johnson & Johnson with market leading performance, important advances across our innovative pharmaceutical, our MedTech pipelines and a successful initial public offering of Kenvue. We delivered solid sales and earnings growth for the second quarter of 2023, reporting operational sales of 7.5% and adjusted operational EPS growth of 9.7%. These strong results contributed to our confidence in raising our expectations for this year. You may have seen this morning the announcement that we intend to split off Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as the next step in the separation of Kenvue. Joe will provide additional information later in the call. We're excited about entering a new era for Johnson & Johnson one built around science, innovation and technology and strategically focused on pharmaceutical and MedTech, while maintaining our position as the world's largest, most diversified healthcare products company with 25 platforms over $1 billion in annual sales. And on today's call, I would like to share recent highlights and achievements from across the business that have contributed to our year-to-date results, as well as upcoming catalysts that give me great confidence in our near and long-term future performance. Starting with MedTech, for the second quarter of 2023, we generated 14.7% operational and 9.9% adjusted operational growth, which excludes the impact of the Abiomed acquisition. On a pro forma basis using sales publicly reported by Abiomed prior to our acquisition, MedTech grew 10.2%. These strong results continue to show that our efforts to improve the growth of the MedTech business are working. Q2 highlights in Electrophysiology include the publication of clinical data supporting the safety and effectiveness of QDOT, our newest Ablation Catheter for Atrial Fibrillation. In fact, this study demonstrated a clinical success rate of 86%, as well as achieving shorter procedure and fluoroscopy times than ablation with conventional catheters. I'm also happy to share that this month, we completed enrollment in the third clinical study evaluating our pulsed field ablation solutions. The SmartfiRE study evaluates our dual energy catheter, which enables physicians to instantly switch energy source whether radio frequency or pulsed field based on patient needs. The Abiomed integration continued to deliver against planned milestones and is on track across all areas and regions with no disruption to commercial activities or pipeline progression. Second quarter sales of $331 million, compared to Abiomed's public reported sales in the same period last year as a standalone company reflects approximately 20% growth. We also continue to see strong enrollment in the ongoing pivotal clinical trials, which aim to expand the use of our products into new patient populations. We anticipate that heart recovery will become a significant multiyear growth platform for Johnson & Johnson. In orthopedics, the VELYS robotic assisted solution is poised for further acceleration, having recently received CE and CA Mark international approvals. In Surgery, we are pleased with our progression on Ottava, our next generation soft tissue surgical robotic system, and we look forward to providing an investor update later in the year. In Vision, we recently launched products such as ACUVUE OASYS MAX and TECNIS Eyhance and we are performing very well across both contact lenses and surgical vision. Now turning to pharmaceuticals. In the second quarter of the year, we delivered above market operational growth of 6.2%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Of note, our multiple myeloma portfolio has grown more than 30% year-on-year, which includes the acceleration of our newly launched products CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. These new launches along with SPRAVATO are performing very well and are expected to be important contributors to achieving our 2025 sales target. We also achieved important regulatory and operational milestones, including multiple readouts from our pipeline. A few things I’m particularly excited by include: first, the receipt of fast track designation from the U.S. FDA for all three prospective indications for Milvexian, our Factor XI oral anticoagulant in partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb, which has the potential to treat a broader set of patients such as those who currently have limited therapeutic options, due to bleeding risk. Second, the recent submission of a supplemental BLA for CARVYKTI to the FDA and European Commission supported by data from the CARTITUDE-4 study, seeking approval for a new earlier indication in treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Third, the presentation of initial TAR-200 data from the SunRISe-1 study in bladder cancer at the American Urological Association meeting. And finally, we announced positive top line results from the Phase 3 PAPILLON study evaluating RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer with Exon 20 Insertion Mutations. This is the first of several ongoing pivotal Phase 3 studies to read out for RYBREVANT based regimens in EGFR mutated lung cancer. In addition, I want to highlight the Phase 2 study data that we presented earlier this month at the World Congress of Dermatology for JNJ-2113, our Novel Oral IL23 Receptor Antagonist Peptide in Psoriasis. The finding suggests that JNJ-2113 has broad potential across the spectrum of IL23 mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. We are already advancing into Phase 3 in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and initiating a Phase 2b in ulcerative colitis and will continue to assess additional opportunities. We are very excited about the potential of this asset and believe it represents $1 billion plus commercial opportunity. We also continue to defend the intellectual property associated with our medicines, including STELARA. In fact, we have reached settlements regarding our STELARA IP with both Amgen and Alvotech. We expect Amgen to launch in the U.S. on January 1, 2025 and Alvotech to launch in the U.S. on February 21, 2025. In all, our pharmaceutical business delivered very strong results. Our pipeline is progressing well and we continue to be confident in meeting our 2025 sales target of $57 billion. We are excited to enter the back half of the year from a position of strength, and we have high expectations as we evolve to a two sector Johnson & Johnson with a higher growth profile. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Jess to review our financial results in more detail.

Johnson & Johnson continues to own 89.6% of total outstanding shares of Kenvue’s common stock and remains the majority shareholder. Therefore, the following financial results continue to include the consumer health business with the 10.4% of consumer health's net earnings no longer attributed to Johnson & Johnson being adjusted for in other income and expense from the date of the IPO through the end of the quarter. Starting with Q2 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $25.5 billion for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 6.3% versus the second quarter of 2022. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.5%, as currency had a negative impact of 1.2 points. In the U.S., sales increased 10.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 2.2%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 4.7% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.5 points. Operational sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth with 6.2% worldwide, 8% in the U.S. and 4.4% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.1 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.96 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.80 a year ago. Excluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.4 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.80, representing increases of 6.5% and 8.1%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.7%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2022, and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with the Pharmaceuticals segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.7 billion increased 3.1%, with growth of 9.2% in the U.S. and a decline of 4% outside the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 3.8% as currency had a negative impact of 0.7 points. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, Worldwide operational sales growth was 6.2% with growth of 9.9% in the U.S. and growth of 1.5% outside the U.S. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, were negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points, due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe. Pharmaceutical growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products with nine assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA with increases of 23.4% and 26.9%, respectively. STELARA grew 8%, driven by market growth and IBD share gains in the U.S., partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and increased rebates. TREMFYA grew 18.9%, driven by market growth and share gains in the U.S., partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. Growth of 16.5% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains in the U.S. and market growth. Turning to newly launched products. We continue to make progress on our launch of CARVYKTI and continue to expand access and reimbursement for SPRAVATO. We are also encouraged by the early success of our launch of TECVAYLI, sales of which are included in other oncology. Total pharmaceutical sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity in REMICADE and ZYTIGA, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. I will now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.8 billion increased 12.9% with growth of 14.6% in the U.S. and 11.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 14.7% as currency had a negative impact of 1.8 points. Abiomed contributed 4.8% to operational growth. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 9.9%. Sales in the second quarter accelerated sequentially from Q1 for all MedTech businesses driven by global procedure growth, recovery in China, continued uptake of recently launched products and commercial execution, partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of volume based procurement in China, as well as supply constraints. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 56.9%, which includes $331 million related to Abiomed. Electrophysiology is a major contributor to the growth with a double-digit increase of 25.9%. This reflects strong growth in all regions, including Europe, driven by our comprehensive portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RS catheter. Orthopedics operational growth of 5.7%, reflects strong procedure recovery, success of recently launched products, such as the enhanced shorter portfolio, as well as global expansion of our digital solutions, such as VELYS Robotic assisted solution. Growth was partially offset by the impact of volume-based procurement in China and continued supply challenges primarily in hips. Operational growth of 8.4% and surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China and supply challenges. Global growth of 6.9% in vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses and other, as well as strength of new products, including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses and TECNIS Eyhance our monofocal intraocular lens and surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by strategic portfolio choices and supply challenges. Although these continue to improve. Moving to the Consumer Health segment. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $4 billion increased 5.4% with growth of 6% in the U.S. and 5% outside the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 7.7% as currency had a negative impact of 2.3 points. Sales in the second quarter accelerated sequentially from Q1 for all consumer health franchises, primarily driven by strategic price increases and growth in OTC globally, due to strong pain performance, and cold, cough and flu season. Excluding the impact of strategic portfolio decisions and sales of personal care products in Russia, volume across all consumer franchises was relatively flat on strong price actions. For more detailed information, please visit investors.kenvue.com. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for second quarter of 2023, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold leveraged by 80 basis points, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network related costs in the pharmaceutical business, partially offset by commodity inflation in the consumer and MedTech businesses. Selling, marketing and administrative margins deleveraged 20 basis points, driven by incremental costs to support the standalone consumer health business, partially offset by proactive management of costs. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 15% of sales this quarter. The $3.8 billion invested was a 3.4% increase versus the prior year. The other income and expense line was income of $60 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to an expense of $273 million in the second quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by favorable litigation settlements, lower litigation expense, and lower unrealized losses on securities, partially offset by higher COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related cost. And as previously mentioned, the 10.4% of consumer health earnings that are no longer attributable to Johnson & Johnson, which resulted in a $37 million reduction in consolidated earnings. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 23.9% versus 17.6% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by 2023 tax cost incurred as part of the planned separation of the consumer health business, due to the internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. Excluding special items the effective tax rate was 16.6% versus 15.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming second quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 34% to 34.6%, primarily driven by favorable product and patient mix, partially offset by unfavorable segment mix and commodity inflation. Pharmaceutical margins improved from 42% to 42.7%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix, sales, marketing and administrative expense leverage, and R&D portfolio prioritization, partially offset by higher milestone payments. MedTech margins improved from 26.5% to 28.6%, driven by favorable intellectual property related litigation settlements and cost management initiatives, partially offset by commodity inflation. Finally, consumer health margins declined from 25.9% to 23.5%, due to incremental costs to support the standalone consumer health business, foreign exchange impacts, and commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. It is important to highlight that the adjusted income before tax for the consumer health business as reported by Johnson & Johnson defers from the financial results reported by Kenvue Inc. this morning. The difference is primarily driven by incremental costs required to run Kenvue as an independent company. Additional differences also exist on an after tax basis, due to the application of different tax rates. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson second quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.

JNJ,2023-07-20,2023-07-20,,2023-07-20,2023-07-20T08:30:00-04:00,0,2023-07-20,prepared,,Joe Wolk,"Thank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As previously shared, we reported particularly strong results across all segments for the second quarter and the first-half of 2023. During the second quarter, adjusted operational sales growth by pharmaceuticals excluding COVID-19 revenue accelerated 6.2% over the first quarter of 2023. Similarly, on a sequential basis, MedTech operational sales increased to 4.5% over an already strong first quarter. During the first-half of the year we executed against our long-term business strategy and achieved key clinical and regulatory milestones. These advancements provide a strong foundation for long-term growth and are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our talented colleagues around the world. We also made considerable progress toward the separation of Kenvue. On May 8th, as partial consideration for the transfer of the Consumer Health business, Kenvue paid $13.2 billion to Johnson & Johnson from the net proceeds of the initial public offering and debt financing transactions in connection with the separation. Today, we were pleased to announce an update on our next step toward the separation of Kenvue, subject to market conditions, our intention is to split off Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as our next step in the separation. As part of the proposed exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson's shareholders will have the choice to exchange all some or none of their shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock for shares of Kenvue common stock subject to the terms of an offer. We believe a split off is the most advantageous form of separation for Johnson & Johnson, Kenvue and our shareholders, specifically an exchange offer provides Johnson & Johnson the potential opportunity to acquire a large number of outstanding shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock at one time in a tax free manner for U.S. federal income tax purposes without reducing overall cash or future financial flexibility. Further, following the completion of the exchange offer, Kenvue would most likely have a shareholder base that would have made the election to own its shares. The exact timing of our decision to launch an exchange offer will, as stated earlier, depend on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as the coming days. Offer terms for the exchange inclusive of applicable discounts, as well as the duration of the exchange tender period would be set upon launch. We understand that you may have questions on this process. At this point, there are no additional details about the contemplated split off to share, but we are committed to providing timely updates as appropriate. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We ended the second quarter with approximately $29 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $46 billion of debt for a net debt position of $17 billion, inclusive of approximately $7 billion of 10 Kenvue net debt. Free cash flow through the second quarter was approximately $5.4 billion, compared to $8.1 billion in the prior year. The second quarter reflects elevated tax payments of approximately $2 billion related to TCJA and past audit related matters. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with continued investment in our business being the highest priority to drive new and better solutions for patients, followed by dividends, increasing on an annual basis, adding strategic opportunities for inorganic growth, and share repurchases when attractive. Our R&D investment in the first-half of 2023 was $7.4 billion or approximately 15% of sales. This includes external investments such as our recently announced partnership with Cellular Biomedicine Group on two next generation CAR-Ts for the treatment of B-cell malignancies further broadening our cell therapy portfolio. In April, we announced our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases and in combination with the completion of our $5 billion share repurchase program authorized by the Board in September of 2022, and completed earlier this year, we returned $8.5 billion to shareholders in the first-half of 2023. Let's discuss our outlook for the balance of 2023. Before I get into the specifics of guidance, in light of the potential Kenvue split off transaction I will remind you that our updated full-year guidance today continues to include results from the Consumer Health Business given Johnson & Johnson remains the majority shareholder of Kenvue. I suspect you already know this, but it would not be accurate to subtract any guidance provided separately by Kenvue from total Johnson & Johnson guidance and assume that the resulting total reflects guidance for the new Johnson & Johnson. When Johnson & Johnson is no longer the majority shareholder of Kenvue, we will provide timely updated new Johnson & Johnson guidance that will reflect among other things the removal of Consumer Health's current contribution to Johnson & Johnson's performance, as well as any updates to Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count. So with that context, moving on to our full-year guidance. Based on the strong results delivered in the quarter, like we did in April, we are again raising full-year operational sales and EPS guidance, despite some strategic items not accretive to EPS as detailed on this schedule. Specifically the lost income related to the approximate 10% non-controlling interest in Kenvue and the acquired in process research and development cost related to our investment in Cellular Biomedicine Group. We now expect operational sales growth for the full-year 2023 to be in the range of 7% to 8% or up $1.4 billion in the range of $99.3 billion to $100.3 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 6% to 7%. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we noted that we utilized the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar at $1.10. The Euro spot rate as of mid-last week remains at $1.10. However, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus other select currencies such as the Won and the Yen. As such, we now estimate a negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 500 basis points resulting in estimated reported sales growth between 6.5% to 7.5%, compared to 2022 with a midpoint of $99.3 billion. Regarding other lines on the P&L, we now anticipate a slight improvement to our adjusted pretax operating margin driven by expense management. We have reduced our other income estimate to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, primarily related to the company’s 10.4% non-controlling interest in Kenvue. Regarding interest income and expense, we now anticipate a reduction of net interest expense to the range of a $150 million to $250 million, due to interest income on the net proceeds linked to the Kenvue separation. And finally, based on current tax law, we are maintaining our effective tax rate estimate in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. These changes result in us increasing our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance by $0.10 per share to a range of $10.60 to $10.70 or $10.65 at the midpoint on a constant currency basis. Constant currency growth of 5% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year assumes no additional foreign exchange impact. As such, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year increases by $0.10 per share to a range of $10.70 to $10.80 or $10.75 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 6% at the midpoint. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, let me offer some qualitative considerations to support your modeling. In MedTech, we continue to anticipate stable procedure volumes and healthcare staffing levels in the back half of the year with normal seasonality. We expect continued competitive performance attributable to commercial execution recently launched products and improvement in supply. Headwinds from volume based procurement in China, as well as potential impacts from international sanctions in Russia are expected to be higher in the second-half than the first-half of the year. In Pharmaceuticals, we continue to expect to deliver our 12th consecutive year of above market growth in 2023, driven by key assets and continued uptake of our newly launched products. We expect continued strong growth in the back half of the year slightly higher than the first-half. When modeling consumer health growth rates in 2023, it's important to take into consideration prior year comparisons with lapping price increases in the back half of the year. Given the strong momentum in our pharmaceutical business and the upcoming clinical milestones mentioned earlier we remain very confident in our ability to meet our 2025 pharmaceutical sales target of $57 billion. Looking ahead, we have many important catalysts for the remainder of the year that can drive meaningful near and long-term value. Beyond the separation, in the near-term, we are continuing to drive performance in MedTech with better commercial execution and recently launched innovative products being a significant factor in driving the continued higher growth trajectory across the MedTech business. Many of the solutions mentioned are early in their commercialization, which means there are still significant opportunity ahead. For example, in electrophysiology we are excited to begin the commercialization of the QDOT MICRO Catheter in the U.S. during the second-half of this year. In Orthopaedics, the VELYS robotic assisted solution, recently received regulatory approvals in Europe, and we plan to launch it in key European countries by the end of this year. And in Vision, we are seeing the benefits of our recently launched innovations such as ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day multifocal, which is driving Johnson & Johnson's market share growth in the large and growing presbyopia market. We look forward to continued growth from this and other recent Vision launches. Related to our pharmaceutical business, we are excited about upcoming advancements in our pipeline with a number of important regulatory and clinical milestones for our key future assets, including on the regulatory front there is expected approval of [daratumumab] (ph) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Clinically, we expect a Phase 3 data for TREMFYA for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The results of the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in front line non-small cell lung cancer with the opportunity to potentially present that data at an upcoming major medical meeting. Phase 1 data for TAR-210 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, and Phase 2 data for Nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. A couple of other items to highlight. In case you missed them, we recently published our Health For Humanity report our U.S. Pharmaceutical pricing transparency report and our U.S. patent table, all of which can be found on our website. Also, a reminder that we will be hosting an enterprise business review featuring both Pharmaceutical and MedTech at the New York Stock Exchange on December 5th. I'll conclude my prepared remarks by reiterating that we have had a strong first-half of the year both financially and operationally and we expect to continue to build upon that momentum in the second-half of this year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Erik Haas.",1810.0,955.0,32.0,6.0,21.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,4.0,2.0,0.033507853403141365,0.0062827225130890054,0.02198952879581152,0.005235602094240838,0.0020942408376963353,0.027225130890052355

On Tuesday, July 18th in the case of Valadez v Johnson & Johnson, a jury in Alameda County, California ruled in favor of the plaintiff on this talc product liability claims. We intend to pursue an appeal based on the erroneous rulings by the trial judge that prevented us from sharing with the jury critical facts that demonstrate that plaintiff's exceedingly rare form of mesothelioma was not caused by baby powder. Without the benefit of that evidence, the jury rendered a verdict that is irreconcilable with a decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming Johnson's baby powder is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer. The research, clinical evidence in over 40-years of studies by independent medical experts around the world continue to support the safety of our cosmetic talc. The verdict award will not be paid, while the bankruptcy proceeding continues, and this decision has absolutely no impact on that process, which has the support of lawyers representing the majority of claimants. We remain focused on all claimants having the opportunity to vote and decide for themselves on a -- our plan to compensate them in a timely and efficient manner. Looking ahead with respect to the bankruptcy re-filing by LTL, the bankruptcy judge is expected to rule by August 2nd the motion to dismiss hearing that took place in the last week of June. In addition, a hearing on the motion for LTL's proposed, reorganization plan and voting procedures process, and the path forward is scheduled for August 22nd.

So this is a continuation of the sustained improvement in our performance that we have had in the last couple of years in which we have grown at or above our competitive composite. When we think about the dynamics that are driving our growth, which are multiple. One is the recovery in the overall market procedures, which is helping our improved commercial execution and very especially the cadence and flow of new product launches that we are having in the market.

So appreciate what you said around the Kenvue and Cellular Biomedicine dynamics. But I'm curious about STELARA, because you have the two settlements now. I don't think there's any chance for having a biosimilar enter this year. And I think before, you had expected that. So I'm curious what your expectations are now in terms of biosimilar entry before Amgen? And how does that impact sort of your guidance expectation for this year, and if you want to comment on sort of next year or sort of how it might impact 2025 with the $57 billion there? And then one also, other one if I could just on MARIPOSA, we've been getting a lot of questions just sort of what's changed there? I know before, the study is supposed to end next year. We obviously heard about the interim on your last earnings call. But then in the last few weeks, it sounds like there's a chance we'll get the data sooner this year than you may be able to present it.

With respect to STELARA this year, there won't be a significant impact. As you can imagine, most of that business was contracted for the full-year about this time last year.

We -- this is driven by market growth, which we believe it's also slightly elevated this year due to the clearing of the COVID-19 backlog. And at the same time, as I commented to our improved commercial execution and the introduction of new products. Of note, of our $12 billion platforms in MedTech, all of them have grown during the first-half of the year. And we are being quite successful in introducing some important new products in all segments of our business. For example, if I start with electrophysiology, that grew north of 25% in the quarter. We have introduced a new mapping catheter OCTARAY and also a new treatment catheter QDOT, which, as you know, Joanne, we presented results about QDOT. So we increased efficacy and procedure efficiency, too. If we move into Vision, we are in the middle of the launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX, which is doing well and also the launch of our TECNIS Eyhance, the first mono-focal intraocular lens, which is progressing also very well. Moving into Orthopaedics. The good news is that we have received CE Mark and CA Mark for our Robotic-Assisted System VELYS. And we continue to have an enhanced portfolio of knees and hips with our Cementless knees, the Medial Stabilized and in the area of hips with hip navigation and the recent addition of CUPTIMIZE and we see our market position there also progressing. And moving forward, we will continue to see good evolution also in Orthopaedics. Finally, in Surgery, we continue to enhance our endocutter and our energy portfolio with the launch of ENSEAL jaw curved and also with the launch of ECHELON 3000 in the stapler side. So overall, good reception of our new products. That portend well for a continuation of growth, as I said before, in the second half of the year. And we look forward also to the different readouts of our PFA pipeline, which as we have announced, we have completed the enrollment of our dual energy catheter, which is going to be offering the physicians the comfort of a catheter that is the most well used with the option of having both radio frequency and PFA to adapt to every patient anatomy. And then on the robotic side, we will provide you more updates on our progress on OTTAVA, our soft tissue robotics system, before the end of the year as we committed. And we have also good news on our Monarch system that has already started with the first patient treated in removal of kidney stone. So overall, good progress during the year.

And then we'll always be on the hunt for real good strategic opportunities that fit with either the clinical or science expertise we have or commercial capabilities that we can offer that drive more value out of a potential asset in our hands than where it currently resides.

Just the first one is, would love just some additional views on the $57 billion pharma target by 2025. It seems like between the pipeline progress we've seen this year and the STELARA settlements, you've had some clear positive updates over the past few months. And I'm just wondering, just level of confidence in that target, and has that increased as we've gone through this year? And then my second question was just for Erik on talc. Is there any update in terms of the number of plaintiffs where you have an agreement on the settlement terms relative to where we stood with the comments in April? And just where you stand right now relative to that 75% threshold you ultimately need?

We have always been confident on the fact that we will reach our $57 billion target by 2025 as we announced back in 2021. And certainly, what we are seeing now increases and reinforces and enhances our confidence. On one hand, you're seeing the progression of our pharmaceutical portfolio and our existing products with excellent results in DARZALEX, TREMFYA and ERLEADA, also in our pulmonary hypertension franchise and in our long-acting injectable antipsychotic franchise, which are key products in this period. We are very pleased with the trajectory of our new product launches, including CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and SPRAVATO. If I focus on CARVYKTI, you see a clear improvement quarter-over-quarter in CARVYKTI, which reflects improvements in supply. In TECVAYLI, you see also a clear improvement of note. When we look at the TECVAYLI launch, align data with DARZALEX in the addressable patient population. TECVAYLI it’s having a faster introduction. And finally, SPRAVATO, which is doing well. And now we see SPRAVATO as a $1 billion plus product, and you're seeing the results this quarter also reaching close to $170 million. If we look at our pipeline and the products of the pipeline that are going to impacting this period, we are expecting the PDUFA date of talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific antibody, which is going to give another option in the treatment of multiple myeloma. And we continue to progress and execute well in some of the key products in our pipeline. I commented on RYBREVANT and the combination of Lazertinib, as you know. We received fast track destination for the three key indications of milvexian, our Factor XI oral anticoagulant that we are working in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. We presented very positive data about TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in meeting in the American Urological Association. And we also -- when it comes to CARVYKTI, we were very pleased to show the data on CARTITUDE-4. We are filing the BLA now, both in Europe and in the U.S. And we are expecting to show you some data on nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. We also have already presented in hemolytic disease of the features of the new wall. So in every angle of the products that we highlighted as the core products of our pipeline, we are executing well. Plus we recently presented in the World Congress of Dermatology our data in our oral IL-23 receptor antagonist peptide, which show great efficacy in psoriasis. And we have announced plans to continue developing into psoriasis and also a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis. So overall, when I look at the picture for 2025, we have increased confidence based on our portfolio, in our new product launches and how we are executing on our pipeline. But now I would like to look even beyond ‘25 if you allow me, Chris, because 2025 is very close. It's only three years from now. So what I think is what you are seeing with this renewal of our portfolio is a very strong position for Johnson & Johnson in Pharmaceuticals beyond 2025. And that's something that we need to highlight, and I think it's important for everybody to recognize. This is going to put us in a great position beyond 2025.",549.0,232.0,12.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.05172413793103448,0.004310344827586207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04741379310344827

The most recent update comes from the hearing on the motions to dismiss that finished on June 30th. And I would refer you to the post-trial findings of fact and conclusions in law that were filed last night that really detailed the evidentiary record that was elicited during the hearing. Based upon that testimony that was elicited and the evidence that went in, we are now looking at approximately 60,000 claimants in support or lawyers who represent 60,000 claimants in support of the plan and lawyers who represent about 40,000 claimants in opposition.

I had two, I was wondering, Joaquin, we've talked a lot about the myeloma market evolution over the last decade or so. J&J has been a leader there. This is a $20 billion market. You obviously have a number of different options now for patients, including TECVAYLI most recently and talquetamab with upcoming PDUFA date. So I guess my question is just top down, what prevents you from capturing a majority share of that $20 billion market? And then, Joe, a question for you on margins post Kenvue. Any early idea you can give us in terms of how that structure could evolve post the full separation?",117.0,49.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.061224489795918366,0.02040816326530612,0.0,0.02040816326530612,-0.061224489795918366

As a matter of fact, our aspiration in myeloma is that with the portfolio that we have today with DARZALEX, TECVAYLI, talquetamab and CARVYKTI, we would be in a position to have three out of every four patients starting in Janssen containing regimen by the end of this decade. So that's our aspiration in myeloma. Our aspiration is that there is a Janssen regimen for every line of therapy and a Janssen treatment for every patient irrespective of their characteristics. And that's the way we are planning our development. Certainly, DARZALEX being a backbone of therapy, first line and also in combination with multiple agents and then sequencing into CARVYKTI and talquetamab and TECVAYLI, which we are studying in combination with DARZALEX and also in combination among each other and sequencing among them. So ultimately, our goal when it comes to multiple myeloma is to be able to sequence our medicines, combine them in a way that we are changing the treatment paradigm from treating to progression to treating to cure. And that is a big, big, big plus in our portfolio. And as I have commented often, multiple myeloma is the core of our Pharmaceutical franchise and the number one growth driver that is going to be for 2025 and beyond. There's more factors that give us optimism about the business potential of this area is that as we combine and as we seek those treatments, the treatment duration itself is going to be significantly increased. So we overall foresee great patient and growth opportunity as we look to combine all these modalities, as I said, in order to be able to convert multiple myeloma into a chronic disease.",299.0,121.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024793388429752067,0.01652892561983471,0.0,0.0,0.008264462809917356,0.008264462809917356

And specifically, I think you're getting at the heart of the potential deleverage that could occur with the separation once Kenvue is on its own entirely. You may recall a couple of quarters ago on one of these calls, we said that there was potentially $500 million to $750 million of deleverage in SG&A. We embarked on an initiative, and I guess the benchmarks would suggest companies usually take about two to three years to get those costs out of their system. Last summer, we really embarked on a project to eliminate those costs in a much faster cadence. And I would say of that $500 million to $750 million, there's a small fraction that may remain, and we're still working to eliminate that. So you should expect as you're modeling no deleveraging or very, very little deleveraging from the Kenvue separation.",151.0,71.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.028169014084507043,0.056338028169014086,0.0,0.0,-0.028169014084507043

And I know you directed the question to me, and I'll answer with one word. I would say our appetite is pretty voracious at this point. But I'll leave it to Joaquin with respect to the size of the deals. I don't think it -- unequivocally doesn't change, whether it's big or small, it has to be a really good strategic fit utilizing the expertise and capabilities that we have and has to provide financial value.

And before I go there, let me say that the Abiomed integration is progressing really well. The growth of Abiomed, it's been 20% on the quarter and we continue to move forward with the enrollment in the key PMA studies, PROTECT and STEMI DTU as well as the Impella ECP. So everything is moving well according to plan in the Abiomed integration. And we are increasingly convinced that this is going to be a key component of our MedTech strategy in becoming a leader in heart recovery. So when it comes to M&A, look, we continue to look for opportunities. And our number one criteria in looking for opportunities is the medical innovation, how they improve patient care, how do we see the science behind the product. So we are agnostic in that sense to MedTech and Pharmaceuticals. It's all about identifying areas that are going to have a significant impact in patient care. When it comes to MedTech, certainly, as we have commented, we are continuing to look forward for opportunities to grow into areas that are close to where we are today. Vision, cardiovascular obviously, surgery too and also opportunities in certain high-growth segments of Orthopaedics. And we normally will continue to look for these opportunities, trying to have a good return on capital, as well as things that are close to our existing expertise. When it comes to Pharma, our history in tuck-ins, in license and collaboration has been very successful. As a matter of fact, external innovation represents about 50% of our pipeline. And while we will continue to look for opportunities like we have done now with Cellular Biomedicines and the agreement that we have too in CAR-T, we are not averse to other transactions of larger size. Evidently both in MedTech and in pharma, we are very disciplined with our capital allocation. And all our transactions will have to clear certain financial milestones for us to be able to move on.

Obviously, we remain very concerned about the government price-setting environment that the IRA creates, which we believe creates a significant disincentive to innovation without addressing the core problem, which is patient access. So it is a significant concern for us. And that's one of the reasons, as we commented earlier, that we have filed a lawsuit versus the IRA. So that's important for us. Then when it comes to the actual business impact, I think it's still early to be able to calculate it, given the fact that many of the rules and procedures are still in flux. So it would be too much to be able to try to anticipate that. In our case, when we look at Johnson & Johnson, relatively speaking towards the industry based on our diversification between MedTech and Pharma and also the diversification of our Pharma portfolio, we feel that we are well positioned competitively to continue to grow way beyond the second-half of this decade. So we remain concerned. But at the same time, we think we are prepared to be able to manage successfully any situation coming from that relative to other industry players. The second question was about CARVYKTI. As I commented earlier, we are working to improve CARVYKTI supply, which is very important. You've seen that improvement in our sales in the second quarter. We are working in different ways. One is we are increasing capacity. We have internalized the production of lentivirus now. And also, we are in the process of increasing the number of slots internally. And also, we have reached agreements with other companies like Novartis to continue to increase capacity. So we are going to be in the trajectory of increasing capacity gradually in order to be able to eventually meet the demand that exists in CARVYKTI. As far as reaching to other patient populations, the CARVYKTI 4, it's already been filed. And it's moving CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy, and we are also working in first line with CARVYKTI 5 and CARVYKTI -- excuse me, with CARTITUDE-5 and CARTITUDE-6. So we are clearly intending to move CARVYKTI through CARTITUDE-4, CARTITUDE-5, and CARTITUDE-6 into earlier lines of therapy.

As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording and are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2022 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SECs website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda. I will start by reviewing the third quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk, our CFO will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and updated guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions. Joaquin Duato, our chairman and CEO; John Reed, and Ahmet Tezel, our Innovative Medicine and MedTech R&D leaders, as well as Erik Haas, our VP of Litigation, will be joining us for Q&A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. As a reminder, on August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson announced the final results of the exchange offer and completion of the separation of Kenvue Inc. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. We will report the consumer health financial results as discontinued operations. Additionally, going forward, the pharmaceutical segment will be referred to as innovative medicine. Starting with Q3 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 6.8% versus the third quarter of 2022. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 6.4% as currency had a positive impact of 0.4 points. In the U.S., sales increased 11.1%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 1.6%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 0.7% with currency positively impacting our reported OUS results by 0.9 points. It is important to note that operational sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA. Excluding the net impact of acquisition and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 4.9% worldwide, 8.9% in the U.S., and 0.3% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.69 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.62 a year ago. Excluding after-tax and tangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.66, representing increases of 14.1% and 19.3% respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13.9%. I will now comment on business sales performance. Unless otherwise stated percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2022 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with innovative medicine. Worldwide innovative medicine sales of $13.9 billion, increased 5.1% with growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and a decline of 2.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 4.3% as currency had a positive impact of 0.8 points. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth was 8.2%, with growth of 10.9% in the U.S. and growth of 4.3% outside of the U.S. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, were negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points, due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe. Innovative medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from a recently launched products with 11 assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA with increases of 20.7% and 27% respectively, due to continued share gains and market growth. Within immunology, we saw growth in STELARA and TREMFYA, with increases of 15.8% and 21.5% respectively. This growth was predominantly driven by favorable patient mix and market growth. Turning to newly launched products, we continue to make progress on our launches of CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO. We are also encouraged by the early success of our launches of TECVAYLI and TALVEY, sales of which are driving the growth and other oncology. We expect to begin disclosing TECVAYLI sales in Q1 2024. Total innovative medicine sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA and REMICADE, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales, due to competitive pressures. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.5 billion increased 10% with growth of 11.6% in the U.S., and 8.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 10.4% as currency had a negative impact of 0.4 points. Abiomed contributed 4.6% to operational growth, excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 6%. On a pro forma basis, utilizing sales in the prior year from Abiomed as a standalone company, MedTech's growth for the quarter would be 6.4%. MedTech was negatively impacted across all platforms by international sanctions in Russia worth approximately 60 basis points in volume-based procurement in China, primarily in five MedTech platforms: Spine, Trauma, Endocutters, Energy, and Electrophysiology. As communicated last quarter, we saw the return to more normalized seasonality with moderate deceleration in the third quarter. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 48.1%, which includes $311 million related to Abiomed. This reflects growth in Abiomed patient procedures in the high-teens and continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 technology in surgery. Electrophysiology is a major contributor to this growth with a double-digit increase of 20.3%. This reflects strong growth in all regions, including Europe, driven by our global market leading portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RF ablation and OPTRELL Mapping Catheters. Operational growth of 3.2% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China and supply challenges. Global growth of 5.4% in vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses and other, as well as strength of new products including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses and TECNIS Eyhance, our monofocal interocular lens and surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by strategic portfolio choices and supply challenges, although these continue to improve. Global vision growth was negatively impacted by 100 basis points, due to the Blink divestiture. Orthopedics operational growth of 2.6% reflects procedure growth, success of recently launched products, such as the global expansion of our VELYS digital solutions, and expansion in ambulatory surgical centers, partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China in Spine and Trauma. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2023, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed, compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of product sold margin was flat due to favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network related exit costs in the innovative medicine business, partially offset by commodity inflation, unfavorable product mix, and restructuring related to excess inventory costs in the MedTech business. Selling, marketing, and administrative margins deleveraged 40 basis points, driven by increased expenses across the enterprise. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing $3.4 billion or 16.2% of sales this quarter. R&D was leveraged by 120 basis points, primarily driven by portfolio prioritization, partially offset by higher milestone payments in the innovative medicine business. Additionally, IPR&D impairments were $206 million in the third quarter of 2023. Interest income was $182 million in the third quarter of 2023, as compared to $99 million of income in the third quarter of 2022. The increase in income was driven by higher interest rates earned on cash balances, partially offset by higher interest rates on debt balances. The other income and expense line was an expense of $499 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared to an expense of $226 million in the third quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by higher unrealized mark-to-market losses on public securities partially offset by the lower COVID-19 vaccine-related exit costs and lower litigation expense. Restructuring in the third quarter was $158 million, primarily related to the innovative medicine restructuring program announced in the first quarter. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 17.4% versus 16.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by a non-deductible, non-recurring pre-tax charge that occurred in the current quarter. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 15.6% versus 15.9% in the same period last year. As a result of the completion of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson is presenting the consumer health business financial results as discontinuing operations, including a gain of approximately $21 billion. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax and separation-related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 35.3% to 37.6%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and innovative medicine, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and commodity inflation in MedTech. Innovative medicine margins improved from 41.4% to 45.4%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and R&D portfolio prioritization. MedTech margins declined from 25% to 24.7%, primarily driven by commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix partially offset by a divestiture gain. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson third quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk.

This quarter's call marks a new era for Johnson & Johnson with a sharpened focus on Innovative Medicine and MedTech. What has remained consistent is our Credo and our commitment to patients. We are privileged to build upon our 137-year legacy of tackling the world's most complex healthcare challenges and helping patients with serious unmet health needs around the world. As we look forward, we are well positioned to grow our business and innovate across the spectrum of healthcare. We are excited about what's ahead and what we can achieve in the future. Before we dive into our performance, I want to briefly touch upon other items important to our business. The first is a brief recap of the Kenvue separation, which was formally completed during the quarter. The transaction was executed within our targeted timeframe and under budget, while generating significant cash and value for our shareholders. Through the separation, we raised $13.2 billion in cash proceeds through the Kenvue Debt Offering and IPO. We reduced Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count by 191 million shares, or approximately 7%, without the use of cash and in a tax-free manner. We maintained our current quarterly dividend per share and we retained approximately 180 million shares of Kenvue stock that provides cash proceeds for future flexibility. We will see the full impact to EPS of the share reduction in 2024. Another item warranting comment is the Inflation Reduction Act. We continue to believe the IRA's price setting provisions are damaging to innovation and will prevent the delivery of transformative therapies and cures to patients. As we await adjudication of legal proceedings initiated by of us and others, we did submit all requested information in compliance with CMS' drug price setting scheme to continue supporting patients' access to our medicines that help them stay healthy and live longer. Moving to segment highlights in the quarter, as Jessica previously shared, our teams delivered strong results in the third quarter, while continuing to advance our pipeline to enhance future growth. Within the innovative medicine business, two important regulatory milestones were announced during the quarter. Specifically, we received European Commission approval for a reduced biweekly dosing frequency for TECVAYLI for eligible patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. And U.S. FDA and European Commission approval of TALVEY, a first-in-class, bi-specific therapy for the treatment of patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma. Regarding clinical data, we are excited to have an unprecedented seven late breaking abstracts, including three featured in the Presidential Symposium being presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology meeting this weekend. Highlights will include the results from all three Phase III studies of RYBREVANT in lung cancer, including MARIPOSA, MARIPOSA II, and PAPILLON. Additionally, updated data from the Sunrise 1 study of TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer will be shared, as well as the first ever data of TAR-210 in patients with FGFR mutations. We also look forward to presenting Phase II data for Nipocalimab and rheumatoid arthritis at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting in November, and have already launched a Phase II combination study NRA. Lastly, we plan to initiate multiple clinical development programs for our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113. This includes the initiation of the ANTHEM Phase 2B study in ulcerative colitis, which will begin this month, and the Phase III clinical program titled Iconic for adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis expected to begin in November. Moving to MedTech, notable highlights in the quarter include significant advancements in electrophysiology across our cardiac ablation platform. We received FDA clearance from multiple atrial fibrillation ablation products in our portfolio to be used in a workflow without fluoroscopy. This FDA indication is unique to Johnson & Johnson and is a significant advancement where caregivers and patients are not exposed to harmful fluoroscopy-related radiation during their cardiac ablation procedures. It also allows for the removal of heavy lead protective equipment that may lead to orthopedic complications for care teams. In pulse field ablation, we have completed our clinical trial in Europe and submitted for CE mark for our VARIPULSE Catheter. We expect the completion for our U.S. VARIPULSE study to occur in the fourth quarter. We are also simultaneously advancing clinical studies for two additional pulse field ablation catheters, the STSF dual energy catheter, capable of delivering both PF and RF energy through the same device, and Omnipulse, a large tip focal catheter. Beyond electrophysiology, we have completed enrollment in the Abiomed Impella ECP clinical study, a landmark pivotal trial designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Impella ECP during high-risk PCI procedures. Impella ECP is the world's smallest heart pump and the only heart pump compatible with small bore access and closure techniques. While not a clinical advancement, we have also taken steps in the quarter to improve MedTech's future margin profile, implementing a restructuring program designed to simplify and focus the operations of our orthopedic business. As part of this two-year program, we expect to exit certain markets and product lines across that business. We anticipate some short-term modest revenue disruption in orthopedics of approximately $250 million in total over the next two years, given the market and product line exits, but believe these actions will improve our ability to meet demand, resulting in accelerated growth and enhanced profitability. The program is expected to be completed by the end of 2025, with total program costs estimated to be between $700 million and $800 million. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We ended the third quarter with approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $30 billion of debt for a net debt position of $6 billion. Free cash flow year-to-date through the third quarter was approximately $12 billion, up from the $5 billion we reported year-to-date in the second quarter of 2023. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to execute a strategic and disciplined approach utilizing our strong credit profile and robust free cash flow generation to prioritize continued investment in our business, increasing dividends on an annual basis, executing strategic business development initiatives for inorganic growth, and executing share repurchases when appropriate. Moving onto our 2023 guidance update. Based on the strong results delivered in the quarter and the first nine months of this year, balanced with planned investments in the fourth quarter, we are raising the ranges for full-year sales and EPS guidance. We now expect operational sales growth for the full-year 2023 to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.0%, or up $600 million at the midpoint in the range of $84.4 billion to $84.8 billion on a constant currency basis and adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 7.2% to 7.7%. Just a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any COVID-19 vaccine revenue. While we do not speculate on future currency movements utilizing the euro spot rate as of last week at 1.06, we now anticipate an incremental negative currency impact of $400 million resulting in a full-year impact of negative 1% or $800 million. Looking across the P&L, adjusted pre-tax operating margin is still expected to improve by approximately 50 basis points versus prior year, driven by stronger margin profile and business mix. Net other income is also being maintained, ranging from $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Due to higher interest rates earned on our cash, we now expect net interest income in the range of $300 million to $400 million. And finally, based on current tax law, our estimate for the effective tax rate for 2023 will be between 15.0% and 15.5%. These revised estimates translate to an increase in our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. Our new range is $10.02 to $10.08 or 12.5% growth at the midpoint, and adjusted reported earnings per share in the range of $10.07 to $10.13 or 13% growth at the midpoint. Since January, We've been able to increase our guidance throughout the year for a cumulative impact of $3 billion on operational sales and $0.25 on adjusted operational earnings per share, which includes absorbing $0.10 for our licensing deal with Cellular Biomedicine Group announced in the second quarter of 2023. Now I appreciate that many of you are turning your attention to 2024, and our teams are actively finalizing our plans for next year. With that context, allow me to provide some preliminary perspectives for you to consider. For innovative medicine, we remain confident in our ability to deliver growth from key brands and anticipate continued progress from our newly launched products, all while advancing our robust pipeline with many exciting data readouts, filings, and approvals ahead of us. This includes data presentations and regulatory submissions for TREMFYA in IBD, presenting data from our Phase III study of Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis, and readouts from two Phase III or ELITA trials in early-stage prostate cancer. We do not expect the entry of STELARA Biosimilars in the United States during 2024. However, as a reminder STELARA does have a composition of matter patent expiry in mid-2024 in Europe. For MedTech, we expect our commercial capabilities and continued adoption of recently launched products across all MedTech businesses will continue to drive our growth and improve competitiveness, while continuing to advance our pipeline programs, including innovation in pulse field ablation, Abiomed, and surgical robotics. We expect procedures in 2024 to remain consistent with elevated 2023 levels. With respect to tax, as you may be aware, the European Union member states are in the process of enacting the EU's Pillar 2 Directive, which generally provides for a 15% minimum tax rate as established by the OECD Pillar 2 framework. The first EU effective date for certain aspects of the law is January 1st, 2024. As a result, we currently estimate it up to a 1% tax rate increase in 2024. In addition, the U.S. Treasury's current perspective on Pillar 2 will be harmful as it relates to the treatment of U.S. incentives for innovation and will result in U.S.-based multinational companies paying more tax revenue to foreign governments. Regarding share count given the Kenvue separation, the full benefit of the approximately 191 million net share reduction in Johnson & Johnson shares outstanding from the exchange offer will be reflected in our 2024 financials. And finally, while we don't speculate on future currency impact, utilizing the current euro spot rate would yield an approximate $0.15 negative currency impact on 2024 full-year adjusted earnings per share. We are pleased with our strong performance during the first nine months of this year and have positive momentum as we move into 2024. We look forward to sharing more about the strength of our business, promise of our innovative medicine and MedTech pipelines, and the long-term strategy of Johnson & Johnson at our upcoming Enterprise Business Review on December 5th at the New York Stock Exchange. More information, including an overview of the day's schedule, will be shared shortly. We hope you will be able to join us either in person or on the available webcast. I want to conclude my remarks by thanking our teams around the world for their continued hard work and unwavering commitment to excellence on behalf of our patients. We are confident that our strategy will position us to deliver long-term growth and create significant value for our shareholders. With that, it's my pleasure to turn to Kevin and begin the Q&A portion of the call.",1891.0,1036.0,39.0,14.0,21.0,6.0,4.0,15.0,2.0,3.0,0.037644787644787646,0.013513513513513514,0.02027027027027027,0.005791505791505791,0.003861003861003861,0.02413127413127413

This is my first time as a newcomer to J&J, and before I answer your question, David, I would just like to say I have to tell you I'm really enjoying being a new member of the J&J team. I've really been impressed with the culture inspired by our Credo with the caliber of our talent our people here at J&J and with the really strong performance of the pipeline. We've already launched two NMEs this year, Akeega for prostate cancer and TALVEY for myeloma, continuing our tradition in bringing new therapies in those agents, and we're positioned to deliver an average of more than two enemies per year between now and the close of the decade 2030. So the pipeline is very robust and it's exciting to be here and to be a part of it. So on to your question, the data will be presented at ESMO in a Presidential session. So we're embargoed until then. Abstracts will be available on [Wednesday] (ph). I can only say that the RYBREVANT Lazertinib combo did perform well head-to-head against Osimertinib.

And part of it, as you mentioned is driven by seasonality. As we have commented, we are in a journey of improvement in orthopedics. We want to be number one and number two in every segment we compete. And that is a place where we are not there yet, but we are very confident that we are going to continue to make improvements by investing and by growing in the highest growth segments. We have made improvements in our portfolio, for example, on the knee side. We have a more complete portfolio now on the revision side, on the cementless side. We are launching now our VELYS orthopedics total robot, total knee surgery replacement in Europe. And we already have about 30,000 procedures that have been performed with our VELYS robotic system. Overall, we are increasing our penetration also in the ASCs, which is a fast-growing segment, and we see our performance continue to improve in the U.S. and globally. In this particular quarter, we also had some impact due to the impact of value-based procurement in China and also because of the impact of the Russia sanctions that was mentioned already in the previous remarks. So overall, in orthopedics, we are determined to continue our journey of improvement. We are focusing in having the right portfolio. We have a very strong team in the field, and as Joe has announced, and Joe can comment on that, we have a plan to be able to continue to improve our margins in orthopedics.",271.0,109.0,10.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.09174311926605505,0.009174311926605505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08256880733944955

The short answer is that we continue to pursue the four-pronged strategy that we communicated back in July. So let me quickly summarize those four prongs and highlight the salient developments and perhaps anticipate some follow-up questions about TALC. So the first prong, we are pursuing the appeal through to the Supreme Court of the United States of the July ruling by the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court that dismissed LTL's bankruptcy case. Notably, our appeal recently was joined by counsel representing the vast majority of the TALC claimants. Also, thereafter, the bankruptcy court certified the case for a direct appeal to the third circuit, bypassing the district court, because the bankruptcy court found that the appeal raises matters of significant public interest, the resolution of which would material advance the progress of the case and we fully agree with that assessment. The appeal challenges both the validity, as well as the application of the novel standard that was imposed by the third circuit that requires a showing of, “immediate financial distress” to proceed with the bankruptcy case. That immediate financial distress requirement, which the third circuit did not specifically define, is nowhere in the bankruptcy code and is contrary to the standards that are implied -- employed by other circuits. Moreover, under any reasonable interpretation of that standard, we believe the record has fully established that LTL faced immediate financial distress due to the large volume of TALC claims that were asserted against it. In terms of timing, the third circuit could rule at any moment whether it will take the direct appeal or not. If it does, we expect briefing to take place over the next couple of months with a decision in the early 2024 timeframe. And because we do anticipate the third circuit will primarily affirm the application of its standards, we will immediately thereafter request the Supreme Court to resolve the circuit split and decide if the third circuit's novel approach is an appropriate standard for deciding a motion to dismiss. We do not think it is. We hope to squeeze the cert petition to the Supreme Court into the first term in 2024, but if not, we will raise it in the second term. Working with the council, representing the vast majority of the TALC claimants more than we had previously that were along with us. Along with the -- in addition to the future claims representatives and together with the council and the future claims representatives were pursuing a consensual resolution of the TALC claims through another bankruptcy. And that is exactly what the bankruptcy court, the New Jersey bankruptcy court urged and strongly recommended that we do in its decision that actually dismissed the case. And the New Jersey court made those recommendations having found that LTL had made remarkable progress towards an equitable and efficient resolution to-date. So we are continuing on in that process. In terms of timing on the second prong, the consensual resolution is on the same trajectory as the initial bankruptcy plan with a vote expected in the next six months to determine whether the requisite super majority of claimants support the plan. Third, while those negotiations are proceeding, we will continue to vigorously defend the meritless TALC claims in the tort system. As you may have seen just this last week, we had a significant favorable ruling in that regard with the New Jersey's appellate court in the Barden case reversing a $223 million verdict against the company. The appellate court reversed because it determined the opinions of the leading plaintiff's experts were unsound, were unscientific, and were unsubstantiated. And it is that baseless nature of those expert opinions why we have prevailed in the vast majority of the cases that have been tried to-date. In terms of timing of the litigation, there are two additional mesothelioma cases that we expect will be tried this year with more to come in 2024. As with the Barden case, it's important to keep in mind that the ultimate resolution of those matters often is determined at the appellate level, not at the trial level, which is the place which occurs in the forms that the plaintiff lawyers choose. Finally, we will aggressively challenge the abuses of the judicial system by the mass tort plaintiff's bar and its experts with their own affirmative litigation. We mentioned last time that we brought two actions against the plaintiff's bar's lead experts for defaming our TALC products with publications premised unknowingly false propositions. And those are moving forward.

Chris, regarding your second question, you know, if J&J had a nickel for every time voracious was quoted back to me since the second quarter earnings, we probably could have taken up guidance even a little bit more. And while that's often associated with wanting or devouring great quantities, I think it's really the second definition in webster's where having a very eager approach to an activity is the construct in which I meant that term in the second quarter. So I could have said that five years ago, 10 years ago, my predecessors could have said that. We routinely, almost weekly meet on new opportunities that may complement our existing portfolio or our future pipeline in both MedTech and Innovative Medicines. And the current moment is no different. In fact, we're in a very good position, given the low levels of net debt, the cash we were able to raise to fulfill one of our capital allocation priorities, which you're probably very, very familiar with at this point in time. But we're not going to compromise our principles in making sure that it's a strategic fit. So it fits into the scientific expertise, the commercial capabilities, or the global reach that will add value to that asset in our hands versus someone else. And we're going to make sure that we're disciplined in that approach financially by ensuring that we have a return that's commensal with the risk that we're bearing on behalf of shareholders. So we'd much rather have an okay deal pass us by, then make a bad deal. And that's kind of the principles that we'll live into. There's no deal that's too big, give it our credit rating, as well as our financial strength and annual cash flow generation. But as you know, we've had great success doing smaller, earlier-stage deals as well. We're agnostic with respect to whether it’d be the next one being MedTech or Innovative Medicines, we are simply looking for the best qualified deal that meets both strategic and financial parameters. So hopefully that answers your question. Next question, Kevin?",373.0,182.0,8.0,4.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.04395604395604396,0.02197802197802198,0.04395604395604396,0.0,0.0,0.02197802197802198

That's included at our original launch site in New Jersey, but we're close to having an additional manufacturing site up and rolling in Europe, in Belgium, and also have recently increased our capacity by using some excess capacity that Novartis had to further bolster the number of slots that we can accommodate. One of the traditionally rate-limiting components of the therapy has been the lentivirus component, and there we've made really outstanding progress in-house, mastering that technology, increasing the scale at our factory in Switzerland. And we're in the process -- we're building, I think it will be available next year, another factory in the Netherlands to support the lentivirus component, which has sometimes been one of the rate limiting aspects. So altogether the capacity continues to ramp up and we continue to perfect the technology I would say. Same thing with the number of centers that are qualified to administer the therapy and we're also making progress on the number of countries where CARVYKTI will be available. So very excited, obviously, about the momentum with that. Really, that best-in-class CAR therapy, the CARTITUDE-4 data as you know, showed unprecedented progression-free survival benefit, a hazard ratio of 0.26, overall response rate of 99%, 86% complete response. Very durable for a one and done therapy that was well tolerated. The Grade 3 or above cytokine release syndrome was only 1.1%.

Certainly we have always been very confident in being able to hit our $57 billion target in 2025 for pharma. As I have explained before, there are a number of factors there, the first one and most important is the growth that we're having in our key assets, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, UPTRAVI, our long-acting injectables, and especially DARZALEX, we continues to have a tremendous trajectory gaining share in first line. We are encouraged, as I just commented, by the launches of CARVYKTI, the progression of SPRAVATO, and also the recent launches too, also in multiple myeloma of TECVAYLI and TALVEY. And looking into 2024, the remainder of the year, and also into 2025, we have some very exciting news in our pipeline. Some of them have been already commented. For example, the first chemo-free regimen as first line in EGFR mutated non-small lung cancer. We will be presenting the data of MARIPOSA in our ESMO and that potentially will be a filing and an approval in 2025. This would be a new standard of therapy in this line of therapy in this very important need for patients. We also continue to be encouraged by the progress in our TARIS drug delivery platform. You are also going to see data being presented at ESMO. Very important for us in two existing products. We will be presenting data on TREMFYA in IBD, both in Crohn's and in ulcerative colitis for a potential approval later in 2024, that’s going to be a very significant growth driver for TREMFYA, take into consideration that in the STELARA case, IBD represents 75% of the sales. So we still have a lot of growth in front of us with TREMFYA, as we do also in ERLEADA, in which we will present data in localized high-risk prostate cancer. We also, you know, we're also going to be able to present some data of Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis end of this year. So all in all, very good news for our pipeline in 2024 and 2025. Certainly, the entrance of the biosimilars in 2025 in the U.S. is another factor that builds our confidence that we are going to be able to meet the $57 billion. For me the most important thing now is to look forward and to think about the growth profile of our innovative medicine group into the second-half of the decade. We have a number of growth drivers that are already there that I described, but also the strength of our pipeline both in immunology, in oncology, and in neuroscience profiles us as a strong company, as a strong growth profile into the second-half of the decade.

So first off, we're very pleased with the margin progress that we've been able to make in 2023. I think we started the year to roughly flat to now improving by 50 basis points. A lot of that has really gone, is it directly attributable to the efforts of many people in the organization, who really took the opportunity to look at our infrastructure as a two segment company versus a three segment company. So dis-synergies that we warned about and talked about early on in the Kenvue separation process really haven't come to manifest. In fact, as we look out to 2024, we see minimal to almost no impact from dis-synergies from the separation. We are in the process of finalizing our business plans for 2024. I'd like to get a little bit better assessment of how the clinical development pipeline is shaping up, what the investments are required there. But we're a larger company. We take the opportunity to look each and every year at efficiencies. So we're not in a position to give you margin guidance right now, but I would expect that something similar to where we started this year would not be a bad starting point for next year.

And taking a step back, we see the evolution of our MedTech business in a very positive way. One of our key goals for us is to be a top tier grower in MedTech. When I look at the results of MedTech this year, we are delivering on that. Our growth in the quarter pro forma was 6.4% when you compare with Abiomed as a standalone company. And when you look at our pro forma growth year-to-date in MedTech is 7.9%. So very pleased with the performance of our MedTech business. And we have expectations to continue our progression into 2024, in part fueled by the procedural growth that we see and also, but our continued improvement in our execution and the launch of new products. Some of them we can discuss later. For example, you know, we will be launching our first PFA catheter in Europe into 2024. When it comes to GLP-1s, it's good for patients to have new options for treatment, especially in obesity, which at times has been a stigmatized disease in which patients were not looking for treatment due to the stigmatization of that. Certainly, as you commented, we're seeing some impact in our bariatric business in the short-term. Some patients are reconsidering surgery, expecting to get treatment. But overall, when we talk to surgeons, bariatric surgeons, what they see is a complementary role of surgery and GLP-1s, and many of them comment on the fact that they could see a tailwind for bariatric surgery down the road, given this complementary nature, the increased awareness about obesity, more patients seeking treatment, and many of the patients, about 30% of them, are not going to be tolerating this medication. So they would be another funnel for our bariatric business.

We see those two mechanisms as being very complementary, reducing the levels of auto antibodies with Nipo and then inhibiting inflammatory mechanisms with the TNF. The so-called DAISY study, the Phase 2, is underway now and we'll test that combination.

So it's a key growth driver for us. So on one hand, certainly, VBP represents a headwind in price. And on the other hand, it also represents an opportunity as you can expand quality products, medical technologies into more patients.

We are very pleased with the performance of our immunology business, especially we're pleased with the performance of TREMFYA with 25.1% growth in the quarter, which shows our ability to drive growth there. As I said before, TREMFYA currently is now indicated in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis as an analog. In the case of STELARA, that represents about 25% of the sales. So with the upcoming readouts, filing and potential approvals of ulcerative colitis and Chron's disease, we expect to have significant growth in TREMFYA. We talk about TREMFYA as a $5 billion product earlier in our Analyst Day in 2021. Now you can see clearly that we're going not only to meet that, but to clearly exceed that benchmark for TREMFYA. So when it comes to STELARA, we had also a very robust growth of close to 16%. In that case, there is a prior period adjustment in the quarter a year ago that represents about 600 basis points.

Overall, our immunology portfolio in the quarter grew 12.4%, which is very strong considering that we also have headwinds there of REMICADE biosimilars. And we remain very excited about the immunology portfolio as a key driver for J&J. Our Innovative Medicines are going to be bringing significant improvements in IBD with TREMFYA as I recall, but also staying there, we have our target oral peptide which is going to be presenting some data soon that we already presented data in psoriasis. And also, we have the combination of [Technical Difficulty] and golimumab in IBD, which has presented also groundbreaking result, so very encouraged about our immunology portfolio and the ability to drive growth in the second-half of the decade more to be seen in our EBR later in the year.",316.0,129.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.06201550387596899,0.015503875968992248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046511627906976744

So really excited to be here, equally excited to be leading a team of talented scientists, engineers and physicians as we do smarter less invasive and more personalized solutions for our patients. So with respect to Ottava, we have made great progress on the platform. The team is really focused on combining a really differentiated architecture based on its software and hardware together with our best-in-class instruments, and we believe that combination of a differentiated architecture with instruments is going to enable us to have high value from day one. Now we will have more updates on Ottava next month, as you mentioned. And at that time, we will provide a lot more detail. But the one point I'll make is that even today, robotic-assisted surgery penetration is in single-digits. So there's still a lot of growth left in that segment. And we're really excited because Ottava brings a lot of differentiation. So we're very excited that we can make a big kind of path.

I've been in touch with multiple surgeons around the world. And one common comment that I find is that they all want. They are rooting for Johnson & Johnson to come into the robotic surgical space. They want to have the service and the support that they have accustomed doing decades with our Ethicon business and they also want to be able to utilize the advanced instruments with whom they have grown.

Unfortunately, with today's therapies, almost all lung cancer patients will eventually relapse. They will need a second line therapy. And we think chemo was best reserved for that circumstance where the patient now has failed the frontline targeted therapies.

We breakthrough science and transformative technology, we innovate across the entire patient pathway in ways no other company can. And as we share at our Enterprise Business Review, we have a stronger growth margin profile and are more focused and agile than ever before, which is what you see with today's results. I'm particularly proud of our Q4 results with innovative medicine operational sales, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, growing by 9.5% at MedTech adjusted operational sales growing by an impressive 9.1%. For the full year, we delivered strong and sustained performance with 9% operational sales growth excluding the COVID-19 vaccine and 10.8% adjusted operational earnings per share growth. These results reflect the breadth and competitiveness of our portfolio. And when I look at the milestones we achieved in 2023 and the promise of our pipeline, I have confidence in our guidance for 2024 and beyond. So let's take a deeper look at the business and what we achieved last year. Starting with Innovative Medicine. For the full year, we delivered above-market operational sales growth of 7.2%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Our Innovative Medicine business continues to be fueled by growth from key brands and the acceleration of sales of new products. Our multiple myeloma portfolio is a good example with significant contribution from recently launched products including CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY. Turning to clinical trials. Key results from the year included positive Phase III readout for more than 10 of our in-line and pipeline medicines, including CARVYKTI, in one to three prior lines of therapy in multiple myeloma. DARZALEX in front-line multi myeloma transplant eligible patients. RYBREVANT, in combination with chemotherapy and RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in non-small cell lung cancer. And finally TREMFYA monotherapy in Ulcerative Colitis. In addition, we saw positive Phase 1 and Phase 2 readout for nipocalimab and TAR-200 and TAR-210 and we initiated our Phase 3 clinical development programs for Milvexian and our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113. Beyond that, we received FDA breakthrough designation for TAR-200 for the treatment of bladder cancer and fast track designations for Milvexian in Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke, and Acute Coronary Syndrome. And with 19 U.S. and EU filings across our Innovative Medicine business in 2023, we have high expectations for the year ahead. Our recent announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire Ambrx to develop next-generation antibody drug conjugates further strengthens our oncology pipeline. Now moving to MedTech. In 2023, we delivered full year operational sales growth of 12.4% and full year adjusted operational sales growth of 7.8%. For the first-time, our MedTech team delivered more than $30 billion in sales, as we continue to build a best-in-class business. We are accelerating growth through commercial execution, differentiated innovation and moving into higher growth markets, as you saw with our successful integration of Abiomed and our recent acquisition of Laminar, which focused on eliminating the left atrial appendage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. And at the same time, we are making strong progress in our pipeline, including advancing our Ottava surgical robot, MONARCH approval in China for bronchoscopy and continued market expansion for VELYS, our robotic assisted solution for total knee replacement with CE Mark approval in 2023. In electrophysiology, we have a lot of momentum in our post-field ablation portfolio. We announced regulatory approval a few weeks ago for the VARIPULSE PFA platform in Japan and have submitted for CE Mark approval in the EU. The true pulse generator has received approval in the EU and we received first and only approval from the U.S. FDA for a zero fluoroscopy workflow for cardiac ablation. And in the fourth quarter, findings from our QDOT MICRO Catheter Q-FFICIENCY Study showed that very high power, short duration ablations improved quality of life and reduced health care utilization for atrial fibrillation patients. In Vision, we are driving strong performance across our TECNIS IOLs and OASYS 1-day family of contact lenses, including our most premium lens, ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, which has proven superiority in comfort and clarity versus the competition. Turning to Abiomed. We recently completed our Impella ECP pivotal clinical trial. In Q4, we also enrolled our first patient in the Abiomed RECOVER IV randomized, controlled trial. As we look ahead, I have never been more excited about the future of our business. At our Enterprise Business Review, we shared that we expect our Innovative Medicine business to grow 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030 with our industry-leading pipeline and portfolio delivering more than 10 assets that have the potential to generate over $5 billion in peak year sales by 2030. We also expect a further 15 assets to have the potential for $1 billion to $5 billion in peak year sales. In 2024, we expect data readouts for many of these assets, including Phase 3 trials for TREMFYA in IBD, ERLEADA in heavy (ph) stage prostate cancer, our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113 in psoriasis, Nipocalimab in Myasthenia Gravis as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder. We also expect Phase 2 readouts for our combination therapy, guselkumab and golimumab, JNJ-4804 in psoriatic arthritis, nipocalimab in Sjogren's Disease and TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. In MedTech, we shared that we expect to grow at the upper range of our markets, which are anticipated to grow by 5% to 7% between 2022 and 2027. And that by 2027, we expect one-third of our revenue to be generated by new products. In 2024, we see strong progress towards these goals. In electrophysiology that includes the full U.S. market release of QDOT MICRO Catheter and we are expecting CE Mark approval for our post-field ablation catheter VARIPULSE in Europe in the first half of 2024. We plan to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for Ottava in the second half of 2024. And in Abiomed, we expect U.S. commercial launch of Impella RP Flex with smart assist and an Impella ECP submission in 2024. As you can see, our pipeline is advancing. Our business is transforming. Before I turn the call to Jess and Joe, I want to thank our teams around the world for everything they do help our patients. We have entered 2024 from a position of strength, and I'm confident in our ability to lead the next wave of health innovation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jess.",1071.0,534.0,37.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.06928838951310862,0.0,0.003745318352059925,0.0018726591760299626,0.0,0.06928838951310862

Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted reflects the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. We will report the consumer health financial results as discontinued operations. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q4 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023. Sales increased 7.2%, with 11% in the U.S. and 2.7% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.7% worldwide, 8.8% in the U.S. and 2.1% outside the U.S. It is important to note that sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA by approximately 1,500 basis points operationally. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.70 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.22 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.6 billion and the diluted earnings per share was $2.29, representing increases of 2.4% and 11.7%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11.2%. For the full year 2023, sales were $85.2 billion. Sales grew 7.4%, with 10.6% in the U.S. and 3.8% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.9% worldwide, 8.2% in the U.S. and 3.4% outside the U.S. Sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA by approximately 1,000 basis points operationally. Net earnings for the full year 2023 were $13.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $5.20 versus diluted earnings per share of $6.14 a year ago. Full year 2023 adjusted net earnings were $25.4 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.92, representing increases of 6.8% and 11.1%, respectively, versus full year 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 10.8%. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $13.7 billion increased 4% with growth of 9.5% in the U.S. and a decline of 3.1% outside of the U.S. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide and U.S. sales growth was 9.5%, and growth outside of the U.S. was 9.4%. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine were negatively impacted by approximately 120 basis points due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with nine assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA, with increases of 22.2% and 19%, respectively. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in both STELARA and TREMFYA, with increases of 14.5% and 20.5%, respectively. This growth was driven by market growth and share gains as well as favorable patient mix in TREMFYA. Growth of 17.4% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains and market growth. Turning to newly launched products. We continue to make progress on our launches of CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO. We are also encouraged by the early success of our launches of TECVAYLI and TALVEY, sales of which are driving the growth in other Oncology. As a reminder, we expect to begin disclosing TECVAYLI sales in Q1 2024. Total Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in XARELTO, a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures and a loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA, REMICADE and PREZISTA. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.7 billion increased 13.4% with Abiomed contributing 4.5% to growth. Growth in the U.S. was 14.1% and 12.8% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 9.1%. MedTech was negatively impacted by international sanctions in Russia worth approximately 50 basis points, primarily in Advanced Surgery and Vision. Electrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 25.2% with strong growth in all regions, including Europe. This growth was driven by our global market leading portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RF ablation and OCTARAY catheters. Abiomed contributed $340 million in sales within the quarter driven by continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 technology. Growth of 6.4% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by volume based procurement in China, primarily in Endocutters. Orthopaedics growth of 5% reflects procedure growth, success of recently launched products such as the global expansion of our VELYS digital solutions and expansion in ambulatory surgical centers, as well as lapping of prior year China’s VBP price concessions in Spine. Growth of 6.6% in Vision was driven by price actions and contact lenses, as well as strength of new products including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses and TECNIS EYHANCE, our monofocal interocular lens and surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by U.S. stocking dynamics. Global Vision growth was negatively impacted by 140 basis points due to the Blink divestiture in Q3. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold margin deleveraged by 130 basis points due to commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix in MedTech, partially offset by favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network related exit cost in Innovative Medicine. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing $4.5 billion or 20.9% of sales this quarter. We invested $3.4 billion or 24.5% of sales in Innovative Medicine with the increase in investment being driven by higher milestones, partially offset by portfolio prioritization. In MedTech, R&D investment was $1.1 billion or 14.6% of sales with the increase in investment primarily driven by the Laminar acquisition. Interest income was $212 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $77 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in income was driven by higher interest rates earned on cash balances and a lower average debt balance. The other income and expense line was income of $421 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to an expense of $795 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by higher unrealized gains on securities and lower (ph) COVID-19 vaccine-related exit costs. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 14.4% versus 16% in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by the net decrease of tax liabilities, including the settlement of the 2013 through 2016 U.S. tax audit. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 10.8% versus 16.2% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2023 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters. Lastly, I will direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 32.5% to 29.2%. Innovative Medicine margins declined from 37.7% to 37.4%, primarily driven by higher R&D milestones, partially offset by favorable patient mix and leveraging and selling and marketing expense. MedTech margins declined from 24.5% to 15.5% primarily driven by in-process research and development expense from the Laminar acquisition, commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by selling and marketing expense leverage. This concludes the sale and earnings portion of the call. I'm now pleased to turn it over to Joe.",1269.0,707.0,29.0,22.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,11.0,0.04101838755304102,0.031117397454031116,0.008486562942008486,0.0014144271570014145,0.0,0.009900990099009901

As Joaquin and Jessica commented, 2023 was a strong year for Johnson & Johnson evidenced by notable top and bottom line performance beats relative to what we guided to 2023 at this time last year. We are particularly proud of the innovation we advanced to strengthen our development pipelines, the continued expansion of our portfolio and investments made for future success. All of this provides us with a strong foundation as we enter 2024. Thus far during the call, you've heard about sales and income performance in 2023. So now let's dive into some detail on capital allocation highlights. We generated free cash flow of more than $18 billion in 2023. At the end of the year, we had approximately $23 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $29 billion of debt for a net debt position of $6 billion. We maintained a healthy balance sheet and robust credit rating, underscoring the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial position, which enables us to strategically invest and deploy capital to unlock value. To that end, we executed against all of our capital allocation priorities in 2023. For starters, we invested more than $15 billion in research and development or 17.7% of sales, an all-time high for the company as we remain one of the top investors in R&D across all industries. Jessica provided R&D investment by business segment, information we will continue to provide on a quarterly basis moving forward. As far as dividends, 2023 marked the 61st consecutive year in which we increased our dividend. We know this use of capital is a priority for our investors, and we plan to continue to increase our dividend annually. We also deployed, announced or committed over $3 billion in strategic value creating inorganic growth opportunities in the last 12 months. This amount includes the recent Ambrx and Laminar transactions as well as more than 50 smaller early-stage licensing deals and partnerships that complement our current Innovative Medicine and MedTech pipelines. Finally, share repurchases. In early 2023, we completed the $5 billion share repurchase program initiated in late 2022 and in combination with our dividend, returned over $14 billion to shareholders last year. Through the Kenvue separation, we further reduced the Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count by 191 million shares or approximately 7% without the use of cash and in a tax-free manner. Looking ahead to 2024, Johnson & Johnson's robust free cash flow generation should continue to solidify our already strong financial foundation and fuel further investment leading to growth for our business or returns to shareholders. Now turning to our full year 2024 guidance. Today, we are confirming the 2024 guidance for those items previewed at our enterprise business review in early December by filling in some of the details. We expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 5% to 6% or $88.2 billion to $89 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. In Innovative Medicine, we expect 2024 to deliver a 13th consecutive year of above market growth, driven by market share gains from key brands such as DARZALEX, TREMFYA and ERLEADA as well as continued adoption of recently launched newer products such as CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI, TALVEY and SPRAVATO. In MedTech, we remain focused on executing our key value drivers: first, advancing our differentiated pipeline such as programs in pulse field ablation, Abiomed and surgical robotics, further shifting our portfolio into high-growth markets; second, expanding our reach and scale around the world; and third, building operational resilience across our portfolio. We don't speculate on future currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.09 as well as other major currencies, we estimate there would be a slight unfavorable impact of $400 million or a negative 0.5% on reported sales growth for the year. Turning to other items on our P&L. We expect our 2024 adjusted pretax operating margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points driven primarily by a continuation of efficiency programs across the organization. We expect this to be partially offset by anticipated STELARA biosimilar entrants in Europe in the second half of this year and some lingering inflation impact in MedTech inventory that will flow through 2024's P&L. This margin improvement encompasses dilution of additional investment associated with our planned acquisition of Ambrx, which will be treated as a business combination. Now we do acknowledge that this 50 basis point improvement simply gets us back to what your models expected, given the elevated Q4 2023 R&D investment for new pipeline assets. Regarding other income and expense, we anticipate income to be $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for 2024. This is less than the 2023 amount driven by the impact of actuarial assumptions on certain employee benefit programs such as lower discount rates. We are comfortable with you modeling net interest income between $450 million and $550 million, consistent with 2023 levels. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2024 in the range of 16% to 17% based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses. This tax rate takes into account an increase of approximately 1.5% or 150 basis points relative to the recently enacted Pillar 2 legislation. We continue to believe the U.S. Treasury's current perspective on Pillar 2 is harmful, reducing U.S. incentives for innovation and resulting in U.S. based multinational companies paying more tax revenue to foreign governments. Our full year share count calculation for adjusted earnings per share in 2024 will include the remaining benefit equal to approximately 120 million shares from the approximately 191 million net share reduction in outstanding J&J shares following the Kenvue exchange offer. Given all these factors, we expect adjusted operational earnings per share to grow 7.4% at the midpoint for a range of $10.55 to $10.75. Based on the euro spot rate of 1.09 from last week, we do not estimate any currency impact on earnings per share. I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on quarterly phasing for your models. We expect Innovative Medicine sales growth to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half, given the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe towards the middle of the year. This headwind will be partially offset by continued uptake from our recently launched products. We project MedTech operational sales growth to be relatively consistent throughout the year, expecting procedures in 2024 to remain above pre-COVID levels. The first half of the year will continue to have modest impact from Russia sanctions as our licenses are approved. We anticipate China VBP pricing for surgical IOLs and orthopedic sports to begin in 2024 with impacts from 2023 VBP in electrophysiology, Endocutters, Energy, Spine and Trauma to begin to anniversary throughout 2024. Regarding EPS phasing, it is important to highlight that the first half of the year will benefit from the full 191 million net share reduction following the Kenvue exchange offer with only a partial comparative benefit in the third quarter versus Q3 2023 and the fourth quarter being neutral versus Q4 2023. So based on the foundation strengthened in 2023 and numerous catalysts that Joaquin outlined across our business in 2024, we are confident in our ability to achieve both near and long-term financial targets. I'd like to close by thanking our colleagues for their dedication and commitment to benefit patients around the world. It is their effort that enables Johnson & Johnson to deliver innovative therapies and solutions that address serious unmet medical needs and creates long-term sustainable value for shareholders.

First, let me remark the strong close of our MedTech business in 2023. We delivered annually more than $30 billion in sales, which is -- were all-time high in our company history with operational -- adjusted operational growth in the fourth quarter of 9.1. So very strong results across the board in electrophysiology, in heart (ph) recovery, in surgery, in orthopedics and in Vision. So when we think about our results in 2023, we think it's going to be aligned with our competitor composite for the year, but ahead of our competitor composite in the fourth quarter. Now, certainly, COVID-19 impacts have stabilized globally and while we continue to see some challenges, macro challenges from the point of view of inflation, hospital staffing and the like, there is a bolus of patients coming out into the market after COVID-19, which has made 2023 market growth faster than historical averages. And we see that trend continuing into a good part of 2024 and therefore, being a tailwind into 2024. There's a lot of factors playing into that. But overall, we see the amended procedures continuing into at least the first half of 2024. Now we also have a number of tailwinds on our side other than the procedures that make me optimistic about 2024. We have the trajectory of Abiomed in heart recovery, which is very strong with the adoption of Impella 5.5. We file already for our Impella ECP, which is the smaller version of Impella CP. In orthopedics, we continue to move into higher growth markets with the expansion of our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution. We obtained CE Mark in Europe. In surgery, we continue to launch innovations across our surgery business with the [indiscernible], in Energy and ECHELON 3000 as a stapler. And we continue to see good expansion of our Plus Sutures too. In our Vision business, we are expanding our TECNIS family into the premium segment of IOLs. And finally, and I know this is an area of interest to you in electrophysiology, we continue to expand our PFA portfolio of catheters. We obtained approval for our VARIPULSE, loop catheter, PFA loop catheter in Japan at the beginning of this year. And we continue to roll out the global launch of QDOT MICRO, our newest radio frequency ablation catheter. So overall, a number of catalysts and tailwinds into our MedTech business into 2024. As we discussed in our Enterprise Business Review, we continue to see our MedTech business growing at the upper end of our markets and becoming a best-in-class competitor in MedTech.",425.0,191.0,10.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.05235602094240838,0.010471204188481676,0.0,0.005235602094240838,0.0,0.041884816753926704

I noticed an ODAC panel was just announced to review the CARTITUDE-4 data. I was just wondering if you can talk about the focus of that upcoming meeting and your confidence in an on-time label expansion for CARTITUDE-4?

So with more than 2,000 patients treated CARVYKTI, it's already the fastest launch CAR-T in the market overall and we are pleased to continue to see quarter-over-quarter sequential growth in CARVYKTI. And overall, we remain confident in two things, both the risk benefit of CARVYKTI in the indication that is being studied and at the same on the potential of CARVYKTI to be $5 billion plus asset at peak year sales. Regarding the ODAC that you commented, we are very confident on the data of our Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study that as a reminder, support the efficacy and safety of CARVYKTI in one to three prior lines in treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We presented the results at ASCO, as you know. And we also published those results in the New England Journal of Medicine. And we very much look forward to review the updated survival and safety data with the FDA ODAC in the future. We are committed to work with the FDA in the continued development of CARVYKTI. And we continue to have the focus on bringing this in immunotherapy to multiple myeloma patients in earlier lines of therapy. We are working with the FDA towards a PDUFA date for our CARTITUDE-4 indication in April 5, and with EMEA towards an anticipated CHMP opinion in the first quarter of 2024. So overall, we feel confident about the risk benefit profile in this indication and about the future of CARVYKTI. Regarding your manufacturing question, we've done a significant progress in our manufacturing capacity, which is a major driver in the continuous growth of CARVYKTI. On the cell processing side, we have doubled our cell processing capacity in our Raritan facility. Since 2023. We are making progress to your point, Terence, in our European cell processing facilities. We are already manufacturing the first batches of CARVYKTI for clinical use this month of January. And we also have contracted additional capacity, external capacity to scale up production and increase our ability moving forward that will start mid this year. On the other hand, we have also made significant progress in the internalization and scale-up of our lentivirus production. We have increased capacity in Switzerland, in our Switzerland side. And at the same time, we continue to progress with new U.S. capacity and additions site in the Netherlands to produce our lentivirus. Late December, we received approval to expand our lentivirus capacity from 20-liter tanks to 50-liter tanks of lentivirus production in our U.S. facility. So overall, we feel good that we are progressing with CARVYKTI that we will continue to deliver quarter-over-quarter growth in 2024. And we are working towards building this $5 billion plus product and continue to transform the treatment paradigm in multiple myeloma, as we have discussed in the past, moving from treating to progression to treating to cure as we move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy.",488.0,217.0,10.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.04608294930875576,0.004608294930875576,0.013824884792626729,0.004608294930875576,0.004608294930875576,0.041474654377880185

So we are very well positioned to continue to entertain many types of deals. As you know, we have the parameters of making sure that they are a strategic fit so that we've got scientific expertise and insights, a familiarity with the space has proven to be our most successful platforms. We want to make sure that we're earning a fair return to compensate shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. It was only 13 months ago, we were able to deploy $17 billion in capital for Abiomed. We're very pleased with that acquisition. Not only has it beat our internal deal models, but it also is performing better than what the Street had called for that business prior to the announcement of the acquisition. So it's been a really nice fit. What I would say is, we also deployed or announced, as I said in my prepared remarks, over $3 billion in capital for more than 50 smaller licensing partnerships or deals. And while those may have not made headlines, they usually are headlines when they become products for patients. And so that when you think about our history of DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, CARVYKTI for one, it's been -- that's kind of our track record. Our appetite is still, I would say, interested in moving into spaces that complement our existing portfolio, whether that be for the near or long term.",253.0,108.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.046296296296296294,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.0,0.046296296296296294

And look, talking about that, Larry, let me say, we are agnostic to sector and agnostic to size. And as Joe commented, our preference is clearly to be in areas in which we have internal capabilities and know-how, and also to go into products that represent a significant progress from the point of view of improving the current standard of care and that are first-in-class and best-in-class. To illustrate that, the two deals that we completed this year, Laminar and Ambrx would be in that direction. So for example, Laminar is a deal in an area we know well, which is atrial fibrillation, and we believe could be first-in-class to be a device that can eliminate the left atrial appendage. When it comes to Ambrx, it's a deal in an area that we have a strong legacy like prostate cancer with a number of products marketed already. And this could be a first-in-class antibody drug conjugate in order to address a significant medical need in metastatic cut-resistant prostate cancer in patients that have failed under gene therapy. So very much so and in that context, we continue to see also opportunities when it comes to Innovative Medicine in neuroscience and in immunology. And when it comes to MedTech, to your point, in other cardiology areas based on the strength that we have now with Biosense Webster and Abiomed and not excluding also the potential for other areas like robotic surgery or segments of orthopedics that are growing faster and also areas of Vision. So overall, that’s our approach. We try to put this strategic, scientific and to Joe’s point, scientific lens in order to be able to deliver value for patients and also value for our shareholders.",302.0,137.0,8.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.058394160583941604,0.014598540145985401,0.021897810218978103,0.0,0.0,0.043795620437956206

I think as you look at that specifically for the fourth quarter, what you have in our operating margins is obviously the Laminar transaction that was part of that mix. So on our slide that details IBT, you likely saw a quarterly reduction in MedTech, specifically of about 9 points, about 2 points for the full year. I would say two-thirds of that is represented by the Laminar transaction. You also then have, I would say, in the fourth quarter specific some mix as orthopedics performed probably a little bit better than it had in previous quarters. And then you have the inflationary impact, obviously, with higher levels of inventory on our balance sheet that flow through the P&L, that is occurring throughout 2023. And we expect it to occur throughout at least the first half of 2024. We're not seeing any incremental inflation in, I'll call it, current activity. So it's not being additive to inventory, but it's also not subsiding either. So we're kind of at a new, I'd say water level, if you will, that should be going forward, but not hurting the P&L as we look out beyond the second half of 2024.",209.0,93.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.021505376344086023,0.021505376344086023,0.010752688172043012,0.0,0.0,0.0

Sometimes I'm asked about osteoarthritis in the context of the GLP-1s, and weight is not a factor in osteoarthritis. We continue to look at this data, and it's early for us to give you an answer there. Now what we can tell you is that we continue to see an increased volume of procedures in orthopedics based on coming out of COVID. And we don't see any change in that neither in the hips or in the knee area or in any of the segments that we compete. So we are optimistic about our orthopedics trajectory.

We had growth in the high-teens driven by improved patient mix, market growth coming out of COVID too. This was an area that was heavily impacted by COVID as pulmonologists were working at COVID and not diagnosing new patients. So overall, it's been a very positive trajectory of our PAH business, and we remain confident about the short-term future of this business into 2024. We are working towards the combination of macitentan, OPSUMIT with Tadalafil, which the trademark will be OPSYNVI. And that would be another option for patients there to enhance compliance. And in my talks with physicians treating pulmonary hypertension, they seem very positive about it, and we expect an approval of that combination in 2024. So that's the outlook for our pulmonary franchise. Are we looking at other areas there? There, we are looking at the space and see if there are potential opportunities to be able to improve the standard of care. And we continue to look to see how we can continue to extend the success of our pulmonary franchise into the future.

And we expect a similar trajectory as macitentan, OPSUMIT and Tadalafil (ph) become standard of care clearly established in this area.",228.0,96.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.10416666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10416666666666667

I commented that here in prostate cancer with ERLEADA that I discussed before. We'll see data in high risk localized prostate cancer in 2024 with the addition of Ambrx now and antibody drug conjugate in this area. We are very, very excited about RYBREVANT and the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib. We have Phase 3 studies completed. We expect -- we have filed all the three indications, and we expect approval of that in 2024. So we are very excited about RYBREVANT and the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer in first line. Moving into bladder cancer. You also will see data with TARIS-200, and TARIS-210 in non-muscle invasive localized bladder cancer. And we received FDA breakthrough designation for TARIS-200 in 2023. And then we continue our progress in our multiple myeloma franchise. We talk about CARVYKTI, but it's important to recognize how well [Technical Difficulty] with the impressive per sales data that we presented in first-line in newly diagnosed transplant eligible multiple myeloma patients. So we are looking at CAR-T in autoimmune diseases to your question, yes, but it's early data. As you know, we did a deal earlier in 2023 to partner two CAR-Ts, a CD19 and a CD19/CD20 BiCAR. So we are looking at that, and it's early data. It looks promising. We are interested in radiopharmaceuticals. We believe that the avenue that we are doing with antibody drug conjugates, it's an important therapeutic option. And when it comes to radiopharmaceuticals, we did a deal earlier this year with Nanobiotics for a radio enhancer that this still been developing head and neck cancer. We expanded our rights at the end of the year. And this could be another avenue to be there for us in which we could combine our expertise in medical devices, in medical technology and pharmaceuticals. And we plan to do a broader development plan of our radio enhancing, and we’ll provide you more information about it as we continue to move. So overall, we are very pleased with the progress that we see in our oncology franchise, both in solid tumors and in hematology.

I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made about MedTech trends and margins. And I think you mentioned some of the headwinds there were patient mix.

I think it was around margins, specifically in MedTech and how that may progress through the year. So as I stated earlier, I would say that the margin profile is going to be impacted by inflationary pressures that were incurred really in 2022, sit on our balance sheet as inventory and then kind of flow through the P&L throughout the corresponding 2023 and probably a good piece of 2024. That being said, Tim and the team are doing magnificent work in terms of finding efficiencies across the business. I highlighted one of the earlier ones with respect to orthopedics. But we're quite frankly doing that across the entire MedTech portfolio at this point in time, looking for opportunities whether it be aided by artificial intelligence or just infrastructure overall as to how we can further improve the MedTech profitability profile. Right now, we stand a little bit above the middle of the pack in terms of our peer set on margin, and we're looking to get towards the upper end of that peer set.",190.0,91.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.06593406593406594,0.01098901098901099,0.02197802197802198,0.0,0.0,0.054945054945054944

So specifically on XARELTO in the quarter, we would say there's two items. It's patient mix, but there is also a one-time entry.

Joe, sorry to harp on the MedTech margin side of things. I appreciate everything you're saying for going forward. But just as we look at Q4 specifically, even adding back Laminar, we're still getting to sort of down 400 basis points year-over-year in the quarter.

I think it's really the inflationary impact, so out of the 9% drop that you saw in Q4, 5 points are really Laminar. The other -- the balance of 4 points, I would chalk up to the inflationary impact that I spoke of earlier and then the mix component, whereby orthopedics, which is our lowest margin portfolio within the MedTech portfolio overall, performed a little bit better. So there's really nothing magical behind it other than the explanations that were already given on the call. Again, we are looking at cost improvement initiatives, specifically in orthopedics, but across the entire portfolio as we move through 2024. But there’s nothing that happened – maybe this is the best way to state it.

And M&A has been -- M&A and external innovation has been a core of our pharma portfolio growth and transformation. As I said initially, we are agnostic to sector. In the case of pharma, our preferred mode has been trying to go to assets that were around proof of concept. So generally speaking, from a size perspective, it's been about deals that have been either of a smaller size or have been different modalities like client senses or partnerships. Just last year, we completed overall at Johnson & Johnson more than 50 deals. The thing is that the headlines are only made by the ones that are M&A. So we've done multiple deals in our pharmaceutical side in order to be able to enhance our existing portfolio. And our bias is to go for transactions that are going to enable us to create more value by leveraging our clinical development strength, our manufacturing capabilities and our commercial reach. So hence, why the majority of the deals that you see in our pharmaceutical side are at an earlier stage. Are we looking broader than that? Yes, we do. But mainly, we find more opportunities to create value at an earlier stage. For example, this year, we did a number of deals that went less publicized. We did, as I commented before, a deal with CNBG now called AbelZeta (ph) in CAR-T with CD19 and CD20, which we believe could be a best-in-class CAR-T in this area that could launch in this decade or at the end of the year, we also did another deal in antibody drug conjugates with a Korean company called LegoChem, which was underreported. But we continue to work in identifying deals in our pharmaceutical space that enables us to be able to put all our capabilities to work in the clinical development side, in manufacturing and in commercial. And that’s been the source of very significant value creation in products that all of you know, like DARZALEX or CARVYKTI that come from that type of approach of going earlier on into the development process.",358.0,151.0,9.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.059602649006622516,0.0,0.019867549668874173,0.0,0.0,0.059602649006622516

And you should think about our EP franchise in 2024 as also a strong year, another year of growth, a strong growth for our EP franchise. If I look at the -- to your point that the drivers of growth in 2023, it was across the board. I mean it was in Asia-Pacific, in the U.S. and EMEA. It was driven by the procedure recovery, but also by new product performance and some offset also, a slight offset of value-based procurement in China. The new products that we introduced this year are the engine generator, our mapping catheters OCTARAY and OPTRELL. And also, importantly, our QDOT MICRO Catheter in radio frequency ablation that has efficacy results higher than any PFA catheter. And that together with our strong commercial execution and broad clinical support across the board has driven this result in electrophysiology that in the fourth quarter was 25% growth globally, 22% growth in the U.S. and 29% outside of the U.S. So very strong results. So we have a strong leadership in electrophysiology and 20 years of understanding this field. And when it comes to our strategy in cardiac ablation, we have multiple strategies, but one core strategy is our CARTO mapping system. That is a fundamental pillar of our strategy in cardiac ablation that supports procedural efficiency and very importantly, now low to zero fluoroscopy workflow. For the electrophysiologist, it's very important to know where they are and what are they doing to the heart anatomy. Otherwise, they are flying blind if they don't have a mapping system. And the CARTO system, it's providing the electrophysiologist real-time feedback and very important parameters like tissue proximity, contact force measurement and ablation indexes that give them an idea of how durable deletion is going to be and what are going to be the outcomes of the procedures. So that's key for us to be able to have a workflow that enables the type of progress that electrophysiologists have been already used to with radio frequency ablation. And hence, all our suite of catheters, it's is going to be from day 1 fully integrated in our mapping system. We have 5,000 CARTO systems already deployed globally and an extensive network of mappers to support the electrophysiologist. When it comes to our catheters, we are developing a full portfolio of options. You commented on VARIPULSE, our multi-electrode catheter that was approved in Japan. We are developing a focal and a large focal catheter and also a single shot one. So electrophysiologists are going to be able to choose the catheter that is more appropriate for their anatomy and for the workflow that they are selecting. We have five clinical trials active, three of them have completed. And we have submitted our VARIPULSE catheter for CE Mark and we plan submitting the VARIPULSE catheter to the U.S. FDA in 2024. Ultimately, PFA is an important option, but RF is also here to stay. That's why we believe that having the workflow and the procedure efficiency that CARTO gives you plus the option of having a catheter like our dual energy catheter that would enable electrophysiologists to simply change depending on the anatomy of deletion from PFA to RFA, it's going to be important for the future. And it's going to help them adopting PFA as this is the most widely used catheter in the world. So very positive about our growth in 2024 based on the strength that we have in this area. I'm positive about the outlook of our ablation business moving forward. As we have commented in multiple occasions, atrial fibrillation, it's an area that is still undertreated. And the outcomes of radio frequency ablation and most likely, the outcomes of PFA have shown significant improvement even compared to medical therapy. So very positive about the outlook of our -- and the strength of our atrial fibrillation business.",668.0,284.0,20.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.07042253521126761,0.0035211267605633804,0.007042253521126761,0.0,0.0035211267605633804,0.06690140845070422

This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of the first quarter business results and our full year financial outlook for 2024. A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder you can find additional materials including today’s presentation and associated schedules on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. Please note that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the company's future operating and financial performance, market position and business strategy. You are cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements, which are based on the current expectations of future events using the information available as of the date of this recording, and are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected. A description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2023 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SECs website. Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. Moving to today's agenda I will start by reviewing the first quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation as well as highlights related to our two businesses. Joe Wolk our CFO will then provide additional business and financial commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, capital allocation priorities, and guidance for 2024. The remaining time will be available for your questions. Joaquin Duato our Chairman and CEO as well as Jennifer Taubert, John Reed, and Tim Schmid, our Innovative Medicine and MedTech leaders will be joining us for Q&A. To ensure we provide enough time to address your questions, we anticipate the webcast will last approximately 60 minutes. Unless otherwise stated the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Turning to our first quarter sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the first quarter of 2024. Sales increased 3.9% with growth of 7.8% in the U.S. and a decline of 0.3% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 7.6% worldwide and 7.4% outside of the U.S. Sales growth in Europe excluding the COVID-19 vaccine was 6%. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter net earnings were $5.4 billion and diluted earnings per share was $2.20 versus basic loss per share of $0.19 a year ago. Excluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.6 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.71, representing increases of 3.8% and 12.4%, respectively compared to the first quarter of 2023. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12.8%. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine, worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $13.6 billion increased 2.5%, with growth of 8.4% in the U.S. and a decline of 4% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 8.3%, both worldwide and outside of the U.S. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with nine assets delivering double-digit growth. We continued to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. DARZALEX growth was 21%, primarily driven by share gains of six points across all lines of therapy and ten points in the front line setting. As of this quarter, we are now disclosing TECVAYLI sales, which were previously reported in other oncology. Sales achieved $133 million in the quarter, compared to $63 million in the first quarter of last year, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed refractory setting. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $157 million, compared to $72 million in the first quarter of last year, driven by continued capacity expansion, manufacturing efficiencies, and strong demand. While sequential growth was roughly flat due to phasing, we continued to anticipate quarter-over-quarter growth with acceleration in the back half of the year. Other oncology growth was driven by continuing strong uptake of TALVEY, our GPRC5D bispecific, and RYBREVANT our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer. Also in oncology, ERLEADA continues to deliver strong growth of 28.4%, primarily driven by share gains. Growth of 22.4% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains, and market growth for both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI. As a reminder, favorable patient mix was a driver in Q2 2023 through Q1 2024. Therefore, while we still anticipate growth, we expect to lap this dynamic beginning in Q2 2024. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in TREMFYA of 27.6%, driven by market growth and share gains. STELARA growth of 1.1% was driven by market growth and share gains in IBD, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in the U.S. and as expected, share loss in PSO and PSA. We anticipate continued volume growth largely offset by price declines as we move towards biosimilar entry. In neuroscience SPRAVATO growth of 72% continues to be driven by share gains and additional market launches. Total Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in XARELTO, which we anticipate continuing throughout the year, as well as a decrease in IMBRUVICA due to competitive pressures, partially offset by stocking dynamics in the U.S. Finally, it is worth noting distribution rights for REMICADE and SIMPONI in Europe will be returned in Q4. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide Med1ech sales of $7.8 billion increased 6.3%, with growth in the U.S. of 6.6% and 6.1% outside of the U.S. In the quarter, worldwide MedTech growth was negatively impacted by approximately 80 basis points due to fewer selling days, disproportionately impacting orthopedics. In cardiovascular previously referred to as Interventional Solutions, electrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 25.9%, with strong growth in all regions. Performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake, commercial execution, and a onetime inventory build in Asia-Pacific, impacting worldwide growth by approximately 370 basis points. In addition, Abiomed delivered growth of 15%, driven by continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. Orthopedics growth of 4.8% includes a onetime revenue recognition timing change related to certain products across all platforms in the U.S. positively impacting worldwide growth by approximately 300 basis points. As a reminder, orthopedics was over indexed by the impact of reduced selling days in the quarter. Strong performance in hips and knees was driven by procedure recovery, growth of new products, and commercial execution. While trauma and spine were negatively impacted by competitive pressures and core trauma was further impacted by weather related softness in the U.S. Growth of 1.9% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our bio surgery and wound closure portfolios, partially offset by competitive pressures in China volume based procurement and energy and endo cutters. Contact lenses declined 2.3%, driven by U.S. stocking dynamics, partially offset by strong performance in ACUVUE OASYS 1-day family of products. Worldwide growth was negatively impacted by 120 basis points due to the Blink divestiture in Q3 2023. Surgical Vision grew 1.1%, driven by CNIS EYHANCE, a monofocal intraocular lens partially offset by China's VBP. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2024. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of product sold margin leveraged by 160 basis points, primarily driven by lower COVID-19 supply network related exit cost. Selling, marketing, and administrative margins deleveraged 110 basis points, driven primarily by timing of marketing investment in the Innovative Medicine business. We continued to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels investing $3.5 billion, or 16.6% of sales this quarter. We invested $2.9 billion, or 21.4% of sales in Innovative Medicine, with the increase in investment being driven by continued pipeline progression. In MedTech, R&D investment was $0.6 billion, or 8.3% of sales, a slight decrease driven by phasing. Interest income was $209 million in the first quarter of 2024, as compared to $14 million of expense in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in income was driven by a lower average debt balance and higher interest rates earned on cash balances. Other income and expense was income of $322 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to an expense of $6.9 billion in the first quarter of 2023. This change was primarily due to the $6.9 billion charge related to the talc settlement proposal recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 16.9% versus 61.8% in the same period last year, which was primarily driven by the tax benefit on the talc settlement proposal recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.5% versus 15.9% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the first quarter of 2024 our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise, as a percentage of sales increased from 36.1% to 36.8%, primarily driven by an increase in non-allocated interest income with both Innovative Medicine and MedTech margins remaining relatively flat year-over-year. When comparing against the fourth quarter and full year 2023, Innovative Medicine and MedTech adjusted income before tax margins have improved. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I am now pleased to turn it over to Joe.",1634.0,915.0,34.0,19.0,18.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,1.0,10.0,0.03715846994535519,0.020765027322404372,0.019672131147540985,0.002185792349726776,0.0,0.01639344262295082

As you just heard, we are off to a solid financial start in 2024, complemented by sustained momentum within our Innovative Medicine and MedTech pipelines, marked by significant regulatory and clinical milestones. Before we delve into segment highlights from the quarter, I want to touch upon some important announcements that we made that will further enhance our competitive positioning. Earlier this month, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Shockwave Medical. Johnson & Johnson has a long history of addressing cardiovascular disease through both our Innovative Medicine and MedTech businesses. The acquisition of Shockwave with its leading intravascular lithotripsy or IVL technology will provide us with a unique opportunity to impact coronary artery and peripheral artery disease, two of the highest growth innovation oriented segments within cardiovascular intervention. This addition is not only adjacent to our other cardiovascular businesses but also consistent with our strategy of becoming a best-in-class MedTech company. During the first quarter, we also expanded our Innovative Medicine portfolio with the completion of the Ambrx acquisition. With its promising pipeline and ADC platform, Ambrx will further strengthen our oncology portfolio and ability to deliver enhanced precision biologics that treat cancer. Now I'll move to segment highlights from the quarter. As Jessica previously shared, our growth in Innovative Medicine continues to be driven by momentum from key brands and the adoption of new products. During the quarter, we hit several regulatory and clinical targets that are key to delivering longer-term growth. Starting with oncology, in multiple myeloma, we received FDA approval and a positive CHMP opinion for CARVYKTI for patients who have received at least one prior therapy, making it the only BCMA targeting treatment available for patients in the second-line setting. We also received biweekly dosing approval from the FDA for TECVAYLI, the only approved BCMA targeting bispecific antibody that provides patients with dosing flexibility. And finally, we submitted an application to the EMA for regulatory approval for DARZALEX-based quadruplet therapy and were granted U.S. priority review by the FDA. In addition, we made significant steps forward in the treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. During the quarter, we received FDA approval for RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations. The approval was based on data from the Phase III PAPILLON Study. We also received priority review from the FDA and submitted a filing to the EMA for RYBREVANT in combination with lazertinib as a first-line treatment option for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation non-small cell lung cancer. The priority review and filing to the EMA are supported by data from the landmark Phase 3 Mariposa Study. Turning to our immunology portfolio, we submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application to the FDA seeking approval for TREMFYA in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We are looking forward to presenting data from the Phase 3 QUASAR Study evaluating TREMFYA in patients with ulcerative colitis at Digestive Disease Week in May. We also significantly advanced our pipeline with important data readouts including positive top-line results from the Frontier 2 study demonstrating JNJ2113 as the first and only investigational targeted oral peptide that maintains skin clearance in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis through one year. Nipocalimab also delivered positive topline results in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in adults with Sjögren’s Disease and Myasthenia Gravis, respectively. We also received FDA breakthrough designation in the treatment of HDFN, hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, and fast-track designation for FNAIT, a rare and potentially fatal blood disorder in infants. Looking ahead, we expect upcoming data readouts for ERLEADA in localized prostate cancer as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder. We also expect Phase 2 results for our combination therapy JNJ4804 in psoriatic arthritis as well as pivotal data from TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer which will be presented at the American Urological Association Annual Meeting in May. Lastly, we're excited to present our Phase 3 TREMFYA Crohn's disease data as well as our Sub-Q data for RYBREVANT at upcoming medical meetings. In MedTech, notable highlights in the first quarter includes significant advancements across our cardiovascular portfolio. In Pulsed Field Ablation, we received CE Mark approval for VARIPULSE based on the 12-month INSPIRE Study which demonstrated 80% of patients achieved freedom from recurrence and zero primary adverse events. We filed for U.S. approval of VARIPULSE based on the ADMIRE Study which showed all pilot phase patients achieved acute success and 80% remaining free from atrial arrhythmia recurrence after one year. We also submitted a CE Mark filing for our Dual Energy Smart Touch SF Catheter, which will provide physicians the optionality for RF and PFA energy sources in one catheter. We began enrollment of patients in a pivotal trial evaluating Laminar's left atrial appendage elimination device to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and the late-breaking DanGer Shock Study presented at the American College of Cardiology Conference and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine, confirmed routine use of Abiomed’s Impella CP in patients who have had a heart attack with STEMI cardiogenic shock reduced 180-day mortality by 12.7%. In vision we launched TECNIS PURE C, a next-generation presbyopia-correcting lens for cataract patients in EMEA. We also presented new data for our presbyope correcting IOL, TECNIS Odyssey at the 2024 American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery in April. Looking ahead, we will continue to advance our electrophysiology pipeline with the full U.S. market release of the QDOT microcatheter, the U.S. commercial launch of Abiomed Impella RP Flex with SmartAssist as well as the submission of Impella ECP. Within our robotic surgery pipeline, we are on track to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for Otava [ph] in the second half of 2024. Turning to financials, starting with cash and capital allocation. We ended the first quarter with $26.2 billion of cash and marketable securities and $33.6 billion of debt for a net debt position of $7.4 billion. We are pleased with our free cash flow generation in the first quarter of approximately $3 billion. This was above the first quarter of 2023, which included the consumer health business cash flow. Also in the first quarter of 2024, we incurred elevated payment levels made in furtherance of achieving a responsible, final, and comprehensive resolution of the talc litigation. We continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet and strong credit rating, underscoring the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial position and ability to execute against our capital allocation priorities. Innovation continues to be a main priority for the company, as demonstrated by our industry-leading R&D spend. During the first quarter, we invested more than $3.5 billion in research and development or 16.6% of sales. We also remain committed to returning capital directly to shareholders through our dividend. We appreciate the value our investors place on the dividend, and we were pleased to announce this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a 4.2% increase marking our 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases. As we stated previously, we are disciplined in our approach to inorganic growth and prioritize acquisitions that strategically fit and present meaningful long-term growth opportunities. This is evidenced by the pending transaction in which we are adding a profitable commercialized portfolio of Shockwave Technologies in high-growth markets as well as a robust pipeline. I'll now discuss our full year 2024 guidance, which excludes the recently announced acquisition of Shockwave. As previously communicated, we assume the closing of the transaction will take place by midyear 2024 at which time we will update our guidance to reflect the expected dilution to adjusted earnings per share in 2024 of approximately $0.10 per share driven by financing costs. Based on the results delivered in the first quarter, we are tightening our ranges and increasing the midpoint for our full year operational sales and adjusted operational EPS guidance. As such, we expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.0% or $88.7 billion to $89.1 billion increasing the midpoint by $300 million or 0.3%. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we utilized the Euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of 1.09. As of last week, the Euro spot rate was 1.08, a modest strengthening of the U.S. dollar also experienced by a handful of other currencies. As a result, we now estimate a negative full year foreign currency impact of $700 million resulting in an estimated reported sales growth between 4.7% to 5.2% compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $88.2 billion or 5% at the midpoint, consistent with last quarter's guidance. We are maintaining other elements of our guidance provided on January's earnings call, with the exception of two items, we are increasing interest income to a range of $550 million to $650 million. We are also tightening the range of our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance from $10.60 to $10.75, increasing the midpoint by $0.03 to $10.68, reflecting year-on-year growth of 7.7%. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year estimates a negative foreign exchange impact of $0.03 per share. As a result, the reported adjusted earnings per share remains unchanged at $10.65, reflecting 7.4% growth versus 2023. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, we continue to expect that the same qualitative considerations provided during January's earnings call to remain intact. We anticipate Innovative Medicine sales growth to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half given the anticipated entry of STELARA Biosimilars in Europe midyear. For MedTech we expect operational sales growth to be relatively consistent throughout the year. Looking ahead, we have many important catalysts in the pipeline that will drive meaningful near and long-term growth across both Innovative Medicine and MedTech. We look forward to advancing our pipelines in both segments to deliver innovative treatments, solving some of the most complex health challenges. This wouldn't be possible without our employees around the world, so it's only appropriate before turning to your questions that we recognize and thank our colleagues for their continued hard work, commitment, and dedication to patients. I'm pleased to be joined by Joaquin, Jennifer, John and Tim for the Q&A and kindly ask Kevin to provide instructions to initiate that portion of the call.",1784.0,966.0,38.0,14.0,12.0,5.0,2.0,11.0,3.0,4.0,0.039337474120082816,0.014492753623188406,0.012422360248447204,0.005175983436853002,0.002070393374741201,0.024844720496894408

First, on CARVYKTI, I was just wondering if you could elaborate on the phasing comments that impacted sales in the quarter? And then secondly, on TECVAYLI, how should we think about growth for this product, it looks like it's been somewhat flattish over the last couple of quarters, but just wondering if TALVEY had an impact there, so as we think about those franchises back half of this year, maybe you could provide high-level commentary?

And before we go into the specifics of your question on CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI and TALVEY, our multiple myeloma franchise, let me share with all of you some reflections on this quarter. We are entering 2024 in a position of strength, and I'm particularly encouraged on the performance of our strategic platforms, the ones that are going to drive growth in the second half of the decade. In Innovative Medicines, DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA all grew over 20% and specifically on TREMFYA, now we have more sales in our psoriasis and psoriatic arthritic indications than we do with STELARA and we have high expectations for the brand with ulcerative colitis data to be presented at the Digestive Disease Week just a few weeks from now and also data on Crohn's Disease to be presented also this year. We continue to see increased demand from our new product launches, SPRAVATO, TECVAYLI, TALVEY, CARVYKTI with CARVYKTI just a few weeks ago receiving FDA approval to move into the second line setting. Now let me move into MedTech. We have demonstrated a strong performance across cardiovascular, in electrophysiology and Abiomed and we have made significant progress with our PSA portfolio. We also have delivered several important capital allocation milestones in Q1, investing heavily in R&D, raising our dividend for the 62nd consecutive year closing the Ambrx acquisition and announcing the planned acquisition of Shockwave Medical. As you have heard from Joe in his prepared remarks, we continue to make progress on achieving a responsible final and comprehensive resolution of the talc litigation. Overall, I'm proud of the performance in the quarter, both in terms of the solid financial but also the numerous pipeline advancements. It is a solid start of the year that puts us in a position of strength for 2024. And it also the sustained progress gives us -- give me great confidence in achieving our long-term growth goals of operational sales compounded annual growth rate of 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030. Overall, it gives me great confidence in the future of Johnson & Johnson, now to Jennifer on your question, Terence, on CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY.",359.0,156.0,11.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.07051282051282051,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.00641025641025641,0.0,0.04487179487179487

Just also a quick shout out and a big thanks to our Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world, delivering 8.3% adjusted operational growth, definitely above-market growth for the quarter, with strength being really across our core launch, our core and launch brands, nine brands achieving double-digit growth, 10 actually, if you include TALVEY in that mix. A strong pipeline progress that Joaquin noted and also the announcement and closing of our acquisition of Ambrx really to add another key pipeline asset for us as well as key technology that can help us in ADCs. So really strong quarter all the way around. With respect to your question specifically in multiple myeloma and then CARVYKTI and TALVEY, multiple myeloma continues to be a true stronghold for us, and we had significant performance and growth across the board in those assets during the quarter. I can start off real quickly with DARZALEX with 21% growth, predominantly with that growth coming in the frontline setting and also it was noted that [indiscernible] data has been filed, which will offer us an additional expansion in frontline. For CARVYKTI, we had over 100% growth versus the first quarter of 2023, very, very strong demand. We did have both the ADCOM in the United States, which results in an unanimous recommendation for approval and then the subsequent to the end of the quarter, approval of CARVYKTI for that line two plus which we think bodes very well. I know there's always questions on how are we doing and where we're expanding our capacity, given the strength of the data and the additional data that's coming through in indications. I'm real happy to say we have doubled our manufacturing capacity since the beginning of 2023 for cell processing. We are continuing to work on our Gant [ph] facility to have that as a secondary source of supply. We brought on some contract manufacturers, and we have completely transformed and expanded antivirus production so that, that's not a rate-limiting step for us. So I know we were a flat -- roughly flat quarter-to-quarter from 4Q to 1Q as noted, that really just was some phasing and timing of orders and when they were actually delivered and built for nothing that -- anything to really see there. We do anticipate continued growth for this asset, particularly second half versus the first half as we continue to add more slots and expand our capacity. And based on the data and everything that we're seeing, we've continued to have a lot of optimism for how CARVYKTI is performing. Likewise, as it relates to TECVAYLI, the TECVAYLI launch is going very well around the world. Consistently, we're seeing very strong uptake and rapid adoption, whether we're in the U.S., Germany, Austria, France, the major markets that have launched to date and really as the first and we believe best-in-class off-the-shelf BCMA bispecific, we really believe that, that therapy is offering deep and durable responses. And so a lot of optimism for continuing to drive the launch there. The product is performing well in the later line settings and is also performing very well from a competitive standpoint. And last but not least is actually TALVEY, which is our 10th product with double-digit growth, although that falls in the all other oncology categories. So we're not fully breaking that out yet. But very, very strong uptake as the first in GPRC5D off-the-shelf by bispecific as well. So I think what this really means is we have got fabulous opportunities across lines of therapy with what we believe are truly best-in-class agents and many of these agents have potential as well to be combined as we work towards curing multiple myeloma. So a significant business for us, and I'm very positive on our outlook for the rest of the year and going forward.",666.0,312.0,16.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.05128205128205128,0.00641025641025641,0.016025641025641024,0.003205128205128205,0.003205128205128205,0.04487179487179487

And let me maybe just reflect a little on the journey that we've been on. As you know, we surpassed $30 billion last year with adjusted operational growth of 7.8%. And I think it's important to note that when we compare ourselves against the majority of the competitors within our competitive composite, we are double their size. So that is performance that we are particularly proud of. We've now followed that up with another solid quarter of 6.3% growth in the first quarter. Now Larry, to your point, there has been some noise in that. We are particularly proud of the tremendous double-digit growth within our Electrophysiology business. And to put that in context, this is a business that is nearing on $5 billion, growing north of 20%. And I think that really calls out the leadership position, which we're continuing to build on and couldn't be more excited about the progress we're making in PFA, which we believe also will continue to drive that performance. There has been some noise specifically in relation to our Vision business. But please rest assured, we are extremely confident in the underlying health of our Vision portfolio. This is a business that grew 6.6% last year, and we expect it to grow in high single-digit performance this year. There has been some stocking issues related to distributor inventory, which was the predominant driver of the performance you see this year. But once again, very confident that we'll see that return to strong single-digit performance for the remainder of the year. There have been a couple of one-timers both in terms of selling days, as we mentioned earlier, about 80 bps of selling days and then a revenue recognition change within our orthopedics business, which impacted that business by about 300 basis points. But all in all, a strong quarter Larry, and we remain very committed to strong high single-digit growth for the remainder of the year for 2024.

I guess following the Shockwave acquisition, what's the appetite, I guess, for further away, maybe talk about like larger tuck-in type transactions either in your MedTech or Pharma business. It just seems like the portfolio and the pipeline at J&J has evolved pretty nicely over the past few years and I'm interested if you think the business is now at a point where we can think about maybe smaller earlier-stage assets as the primary focus for BD or do you still have a greater sense of urgency either in MedTech or pharma to add some of these kind of bolt-on type transactions going forward?

I'm glad that you recognize the strategic consistency of our M&A trajectory, and that's good. Our M&A strategy looks for the long term. So it's not going to change. Our capital allocation strategy will continue to be disciplined and M&A, it's going to be -- remain a critical component of that. And it's important for me to underline that with the strength of our cash flow and our balance sheet, we have significant flexibility to consider multiple types of transactions, as you mentioned. And what we have done so far is a demonstration of that with Abiomed, Laminar, Ambrx, and now the planned acquisition of Shockwave, all of them are good examples of our study consistency and the principles that we have outlined to you. So that is not going to change. Our M&A strategy is not going to change. We'll continue to evaluate opportunities agnostic to the sector and size and what we are looking for, it's a number of components. One, does this technology improve the current standard of care. That's critical for us. To what extent we believe there is a patient impact, which is positive. Number two, does it -- is it consistent with the capabilities and knowledge that we have in-house. We see a correlation between that and the success in the acquisitions. Number three, does it enable us to enter into higher growth markets, so areas that are growing in which we can continue to develop that market. And finally, and very important for us, does it continue to deliver a compelling financial result for our shareholders. So that's our M&A strategy, and it's been a cornerstone of our ability to create value.

As I mentioned earlier, this is a business that grew 6.6% in 2023 and actually consistently grows in high single-digit. We absolutely believe in the underlying health of our Vision business and that it remains strong and continues to perform above market. As I mentioned earlier, the Q1 performance was predominantly driven by a contraction of U.S. distributor inventory in contact lens. As we have mentioned in the past, we had some variability in terms of our supply, which resulted in changes within distributor inventory. We've now started to see that as our supply for contact lenses has stabilized, we've started to see a normalization of the inventory that our distributors are carrying on hand. And so that is the big driver in the results that you see today. As you know, in contact lens, this is an annuity business where it's all about how you gain your fair share of new users, while at the same time, protecting the base. We are incredibly pleased with the ongoing performance of our premium ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family and we are seeing unprecedented share gains in multifocal. I will also say that if we look at sequential share gains across the contact lens business, we are seeing sequential gains, which should bode well for continued performance for the remainder of the year. Specifically to IOLs, as you know, we are not currently a market leader, but we are expecting to deliver the fourth consecutive year of global share gains driven primarily by tremendous performances of our IOL business in Asia Pac and in EMEA. We're also excited, as you heard from Jess earlier by the limited market release of our TECNIS PURE C and Odyssey next-gen multifocals and we'll see a full release occurred through the remainder of the year. So once again, very confident that you will see tremendous improvement in the performance of that business, and we expect high single-digit growth for Vision for 2024.

So yes, we're really pleased with our Pulmonary Hypertension results for the first quarter with both OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI, delivering strong growth that was both volume and share gains in the market as well as some favorable patient mix and really rounding out a year of favorable patient mix. That last piece we don't see continuing to go forward to the same degree. But the products are performing very well for patients with PAH. Importantly, in the quarter, we got approval for OPSYNVI, which is the first combination tablet of PDE5 and an ERA. This is in line with guidelines. It's really once a patient is diagnosed really the right first choice for them is to start them on combination therapy. And so we think that this is an important introduction. And as we take a look at our portfolio and even despite other new competitors that are coming in, we do believe with OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI, they have got very strong usage and both with the launch of OPSYNVI as well as what we have, that these will continue to be really productive assets and a good therapeutic area for us.",200.0,85.0,8.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.09411764705882353,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.0,0.0,0.09411764705882353

As we communicated in the fourth quarter of last year, we still see some remnants of procedural backlog that are benefiting primarily our Orthopedics business, and we expect that to continue at least to the first half of 2024. As you mentioned, our overall performance in Orthopedics of 4.8% was impacted by a onetime change in revenue recognition timing. And this is only related to our U.S. business, but it did impact that business by about 300 basis points. Now keep in mind, we also had the impact of the fewer selling days, which disproportionately impacted our ortho business by 80 bps. We are proud of the ongoing progress we're making, specifically in areas where we needed to compete better and specifically in hips and knees, we saw high single-digit growth in the first quarter and specifically in knees driven by the tremendous performance of our VELYS platform. We're now within two years in 18 markets, 50,000 procedures and are seeing that as a constant tailwind as we now expand the provision of VELYS into EMEA and Asia Pac through the remainder of the year. And so I think you can expect continued improvement in our Orthopedics business for the remainder of the year as we continue to build our portfolio and drive further expansion across the globe.

I'll take the INVEGA SUSTENNA question, and I'll pass it over to my colleague, John to take the next one. So if we think about our LAI portfolio, our long-acting injectable just as a reminder for everybody, we really are leading therapies in this space with our INVEGA SUSTENNA, INVEGA TRINZA and INVEGA HAFYERA products. And we're really excited about the latest data that we have, particularly for HAFYERA, which a recent study shows that at two years, 96% patients on HAFYERA are relapse free, which is really, really striking. So as we get to the legal question, we really don't speculate on the impact of ongoing litigation. But that being said, we remain really confident about the strength of our INVEGA SUSTENNA patents, and we're going to continue to defend the intellectual property that's associated with these patents. If we're clear to go a little bit deeper, the Federal Circuit’s April 1st decision did not invalidate our patent. It just remanded the case back to the New Jersey District Court, the one that had ruled in our favor originally. Likewise, there was another ruling and another case on this patent against a different company that also did go in our favor. So it's going back to the original judge that ruled in favor of the patents, and we'll have to see what comes. We don't speculate on that, but we remain really confident on the strength of our patents.",252.0,111.0,7.0,6.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.06306306306306306,0.05405405405405406,0.018018018018018018,0.04504504504504504,0.0,0.009009009009009009

Thanks for your interest in the platform that we have, the drug device combo for early bladder cancer. Clearly, a great unmet need and as much as there are more than 600,000 people every year who are diagnosed with early bladder cancer and the vast majority of those patients go on to have their bladders removed, which clearly has a very detrimental effect on quality of life. With our drug device system which I think, again, is a great example of how MedTech and pharma can come together in a synergistic way, but we delivered really, I think, exciting early data. Those were presented at the ESMO conference last September and showed, for example, with the TAR200 product that has gemcitabine, an impressive complete response rate of over 75% and nice durability with 21 out of 23 patients, we showed at that meeting is still ongoing and no patients having had to progress to a radical cystectomy. So I think at the AUA, because those data are not yet disclosed, I can't provide the details, but I think you can expect to see more of the same now with longer follow-up and with more patients. We've expanded those cohorts and do believe that we're on track to deliver pivotal data in that first indication, which is in the BCG nonresponsive patients recollect that in early bladder non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Standard care is this attenuated micro bacteria BCG. Unfortunately, fewer than half patients receive -- achieve a complete response. And the therapy is -- has tolerability problems to say the least where patients feel like they have a chronic urinary tract infection. The discontinuation rate with TAR200 has been very low. So we're very delighted with the excellent tolerability profile as well as these impressive deep efficacy, deep and durable efficacy. So yes, so please watch that AUA presentation.

As Joaquin mentioned, we've made a lot of progress in building out our portfolio. And until recently, we only participated in one high-growth category within cardiovascular and that being electrophysiology, which I will touch on performance in a second. We are and have had a 20-year lead in electrophysiology and now have built on that position in cardiovascular with the acquisition of Abiomed. We're now over a year into integrating that business and couldn't be more proud of the progress we've made. We continue to perform ahead of the deal model. And once again, this quarter did so with growth in excess of 15%. That gives us now two leadership positions within cardiovascular care. Once we close the acquisition of Shockwave, that will be our third very thoughtful and deliberate move to only participate in high-growth, high-margin cardiovascular areas where there is significant unmet need and tremendous opportunity for us to grow. And so we're very excited by the fact that we will be one of the only strategics with only high growth, high-margin businesses in the largest category within MedTech, $60 billion market, growing roughly 8%, incremental $5 billion of growth coming out of that category each and every year. So very excited by those moves. Specifically, to your questions on EP, we've seen growth across the board in excess of 20%, both in the U.S. and ex U.S. And I think it really talks to the trust that our customers have in our technology today. RF and our portfolio of RF products are the most trusted and tested products with 20 years of experience. And by the way, we're not going to miss PFA, the progress we've made on ensuring that we can build our presence in that category with the approval in the EU as well as in Japan. We've also submitted for FDA approval. And while we don't control the timing, we expect that approval to come through by the end of this year or early next year. And so very confident in our ability to build on our leadership position in EP.

Now this was a strong quarter. Can we see that sort of growth every single quarter, not absolutely sure, but we do expect high single-digit growth out of both of those categories going forward. I will also say that the work we've done in the orthopedics areas hasn't been just about growth. It's also about improving our margin profile. And you know that in the second quarter of 2023, we announced a major restructuring, which is focused on really simplifying our portfolio and focusing our business on where we could drive the greatest impact for patients and for shareholders. That effort is resulting in a 20% reduction in our implants. And just to put that in context, we have 100,000 implants today within our orthopedics business.

We continue to be really pleased with the uptake of SPRAVATO as we continue to launch that product globally. You saw that there's over 70% growth in the quarter as it continues to perform well for patients with treatment-resistant depression. And so we've got a bold outlook for SPRAVATO as we continue to launch it into more markets and as we are able to even further penetrate the existing markets that we're in into a bit more of the community setting there. In terms -- so good -- really, really good outlook. We're also just to put in a plug for neuroscience. We talk a lot about our oncology business and our immunology business. Neuroscience is also a key area for us, so SPRAVATO is a key platform. We've also got aticaprant and seltorexant coming, and we had mentioned the long-acting therapies with the INVEGA SUSTENNA franchise earlier. So back on IRA, we've been really clear that we do think that these -- the IRA’s drug setting provisions are damaging to the health care innovative system. It just -- it is not something that is going to help reinforce the tremendous investments that we're making in R&D to develop the next types of treatments and cures. That being said, we do focus on patient access and are trying to make sure that our products are available to the patients who need them. And so we're working appropriately with the government and in line with the process to start going back and forth around what the ultimate price will be. So there has been a round or two of going back and forth. And so we're still in the middle of that process. I can't really provide any more details on that. What I will say is that the products that we have that are going through the process, they are not our growth drivers for the future. Those are -- they are our products that are more at end of life. And so they're not the ones that are going to be really key for us both in the coming years as well as out through the end of the decade. And what I'd love to also reinforce is that we do remain confident that we've got a clear path to achieving our $57 billion commitment that we made back in December at our Enterprise Business Review as well as from 2025 to 2030, delivering above market growth with the 5% to 7% compounded annual growth rate and with growth in every year that being 2025 as well as all of the years beyond that.

Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Turning to our second quarter sales results. Worldwide sales were $22.4 billion for the second quarter of 2024. Sales increased 6.6%, with growth of 7.8% in the U.S. and 5.1% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, sales growth was 7.2% worldwide and growth of 6.4% outside of the U.S. Sales growth in Europe, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine was 6%. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.93 versus diluted earnings per share of $2.05 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.82, representing increases of 1.6% and 10.2%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2023. I'll now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine, worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $14.5 billion increased 7.8%, with growth of 8.9% in the U.S. and 6.4% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 8.8% worldwide and 8.7% outside of the U.S. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products with 10 assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. DARZALEX growth was 21.3%, primarily driven by share gains of 4.6 points across all lines of therapy and 9.4 points in the frontline setting, as well as market growth. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $186 million, with growth of 59.9%, driven by continued capacity expansion, manufacturing efficiencies, and strong demand. TECVAYLI sales achieved $135 million in the quarter, with growth of 43.5%, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed-refractory setting. Demand remained strong while sequential growth slowed due to adoption of recently approved longer-duration dosing intervals. ERLEADA continues to deliver strong growth of 32.5%, primarily driven by share gains and market growth in metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer. Other oncology growth was driven by continued strong uptake of TALVEY, our GPRC5D bispecific, and RYBREVANT, our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in TREMFYA of 30.7%, driven by market growth, share gains in PSO and PSA, and favorable patient mix. STELARA growth of 4.9% was driven by market growth, partially offset by net unfavorable patient mix. We continue to anticipate biosimilar entry in Europe later this month, while in the U.S., we expect continued volume growth largely offset by price declines as we move towards biosimilar entry in 2025. In neuroscience, SPRAVATO growth of 60.8% continues to be driven by increased physician and patient confidence. In pulmonary hypertension, OPSUMIT grew 9.1% due to share gains and market growth, partially offset by unfavorable mix. UPTRAVI growth of 8.1% was driven by market growth and share gains, partially offset by inventory dynamics. Total Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by a decline in other neuroscience, unfavorable patient mix in Xarelto and competitive pressures in IMBRUVICA. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $8 billion increased 4.4%, with growth in the U.S. of 5.7% and 3.2% outside of the U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures had a positive impact of 40 basis points on sales growth in the quarter. Growth was driven by commercial execution, strength of new product introductions, and continued strong procedure volume, partially offset by performance in China and competitive pressures in US distributor stocking dynamics and vision. In cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered a double-digit growth of 13.4% with strong growth across all regions. The performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake, and commercial execution, partially offset by the previous one-time inventory build in Asia-Pacific from the prior quarter. In addition, Abiomed delivered growth of 15.4%, driven by double-digit growth in all regions and continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. Results include $77 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave, which closed on May 31. Contact lenses adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the Blink divestiture was 2.1%. Growth was driven by strong performance in the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, partially offset by U.S. distributor stocking dynamics and competitive pressures, and Japan macroeconomic pressures. The Blink divestiture negatively impacted growth by approximately 130 basis points. Surgical vision grew 1.2%, driven by TECNIS Eyhance, our monofocal interocular lens, partially offset by China VBP and refractive softness in the U.S. Surgery adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the Acclarent divestiture was approximately flat. Performance was driven primarily by competitive pressures in energy and endocutters, China VBP, prior year China recovery, EMEA tender timing across advanced surgery and supply constraints, and wound closure. This was partially offset by strength of new products. The Acclarent divestiture negatively impacted growth by approximately 110 basis points. Orthopedics growth of 3.3% was driven by strong performance in hips and knees, due to procedure growth, strength of new products, and EMEA tender timing in knees. This growth was partially offset by competitive pressures and impacts of China VBP in spine and sports. Now, turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2024. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed, compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of product sold margin deleveraged by 60 basis points, primarily driven by product mix within innovative medicine and macroeconomic factors across both sectors. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing $3.4 billion or 15.3% of sales this quarter. We invested $2.7 billion or 18.8% of sales in innovative medicine, compared to 22.2% of sales in 2023. As a reminder, last year included an upfront payment of $245 million associated with the AbelZeta partnership. In MedTech, R&D investment was $0.7 billion or 9% of sales, an increase driven by continued investment in strategic platforms. Other income and expense was a net expense of $653 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to income of $384 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in expense was primarily driven by costs related to the closing of the Shockwave acquisition, the loss on the completion of the debt for equity exchange of the retained stake in Kenvue and prior year favorable intellectual property litigation settlements in MedTech. This was partially offset by the gain on the Acclarent divestiture. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 18.5% versus 14.7% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by unfavorable one-time international audit settlements and the continued impact from Pillar 2. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 18.6% versus 15.9% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming second-quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2024, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 37.2% to 37.4%. Innovative Medicine margin improved from 42.3% to 44.6%, primarily driven by an upfront payment of $245 million associated with the AbelZeta partnership in 2023, partially offset by product mix and cost of products sold. MedTech margin declined from 28.2% to 25.7%, driven by prior year favorable intellectual property litigation settlements worth approximately 300 basis points. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I'm now pleased to turn it over to Joe.",1583.0,903.0,38.0,23.0,16.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,9.0,0.042081949058693245,0.02547065337763012,0.017718715393133997,0.005537098560354375,0.0011074197120708748,0.016611295681063124
JNJ,2024-07-17,2024-07-17,,2024-07-17,2024-07-17T08:30:00-04:00,0,2024-07-17,prepared,,Joe Wolk,"Thank you, Jessica, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Overall, Johnson & Johnson delivered solid top and bottom-line, as well as free cash flow growth in the quarter. Our Innovative Medicine business made great progress in the second quarter. We have strong momentum with key end-market products and continue to advance our pipeline with significant clinical and regulatory milestones being attained. Our MedTech business delivered growth that fell below our expectations of growing in the upper range of our markets, which as you recall correlates to a weighted-average market growth rate of 5% to 7% from 2022 through 2027. We came into the year thinking 2024 would be in the upper end of that range. With acceleration planned in the second-half, given some of the first-half dynamics Jessica outlined, we now expect growth closer to 6% for 2024. To me, this reflects the power and breadth of our company, where we can more than offset quarterly volatility in one part with overperformance from another part of our business. Before I get into the numbers, I'd like to provide some qualitative business highlights from the quarter. Starting with innovative Medicine, in oncology, we continue to make meaningful progress across our disease areas of focus. Of note, we received FDA approval for CARVYKTI in earlier lines of therapy and reported positive top-line overall survival results from the CARTITUDE-4 study. We also submitted a filing with the FDA for our subcutaneous formulation of RYBREVANT. We presented updated results for TAR-200 and TAR-210 and we met primary endpoints for two DARZALEX studies, Cepheus and Aquila, where results will be presented at an upcoming major medical meeting. Turning to immunology, we achieved key milestones for TREMFYA in inflammatory bowel disease, including the presentation and filing of Phase III studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, as well as the filing of our subcutaneous formulation, which would make TREMFYA the only IL-23 inhibitor with a fully subcutaneous regimen. We also expanded our immunology portfolio with the acquisitions of Proteologix and NM26. These bispecific antibodies will further strengthen our portfolio and enhance our ability to address significant unmet need in atopic dermatitis. Finally, spanning immunology and neuroscience, we presented positive results for nipocalimab in Sjogren's disease and myasthenia gravis. But it doesn't stop with the second quarter. We are excited for what awaits in the second half of this year with the anticipated approval and launch of both RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib in frontline EGFR positive lung cancer and TREMFYA in IBD. We also expect data from JNJ-2113, our targeted oral peptide in psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, JNJ 4804, our co-antibody therapeutic in IBD and nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. As we continue to bring new innovations to market and execute against clinical and regulatory milestones, Innovative Medicine is well-positioned to achieve sustainable growth in both the near and long-term. Turning to MedTech, we continue to advance our pipeline, launch new commercial products and integrate strategic acquisitions that broaden and further differentiate our portfolio. In cardiovascular, we are enhancing our portfolio and shifting into higher growth markets through strategic acquisitions such as Shockwave Medical. In May, we announced the launch of our CARTO 3 Version 8 electroanatomical mapping system. This is the latest version of our 3D heart mapping system, which has machine learning capabilities that increase efficiency, reproducibility, and accuracy in maps electrophysiologists use to treat atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias. In pulsed field ablation, we initiated the commercial launch of the VARIPULSE platform in the EU and Japan receiving early positive physician feedback in the external evaluation period. We also delivered results from the pivotal phase of the admIRE trial, where the VARIPULSE platform demonstrated 85% peak primary effectiveness with minimal adverse events, short PFA application times and low fluoroscopy exposure. In orthopedics, we received 510(k) FDA clearance for the clinical application of the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. This is designed for both medial and lateral procedures enabling surgeons to guide precise implant placement without a CT scan. In surgery, we launched the ECHELON 3000 in the U.S., which combines 3D stapling and gripping surface technology to enable greater staple line security. This has been shown to deliver 47% fewer leaks, reduce surgical risks and improve surgical outcomes. In surgical vision, we launched TECNIS Odyssey in the U.S., and head into a full market launch in the second-half of 2024. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to advance our electrophysiology and cardiovascular pipelines as we prepare for the anticipated U.S. approval of VARIPULSE, as well as the submission of Impella ECP for regulatory approval. Within robotic surgery, we are on track to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for OTTAVA in the second-half of the year. Before turning to cash flow and guidance, I wanted to provide an update on the talc litigation. As announced on May 1, the company has committed to pay ovarian claimants a present value of approximately $6.5 billion or $8 billion nominally over 25-years, resulting 99.75% of all pending talc lawsuits against the company and its affiliates in the United States. We are currently in a voting period for the plan, where for the first time, claimants are able to vote for themselves for or against the plan. The last day of voting is scheduled for July 26. It will then take a few weeks for the vote administrator to vet and tally the votes. Once that process concludes, we plan to make a public announcement on the next steps regarding a pre-packaged bankruptcy filing. Our confidence that we will reach the requisite 75% vote is bolstered by the continued support of council representing the vast majority of claimants with whom the plan was developed, as well as the announcement of support by additional prominent plaintiff law firms recently, including Ailstock, Keller Postman, and Miller. Additionally, in furtherance of our goal of achieving a comprehensive solution, we finalized the previously announced agreements reached with all states that advanced talc claims in the Imerys and Cyprus entities, owners of the mines that supplied talc to the company. In the second quarter, we continued to make progress with mesothelioma claimants with 95% of claimants now settled. Turning to cash and capital allocation. We ended the second quarter with approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $41 billion of debt for a net debt position of $16 billion. Free cash flow year-to-date was approximately $7.5 billion, compared to $5.5 billion in the prior year period, which included cash flow from the Consumer Health business. During the quarter, we exited our retained stake in Kenvue, bringing the separation to a close. The net proceeds from the secondary offering were $3.6 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We maintain a strong balance sheet, which continues to enable us to strategically invest in and grow our business, while returning capital to our shareholders. Innovation remains core to our strategy. In the second quarter, we invested more than $3.4 billion or 15.3% of sales in research and development. In terms of acquisitions and licensing, during the first half of 2024, Johnson & Johnson has deployed approximately $17 billion in strategic value creating inorganic growth opportunities. This includes Shockwave, Proteologix and the NM26 bispecific antibody transaction announced last week, as well as more than 20 other smaller complementary business development transactions. While we will always explore strategic deals of any size that can create value, we foresee modest tuck-in deals as the preferred route over the near-term. Now turning to our full-year 2024 guidance. Given the moving parts associated with the acquisitions this quarter, I'll start where I usually end with earnings per share. Before the impact of recent acquisitions, our outlook for adjusted operational EPS performance is once again being increased. As this schedule reflects, we are expecting a $0.05 per share increase in our operational performance. This would result in year-over-year EPS growth of 8.2% at the midpoint. To account for the completion of Shockwave, Proteologix, and the NM26 bispecific antibody transactions, and as previously disclosed, our adjusted operational EPS guidance now includes dilution of $0.68 per share. Combined, all of this yields an updated adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range of $10 to $10.10 per share. In addition to assist with your future models, these transactions are expected to have a smaller impact of $0.33 to adjusted operational EPS in 2025. Now to address all elements of P&L guidance for 2024. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. We are increasing our operational sales guidance for the full-year by $500 million to reflect the completion of the Shockwave acquisition. We now expect growth in the range of 6.1% to 6.6% compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $89.4 billion or 6.4% at the midpoint. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, we are maintaining our adjusted operational sales growth to the range of 5.5% to 6.0% compared to 2023. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. We are utilizing a euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of 1.08, consistent with last quarter. However, there have been notable strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies, specifically the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. As a result, we estimate an incremental negative foreign currency impact of $500 million, resulting in a full-year impact of $1.2 billion. As such, combined with the Shockwave acquisition, we expect reported sales growth between 4.7% to 5.2%, compared to 2023 with a midpoint of $88.2 billion or 5% growth. Turning to the rest of the P&L. Based solely on the dilution from the transactions, we now anticipate our 2024 adjusted pre-tax operating margin to decline by 120 basis points, more than offsetting the previously communicated 50 basis point improvement. We projected net interest income between $300 million and $400 million, lower than previous guidance driven by interest expense associated with financing of our recent acquisitions. Other income is anticipated to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, an increase versus previous guidance driven by year-to-date performance. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be between 17.5% and 18.5% for the full-year, much higher than 2023, largely due to the impact of OECD Pillar 2, as well as the non-deductible nature of the recently announced NM26 bispecific antibody acquisition. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations to support your modeling. We continue to expect Innovative Medicine sales growth to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half, given the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe beginning the last week of July. This headwind will be partially offset by continued uptake from our recently launched products. While we had COVID-19 vaccine sales in the second quarter, we do not anticipate any future sales. Finally, it is worth noting that distribution rights for REMICADE and SIMPONI in Europe will be returned in the fourth quarter. In preparation for this transfer, we expect limited third-quarter sales in Europe. Turning to MedTech, as previously stated, we expect growth to accelerate back in line with our long-term expectations in the second-half of the year. This will be driven by recovery in contact lenses, evidenced by sequential monthly improvement within Q2. Further expansion into high-growth segments, including the integration of Shockwave and continued growth of new products and commercial execution across the portfolio. As you think about our adjusted operating margin, we continue to expect it to be higher in the first-half of the year, compared to the second-half. Again, this is due to the IP R&D charge for the NM26 bispecific antibody transaction in Q3 as well as the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe later this month. Lastly, as a reminder on share count, we only expect a partial benefit in the third quarter resulting from the share count reduction following the Kenvue exchange offer in August of 2023 with the fourth quarter being neutral. As we move forward, we remain focused on advancing our differentiated portfolio and achieving key clinical and regulatory milestones across Innovative Medicine and MedTech. We remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained growth and long-term value for patients, customers, and shareholders. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin for concluding remarks before taking your questions.",2050.0,1078.0,39.0,15.0,19.0,15.0,1.0,10.0,2.0,6.0,0.036178107606679034,0.013914656771799629,0.017625231910946195,0.013914656771799629,0.0009276437847866419,0.022263450834879406

With a strong second quarter, I'm excited about the rest of 2024. Our Innovative Medicine business is on track for a 13th consecutive year of above-market growth. Our success is driven by a portfolio of innovative best and first-in-class medicines, many of which have the potential to change the practice of medicine. Across the board, oncology, immunology, neuroscience, we are reinventing treatment paradigms and transforming lives. As Joe mentioned, we have made significant progress across our pipeline. In particular, I would like to highlight two major milestones on the horizon that will help drive sustained growth through 2025 and beyond. First, the approval and launch of RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib for first-line treatment of EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer. And second, the approval and launch of TREMFYA in Inflammatory Bowel Disease or IBD, which follows the recent presentation of data that demonstrated superiority versus STELARA. This represents a meaningful opportunity for TREMFYA as approximately 75% of STELARA sales today come from IBD. We also have regulatory and data milestones for many of the assets that we expect to generate more than $5 billion in peak year sales. As the pipeline and portfolio progress, so too does our confidence in our near and long-term growth trajectory. We are confident in our ability to grow through the upcoming STELARA biosimilar entry and see accelerating momentum through the back half of the decade. In MedTech, year-to-date adjusted operational sales growth of 5.2% reflects continued progress with the portfolio as we move into higher growth markets. As you heard from Joe, we expect MedTech growth to accelerate in the second-half of the year. Growth will accelerate through continued expansion of new products, including ACUVUE OASYS Max 1-Day Contact Lenses, TECNIS Odyssey in the U.S., and VARIPULSE in Europe and Japan. Our confidence in the business outlook remains unchanged. With meaningful outcomes from the danger shock trial in Abiomed and the second quarter close of the shockwave acquisition, we look forward to continue the expansion into high-growth MedTech markets. As you know, Johnson & Johnson is laser-focused on advancing the next wave of medical innovation. We are building on a strong foundation to unlock accelerated growth with a healthy balance sheet and industry-leading investments in the best science and innovation. This enables us to move into the second-half of 2024 from a position of strength.

Real quick before I get into that one, I just wanted to give a quick shout-out to all my internal Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world for a terrific quarter. Our first $14 billion-plus quarter that we hit in over 10 products with double-digit growth. So, really, really a tremendous quarter and looking-forward to a great half of the year as well. So, we are very excited about RYBREVANT plus Lazertinib and the data that we're seeing and really believe that it's going to have a significant place in frontline non-small cell lung cancer. As we've discussed before, there is a significant unmet need in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with about a quarter of patients never even making it to second-line therapy. So, a lot of patients that are there with high unmet medical need. When we take a look at the data that we've been able to generate in terms of PFS and when you add to that, the new data that we brought forward on our subcu dosing, we think together, we're going to have a really winning combination for patients in that frontline setting.

Let me be very clear, we remain absolutely committed to delivering solid growth in the full-year for 2024. And Larry, when you actually look at ‘24 Q2, it was a tougher quarter for us. And we knew this, given the fact that at this time last year around the second quarter, we saw the opening up of the China market, which as you know is an important market for us and that was expected. That was actually by the way, last year our fastest-growing quarter. Now in all transparency, as you heard initially in the comments earlier, there have been two businesses that have or two areas of our business that have performed below expectations. Number one is Vision and secondly, our performance in China, which right now is a very volatile market. Now in Vision, we initially announced in the first quarter some challenges with distributor stocking dynamics here in the U.S., some competitive pressures, as well as some macroeconomic challenges in Japan. What gives me confidence in the turnaround of that business is that we actually saw sequential improvement through the second quarter. Some of those stocking dynamic dynamics I mentioned bled into April, but month-on-month, we saw strong rebound of that business, in fact, to the end of the quarter back to historical levels. And so as we look to the back half of the year, while it's been a slower start there, we're very confident that we're going to be able to bring that business back to historical norms, driven primarily by innovation. Our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day MAX portfolio and that global launch as well as the addition of our premium IOLs with TECNIS PureSee in Asia-Pac and EMEA as well as Odyssey here in the U.S., and so we believe we've got that under control. When I look to the back half onto answer your question more directly, the reason we are confident is firstly, not only the return to more normalized growth within Vision, but in surgery, by the way, that -- all that business also was impacted by a slower start, especially in China. We see that starting to normalize. And also remember in our surgery business, the results were impacted by the divestiture of a Acclarent last year. And so normalized growth -- our adjusted operational growth was actually closer to flat. We see that continuing to grow at low-single-digit through the back half of the year. We're proud of the solid results in ortho and see that continuing to be driven by strong results within hip 6%, in knees, almost 10%, driven by tremendous innovation, especially in VELYS. And then more broadly, I'll end with our real confidence in the growth of our cardiovascular portfolio. And remember, Larry, that we've got an EP business that's $5 billion today, grew 21% last year, 19% for the first-half of the year. In fact, in the second quarter, in the face of competition, here in the U.S. we grew that business 16%. And so we're very confident in our ability to grow that leadership position. And then finally, the addition of Abiomed still continuing to grow ahead of our deal expectations, 15.4%. I think that's going to be bolstered by the landmark results, the first time in 25 years, where we have the DanGer Shock study showing survivability benefits of Impella, which will continue to open new markets for that portfolio. And then finally, I'll end with how delighted we are to inch very, very short order, welcome Shockwave to Johnson & Johnson. We closed that transaction in record timing and are really excited by the fact that we will shortly announce that they will be the 13th business with sales in excess of $1 billion annually.

And the consistent efficacy we've seen across all primary, secondary endpoints, et cetera, is really compelling as a guess that we may be on the first advanced therapy for Sjogren's that disease has ever seen.

And Rick, I'd start with firstly, recognizing that we believe that PFA is really good for electrophysiology and really good for patients. It is a tailwind for the entire market. And as I mentioned earlier, that's a $5 billion market for us today, growing 19% year-to-date. And let me be clear, we clearly see some competition, especially here in the U.S., especially between now and the time that we bring our PFA technology to market, we're confident. While we don't control the timing, we expect to have that by the end of the year or early next year. As you know, we already have and are commercializing our PFA technology in EMEA and in Japan, and we are very fortunate to actually benefit from a very global EP business. What gives us confidence in the future, Larry, is that we believe that while PFA has a role to play in the portfolio, so does RF. From everything we're hearing from EPs around the world, what they like about PFA is the relative safety of the technology, but they also like about RF, which by the way, we have 20-years of leadership in safety and clinical efficacy, is the durability of that product. In fact, even today, Rick, here in the U.S., for every five procedures where PFA is used, RF is used in conjunction. And so we believe that leisure position that we built over the last 20-years will continue, both in RF and then obviously, we're excited by the launch of our PFA technology. You'll know that at the HRS conference in May, we announced the results of our admIRE study, which showed the 86% relative effectiveness -- primary effectiveness of our PFA technology. And we are going to continue to employ the same strategy we did in RF, which is building out a broad portfolio of PFA offerings, both in dual energy, focal, large focal and single shot. Did you know that today, the number one used catheter on the market is our SPF catheter within RF. And we are -- and you'll know that in the second -- first quarter of this year, we announced a application for a CE mark for our dual energy catheter. This will be one catheter used, both for RF and PFA technology. And so we've got a lot of reasons to believe. And I think to touch on your point on CARTO, one of the benefit of our portfolios, not just our energy source and catheters, it really is the installed base of 5,500 CARTO systems around the world. We just version 8 of that software. It is best-in-class in the market. And that's also complemented by highly trained clinical specialists in every cath lab around the world who are supporting EPs each and every day. And so once again, PFA is a good thing for the marketplace, it's a tailwind and we expect to continue to benefit on that.

In terms of IRA and kind of what's been going on, if we take a look at Part D redesign, while we're not externally quantifying the impact at this time, what we can say is that we do anticipate a net unfavorable impact in 2025.

And I think my answer to your sort of volume question will be very brief and consistent with what we've shared before. For the most part, across the portfolio, we've seen volumes normalize. We did mention that we expected to see some of the -- some tailwinds from the backlog within Orthopedics in the first-half of the year. And we've seen that, but we expect that to normalize in the back half. We remain consistent in our belief in the 5% to 7% growth for our end markets and that we will perform well within that. As it relates to pricing, inflation has not been a friend to our industry, and we have put a lot of effort into really ensuring that we can secure preferential pricing across the world. I do think we benefit from the global nature of our business. While there are pockets cost containment efforts that we're managing, like VBP in China, we see tremendous opportunity to really secure a premium pricing, especially where we have differentiated innovation. And especially now that we're entering or are entering is like cardiovascular of significant unmet need, there is tremendous opportunities for us to ensure that we secure premium pricing for truly differentiated innovations, especially in areas like electrophysiology, in heart recovery with Abiomed, and more recently with Shockwave.

And Danielle, we are fortunate to have a global business with more than 50% of our revenue already out of the U.S. And I think that gives us the flexibility to really manage a number of challenges that occur on a quarterly and yearly basis across the world. To Joaquin's point, we've been in China for 37-years. One of the reasons why we've been successful is our ongoing commitment in navigating multiple headwinds and opportunities. And when we look at our performance in China, remember, we had the end of COVID when we came out of lockdown, and so that has impacted the results in the second quarter. But when you look at on the ground, what's really happening is there's two factors. Firstly, you look at the impact of VBP, which is a government-driven cost containment effort. And given our leadership position in China, we are seeing that as a short-term tailwind. We do believe the volume opportunity will far offset over time the impact we're seeing on price, but that certainly is a short-term pain that we are enduring. That has also been exacerbated by the anticorruption campaign. You may know that in July of last year, the government initiated an anticorruption campaign, which actually has had an impact on both procedural volumes and engagement from health care professionals. Now I must reiterate that we see this as a really good thing. We believe that any effort on behalf of any government to really build integrity and compliance into the health system is a good thing for more fair competition and aligns with our credo and our commitment to compliance across all of the markets in which we participate in. So it's a short-term headwind, but long-term, really good for our industry and really good for J&J. We remain absolutely committed to China.

As you will hear, we delivered strong results in the third quarter with 6.3% operational sales growth. Our performance, once again, reflects the unique breadth of our business and our commitment to delivering the next wave of healthcare innovation to patients around the world. It also reflects the work we have done to shift our pipeline and portfolio to high innovation and high growth markets. That work continues, which you saw with the recently completed acquisitions of Shockwave and V-Wave in MedTech and Ambrx, Proteologix and NM26 bispecific antibody in Innovative Medicine. And we are pleased with the progress we are making. In Innovative Medicine, we reported a second consecutive quarter of sales exceeding $14 billion with 11 key brands growing double-digits. DARZALEX became the first product in our portfolio to reach $3 billion in sales in a single quarter. And as you will hear, our pipeline of high innovation, high growth potential assets is advancing rapidly with five major U.S. and EC approvals in the quarter. This includes FDA approval of RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE as first line treatment for EGFR-mutated advanced lung cancer, a transformational step forward for patients, and FDA approval of TREMFYA for active ulcerative colitis, which represents a significant opportunity for Johnson & Johnson, given 75% of STELARA sales today come from inflammatory bowel disease. And with filings and reviews underway for many of our innovative medicines that have the potential to generate $5 billion in peak year sales, we are increasingly confident in our near- and long-term growth trajectory. In MedTech, you can see the impact of our portfolio shift to high innovation, high growth markets, particularly in Cardiovascular. With the recent acquisitions of Shockwave and Abiomed, we are now category leaders in four of the largest and highest growth cardiovascular intervention medtech markets, which in Q3 translated to another quarter of double-digit growth across the Cardiovascular portfolio. And with the full market launch of Shockwave E8 peripheral IVL catheter, we are seeing an immediate impact of the Shockwave acquisition. In Vision, growth is accelerating, and we expect that to continue with the recent full market release of TECNIS Odyssey in the U.S. and ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day contact lenses. We are also excited about the future of our surgery business. As you will recall, in November 2023, we committed to submitting the OTTAVA robotic surgical system for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to the U.S. FDA in the second half of 2024 to initiate clinical trials. I'm pleased to announce that we have met that milestone with the IDE application submitted in Q3. Looking across the enterprise, our high innovation, high growth strategy is working and our progress this quarter speaks to the strength of our commercial and innovation capabilities. We have increased adjusted operational EPS guidance pre-M&A for the third quarter in a row. We have invested $18 billion in high innovation, high growth M&A this year. Based on this quarter's results, we are confident in our expectations for 2025 through the end of the decade and beyond.

JNJ,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,,2024-10-15,2024-10-15T08:30:00-04:00,0,2024-10-15,prepared,,Jessica Moore,"Thank you, Joaquin. Moving to our financial results for the quarter. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Worldwide sales were $22.5 billion for the third quarter of 2024. Sales increased 6.3%, with growth of 7.6% in the U.S. and 4.6% outside of the U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures positively impacted worldwide growth by 90 basis points. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $2.7 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.11 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.69 a year ago. Results in the quarter were impacted by the updated talc litigation settlement proposal, as well as acquired IPR&D expense associated with the NM26 bispecific antibody. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.42, representing decreases of 13.3% and 9%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Results were impacted by the acquired IPR&D expense of $1.25 billion or approximately 1,900 basis points associated with the NM26 bispecific antibody. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide sales of $14.6 billion increased 6.3%, with growth of 7.5% in the U.S. and 4.4% outside of the U.S. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with 11 assets delivering double-digit growth. Results across the portfolio continue to be positively impacted by price increases associated with Argentina hyperinflation, consistent with market practice. We continue to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. DARZALEX growth was 22.9%, primarily driven by share gains of 4 points across all lines of therapy, with 7.7 points of growth in the front line setting as well as market growth. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $286 million, with growth of 87.6%, driven by share gains, continued capacity expansion and manufacturing efficiencies. This reflects sequential growth of 53.2% aligned with our expectations of accelerating growth in the back half of the year. TECVAYLI sales were $135 million in the quarter with growth of 21.4%, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed refractory setting. Demand remained strong, while sequential growth was flat due to continued adoption of longer duration dosing intervals. Finally, within our multiple myeloma portfolio, TALVEY continued its launch trajectory with another quarter of strong growth. We anticipate disclosing TALVEY sales in the first quarter of 2025, which are currently reported in other oncology. ERLEADA continues to deliver strong growth of 26.3%, primarily driven by share gains in metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer and favorable inventory dynamics. RYBREVANT, our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer, contributed to growth in other oncology as we expand approved indications. We also anticipate disclosing RYBREVANT sales in the first quarter of 2025. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in TREMFYA of 14.3%, driven by strong market growth and share gains in PsO and PsA, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. STELARA declined 5.7%, driven by unfavorable net patient mix and share loss, partially offset by market growth. As a reminder, biosimilar competition has entered Europe as of July, and we anticipate U.S. biosimilar entry in January 2025. In neuroscience, SPRAVATO growth of 55.3% continues to be driven by increased physician and patient confidence. In pulmonary hypertension, OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI grew 17.4% and 15.2%, respectively, driven by market growth, share gains and patient mix. As mentioned last quarter, REMICADE and SIMPONI realized limited sales in Europe as we prepare for the return of distribution rights in Q4. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide sales of $7.9 billion increased 6.4% with growth in the U.S. of 7.8% and 5% outside of the U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 270 basis points on worldwide growth, 360 basis points in the U.S. and 180 basis points outside of the U.S. Overall, MedTech growth was driven by commercial execution and strength of new product introductions, partially offset by continued headwinds in Asia Pacific, specifically in China. In Cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 10.7%. Performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake and commercial execution, partially offset by competitive PFA ablation catheter uptake in the U.S., as well as prior year trade inventory dynamics and VBP in China. Abiomed delivered growth of 16.3%, driven by strong growth in all regions and continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. Cardiovascular results also included $229 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave. Contact lenses and other performance improved to 4.7%, driven by continued strategic price actions, strong performance in ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, a one-time benefit from a change in U.S. contract shipping terms worth approximately 150 basis points, as well as lapping prior year impacts from Russia sanctions. Surgical Vision grew 1.9%, driven by TECNIS PureSee and TECNIS Eyhance, partially offset by China VBP and softness in the U.S. Surgery declined 0.7%, with the Acclarent divestiture negatively impacting results by approximately 110 basis points. Performance was driven primarily by competitive pressures in energy and endocutters, as well as VBP and the anticorruption campaign in China. This was partially offset by commercial execution, strength of new products across wound closure and biosurgery and continued price increases associated with Argentina hyperinflation consistent with market practice. Orthopaedics growth of 1.3% was primarily driven by success of recent product launches and commercial execution, partially offset by competitive pressures, impacts of China VBP and revenue disruption from the previously announced Orthopaedics transformation. Now, turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2024. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing nearly $5 billion or 22% of sales, which includes a $1.25 billion payment to secure the global rights to NM26 bispecific antibody. Even when excluding this investment, R&D as a percent of sales increased 30 basis points. Selling, marketing and administrative expense as a percent of sales was leveraged 100 basis points, driven by the realization of optimization efforts following the Kenvue separation. Interest income was $99 million as compared to $182 million of income last year, driven by a higher net debt position primarily related to the financing impacts of the Shockwave acquisition. Other income and expense was a net expense of $1.8 billion compared to an expense of $0.5 billion in the prior year. The increase in expense was driven by a $1.75 billion charge related to the talc litigation settlement proposal, partially offset by prior year higher unrealized mark to market losses on public securities, as well as the monetization of royalty rights. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 19.3% versus 17.4% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by the tax treatment of the NM26 bispecific antibody acquisition and OECD Pillar 2. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.3% versus 15.6% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming third quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now, let's look at adjusted income before tax [by segment] (ph). Innovative Medicine margin declined from 45.4% to 37.9%, primarily driven by the $1.25 billion acquired IPR&D expense to secure the global rights for NM26 bispecific antibody, partially offset by the monetization of royalty rights. MedTech margin declined from 24.7% to 24.1%, driven by increased R&D investment and lapping of a prior year divestiture gain, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. As a result, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 37.6% to 32.4%, with acquired IPR&D expense impacting results by 560 basis points. Starting in 2025, aligned with recent FASB reporting disclosure requirements, we will begin providing additional P&L details by segment. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I'm now pleased to turn it over to Joe.",1343.0,776.0,29.0,19.0,9.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,0.037371134020618556,0.024484536082474227,0.011597938144329897,0.007731958762886598,0.001288659793814433,0.01288659793814433
JNJ,2024-10-15,2024-10-15,,2024-10-15,2024-10-15T08:30:00-04:00,0,2024-10-15,qa,qna_heading,Joe Wolk,"Thank you, Jessica. In the third quarter, Johnson & Johnson delivered results that illustrate not only the breadth of the business, but our ability to consistently beat financial expectations. Innovative Medicine continued to build on strong first-half revenue momentum. We are advancing our pharmaceutical pipeline, achieving significant clinical and regulatory milestones across key therapeutic areas. Our MedTech business, with the addition of Shockwave, delivered operational growth of 6.4% in the quarter, but did experience headwinds in the Asia Pacific region. We continue to fortify our future advancing the OTTAVA robotic surgery system to IDE, expanding VELYS use and launching new intraocular lenses. Due to dynamics in the Asia Pacific region, specifically in China, we are taking a responsibly conservative approach by assuming no material improvement in that part of the business for the remainder of this year. And as such, we expect MedTech adjusted operational sales growth for the full year 2024 to be closer to 5% versus the 6% we referenced last quarter. The strength of a diversified business enables us to more than offset volatility in one part of our business, but yet be in a position to once again increase 2024 guidance for the enterprise. Before diving into the results, I'll take a moment to touch on some enterprise-wide updates from the quarter. We are making progress towards resolving talc litigation. Our pre-packaged bankruptcy plan received overwhelming support from the current claimants of roughly 83% as well as the future claimants representative. As announced last Thursday, the case will be heard in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. And while we remain committed to bringing this matter to a resolution, it would be premature to speculate on timing. In addition to the pipeline highlights Joaquin mentioned, there are some additional notable advancements throughout the quarter. In oncology, we received U.S. and EU regulatory approval for RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy as a second line treatment for adults with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. With FDA priority review underway for a subcutaneous formulation of RYBREVANT, along with data supporting a treatment regimen to reduce adverse events, we are building a best-in-class EGFR portfolio. We also presented Phase 1 data for RYBREVANT with chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer patients, extending the asset's potential beyond lung cancer. In multiple myeloma, we advanced our leadership position with FDA approval and filing of two DARZALEX FASPRO quad-based regimens for newly diagnosed patients. With CARVYKTI, we announced three-year follow-up data showing significantly extended overall survival and gained approval for commercial production at our Ghent facility, further expanding supply capacity. Finally, in oncology, we added to the growing evidence base for our TARIS platform with positive Phase 2b data in patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and positive interim to Phase 2 data in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. In neuroscience, we submitted to the U.S. and European regulatory bodies for what would be the first global approval of nipocalimab for the treatment of people living with generalized myasthenia gravis. For the remainder of the year, we expect approval of TREMFYA subcu for Crohn's disease and data readouts on JNJ-2113, our targeted oral peptide for psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, JNJ-4804, our co-antibody therapeutic for inflammatory bowel disease, aticaprant for adjunctive major depressive disorder and nipocalimab for rheumatoid arthritis. In MedTech, we completed enrollment of the Omny-IRE clinical trial to evaluate safety and effectiveness in mapping and treating symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during standard ablation procedures. Also in Cardiovascular, we are preparing for the anticipated approval of VARIPULSE in the U.S. and the submission of Impella ECP for regulatory approval. In Orthopaedics, we launched several exciting new products in the U.S., including our VELYS SPINE robot and VOLT Plating System. The plentiful pipeline progress across our businesses will ensure continued success. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. Free cash flow year-to-date was approximately $14 billion compared to $12 billion last year, which included eight months contribution from the Consumer Health business. We ended the third quarter with $20 billion of cash and marketable securities and $36 billion of debt for a net debt position of approximately $16 billion. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Our strong balance sheet enables us to strategically invest to grow our business while simultaneously returning capital to our shareholders. Innovation remains core to our strategy. During the quarter, we invested nearly $5 billion in research and development. This is an increase over 2023 levels even after excluding acquired in-process R&D expense. Thus far in 2024, Johnson & Johnson has deployed approximately $18 billion for strategic acquisitions and licensing agreements, which includes the recent acquisition of V-Wave, another innovative treatment in heart failure, which closed last week. Turning to our full-year 2024 guidance. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, we are increasing our adjusted operational sales guidance. We now expect growth in the range of 5.7% to 6.2% with a midpoint of 6%. We are also increasing operational sales growth by $200 million to a range of 6.3% to 6.8% with a midpoint of $89.6 billion or 6.6%. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. For today's call, we are utilizing a euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of $1.10, slightly above last quarter's guidance. This results in an estimated incremental positive foreign currency impact of $200 million, reducing our previous full-year negative impact to $1 billion. As such, we expect reported sales growth between 5.1% to 5.6% with a midpoint of $88.6 billion or 5.4%. Regarding the rest of the P&L, with the addition of the V-Wave transaction, we now anticipate our 2024 adjusted pre-tax operating margin to decline by approximately 200 basis points. Excluding the impact of asset acquisition accounting and related R&D investment, we would be on track to improve operating margins by 50 basis points, which is consistent with what we guided to at the beginning of the year. As we strive to advance and accelerate our pipeline, you can anticipate elevated levels of investment in the fourth quarter. Net interest income is now projected to be between $450 million and $550 million, $150 million greater than our previous guidance. Other income is anticipated to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, an increase versus previous guidance, driven by the one-time monetization of royalty rights, which Jessica referenced, that will be utilized for that higher Q4 investment I referenced a moment ago. Our effective tax rate, consistent with previous guidance, is expected to be between 17.5% and 18.5% for the full year. Similar to last quarter, we have provided an EPS bridge to outline the impact from acquisition activity throughout the year. Before the impact of the V-Wave acquisition, our outlook for adjusted operational EPS performance is once again increasing. As the schedule reflects, we are expecting an incremental $0.10 per share increase on our operational performance for a total increase of $0.18 per share for the year. On this basis, when excluding acquisition activity throughout the year, EPS growth is 9.2%. To account for the completion of the V-Wave transaction, as previously disclosed, our adjusted operational EPS guidance now includes dilution of $0.24 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.06 per share in 2025. Combined, this yields an updated 2024 adjusted operational EPS guidance of $9.91 at the midpoint of the range, basically flat year-on-year despite absorbing approximately $0.92 of acquisition activity. While not predicting the impact of currency movements utilizing the recent exchange rates just referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year now estimates a full year positive impact of $0.02 per share. As such, we expect reported adjusted earnings per share of $9.93 at the midpoint. We are still finalizing our plans for next year, but let me provide you some preliminary qualitative commentary to inform your modeling for 2025. For Innovative Medicine, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver growth despite a significant LOE resulting in sales above the $57 billion commitment we stated in 2021. This will be driven by our end market brands and continued progress from our recently launched products, including TREMFYA in IBD and RYBREVANT in non-small cell lung cancer. Regarding the STELARA LOE, we are planning for biosimilar entries in the U.S. in January, assuming that HUMIRA's erosion curve is a relatively good proxy for your models. We continue to expect a negative impact associated with the Part D redesign. In our pipeline, we anticipate data readouts across all our priority platforms: anticipated approvals of TREMFYA subcu in Crohn's disease, RYBREVANT subcu for lung cancer and nipocalimab in generalized myasthenia gravis, as well as potential filings for TARIS in bladder cancer and aticaprant in major depressive disorder. As a reminder, TREMFYA, RYBREVANT and TARIS continue to be the three largest underappreciated assets in terms of our revenue projections versus what analysts are estimating for the back half of this decade. For MedTech, we continue to expect to deliver on our long-term objective identified at last year's Enterprise Business Review of growing operational sales in the upper end of the 2022 through 2027 weighted average market growth rate of 5% to 7%. We also expect continued adoption of newer products across all MedTech businesses, such as VARIPULSE in electrophysiology, VELYS enabling technology across Orthopaedics, Odyssey and PureSee in Surgical Vision and contributions from our Abiomed and Shockwave integration. Specific to volume-based pricing in China, we expect continued impacts from the rollout of the 2024 tenders in Orthopaedics sports and intraocular lenses and anticipate VBP to continue expanding across provinces and products. Moving to the rest of the P&L. When thinking about operating margin, there are pluses and minuses. Tailwinds include an anticipated reduction of acquired IPR&D expense year-over-year, continued focus on MedTech margin improvement and continued OpEx optimization benefits post the separation. Working against us is unfavorable product mix driven by STELARA biosimilar entrants and Part D redesign. With a brief look at your models last week, the consensus margin does not appear unreasonable, and we'll provide further clarity in January once we complete our 2025 plan. We do not expect to maintain the heightened levels of interest income due to a reduction in interest rates and impact from debt experienced in 2024 related to acquisition activity. Regarding other income and expense, we expect lower net other income due to the non-recurring nature of the monetization of royalty rights experienced in Q3, a lower benefit related to employee benefit programs based on discount rate assumptions, as well as income lost on the Kenvue dividend. Lastly, based on what we know today, under current tax law, we anticipate our 2025 tax rate to be slightly lower than our anticipated 2024 tax rate. To wrap up prior to Q&A, we are pleased with our underlying 2024 performance that simultaneously fortified a strong foundation for continued success heading into 2025. With that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin to open the call for your questions.",1809.0,974.0,37.0,18.0,27.0,9.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,0.037987679671457907,0.018480492813141684,0.027720739219712527,0.009240246406570842,0.002053388090349076,0.019507186858316223

And we're proud of the 6.4% operational growth for the quarter -- sorry, 5.7% for full year. And I think the results really talked about the success of our deliberate move into higher-growth, higher-margin categories, especially in the cardiovascular space. You'll recall, and you'll see that from our results, almost $300 million has been added from the Shockwave acquisition, which continues to perform to expectations as does Abiomed. And we've also added to the portfolio acquisition of Laminar in the fourth quarter of last year, and then more recently, the announced closure of the acquisition of V-Wave, which, once again, takes us into even more exciting high-growth, high-margin opportunities within Cardiovascular. Specifically to Orthopaedics, we believe this is going to be another solid year for Orthopaedics, 3.2% growth for the year. We did have a slightly softer third quarter, which was a result, to your point, of the restructure within Orthopaedics. And as we look to the full year, we expect a return to a significantly better performance, especially in Orthopaedics, which typically has a stronger fourth quarter. And we are seeing tremendous performance specifically within the hips and knees categories growing 6% and 7%. And I think that's really been enabled by the success of our enabling technologies in VELYS in knees, which also, by the way, we've added indication of the [Uni Knee] (ph), as well as our KINCISE and Hip Navigation systems within hips. I'd also add to the Orthopaedics performance, we are significantly addressing portfolio gaps within our trauma portfolio with the launch of TriLeap, [indiscernible] and VOLT in the back half of the year. And I think you know our spine portfolio has been challenged, and we're addressing that with the launch of TELIGEN, our new TriALTIS thoracal lumbar system and the new spine robot, which we just received approval for. As it relates the hurricanes, we did see the impact, certainly of Hurricane Helene, in the final weeks of the third quarter and continue to see the impact of Milton over the last coming days especially in the areas most impacted by those storms. I do think the watch out that we all need to watch carefully is certainly the impact of the recently announced IV saline shortages, which if they do persist, could potentially impact surgical procedures across our portfolio.

And I wanted to start off by having a chance to really recognize and thank all my Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world for fabulous quarter in the third quarter. We really continue to deliver against our strategy with 11 key brands having double-digit growth and achieving a few really notable milestones, notably the TREMFYA approval and launch in ulcerative colitis, also RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE in first line non-small cell lung cancer, and we also completed the acquisition of NM26, which is a Phase 2-ready asset for atopic dermatitis. So, as we take a look at the immunology portfolio, we're really excited about TREMFYA, what we see as the prospects ahead. I just mentioned that we got approval during the quarter for that product in ulcerative colitis. We believe we truly have a winning proposition for that asset in IBD. And it's off to a really nice start with a good -- a really strong reception amongst the medical community. And we see that product having a lot of strength because it's the only dual act of IL-23. So, it blocks both IL-23 and the CD64 receptor cells. It really sets what we believe is a new bar in terms of efficacy with the highest rate of endoscopic normalization. And we've got rigorous head-to-head data versus STELARA showing superiority in Crohn's disease. And we think that we've got unrivaled flexibility and what will ultimately be a subcu both induction and maintenance dose for TREMFYA. So, TREMFYA was $4 billion in sales for the quarter. And that was really on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis alone. When we take a look going forward and what we had seen with STELARA in terms of the strength in IBD and the potential, we think that TREMFYA definitely is an asset that is STELARA size or bigger and better. So, a lot of exciting opportunity for us ahead. For 2113, we're really excited about our oral asset that we're developing. And I'll let John Reed, my colleague, John Reed, actually talk about why we're so excited about it and some of the data -- upcoming data there, but we do think that being able to have that advanced efficacy and known safety profile in a simple oral tablet is not only going to be great for the existing biologics' appropriate patients, but we think it gives us a great market expansion opportunity moving into earlier lines of therapy as well.

As you know, this is our targeted oral peptide, a very exquisite, elegantly designed molecule that binds to and blocks the IL-23 receptor, and it is orally available with once-daily dosing. The psoriasis indication is fully enrolled now, four Phase 3 studies, which are quite broad and include head to heads against TYK2 inhibitors as well as both adult and adolescent patients as well as a study in patients that have disease affecting hard-to-treat areas, scalp and other parts of the anatomy that can be very difficult to clear typically. So, we're really looking quite comprehensively there, and the data will be rolling out in the next few months. So, we look forward to sharing those at the appropriate time. In inflammatory bowel disease, we're in a signal-seeking Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis where we're exploring different doses before moving into more advanced studies, given that the IL-23 pathway is well validated inflammatory bowel disease. Thanks to STELARA and TREMFYA, we're quite confident that those studies will come through for us, but we'll wait for those data later this year to see how that oral medication is faring there. The other thing I'd maybe mention just in case it's not on your radar is we also have a co-antibody approach, we call it 4804, where gus and gol, TREMFYA and our TNF inhibitor are combined for patients tend to be on the more refractory side. And we're in the middle of inflammatory bowel disease studies there that will read out next year. So, really excited about that antibody combination as well.

And I won't go into a lot of detail on DARZALEX, but it's worth noting that we had $3 billion in sales, more than 20% growth. And DARZALEX really continues to perform quite strongly for us as we continue to grow share, particularly in frontline, in both transplant eligible and ineligible patients. I really appreciate the question on CARVYKTI. So, $286 million in sales, 88% growth year-over-year and 53% quarter-over-quarter. And we're really seeing that continued growth for a number of reasons. So first, we're seeing very strong demand based on the CARTITUDE-4 approval for that second-line-and-beyond patients. In addition, overall survival data was just presented for CARVYKTI in this line, which was very, very significant and further adds to the importance of this medicine for patients with multiple myeloma. And the other aspect is we continue to progress really nicely with our continued capacity expansion, both in terms of number of slots per day in Raritan, we gained approval for our Ghent manufacturing site in Europe for commercial production, that is now underway and able to serve patients, and our CMO in the United States as well is producing on the clinical end. And so, all the way around from performance of the product from new data as well as continued capacity expansion, we continue to see very strong performance for CARVYKTI. And as we discussed before, I don't know that we will see that as a complete exact linear growth curve quarter-to-quarter simply because the capacity expansion works in a bit more of a stair-step fashion, but as we have discussed, second quarter for us being definitely more robust than the first half, that's playing through. And I think if you think about that going forward, that makes a lot of sense. And we're over 4,200 patients now with CARVYKTI, and it is the most successful CAR-T launch for across -- throughout the industry across all CAR-Ts. Then last, you asked about TECVAYLI and talquetamab. So, if we take a look at -- start off basically with TEC. So, TEC sales were $135 million and 21% growth for the quarter, but it was flat sequentially. We're seeing really nice uptake in the market in terms of new patients. There's also a dynamic where physicians are treating with longer treatment durations. So, we do think that there's a lot of continued growth and expansion for the product. It's performing very well for patients and not only in its current lines of therapy, but we're also taking a look and studying it in combinations, whether with DARZALEX, whether with TAL. And so, we do believe that there's a lot of growth potential on there. For TALVEY, we're not reporting out the sales yet. I think we'll start on that probably next year. But both TAL and TEC, we continue to expand not only with the academic, but also out into the community setting. And so, we think there's a lot of growth ahead.",522.0,231.0,6.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.025974025974025976,0.012987012987012988,0.008658008658008658,0.0,0.0,0.012987012987012988

With TEC, that is not only the first-in-class BCMA-targeting T-cell engager, but the data really showed also is best-in-class relative to other molecules in that -- of that type. The deepest responses -- complete response rates are approaching 50%, about half of patients. Duration of response is nearly two years, and very low discontinuation rates, less than 5%, showing the weight-adjusted dosing where we can really optimize for the patients, it's really playing out there. Very excited about the early data we're seeing when we combine TEC with dara, where we're seeing really high response rates in patients who have been multiply treated and now in Phase 3 studies in patients with one to three prior lines. And then, similar story with TAL. That is a B-cell preserving target, as you know. So, there are fewer risks of severe infections with TAL. And it has shown in the late line, the highest overall response rates of any T-cell engager bispecific for myeloma. So, we think there's a lot of upside opportunity there. And again, the data in combo with dara are really impressive. So, we're marching along with that combination and where we can have the benefits of both the T cell engager together with the CD38 class.

And we couldn't be more proud of the significant leadership position we've held in this category for more than 20 years. And just to put our performance in context, our EP business is a $5 billion business, which grew 11% in the third quarter and 17% year-to-date. We are actively progressing our launch of VARIPULSE in EMEA and in Japan, where we still are executing against our soft launches. We've had over 800 successful cases. We shared the data from our admIRE study at the recent HRS meeting showing 85% primary effectiveness in that portfolio and that product. And we believe we've got a product that really will hunt. As it relates to the U.S., you're right, we're seeing continued competition, especially in the ablation space, given that we don't currently have a PFA product. But having spent a lot of time in EP labs over the last couple of weeks, I can tell you that we are incredibly excited for the availability of VARIPULSE, which we expect to have approval sometime later this quarter or in Q1 of next year. We are still, by the way, mapping the majority of those cases, Danielle. That's what most people don't see is that while we may not have that product in the portfolio, we are mapping more than 50% of competitive cases. In fact, we've updated our market-leading CARTO software to actually reflect better visualization for competitive products. And what we've seen in the market, and I can't give you specific data, but a significant increase in procedures on the time it's taking EPs to perform ablation procedures with PFA. And by the way, today, we're benefiting from the volume increase from PFA even though we don't have that catheter. And so, that combination of the 5,500 installed base of CARTO system's best-in-class mapping and highly trained mappers, we believe, is a significant advantage and positions us extremely well when PFA comes to market. I will also say that similar to RF, which by the way, we still believe has a play within the portfolio, we have the best-in-class RF catheter with QDOT, 86% primary effectiveness, this winning strategy in RF has been a full portfolio. And similarly, in PFA, beyond our first launch with VARIPULSE, you will see a full portfolio of focal, large focal single shot and dual energy catheters. By the way, we already applied for CE marking for our dual energy catheter. And so, we're confident in our leadership position in EP and our sources of differentiation for the future.

And let me just highlight a couple, and I'll certainly get to your question on China. Firstly, you may know that in February of this year in Korea, the government initiated or at least a strike was initiated among the healthcare professional community. Unfortunately, we don't see any end in sight to that. And so that certainly has been a headwind. We're seeing macroeconomic pressures in Japan. And then, more importantly, to your question, the ongoing impact of volume-based procurement, which has also been exacerbated by the anti-corruption campaign. And by the way, while we believe this is absolutely the right thing to do and we support it for the long term, it is impacting procedures and the engagement by healthcare professionals with companies like ours, especially on premium products. We have a leadership position. We have the largest medtech company in China. And given the high leadership positions, we are seeing a disproportionate impact from VBP. We have five major categories impacted through tenders in 2023 in electrophysiology, trauma, spine, endocutters and energy, and more recently, IOLs and sports in our Orthopaedics business. We do believe that this will be a headwind through the remainder of '24 and into '25. That said, we are absolutely confident that China continues and will continue to be an important part of our portfolio. Even with the impact of VBP, we believe we can deliver tremendous growth and returns for our shareholders. And I think this really talks to the strength of our global portfolio across medtech, the fact that we can offset headwinds in one geography with better performance in places like Europe and the U.S. Please rest assured, we also believe that this part of the world, especially in Asia Pacific, will continue to be a growth opportunity. And let me tell you why. 60% of the world's patients live in that part of the world. And we're proud of the fact that we've been in many of these markets many, many years and expect to continue to do so. The final point I'll make is, let's remember, while, this is a headwind for MedTech, this is not material to Johnson & Johnson.

So, when we refer to patient mix, this is different patients coming through different channels as well as some of the accounting true-ups for the final payments that we make. Then, I will hand it over to Jennifer to specifically talk about the performance and the commercial perspective of TREMFYA and STELARA in the U.S.",126.0,50.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.02,0.02,0.04,0.0,0.0,0.0

In the U.S., it was a little over 9% specifically for that patient mix issue that Jess just spoke about. We do think that the prospects are very strong for continued TREMFYA growth based on what I articulated before around the launches in ulcerative colitis and the upcoming launches that we're planning for in Crohn's disease as well. I think for STELARA, we did see a decline and that, again, sort of similar patient mix piece in the U.S. We've also -- and also we've noted the decline ex U.S., particularly in EMEA due to biosimilar competition. We know that STELARA is near or at its end of life and really that TREMFYA and across the rest of our portfolio, we've got a very robust stable of products with pretty significant growth.",155.0,61.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03278688524590164,0.03278688524590164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

No, we have seen the majority of the impact in the areas impacted by that storm. As I mentioned earlier, I think the watch out is any potential impact from additional shortage of IV fluid, which may impact elective procedures, and certainly, we're continuing to monitor that very carefully. As Joe mentioned, we expect now on the back of the headwinds we mentioned earlier in Asia Pacific to deliver adjusted operational growth of around 5% and north of 6% on an operational basis for the year. We believe that the momentum we're carrying into the fourth quarter, especially in our Cardiovascular businesses with our winning portfolio in electrophysiology, strong double-digit growth in Shockwave, Abiomed, I mean, those are, as you can see from the performance, absolute home runs. The other important dynamic here is that, as we signaled in the first and second quarter, we expect to see improvement within our Vision business, which typically has delivered solid single -- mid-single-digit growth. We had a tremendous third quarter, which really gives us confidence in even stronger fourth. This was delivered by much better performance, especially in our contact lens business. In fact, here in the U.S., our most important market, double-digit growth for contact lenses in the quarter. And this just really has been delivered from a stabilization of our distributor inventory in the U.S., the fact that we're able to get back to taking new wearer share now that we have unconstrained supply, especially within our astig portfolio. And so, we do believe that Vision has a very strong quarter ahead. And then finally, across the portfolio, we're benefiting from tremendous new product launches, both within Cardiovascular, the E8 peripheral catheter within Shockwave, continued performance within Abiomed with our broad portfolio of pumps. And then, within our surgery business as well as orthopaedics, as I mentioned earlier, tremendous new products to add differentiation to the portfolio. And typically, that fourth quarter also is a stronger one for us. So, once again, very confident in our performance at around 5% on an adjusted basis and north of 6% operationally.

Today, we operate in a broad set of high unmet need, high growth and high innovation segments, including oncology, immunology and neuroscience in Innovative Medicine and cardiovascular, vision and robotics in MedTech. In 2024, we continue to make disciplined decisions to exit lower priority businesses while investing industry leading amount in our pipeline, approximately $50 billion in R&D and M&A in the last year, inclusive of the recently announced acquisition agreement with Intra-Cellular Therapies, which I will speak about shortly. And while we have been through a period of transformation, the fundamentals of our company remain the same. Indeed, our enduring success is rooted in two things. First, we are a purpose-driven company guided by Our Credo. And second, we are broadly diversified, meaning that we can truly lead where medicine is going. No other company has the span of expertise and capabilities that Johnson & Johnson has. No other company can impact the entire patient journey as we do. We are not just a Pharma company or a MedTech company. We are a health care company. And our strategies are disease centric focused on end-to-end solutions. Just think about multiple myeloma and the impact of DARZALEX, CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY. Think about heart recovery and the impact of Abiomed's Impella heart pumps and the promise of V-Waves minimally invasive interatrial shunt. Think about mental health and the impact of our INVEGA portfolio, SPRAVATO and the potential of the Intra-Cellular Therapies acquisition we announced last week. And think about inflammatory bowel disease and the impact of STELARA and TREMFYA and the potential of our targeted oral peptide that blocks IL-23 Icotrokinra and JNJ-4804, our Co-antibody Therapeutic targeting IL-23 and TNF. As the only major health care company focused both on Pharmaceuticals and Medical Technology, we are unique in the industry with the financial muscle, global reach and this is expertise to deliver the sustained high pace of growth and innovation that is the hallmark of Johnson & Johnson. The strategic decisions we made in 2024 position Johnson & Johnson for sustained growth through the second half of the decade and beyond and strengthen our confidence in our 2025 guidance. Now to the numbers for 2024. Over the full year, we delivered robust operational sales growth of 7% excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. With SPRAVATO surpassing $1 billion in annual sales, we now have 26 platforms that generate at least $1 billion in annual revenue. In Innovative Medicine, we reported a third consecutive quarter of sales exceeding $14 billion with 10 key brands growing double-digit. Across the full year, we achieved strong growth in oncology, neuroscience and pulmonary hypertension with immunology performing well despite the entry of biosimilars for STELARA in the EU. Equally impressive is our pace of innovation, which in 2024 resulted in 27 approvals in major markets, including FDA approvals of TREMFYA for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and RYBREVANT and LAZCLUZE for first line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. In 2024, we reported 18 positive readouts for registrational studies, initiated 16 Phase III studies and submitted 49 filings across major markets. And as you have seen over the last three weeks, we are off to a fast start in 2025. RYBREVANT and LAZCLUZE showed significant in overall survival in first line treatment of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. We received FDA approval of SPRAVATO as the first and only monotherapy for adults with treatment resistant depression. We received priority review for Nipocalimab for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis in addition to the FDA breakthrough therapy and Fast Track designations for other indications received last year. And last week, we announced a new drug application with the FDA for TAR-200, our intravesical drug releasing system for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and area of significant unmet need impacting as many as 1 million patients per year. Turning to MedTech. For the full year, we reported a second year of over $30 billion in sales with growth across most part of the business, including particularly strong momentum in cardiovascular ambition. Our pace of MedTech innovation also continues to accelerate with 15 major products launched in 2024. Major highlights of the year include the approval of our VARIPULSE Pulsed Field Ablation platform in several major markets and FDA clearance of our VELYS robotic assisted solution for the use in Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty procedures as well as an expanded FDA indication for Impella heart pumps to treat pediatric patients and FDA clearance of Shockwave's Javelin Peripheral IVL Catheter for the treatment of tight, difficult to close peripheral lesions. We also achieved the full market release of 10 major products including the Shockwave E8 Peripheral IVL Catheter in the US. Version 8 of the CARTO 3 Electroanatomical Mapping System and our TECNIS Odyssey Intraocular Lens. And we progressed 18 clinical trial programs including the IDE approval of our OTTAVA robotic surgical system, which allows clinical trials to begin at US sites. And last year, we fortified our future by making significant value creating investments in M&A. These investments enable us to further shift our portfolio to address our mandates in high growth and high innovation markets. This included the acquisitions of Shockwave and V-Wave in MedTech and Ambrx Proteologix and the NM26 biospecific antibody in Innovative Medicine. And building on our nearly 70 year legacy neuroscience, we announced last week plans to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics for Central Nervous System Disorders. This unique opportunity to add Intra-Cellular Therapies reflects our commitment to transforming care and advancing research in mental health. It also further solidifies sales growth above analyst expectations now and through the remainder of the decade. Together, these transactions represent industry leading levels of investment for the company, providing strategic near and long-term growth catalyst for Johnson & Johnson. Turning to 2025. And as previously guided back at the end of 2023, we expect to deliver operational sales growth of 3%, overcoming headwinds associated with US biosimilar entries for STELARA and the impact of the Part D redesign and continued macroeconomic pressures in China. Perhaps even more impressive, we are planning for adjusted operational earnings per share growth of nearly 9%. I cannot think of any other company that would be able to deliver growth through the first year of losing exclusivity of a multibillion dollar product. We are able to achieve these results because of the diversification of our business, the strength of our commercial assets as well as the breadth of our pipeline with additional launches in 2025 including TREMFYA in IBD, RYBREVANT and LAZCLUZE in lung cancer and VARIPULSE and the Dual Energy THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF Catheter in electrophysiology. In closing, I want to thank everyone at Johnson & Johnson for all that they do to help patients. We are starting the year from a position of strength and we have confidence in our sales growth and EPS guidance for 2025. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jess.",1173.0,606.0,34.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.056105610561056105,0.0049504950495049506,0.006600660066006601,0.0,0.0033003300330033004,0.05115511551155116

Unless otherwise stated, the results and guidance highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore excludes the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q4 2024 sales results. Worldwide sales were $22.5 billion for the quarter. Sales increased 6.7% with growth of 10% in the US and 2.5% outside of the US. Worldwide growth was negatively impacted by 290 basis points due to STELARA and positively impacted by 100 basis points due to acquisitions and divestitures. It's important to note growth in Europe was negatively impacted by 720 basis points due to the loss of exclusivity of STELARA and the COVID-19 vaccine. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.4 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.41 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.70 a year ago. Excluding after tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $4.9 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.04, representing decreases of 11.1% and 10.9%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Earnings per share in the quarter was negatively impacted by $0.22 of acquired IPR&D expense related to the V-Wave acquisition. For the full year 2024, sales were $88.8 billion. Sales grew 5.9% with growth of 8.3% in the US and 2.9% outside of the US. STELARA and the COVID-19 vaccine negatively impacted worldwide growth by 260 basis points. Acquisition and divestitures positively impacted worldwide growth by 50 basis points. Growth in Europe was negatively impacted by 670 basis points due to the COVID-19 vaccine and the loss of exclusivity of STELARA. Net earnings for the full year 2024 were $14.1 billion and diluted earnings per share was $5.79 versus diluted earnings per share of $5.20 a year ago. Full year 2024 adjusted net earnings were $24.2 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.98, representing a decrease of 4.6% and an increase of 0.6% respectively versus full year 2023. Earnings per share in the year was negatively impacted by $0.67 due to acquired IPR&D charges on various transactions throughout the year. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide sales of $14.3 billion increased 6.5% excluding the COVID-19 vaccine with growth of 11.1% in the US and a decline of 0.3% outside of the US. STELARA negatively impacted worldwide growth by 490 basis points. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products with 10 assets delivering double-digit growth. Results across the portfolio continue to be positively impacted by price adjustments associated with Argentina hyperinflation consistent with market practice. Starting with oncology. We continue to drive strong sales growth across our multiple myeloma portfolio. DARZALEX growth was 23.5%, primarily driven by share gains of over three points across all lines of therapy and six points in the frontline setting as well as market growth. This marks Johnson & Johnson's first brand to achieve over $3 billion in sales in a quarter. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $334 million with growth of over 100% driven by share gains and capacity expansion. This reflects sequential growth of 17.3% aligned with our expectations of accelerating growth in the back half of the year. TECVAYLI sales were $146 million in the quarter with growth of 18%, reflecting a strong launch in the relapsed refractory setting. Demand remains strong despite continued adoption of longer duration dosing intervals. Finally, within our multiple myeloma portfolio, TALVEY continued its launch trajectory with another quarter of strong growth. As a reminder, we anticipate disclosing TALVEY sales in the first quarter of 2025, which are currently reported in the category Other Oncology. ERLEADA continues to deliver strong growth of 22.7%, primarily driven by share gains and market growth, reaching $3 billion in annual sales for the first time. RYBREVANT, our bispecific antibody for non-small cell lung cancer, contributed to growth in the category Other Oncology as we continue to expand approved indications. We also anticipate disclosing RYBREVANT sales in the first quarter of 2025. Within immunology, we saw sales growth in TREMFYA of 5.6%, driven by strong market growth and share gains in PsO and PsA, partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and inventory dynamics. We are excited about the recent UC launch and expect to see strong uptake of the IBD indications in 2025. STELARA declined 13.6% driven by the impact of current and anticipated biosimilar competition. As a reminder, biosimilar competition has entered the US in January 2025. REMICADE and SIMPONI worldwide sales were positively impacted by return of distribution rights in Europe. In Neuroscience, SPRAVATO growth of 45.3% continues to be driven by increased physician and patient demand. As Joaquin mentioned, SPRAVATO has exceeded $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. Other Neuroscience decline was driven by the loss of a SPINRAZA tender in Europe. In Pulmonary Hypertension, OPSUMIT grew 2.5%, driven by market growth and share gains, partially offset by inventory dynamics in the US and austerity measures in Europe. Starting in 2025, we will begin to report OPSYNVI, which is currently reported in the category Other Pulmonary Hypertension in OPSUMIT. UPTRAVI grew 12. 1%, driven by market growth, patient mix and share gains. Finally, XARELTO sales growth was driven by favorable patient mix. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide sales of $8.2 billion increased 7.6% both in the US and outside of the US. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 300 basis points on worldwide growth, 430 basis points in the US and 150 basis points outside of the US. Overall, MedTech growth was driven by commercial execution and strength of new product introductions, partially offset by increased competitive PFA pressures in US electrophysiology and continued headwinds in Asia Pacific, primarily in China. In Cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered growth of 7.3%. Performance was driven by global procedure growth, new product uptake and commercial execution, partially offset by competitive PFA ablation catheter uptake in the US and VBP in China. Despite the IV saline shortage in the US, Abiomed delivered growth of 13.2% driven by strong growth in all regions and continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP technology. Cardiovascular results also included $258 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave. Contact Lenses and Other grew 7.4%, driven by trade inventory dynamics, continued strategic price actions, strong performance in ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products as well as lapping prior year impacts from Russia sanctions. Surgical Vision growth of 13.6% was driven by TECNIS PureSee & TECNIS Eyhance. Commercial execution partially offset by competitive pressures in the US. Orthopedics grew 2.5% inclusive of hips growth of 5.6%, primarily driven by the success of recent product launches and commercial execution, partially offset by revenue disruption from the previously announced orthopedics transformation, impacts of China VBP and competitive pressures. Lastly, Surgery grew 0.4% with the Acclarent divestiture negatively impacting results by approximately 130 basis points. Performance was driven primarily by commercial execution, strength of new products across wound closure and biosurgery and continued price adjustments primarily associated with hyperinflation consistent with market practice. Growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in Energy and Endocutters as well as VBP and the anticorruption campaign in China. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels to fortify our future, investing $5.3 billion or nearly 24% of sales, which includes $540 million of acquired IPR&D expense associated with the V-Wave acquisition. Selling, marketing and administrative expense as a percent of sales deleveraged 150 basis points driven by increased commercial investment in the Innovative Medicine business. Interest income and expense was a net income of $144 million as compared to $212 million of income last year driven by lower interest rates earned on a lower average cash balance and higher interest rates on a higher average debt balance. Other income and expense was a net income of $161 million compared to $421 million of income in the prior year. This was primarily driven by lower gains on securities, a lower benefit related to employee benefit programs due to the discount rate, partially offset by lower litigation expense in 2024. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 11.7% versus 14.4% in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by post-acquisition integration efforts that allowed the company to deduct certain acquisition costs for tax purposes as well as the resolution of prior tax matters both in jurisdictions outside of the US. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 8.8% versus 10.8% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2024 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible, amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment for the quarter. Innovative Medicine margin declined from 37.4% to 32.5% primarily driven by strategic commercial investment and R&D pipeline advancement. MedTech margin declined from 15.5% to 10. 8% primarily driven by acquired IPR&D expense related to the V-Wave acquisition. Please note that the MedTech margin was negatively impacted in both years due to expenses associated with the strategic acquisition of Laminar. When adjusting for these one-time items, MedTech margin was relatively flat. As a result, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 29.2% to 24.1% with the V-Wave acquired IPR&D expense impacting results by 240 basis points. When looking at the full year, Innovative Medicine, MedTech and the Enterprise adjusted income before tax remained relatively flat year-over-year when adjusting for the one-time items highlighted on the slide, mainly acquired IPR&D expenses on various transactions across both years. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call. I am now pleased to turn it over to Joe.",1633.0,958.0,39.0,28.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,11.0,0.0407098121085595,0.029227557411273485,0.007306889352818371,0.003131524008350731,0.0,0.011482254697286013

As you've heard already, we delivered solid overall fourth quarter and full year results in 2024, above the operational guidance we set at the beginning of the year when excluding acquisition costs we incurred to fortify our business for the future. We are particularly pleased with advancements made throughout the year, strengthening our pipeline, achieving key milestones across core therapeutic areas and platforms. We continue to prioritize investment and innovation, forge strategic partnerships that further enhance our differentiated business and focus on improving margins positioning the company for near and long-term growth. Additionally, we've made progress toward resolving the talc litigation. As many of you are aware, our prepackaged bankruptcy plan received overwhelming support from current claimants and the futures claims representative and that support has only increased in recent months. The next milestone is the scheduled confirmation hearing commencing on February 18th in the Southern District of Texas Bankruptcy Court. Now let's get into the numbers, starting with cash and capital allocation. We ended 2024 with approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $37 billion of debt for a net debt position of approximately $12 billion. Our focus on cash flow resulted in the company delivering approximately $20 billion of free cash flow during 2024, $1.6 billion more than in 2023, despite having higher litigation settlement payments during 2024, higher TCJA toll tax and eight months of contribution from Consumer Health in 2023. Our ability to strategically invest and deploy capital that unlocks value has made Johnson & Johnson successful in the past and will be as important for our success moving forward. We evaluate strong credit rating, which underscores the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial discipline and enables us to execute against our capital allocation priorities. In Research and Development, we invested more than $17 billion or 19.4% of sales. We remain one of the top investors in R&D across all industries. 2024 marked the 62nd consecutive year of dividend increases. We know this use of capital is a priority for our investors and we plan to continue to increase our dividend annually. We also deployed, announced or committed to over $32 billion in strategic value-creating inorganic growth opportunities in the last 12 months. This amount includes larger transactions such as Shockwave, Proteologix, the NM26 bispecific antibody, V-Wave, the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies as well as more than 40 smaller early-stage collaborations and partnerships to complement our businesses that are much more common for us than larger transactions. As we look ahead to 2025, we will maintain a heightened focus on cash flow generation to build on our strong financial foundation and judiciously deploy capital on behalf of shareholders to create value. Let's now discuss our full year guidance for 2025. It is important to note that guidance at this time excludes the impact from the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, but I will provide some comments on that transaction in a few moments. We anticipate operational sales in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% with a midpoint of $91.3 billion or 3.0% in line with the expectations outlined at our late 2023 enterprise business review as Joaquin noted. Acquisitions and divestitures are expected to favorably impact operational growth by approximately 50 basis points resulting in an adjusted operational sales growth midpoint of 2.5%. Sales growth across our innovative medicine businesses will be driven by our proven assets such as DARZALEX, ERLEADA and SPRAVATO. Our recently launched products, CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY and our new launches of TREMFYA in IBD and RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE in lung cancer. The strength of our portfolio enables Innovative Medicine to grow despite the expanded STELARA biosimilar competition and approximately $2 billion negative impact from Part D redesign. MedTech sales growth will be driven by our recent acquisitions, Shockwave and Abiomed as well as continued uptake of our recently launched products such as VARIPULSE, TECNIS Odyssey, ACUVUE OASYS MAX, the VELYS portfolio of enabling technology and our barbed suture and hemostat portfolio. We continue to expect China to remain a headwind through 2025. Regarding VARIPULSE in the US, we are working diligently to complete our investigation and we'll provide an update when we have additional information to share. As a reminder, there is no impact to commercial activity to VARIPULSE outside of the United States. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. For today's call, we are utilizing yesterday's euro spot rate relative to the US dollar of 1.04 significantly below last quarter's euro spot rate of $1.10. This results in an estimated unfavorable foreign currency impact on sales of $1.7 billion or 2.0%, as such, we estimate reported 2025 sales of $89.6 billion or 1% growth at the midpoint. Turning to other items on the P&L. Despite STELARA biosimilar competition and the impact of Part D redesign, we expect our 2025 adjusted pre-tax operating margins to increase by approximately 300 basis points of which approximately half is driven by operating spend management and the remainder from reduced acquired IPR&D expense. This is about 50 basis points better than we discussed on the Q3 earnings call in October. We anticipate net other income to be $900 million to $1.1 billion for 2025. The reduction versus last year is primarily driven by a lower benefit related to employee benefit programs based on discount rate assumptions, the nonrecurring monetization of royalty rights in 2024 and no longer receiving a Kenvue dividend. Due to higher debt incurred associated with 2024 acquisitions and the reduction in interest rates earned on cash, we expect net interest income between zero and $100 million. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2025 in the range of 16.5% to 17.0% based on current tax laws and our anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses. Given all these factors, we expect adjusted operational earnings per share to grow 8.7% at the midpoint for a range of $10.75 to $10.95. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the recent exchange rate previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year now estimates a full year negative impact of $0.25. As such, we expect reported adjusted earnings per share of $10.60 at the midpoint. When adjusting for this impact, it becomes clear that our operational EPS performance is considerably stronger than consensus assumed as only about half the analysts incorporated the impact of foreign currency into their models. A few initial considerations outlined on this chart regarding the planned acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies, a transaction we plan to finance mainly with debt. We are not planning for material near-term cost synergies. Rather, we expect to accelerate penetration of CAPLYTA in existing markets, explore additional geographies to commercialize the portfolio and potentially accelerate research and development to expand into new indications and disease areas where high unmet need exists. Given this and assuming a close subject to regulatory review early in the second quarter, we anticipate an acceleration of our sales growth of approximately 80 basis points. Inclusive of the impact of financing cost, the transaction is expected to have a dilutive impact on adjusted EPS of approximately $0.30 to $0.35 in 2025. Again, these are very preliminary thoughts, which will be influenced by when the transaction closes and borrowing rates. We will be sure to provide an update to our full year guidance shortly after the acquisition is complete. I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on the phasing of notable events for your modeling. We expect both Innovative Medicine and MedTech operational sales growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half. Regarding Innovative Medicine, we anticipate STELARA biosimilar competition to accelerate throughout the year as the number of biosimilar entrants increase. HUMIRA's erosion curve, once faced with material biosimilar competition continues to be the best proxy for STELARA erosion with the additive impact of Part D redesign. The impact of Part D redesign as a percent of sales will be consistently applied throughout the year. We expect a more pronounced benefit from our newly launched products as we progress throughout 2025 to counter these headwinds. In MedTech, for the first half of the year and more prominently in Q1, we faced tougher year-over-year comparisons, excluding the positive impact associated with the Shockwave acquisition. We anticipate acceleration of our newly launched products to build throughout the year. As we've said before, we continue to expect normalized procedure volume and seasonality. Regarding the P&L, it is important to consider one-time items that impacted our EPS results in 2024. Specifically, the benefit of Kenvue dividend in the first two quarters of 2024 is not repeating. Higher interest income prior to the Shockwave acquisition closure in May, the monetization of royalty rights recorded in Q3 and IPR&D expense associated with the NM26 bispecific antibody in Q3 and V-Wave acquisition in Q4. Given these factors and aligned with sales, we expect higher earnings per share growth in the second half of the year versus the first half. Moving to the discussion beyond financial commitments. We are excited for the pipeline progress planned for 2025. In Innovative Medicine, this includes expected approvals for TREMFYA subcutaneous for Crohn's disease, nipocalimab for generalized myasthenia gravis and subcutaneous RYBREVANT for non-small cell lung cancer. We expect to file for regulatory approval of TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, and Icotrokinra in psoriasis and planned data readouts for RYBREVANT lung cancer overall survival as well as data in head and neck and colorectal cancer and Icotrokinra in ulcerative colitis as well as head-to-head data versus TYK2 in psoriasis. In MedTech, building upon the 15 major product launches in 2024, we anticipate a submission to the FDA for Impella ECP regulatory approval, continued progress on our OTTAVA robotic surgical system and advancements across our cardiovascular portfolio, including electrophysiology, heart recovery and circulatory restoration. So to summarize, we are well positioned to tackle the challenges in 2025, continue to advance our pipeline, deliver on our financial commitments and create long-term sustainable value for shareholders. Our success is the result of the hard work and dedication of our colleagues who share a sincere passion to successfully serve patients around the world. We are extremely grateful for their efforts. With that, we are happy to take your questions. So I will now turn it to Kevin to provide instructions for those seeking to participate in the Q&A.",1713.0,930.0,41.0,16.0,24.0,10.0,3.0,10.0,1.0,2.0,0.04408602150537634,0.017204301075268817,0.025806451612903226,0.010752688172043012,0.0032258064516129032,0.026881720430107527

I'd like to start by thanking all of our Innovative Medicine colleagues around the world for a very strong quarter. This was our third quarter with sales over $14 billion with 10 key brands achieving double-digit growth and Terence I will come back to that. That includes brands like DARZALEX, CARVYKTI, TALVEY and TECVAYLI as well as ones such as ERLEADA, SPRAVATO and UPTRAVI. We're making really nice progress on our launches, including TREMFYA in ulcerative colitis and RYBREVANT plus LAZCLUZE in non-small cell lung cancer. And just an important note, we hit our $57 billion target this year, a year early. For those that were here back at our enterprise review, we had made that commitment to hit the $57 billion by 2025 and we cleared that goal this year in 2024. So multiple myeloma is really an extraordinary franchise for us. And maybe I will start with DARZALEX because our quarter was over $3 billion. It was $3.1 billion and 22% growth and we continue to really build out share across the frontline settings in both transplant eligible and ineligible patients and in triplet and quad regimens. And so we're performing very well for DARZALEX and anticipate that to continue. And in fact, with DARZALEX, it's our first brand to hit $3 billion in quarterly sales. So important to note that milestone too. CARVYKTI had a really, really robust quarter as well as year nearing $1 billion for the year, $963 million as we continue to see very strong demand in that second-line plus setting as well as very strong capacity expansion in the US, in Europe and also with a contract manufacturer. And so we've talked before about that being more of a stair step rather than a direct linear line and it is performing very, very well and we're seeing nice continued expansion in the first quarter of this year that will also continue throughout the year. For TEC and TAL both products did well. We report sales, we break out sales on TEC. We don't yet on TAL. Both of these agents are best-in-class bispecifics. They're performing very well from a competitive share standpoint. We've got them nicely being utilized in the academic setting and we're working that out into more of the community setting, which will be important for their continued growth and uptake. So in total, multiple myeloma really is a stronghold for us and we're not stopping there. Because of the strength that we have, the assets that we have, we're also working on multiple additional types of combinations. John, maybe you want to address what we're doing with the bispecifics specifically.",454.0,210.0,9.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.04285714285714286,0.014285714285714285,0.014285714285714285,0.004761904761904762,0.004761904761904762,0.02857142857142857

Maybe before I jump in, I'll follow your lead and just offer my appreciation and thanks to our colleagues in Innovation Medicine R&D. We had a heck of a year for the pipeline, 27 approvals, 49 submissions, 15 out of 17 positive Phase IIIs, more than 90% success rate. 9 out of 12 POCs came in positive, exceeding the industry benchmarks by approximately double, 10 first-in-humans, 10 new NMEs added to the pipeline from internal research at a price point well below the industry median and quite an impressive year on the BD front with five bolt-on acquisitions and six new molecules added to the pipeline. So my congratulations to the team. Now on the point around our broad portfolio of myeloma medicines, this is where we are now bringing them together to reinvent the next frontline therapies. And if you were at the ASH Congress, the American Society of Hematology, you saw some of the early tantalizing data where in early lines of therapy front, first, second line of myeloma, we're bringing DARA together with either TEC or TAL and we've been getting 100% minimal residual disease negativity, MRD negativity, showing the impressive potential of these new combinations. Mind you, last year, the FDA declared MD or minimal residual disease negativity or MRD as a surrogate endpoint within myeloma that could form the basis for accelerated approvals. So we're really excited about bringing these into earlier lines. And then I would also remind you with CARVYKTI, we are now doing studies in frontline transplant eligible and ineligible and asking whether we can replace autologous stem cell transplant with our CAR-T therapy as a new opportunity there to break through with unprecedented outcomes for patients. CARVYKTI, of course, already is the go-to regimen in the second line setting, the only CAR-T for myeloma approved in that setting. And last year, we reported overall survival data for CARVYKTI in a randomized setting with an impressive hazard ratio of 0.55. So really feel great about bringing CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy as well.",346.0,174.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.05172413793103448,0.017241379310344827,0.022988505747126436,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655

I was hoping to just ask about the medical device or the sector, the business, excuse me, and just the acquisition strategy. You've had a couple of pre-revenue swings with Laminar and V-Wave and some other more established more established businesses under the roof. Can you just talk about the strategy on a go-forward basis?

External innovation has always been a very important part of our capital allocation strategy for Johnson & Johnson for the enterprise. And in fact, we are one of the top investors not only in M&A, but also in R&D. We are always looking for opportunities to be able to enhance our portfolio and our pipeline. And in 2024 alone, we completed more than 40 business development transactions. Some of them were big, some of them were small, but all of them complement both our Innovative and MedTech portfolio. Many of these smaller acquisitions were also in our MedTech portfolio. You have to think that larger acquisitions like the case of Shockwave or in the Innovative Medicine side, Intra-Cellular are more outliers. Our go-forward, it's always been focused on these smaller opportunities like the ones you mentioned like Laminar or V-Wave or some of the ones we have completed the Innovative Medicines like TARIS or our IL-23 blocker, which are more than $5 billion opportunities. That's where we are able to create value, larger opportunities have to be seen more like outliers. And finally, I want to underline that both Abiomed and Shockwave are progressing really well ahead of the deal model, delivering on our financial commitments there and that we are looking forward upon closure to start working on the Intra-Cellular acquisition, which is an opportunity to reinforce our position of leadership in the Neuroscience space, which has been always a strength of Johnson & Johnson and also an opportunity overall to fortify revenue projections that you have looking today and also into the future.

While the big acquisitions get a lot of attention, to Joaquin's point, we have a tremendous amount of business development activity across all of our businesses. I think most notably evidenced by almost 40 transactions just in '24 alone. I did want to point to the excitement we have around the significant investments we've made both in Abiomed and Shockwave. Abiomed grew 15% for full year 2024 and we are seeing constant acceleration driven by firstly, the tremendous portfolio we have. I think we could not be more excited about the danger shock results, which really bring more validity to the evidence base around this portfolio. This is the first study in 20 years to actually demonstrate a survival benefit, in fact, a 12.7% mortality improvement versus the standard of care. We also, while not a big commercial opportunity, received FDA approval in the fourth quarter of last year for the use of Impella in pediatric community, which I think is just further evidence of the building confidence around the safety profile of this product. We also mentioned earlier that we are excited to be planning our submission for ECP to the FDA in the first half of this year. This will, Josh, be the first and actually the smallest pump in the world. This is a 9-French at insertion, which expands to about 21-French inside the heart, a lower profile, which we believe that along with its ease of use, reduce further barriers to adoption. And then finally, a smaller transaction, but certainly important to our goal to play a bigger role in heart failure is the acquisition of V-Wave, which reinforces our commitment to building leadership in heart failure and really allows for the active shunting of blood across the intraatrial septum. A quick couple of comments on Shockwave. It's our latest acquisition. We closed that in May of last year. This delivered $564 million of growth last year. It is the leading and first-to-market pioneer in IVL technology. And we're confident that while certainly, there's a lot of excitement around this category, we have at least a five to eight year first-mover advantage. And this comes down to the fact that we have an easy-to-use system with now six available catheters. We've also recently announced the addition of two additional catheters, our E8 catheter, which is our workhorse within peripheral as well as Javelin, which is a novel non-balloon based IVL catheter designed to modify calcium and cross extremely narrowed vessels. And so we feel enormously confident that while big investments, they will make tremendous impact on patients and continue to drive our business.

And we are so excited to be able to welcome the Intra-Cellular colleagues to Johnson & Johnson. They have done such an extraordinary job, both in developing CAPLYTA and their pipeline, but also commercializing and bringing CAPLYTA to patients currently for schizophrenia as well as for bipolar I and bipolar II depression. I think you can take a look at their current sales trajectory, which is a really nice growth curve and then also take into account the filing that has done for AMDD, major depressive disorder. The filing has been done with the regulatory authorities that we anticipate approval for later in the year. AMDD, we believe to ultimately be the largest of those three indications for CAPLYTA. And so we think that, that will be an additional catalyst for growth. So you can factor that into your thinking. We're really excited about CAPLYTA. I know the company had guided to it being a $5 billion plus asset. We definitely think that it will be as well and think that together we're going to be able to do even more for patients with mental health issues.

About your question, though, around whether we'll deprioritize other things in the portfolio, absolutely not. Let me just remind everyone that depression is a very heterogeneous disorder and it's not a disease that accommodates to a one size fits all. We see each of these molecules that we're developing, having unique mechanisms that can play in different subpopulations. And we're developing those aticaprant, seltorexant, for example, using a precision neuroscience strategy. So we see this broad portfolio, which includes, of course, SPRAVATO as a repertoire of different mechanisms we can bring to bear. The 260 million people worldwide that suffer from chronic depression. It's the leading cause of disability and more than 30% of those do not get relief from the ongoing medicines. The other thing that I really like about our portfolio is the side effect profiles are so benign compared to the standard of care. With all four of the mechanisms, whether it's CAPLYTA, which we hope to welcome into the portfolio, whether its aticaprant, seltorexant or SPRAVATO, you don't have weight gain, you don't have sexual dysfunction, you don't have the tardive dyskinesia or extrapyramidal effects that are so common with many of the medicines today. So this is really exciting for us. Maybe also while I am talking about our depression portfolio, I would just acknowledge and congratulate the team on the recent approval of SPRAVATO in the monotherapy context. This indeed allows us to offer SPRAVATO as a solution for patients with treatment resistant depression without necessity to use it on top of standard of care and therefore avoiding those side effects that I just mentioned that the standard of care medicines often bring. Very excited about that approval. We had received priority review from the FDA for that submission. That's the second time SPRAVATO had received a prior review, the only antidepressant ever to do so. And SPRAVATO is also the only antidepressant to ever receive breakthrough designation from the FDA.

And so we do see across the board, shifting of patients and movement into the newer and the better products. I would put TREMFYA squarely in that camp. We've got lots of reasons. We focus in on IBD and the potential growth for TREMFYA. We've got a lot of reasons for great optimism there and differentiation. It's the only dual-acting IL-23 agent in IBD, acts on both IL-23 as well as CD64. We think it's got the potential to really set the next bar in efficacy and we know there are a lot of patients who need more and are ready for switch. And we think with our subcu induction dose, we're going to have unrivaled flexibility. So the ability for fully subcu induction and maintenance as well as the opportunity for IV. So the launch right now is going very well in UC and we're very excited and optimistic really looking forward to the upcoming launch in Crohn's and subcu. And we've invested appropriately, last part of the question, I think, was on pricing. We've invested appropriately to make sure that we've got the right access for patients with TREMFYA so that as we launch, we've got the abilities when prescribers want to write for patients. We've got the access to be able to do so. And we're seeing that right now with strong frontline commercial coverage for TREMFYA in UC as well as a permanent J-code. So that is in and sort of factored into what we're seeing now.",384.0,157.0,10.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.06369426751592357,0.025477707006369428,0.012738853503184714,0.0,0.0,0.03821656050955414

Let me start with the market, Larry. We communicated that the Enterprise Business Review that we saw our end markets growing roughly 5% to 7%. As we look at procedures within the year to come, we believe that they have, for the most part, normalized. You will recall that in the first half of last year, we expected some tailwinds on the back of clearing of the backlog, specifically in orthopedic procedures. We believe that for the most part around the world, procedures have normalized to pre-COVID levels and we expect the same as we now move into 2025. Specific to electrophysiology, I did want to firstly acknowledge that out of an abundance of caution, we recently announced a temporary pause of all US VARIPULSE cases while we investigate the root cause of four reported neurovascular events. And, Larry, while disappointing, this is an easy decision for us aligned to Our Credo. Patient safety is always an absolute priority for us. And frankly given that we are collaborating now with the FDA on this matter, this is all we will be sharing at this time. We will proactively provide further updates when we have additional information to share. I do have I think it's important to remind everyone that this announcement is specific to the US and there is no expected impact to VARIPULSE cases outside of the US where the rollout of the technology has been successful with approximately 3,000 commercial cases completed. I do think important, it's important to reinforce that while we are facing a headwind today, we have tremendous opportunity in the electrophysiology space. It's an exciting market, as you know, with relatively low global penetration well under 5%, as you know, and an expanding market size due to aging populations. Today, we have a $5 billion market leading position in electrophysiology, which grew 14% in 2024 driven by commercial execution and a significant portfolio of new product introductions from QDOT to Ultrasound, CARTO and more recently, VARIPULSE, partially offset by competitive PFA pressures, most notably here in the US. Now we've been market leader, as you know, Larry, for 20 years and have an entrenched footprint with an installed base of over 5,000 CARTO systems, which is widely recognized that the benchmark in mapping software and a broad network of highly trained mappers. And building on our success in navigation catheters and RF ablation in 2024, we launched our first PFA catheter VARIPULSE with strong initial feedback in Europe, Japan and Canada. Additionally, similar to our success in our RF portfolio, we are expanding beyond that. And we recently announced EU approval of the Dual Energy STSF catheter which is modeled on the RF STSF catheter, which historically is the most widely used ablation catheter in the world. We're also building on this and working on an Omnipulse large tip focal catheter demonstrating commitment to bring to market a comprehensive portfolio in PFA. And so I will also say, Larry, it's not just in EP, we're also moving beyond AFib and we're working to enter the Left Atrial Appendage closure market through the acquisition of Laminar which we announced in the fourth quarter of 2023. In summary, Larry, while we're facing short-term headwinds, as you know, especially here in the US, we are absolutely confident in our ability to retain our global market leadership position over the long-term.

With respect to the 150 basis improvement that wasn't related to year-on-year comparison from IPR&D. I would say that's really part and parcel to what we've been doing for a couple of years now when we had a chance to separate the consumer health business out into its own company, we did take a look at the corporate infrastructure. And as you know, we also prioritized our investments in Innovative Medicine and MedTech, specifically within those portfolios as well. So we came much more focused and you're starting to see the culmination of that this year. You might have noticed in MedTech last year, we did have some restructuring charges related to some orthopedic moves that we made, getting out of certain markets that were less profitable, improving our infrastructure around manufacturing. Those are starting to come home to roost, so to speak, in Innovative Medicine, obviously, prioritizing most of our investment into what I would call our thoroughbreds within the stable, so oncology, immunology, neuroscience, as you can tell. And we have invested in technology over the last few years in a pretty significant way. There's still more investment to come, but that's starting to yield some benefits as well in terms of efficiency around the organization. So we knew for a few years now that STELARA would face biosimilar competition. And so we had to be prepared and this is kind of how the organization has gone about it. As far as 2026 and beyond, I think, I'd go back to the comments I made with respect to operating margin and probably EPS growth overall that, that will be commensurate with sales. So that should be a positive outlook. As you know, this year, we're calling for 3% operational growth despite a multibillion dollar headwinds. Most organizations would be looking to contract both probably top and bottom line. Here we are growing 3% on the top line operationally and about 9% on the bottom line. I think you could look for maybe a little bit better equilibrium in 2026 and beyond, but with an expectation that we'd have some higher sales growth.",366.0,167.0,10.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.059880239520958084,0.011976047904191617,0.029940119760479042,0.005988023952095809,0.0,0.04790419161676647

I wanted to come back to just the overall MedTech strategy. And I appreciate that you exited the year over the 7% number that you had previously communicated as the high end of the range. But when you pick that apart a little bit, clearly, a big percentage of that does come from M&A, I think with ex M&A, the organic number being below the 5% to 7%. So can you maybe just walk through a little bit how you think about the organic investment in the business versus inorganic contribution to that number long-term, especially when you start to look at some of the more established franchises of that surgery, orthopedics, your end market?

And we could not be more thrilled with the performance that we delivered in 2024. And while there are opportunities, we delivered almost $32 billion of sales at an operational growth rate of 6.2%. When you take out impact of Shockwave, that's 4.7%. And let me be very clear that we remain very confident in our expectations communicated at the EBR. And as a reminder, we expect our end markets to grow between 5% and 7% on a weighted average basis between 22% and 27%. And we expect to deliver an operational CAGR in the upper end of the range over that period. In 2024, 6.2%, as I mentioned and we're pleased with the continued double-digit growth in cardiovascular, both within our core electrophysiology business and our new acquisitions in Abiomed and Shockwave, which I referenced earlier. We're also proud of the continuous improvements in Ortho. This is a business that historically was a laggard for MedTech, but tremendous improvements especially with the mid-single-digit growth in hips and knees and continued innovation with our enabling technologies and specifically in VELYS. We're also encouraged by the continuous improvements in vision, another core business. And as you know, we had a slower start to 2024, but we saw that improve throughout the year, culminating in operational growth rate in the fourth quarter of 9.1%. That said, as you know too well, we do have some short-term headwinds near-term competitive pressures in US. EP as one and secondly continued headwinds in China, which we've mentioned in 2025 will continue to be a headwind and we have included that in our estimates. As we look to the year ahead, we don't provide guidance by sector, as you know, but we're confident that continued growth will be driven by our tremendous portfolio of new products, specifically VARIPULSE, our TECNIS premium IOLs, ACUVUE OASYS MAX and Contact Lens, VELYS portfolio in Ortho, our STRATAFIX portfolio in barbed sutures and our broad-based hemostats in surgery. We also believe that our recent acquisitions of Shockwave and Abiomed, as I mentioned earlier, will continue to perform exceptionally well fueled by multiple new products, new indications and a rapidly growing body of clinical evidence. I will say that it's important as you think about 2025 to recognize, as Joe mentioned earlier, that we expect to see an acceleration in the back half. We are seeing some tough comparators when we compare to 2024. A couple of factors will be a positive one-time change in revenue recognition in our Ortho business. Inventory builds outside of the US and electrophysiology and finally headwinds related to selling days versus prior year. And so we would recommend that you encourage you to consider these in your statements for the year ahead. And maybe, David, just to cap off, you asked a specific question around accounting reversal and whether that had any impact on the quarter.

In the first quarter, we delivered strong operational sales growth of 4.2% across our business. Our Q1 performance reinforces my confidence in our 2025 guidance and reflects the strength of Johnson & Johnson's uniquely diversified business, with year-over-year sales increases in both our innovative medicine and med tech sectors. No other healthcare company has delivered growth through the first year of Lucin exclusivity for a multibillion-dollar product. In our case, STELARA. And yet, that is exactly what we are doing. Our resiliency is a testament to what makes us unique. We are not just a pharmaceutical company or a med tech company. We are a healthcare company, innovating across the full spectrum of disease. Our consistent strong performance is a testament to our capabilities across commercial, R&D, and supply chain. It is also a reflection of our strength in execution, which you can see in our quarterly results. We have described 2025 as a catalyst year. It is a year that will set us up for accelerated growth through the second half of the decade and beyond. In Q1, the power of our portfolio and pipeline was on full display. In innovative medicine, we delivered 4.2% operational sales growth despite an approximate 810 basis points headwind from STELARA, with eleven key brands growing double digits. With our third consecutive quarter of sales above $3 billion, DARZALEX continues to set the standard in multiple myeloma with another quarter of over 20% growth. In fact, just last week, we expanded our DARZALEX indication in Europe with the approval of a DARZALEX-based quadruplet regimen for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma regardless of transplant eligibility. It is further proof of the impact of this medicine, which together with CARVYKTI, Talvey, and TECVAYLI, is changing the conversation from treating to progression to treating to cure. Other significant oncology portfolio advancements in Q1 included Phase 3 data presented at ELCC last month showing riboflavin plus LASCRUZ extended overall survival by more than one year versus the current standard of care in first-line EGFR-mutated lung cancer. Last week, the European Commission approved subcutaneous riboflavin in combination with LASCRUZ for the treatment of EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. This was an important milestone for patients as subcutaneous riboflavin reduces administration time from hours to minutes. Our aspiration is for riboflavin plus LASCRUZ to become the new standard of care for these patients, and you can see our progress in Q1. In immunology, we're seeing the impact of Tremfya's entry into inflammatory bowel disease, with our launch in ulcerative colitis helping accelerate operational sales growth to 20%. And with our recent FDA approval in Crohn's disease, I'm more confident than ever that this blockbuster drug will become the gold standard for IBD patients and a $10 billion-plus product. Turning to MedTech, in Q1, we delivered 4.1% operational sales growth with strong performance in our recently acquired cardiovascular businesses, Abiomed and Shockwave, as well as in surgical vision and wound closure. In addition to their contribution to MedTech growth, Abiomed and Shockwave continue to meet deal model expectations and both announced important portfolio milestones this quarter. These included updates to the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines for our Impella heart pump, which based on evidence from the DANGER shock trial was upgraded from class IIb to class IIa. And in Shockwave, the team launched the first of its kind Javelin Peripheral IVL catheter for the treatment of difficult-to-cross lesions in peripheral artery disease. In electrophysiology, we resumed U.S. VariPulse cases and to date, we have completed more than 5,500 cases globally. Turning to surgery, we recently announced we have started OTAVA clinical trials with a procedure that supports submission for US FDA de novo in general surgery with an indication for multiple upper abdomen procedures. This is an important milestone as we continue to strengthen our presence in robotic surgery. Beyond our existing portfolio and pipeline, we also fortified our leadership as an innovation powerhouse with two major announcements. In March, we announced our commitment to invest more than $55 billion in the U.S. over the next four years in manufacturing, R&D, and technology. This represents a 25% increase in investment compared to the previous four years. It builds upon the company's already elevated commitment to the U.S. economy while expanding our capacity to manufacture next-generation medicine and devices for patients in America and around the world. The investment includes four planned new manufacturing facilities, the first of which broke ground last month in North Carolina. And at the beginning of April, we announced the completion of our acquisition of IntraCellular Therapies, which extends Johnson & Johnson's industry-leading portfolio in central nervous system disorders. With the addition of Caplyta, we have expanded our lineup of therapies with at least $5 billion-plus potential in peak year sales, further solidifying sales growth above analysts' expectations now through the rest of the decade. Turning to the TALC bankruptcy ruling, as we shared a few weeks ago, we will return to the tort system where we expect continual success in litigating these medical claims. In terms of next steps, we will immediately pursue our motion pending in the multi-district litigation to exclude plaintiffs' experts, known as the Daubert challenge. And finally, as announced this morning, we increased our dividend for the sixty-third consecutive year, which we know. We have a strong start to 2025, and I'm looking forward to sharing many more successes throughout the year. Recognizing that there have been many important milestones and data readouts in the quarter, I will now pass the call to John Reed for an innovative medicine R&D update. Thank you, Joaquin.",957.0,497.0,21.0,9.0,2.0,7.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.04225352112676056,0.018108651911468814,0.004024144869215292,0.014084507042253521,0.004024144869215292,0.02414486921529175

With the successful acquisition of IntraCellular, I want to focus on Caplyta, a remarkable medicine with balanced pharmacology that delivers robust efficacy combined with a favorable tolerability profile in neuropsychiatric disorders. Caplyta is already approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and is the only medicine approved for the treatment of depression in both bipolar I and II, either as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. On this slide, we are sharing data for major depressive disorder showing very impressive and consistent improvements in the standard depression scoring metric, MADRS, in both Phase 3 studies that served as the basis for submission of the supplemental new drug application to the FDA. We anticipate approval of Caplyta later this year as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder, representing the largest of the indications for novel antidepressant drugs today. Turning to oncology, we are so excited about our recent overall survival data for riboflavin plus LASCRUZ in first-line, non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFRCEPT gene mutations. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most prevalent type of lung cancer, making up about 85% of lung cancer diagnoses. Sadly, less than 20% of people diagnosed with this form of the disease are alive after five years, and only a fraction live long enough to try a second treatment. That's why it is so important to use the best treatment first. In a head-to-head study against today's standard of care, our riboflavin plus LASCRUZ regimen improved overall survival by more than a year, with the Kaplan-Meier survival curves continuing to separate at 37.8 months median follow-up. With riboflavin's triple mechanism of action, we're looking to reset the standard five-year survival expectations in a never-before-seen way. In simplest terms, we're giving patients more hope that they may live to celebrate another birthday, anniversary, or other important family event. A truly practice-changing achievement. Now moving on to immunology, I draw your attention to the recent FDA approval of Tremfya in Crohn's disease, our fourth indication for Tremfya. Tremfya is currently the only IL-23 inhibitor with the flexibility of subcutaneous administration for both induction and maintenance dosing for the treatment of Crohn's disease, which means patients can start their treatment by self-administering with results as rapid and robust as receiving the IV in a clinic or doctor's office. Additionally, in a recent head-to-head study in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, Tremfya demonstrated superiority versus STELARA in all pooled endoscopic endpoints. As the only dual-acting IL-23 inhibitor, Tremfya neutralizes IL-23 while also binding to CD6 and immune cells that produce IL-23, thus localizing Tremfya right at the source of inflammation. Tremfya continues to offer an exceptional profile. Lastly, highlighting some of our latest data for our investigational oral IL-23 pathway inhibitor, Ichotrochindra, we are aiming to redefine the standard of care for people living with plaque psoriasis. Ichotrochindra is the first and only targeted oral peptide that selectively blocks the IL-23 receptor. In two placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, Ichotrochindra demonstrated impressive complete skin clearance and a favorable safety profile in a once-daily pill. Our Phase 3 data demonstrated that nearly half of adult patients and three-quarters of adolescents with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis treated with Ichotrochindra achieved completely clear skin by week 24. We also reported that Ichotrochindra achieved the pre-specified endpoints in additional Phase 3 psoriasis studies comparing our molecule head-to-head with the most commonly prescribed TIC-two inhibitor. Those data will be shared in an upcoming medical congress. Looking forward, we are initiating the first-ever head-to-head study seeking to demonstrate the superiority of a pill by Ichotrochindra compared to an injectable biologic, STELARA, in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, representing an important step forward in psoriasis research. As a reminder, we intend to file Ichotrochindra for approval later this year. Finally, beyond psoriasis, we recently announced positive top-line results from Anthem UC, our Phase 2b study of Ichotrochindra in adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. That study showed that Ichotrochindra achieved impressive clinical remission rates combined with a favorable safety profile, again dosed as a once-daily pill.

Unless otherwise stated, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q1 2025 sales results, worldwide sales were $21.9 billion for the quarter. Sales increased 4.2% despite an approximate growth in the U.S. was 5.9% and 2.1% outside of the U.S. Worldwide growth was positively impacted by 90 basis points due to acquisition and divestitures. Turning now to earnings, for the quarter, net earnings were $11 billion and diluted earnings per share was $4.54 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.34 a year ago, primarily driven by the reversal of $7 billion related to the talc settlement proposal. Excluding after-tax intangible and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.77, representing increases of 1.9% and 2.2% respectively compared to the first quarter of 2024.

Beginning with innovative medicine, worldwide sales of $13.9 billion increased 4.2% despite an approximate 810 basis point headwind from STELARA. Growth in the U.S. was 6.3% and 1.5% outside of the U.S. Starting with oncology, SARS growth was 22.5%, primarily driven by continued share gains of approximately three points across all lines of therapy and approximately five points in the frontline setting as well as market growth. Pervixi achieved sales of $369 million and growth of over 100%, driven by share gains and capacity expansion. This reflects sequential growth of 10.5% as we continue to expand outside of the U.S. TechValley and Talvei growth was 15% and 50.2% respectively, reflecting strong launches in the relapsed refractory setting. Patient demand remains strong despite continued adoption of longer dosing intervals. Erlida continued to deliver strong growth of 14.6% despite the impact of Part D redesign, primarily driven by share gains and market growth. Ribrovant plus LastClues continued its strong launch trajectory with sales of $141 million, growth over 100%. Within immunology, Tremfya delivered growth of 20.1% despite the impact of Part D redesign, driven by share gains and market growth across all indications, including our newly launched indication in ulcerative colitis. STELARA declined 32.3%, driven by the impact of biosimilar competition and Part D redesign.",211.0,125.0,14.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.112,0.008,0.024,0.0,0.0,0.104

This positively impacted results in the quarter and is anticipated to continue for the remainder of the year. Remicade sales also include a one-time patient mix benefit in the U.S. In neuroscience, growth of 42.9% was driven by increased physician and patient demand. Finally, other assets that were impacted by Part D redesign include Invego long-acting injectables, which declined 13.5%, pulmonary hypertension, which declined 1.2%, and was partially offset by market growth and share gains, and Xarelto, which increased by 33% and also included a one-time patient mix benefit. I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide sales of $8 billion increased 4.1% with growth of 5.1% in the U.S. and 3% outside of the U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 280 basis points on worldwide growth, 420 basis points in the U.S., and 120 basis points outside of the U.S. Underlying MedTech performance was driven by commercial execution and strength of new products, partially offset by several one-time events disproportionately impacting orthopedics in addition to continued competitive PFA pressures, in electrophysiology and headwinds in China. Results were negatively impacted by approximately 210 basis points worldwide, 240 in the U.S., and 180 outside of the U.S. due to these one-time events. In cardiovascular, electrophysiology growth was roughly flat versus prior year driven by lapping of prior year inventory dynamics in Asia, impacting worldwide results by roughly 310 basis points, and competitive PSA ablation catheter pressure. This was mostly offset by global procedure growth, new product uptake, and commercial execution. Abiomed delivered growth of 14% driven by strong growth in all regions and continued adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella CP technology. Cardiovascular results also included $258 million associated with the acquisition of Shockwave. As a reminder, we will lap the acquisition benefit at the end of May. In vision, contact lenses and other grew 2.7% driven by continued strategic price actions and strong performance in the Acuvue Oasis one-day family of products. Surgical vision growth of 6.2% was driven by our recent innovations, Tegnis Odyssey, PIRC, and Eye Hands, as well as commercial execution, partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S. Surgery grew 1.1% with divestitures negatively impacting results by approximately 180 basis points. Performance was driven primarily by commercial execution and the continued strength and adoption of new products across wound closure and biosurgery. Growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in energy and endocutters, as well as the negative impact of China VBP. Given the disproportionate impact of the one-time events to orthopedics, I'd like to draw your attention to this additional slide. Orthopedics declined 3.1%, primarily driven by the lapping of a one-time revenue recognition timing change related to certain products across all platforms in the U.S., fewer selling days, and revenue disruption from the previously announced orthopedic transformation. These one-time events negatively impacted worldwide orthopedics growth by approximately 480 basis points, 650 basis points in the U.S., and 210 basis points outside of the U.S. This was partially offset by the success of new product launches and commercial execution. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2025. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 320 basis points, driven by unfavorable transactional currency and product mix, primarily due to the decline of STELARA in innovative medicine, as well as the fair value step-up in amortization associated with the Shockwave acquisition in MedTech. Selling, marketing, and administrative expenses improved 130 basis points driven by operating spend management and phasing of investments primarily in innovative medicine. Research and development expenses leveraged by 190 basis points primarily driven by portfolio progression towards commercialization and phasing of investments in innovative medicine, partially offset by investments associated with the recent acquisitions of Shockwave and V Wave in MedTech. Interest income and expense was a net income of $128 million as compared to $209 million in the first quarter of 2024, primarily driven by higher interest rates paid on higher average debt balances. Other income and expense was a net income of $7.3 billion compared to an expense of $2.4 billion in the prior year, driven by the $7 billion talc reserve reversal in the first quarter of 2025 and the $2.7 billion talc settlement proposal recorded during the first quarter of 2024. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 19.3% versus 12.4% in the same period last year, primarily driven by the tax effect of the reversal of the talc settlement accrual. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.3% versus 16.5% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming first quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided the company's income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment for the quarter. New this quarter and to continue our efforts of increased financial transparency, you will find GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations by segment in the supplemental schedules of our press release. Innovative medicine margin declined from 42.9% to 42.5%, primarily driven by unfavorable transactional currency and product mix, and cost of products sold and Part D redesign, partially offset by operating leverage. MedTech margin declined from 26.4% to 25.9%, primarily driven by R&D and selling, marketing, and administrative investments associated with the recent acquisition of Shockwave and V Wave. As a result, adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 36.8% to 36.6%. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call, and I will now turn the call over to Joe.",972.0,558.0,15.0,18.0,8.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,0.026881720430107527,0.03225806451612903,0.014336917562724014,0.0035842293906810036,0.0,-0.005376344086021506

Thanks, Jessica, not just for the transition now, but also how well you have led the investor relations function the past few years. The investment community will miss you, but we look forward to seeing you in the lead finance role in innovative medicine. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strength and reliability of Johnson & Johnson. Innovative medicine achieved robust growth in the face of STELARA biosimilar entrants, and we advanced our pipeline, attaining significant clinical and regulatory milestones. In MedTech, as indicated in January, we anticipated pockets of challenge early on and are planning for higher second-half growth in those areas of our business. The team is focused on commercial execution and accelerating the recently launched products to deliver MedTech's commitments that are included in the company's full-year guidance.

Focusing on portfolio renewal, we plan to exit certain non-strategic product lines globally and optimize select sites across the network. We anticipate some modest short-term revenue disruption in Surgery of approximately $250 million in total over the next two years, but these actions will improve our ability to accelerate growth and enhance profitability. The program is expected to be completed in 2027 with costs estimated at approximately $900 million. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We are pleased with free cash flow generation in the quarter of approximately $3.4 billion. We ended the first quarter with $38.8 billion of cash and marketable securities and $52.3 billion of debt for a net debt position of $13.5 billion. It is important to note that cash and net debt will be favorably impacted by approximately $14 billion of cash held in anticipation of the IntraCellular acquisition, which closed on April 2nd. Taking this into consideration, net debt would have been approximately $27.5 billion. Investment in innovation remains the highest priority in our capital deployment, and during the first quarter, we invested more than $3 billion in research and development, approximately 15% of sales. We also remain committed to returning capital directly to shareholders. We recognize the value investors place on our dividend, and we were pleased to announce today that our board of directors authorized a 4.8% increase, marking our sixty-third consecutive year of dividend increases. The IntraCellular Therapies acquisition bolsters our neuroscience portfolio, and we maintain a disciplined approach to inorganic growth, focusing on acquisitions and partnerships that align strategically and offer value creation. As noted in our talc investor call, and following up on some of Joaquin's earlier comments, we reversed $7 billion of the reserve previously held for the bankruptcy plan. This litigation has not and we foresee will not impact our ability to execute upon our capital allocation priorities to appropriately manage our business. Let's now discuss our full-year guidance for 2025. We are increasing our operational sales guidance for the full year by $700 million to reflect the addition of Caplyta following the completion of the IntraCellular acquisition.",381.0,217.0,10.0,4.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.04608294930875576,0.018433179723502304,0.03686635944700461,0.004608294930875576,0.004608294930875576,0.027649769585253458

Excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, we are maintaining our adjusted operational sales growth to the range of 2% to 3% compared to 2024. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements, and last quarter, we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar of 1.04. Last week, the euro spot rate relative to the US dollar was 1.11. We estimate an incremental positive foreign currency impact of $1.1 billion versus previous guidance, resulting in a full-year headwind of $600 million. As such, we now expect reported sales growth between 2.6% to 3.6% with a midpoint of $91.4 billion or 3.1%. Turning to other notable items on the P&L, we are maintaining our guide of operating margin improvement by 300 basis points versus 2024.

Other income is anticipated to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, a slight increase versus previous guidance. Despite $0.25 dilution from the IntraCellular acquisition, including the impact of tariffs, based on what is in place today, we are pleased to be able to maintain our adjusted reported earnings per share guidance of 6.2% at the midpoint for a range of $10.50 to $10.70, partially aided by the reduced FX impact. I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on phasing for your models. We continue to expect both innovative medicine and MedTech operational sales growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half. Regarding innovative medicine, we maintain the assumption that the impact of STELARA biosimilar competition will accelerate throughout the year, similar to HUMIRA's erosion curve, which is still our proxy with the additive impact of Part D redesign. The impact of Part D redesign on affected products as a percent of sales will be consistently applied throughout the year, aligned with how we traditionally account for similar discount and rebate programs. Naturally, we expect a greater benefit from our newly launched products as the year progresses. Regarding MedTech, we expect normalized procedure volume and seasonality, and of course, we anniversary the Shockwave acquisition at the end of May. We anticipate our newly launched products to build throughout the year with the relaunch of VERIPULSE in the U.S., the introductions of dual energy STSF in the EU, Velas Uniti, Velas Spine, and Technis Odyssey. Lastly, this slide highlights the one-time prior year P&L items that should be taken into quarterly consideration for your models. Beyond our financial commitments and what Joaquin and John mentioned, we are excited for the pipeline progress planned for the remainder of 2025. In innovative medicine, this includes expected approvals in nipocalumab for generalized myasthenia gravis, subcutaneous riboflavin for non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S., Tremfya subcutaneous induction for ulcerative colitis, and Caplyta for adjunctive major depressive disorder. We continue our rolling submission of TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and anticipate filing Ichotrochindra in psoriasis. And planned data readouts for riboflavin in head and neck cancer, Ichotrochindra in ulcerative colitis, as well as head-to-head data versus SITC-2 in psoriasis. In MedTech, we continue to make progress with clinical trials for our OTAVA robotic surgical system and across our cardiovascular portfolio, including heart recovery with Impella ECP submission, and circulatory restoration with Javelin and Shockwave E8 launches. This progress will bode well for financial performance for the balance of this decade. In fact, building on John's earlier discussion on our innovative medicine pipeline, and what I just outlined, I'd like to revisit and update a slide that we shared at our enterprise business review in late 2023. In that slide, you may recall we highlighted key assets in our portfolio that we expected to drive long-term growth and projected higher revenue than street estimates. We've been pleased to see some estimates have been raised since the 2023 enterprise business review, and now I'd like to walk you through some of our current thinking on our pipeline potential. To show where we see even more upside. Based on current 2027 street estimates, our projections are at least two times higher for riboflavin plus LASCRUZ and at least 50% higher for SPRAVATO. One asset that we didn't highlight in this look back in 2023 was Tremfya. However, given recent regulatory approvals for inflammatory bowel disease, we now see sales for Tremfya at least 25% higher than current street estimates. When looking ahead to 2028, we anticipate sales previously referred to as TARUS to be at least three times higher than current street estimates, and new to the chart, Ichotrochindra, our targeted oral peptide, to be at least two times higher. To be balanced, analyst estimates are still a bit more optimistic than our own estimates on nipocalumab in 2027. However, we do anticipate closing that gap after launch. We have even stronger conviction today in our growth opportunities than at the enterprise business review as we've reached new milestones with each of these medicines. And importantly, we expect all these assets to achieve peak year sales beyond 2028 with further potential upside to street estimates in the outer years. Even after considering risk adjustments for unapproved products that you may apply, hopefully, you'll also conclude there is additional value to your outlooks. In summary, it was a solid start to the year. Johnson & Johnson's diversified business model uniquely positions us to tackle the headwinds in 2025, deliver on our financial commitments, and advance our pipeline to create long-term sustainable value for shareholders.

Joe, you talked about $400 million in tariffs in the 2025 guidance or about fourteen cents by our math. What is that on an annualized basis? And how are you thinking about being able to mitigate that over time? Can you pass it along to customers, or can you offset it by moving production?

So what's included in the $400 million, and again, that is primarily MedTech tariffs at this point. It's based on the programs that have been announced and the timing that correlates with those programs. So that would be inclusive of Mexico and Canadian import tariffs that are not excluded. Of USMCA. It'll include to us a very small degree some of the steel and aluminum tariffs that impact some of our products. It includes the China tariffs as well as the China retaliatory tariff, and that is probably the most substantial out of all the tariffs in terms of that $400 million. And so just to maybe clarify for everybody, that is products of US origin being shipped into China, and that's probably the most penalizing factor. That $400 million, I don't want to be cavalier about that. It's obviously the program has been phased in as a partial year. And then you have mostly this being captured as cost of goods. It's going to sit on the balance sheet in inventory and be relieved through the P&L in future periods. So that's how we're thinking of it. In terms of mitigation strategies, I think you know across our entire business, we're very limited in terms of price leverage. Whether it be on the MedTech side, there's contractual agreements already in place and certainly very much precluded on the pharmaceutical side. On current products that exist in terms of taking price increase. And I know Joaquin has a few thoughts regarding tariffs and maybe other mitigation factors and the supply nature of healthcare. Thank you, Joe. And thank you, Larry, for the question. Thinking about tariffs and thinking specifically about pharmaceutical tariffs, there's a reason why pharmaceutical tariffs are zero. It's because tariffs can create disruptions in the supply chain leading to shortages. If what you want is to build manufacturing capacity in the US, both in MedTech and in pharmaceuticals, the most effective answer is not tariffs, but tax policy. As a matter of fact, since President Trump's 2017 tax reform, the investment in manufacturing both in MedTech and in pharmaceuticals has significantly increased. And when you think about our recent announcement of investing $55 billion over the next four years, at the completion of this investment plan, essentially, all our advanced medicines that are used in the US will be manufactured in the US. So tax policy is a very effective tool to be able to build manufacturing capacity here in the US both for MedTech and pharmaceuticals. Hey, Larry. I just want to follow-up too. You did ask about a full-year impact, and I would say I purposely ignored the only because it would be way too speculative at this point. As we know, these tariffs are very fluid, and the responsible action for us now is to quantify what we see the impact in 2026 and then see what happens with respect to does it lend itself to negotiations with other countries on what's actually in place as we get into the later part of 2025?",529.0,223.0,3.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.013452914798206279,0.03139013452914798,0.02242152466367713,0.004484304932735426,0.004484304932735426,-0.017937219730941704

So I would say it's a there's a two-part answer to this one. So specifically, in the quarter when looking at the first quarter of 2024, we obviously had the impact of STELARA, which was a much higher gross margin product than our average product in our portfolio. You had Part D, which is exclusively priced, which is an eroding margin. And then you had some, I would say, transactional currency headwinds, one a favorable impact last year or in 2023, funneling into 2024, and then some unfavorability from last year's currency action. I would expect moving forward based on some of the plans that we have, you could expect that that 300 basis points to probably improve by a third to fifty percent, and that would be inclusive of the tariff that I just mentioned in Larry's question. The other thing I would say is, I know you guys do a great job, but I think analysts were maybe a little bit optimistic with respect to their outlook for gross profit, given that we had STELARA in Part D certainly communicated in the past, I believe the consensus was taking gross margins up year over year, and that one was probably a little bit of a miss.

So what we saw with STELARA in the first quarter was definitely in line with our expectations for the product for the year, and we continue to guide to the HUMIRA two-year erosion curve once there were multiple biosimilars as really the best model there and make sure, you know, are also including the additional impact of Part D redesign. If I could, you know, one additional point around STELARA, we take a look at the business overall, it was highlighted that we had 4.2% growth across innovative medicine. That included a negative 810 basis point impact from STELARA. You know, if you exclude that from our business, the remaining business, the bulk 90% of our business was actually growing at over 12%, really demonstrating the strength of our overall business. And with eleven key brands that were growing double digits. So, yes, we've got the STELARA LOE, but the strength of the business is really coming through across all of our growth drivers. Yeah. And I would add to that. It is remarkable that in a year in which we are facing the headwind of the STELARA biosimilars and Part D redesign, we are able to grow even in the first quarter and that we are able to do it like any other company to my knowledge in the healthcare industry, has done it.

I think when you know, we think about our business, the one thing we look to is certainly job reports in the US, and as of the most recent reports, it seemed to be pretty healthy. The reason we look at that is because it's a precursor as to who may have benefits and coverage for prescription medications as well as procedures inclusive of elective procedures. We have seen in times past when there's been a little bit of a recession that some of those elective procedures maybe get delayed, but they don't get abandoned. And I'm thinking primarily within orthopedics, you know, healthcare overall has proven to be, while nothing is immune to a recession, it's been a little bit more recession-proof than most other industries. And so we'll continue to monitor that. But right now, we feel good about the standards of care that we're elevating on both the innovative medicine and MedTech side of the house. Overall care demand remains solid, and we feel good about the rest of the year regarding procedures and use of pharmaceuticals. I don't know any comments on that team? Sure. Further to Joe's point, Daniela, the category such as advanced IOLs is a good precursor to really assessing the health of the economy. And so far, we haven't seen any impact on the performance of our IOL portfolio. In fact, we've seen the opposite. When you look at the performance of our IOL business on the back of the launch of both TECNIS Odyssey here in the US and PureC globally. We're seeing benchmark performances and frankly a turnaround of our performance here in the US with truly differentiated innovation.

It was already announced previously, so it's something that we consider normal that is going to happen. And overall, adding to my comments on tariffs before, I think it's also important that companies in healthcare partner with the administration to look to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities that exist today in our healthcare supply chain so as to avoid any continuity of supply effect. So it's important for us to partner with the administration and with the government, and we plan to do it in this process to make sure that we have enough manufacturing capacity here in the US to be able to address multiple scenarios. And, Terence, just to be clear that we want to be deferential to the administration and their process. That is speculative.

And as we mentioned, we've tried to provide as much transparency as possible to the significant impact of one-timers in the quarter, which, to your point, have disproportionately impacted the Ortho business to the tune of roughly 480 basis points. There are three key drivers to that. Number one, the lapping of prior year change in walking implants revenue recognition, fewer selling days, and finally revenue disruption from the recent ortho transformation, which we announced in 2023. So when you actually look at our operational growth, when accounting for those, it would be closer to 2%. Now at the same time, I will say, Joanne, we are not satisfied. Our underlying performance was impacted by competitive pressures, primarily in spine and sports, which is partially offset by strong NPIs and commercial execution in categories like trauma, shoulder, and foot and ankle. What gives us confidence in continued acceleration to the back half of the year is the incredible impact of truly differentiated innovation across our ortho portfolio. In fact, in 2024, we had eighteen 510(k) approvals here in the US, and forty-five outside of the US across our portfolio. And what gives us confidence is this combination of having best-in-class implants with truly differentiated enabled technology such as Velas. In our Hips portfolio, we believe we're going to see continued performance on the back of our focus on two-point-o. In these, we have seen a slowdown in revisions where I think you know we are historically number one, but feel very confident about continued momentum in primary with the combination of Attun and Velas which is now available in thirty markets. We have a hundred and ten thousand procedures, and as you probably know, we're now launching the Velocirune knee in the coming quarters. In trauma, this was a standout quarter for us, close to 7.3% operational growth when you account for the one-timers, and this was driven by a tremendous uptake of our VoLTE plating system and the feedback we've got from surgeons, especially for our small frag. Our mini frag and our distal radius has been exceptional. I think you also know that spine has been a bit of a laggard for us in the ortho portfolio. We are now effectively launching the TriAlta Spine System, which is a thoracolumbar system coupled with Velo Spine, also launching in the coming quarters. And so not the best start but strong confidence in improved performance the remainder of the year and also.",424.0,201.0,13.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.06467661691542288,0.01990049751243781,0.01990049751243781,0.0,0.0,0.04477611940298507

And Tremfya really had a great quarter in the first quarter with sales nearly a billion dollars and over 20% operational growth. And this was really driven by March as well as what we're seeing as it relates to the launch in ulcerative colitis and also in Crohn's disease. So, we are really encouraged by the launch in both of these IBD indications. Tremfya is now if we start with ulcerative colitis and how we're doing and then now go to Crohn's disease. So, in ulcerative colitis, Tremfya is the fastest-growing product. In the ulcerative colitis market, IL-23s are the fastest-growing class, and Tremfya has already achieved nearly a 50% share of the IL-23 new patient starts in UC. So, this is really based on the strength of the profile of the product and the strong differentiation that we have as a dual-acting IL-23, both impacting both IL-23 as well as CD-sixty four. The robust data that we have as it relates to efficacy and remission. And then as we get into Crohn's disease and then later in ulcerative colitis, as well, what we see is unrivaled simplicity with the opportunity for subcu induction as well as maintenance dosing. When we take a look at market research data and you know, intend to prescribe, the data comes through really strong that gastroenterologists really prefer Tremfya over the IL-23 competitors based on those aspects that I just discussed. So, you know, efficacy, sustained remission, and mucosal healing right now for UC. On Crohn's, there is very significant enthusiasm around our launch there, and it's really quickly getting traction. In the first few weeks since approval in Crohn's disease, patient initiation volumes are outpacing the other IL-23 launches in the market, and the polling data, our recent market research, eighty-two percent of gastroenterologists consider Tremfya's induction dosing and flexibility to be a very positive differentiation in their treatment decisions. And they're seeing the efficacy profile to be quite compelling compared to the other therapies that are in the market. So we believe that in IBD, both in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's, we're off to a strong start. And, as a reminder, tracking back to STELARA, seventy-five percent of sales were in IBD indications. We see no reason why Tremfya wouldn't be the same or even better based on what we're seeing with the strength and competitiveness of the profile.",426.0,181.0,11.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.06077348066298342,0.0,0.016574585635359115,0.0,0.0055248618784530384,0.06077348066298342

You know, with even a market like psoriasis, which, you know, should be well penetrated by now because it is a place where some of the biologics first got their start. More than half of patients who are eligible for advanced therapy are still not on advanced therapy, and for many of these patients, it's really an aversion to the injections and going to biologic route.

Today's results showcased the strength of our uniquely diversified business as the only major health care company operating in both the med tech and innovative medicine sectors. In the second quarter, we delivered operational sales growth of 4.6% across our business. In Innovative Medicines, we reported 3.8% operational sales growth, delivering more than $15 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. No other health care company has grown through the loss of exclusivity of a multibillion dollar product in the first year. In our case, STELARA and yet that is exactly what we are doing. And for the second quarter in a row. Our performance was driven by double-digit growth across 3 brands including DARZALEX, CARVYKTI, [indiscernible] as well as [indiscernible] and in medtech, we delivered 6.1% operational sales growth with particularly strong momentum in cardiovascular surgery ambition. Based on our strong performance in the quarter, we are pleased to raise our full year sales guidance by $2 billion and EPS guidance by $0.25 a from $10.60 to $10.85. Results like this are a direct result of our deep and resilient portfolio. It's what makes Johnson & Johnson unique. Today, we will focus on the remarkable ways we are driving innovation and creating value for patients and shareholders. We will highlight the depth of our portfolio and pipeline focusing on 6 areas of unmet need and where we are delivering significant growth. Oncology, immunology, neuroscience, cardiovascular, surgery ambition. These are spaces where we are moving the conversation from treatment to cure and where we are extending and improving lives in meaningful ways. Let's start with innovative medicine and oncology, where we have a bold vision to eliminate cancer. Our leading products for the treatment of blood cancers and solid tumors are built on cutting-edge scientific platforms that are transforming outcomes for patients with more than 10 products in market across 26 approved indications and over 25 treatments in late-stage development, we expect to become the #1 oncology company by 2030 with sales of more than $50 billion. And when you look at our quarterly results in oncology, with operational sales growth of 22.3%, you can see that we are well on our way to achieving that. I'll draw your attention to 3 key areas of Q2 progress. First is multiple myeloma, where we have treatments in every line of therapy. Approximately 80% of myeloma patients today receive a Johnson & Johnson medicine at some point in their treatment journey. And in Q2, we presented several important sets of data. They include new 5-year data showing a single treatment of our CAR T therapy CARVYKTI has the potential to deliver long-term remission. We also presented the first data from our investigational tri-specific antibody, which showed an unprecedented 100% overall response rate in heavily pretreated patients. With results like this, we are closer than ever to our ambition of curing multiple myeloma. Second is lung cancer, where our chemotherapy-free combination of [indiscernible] has a projected overall survival of at least a year over the current standard of care in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations. Intend to prescribe continues to grow among health care professionals, which you can see in our strong quarterly sales. This is a life-changing advancement for patients and one we are building on with a pipeline of novel therapies. And third is bladder cancer, where we are excited to share that we have received FDA priority review for TAR-200 a first-of-its-kind drug releasing system. We anticipate launching TAR-200 for high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer later this year a transformational product that harnesses our unique expertise in both innovative medicine and medtech. We expect TAR-200 to generate at least billion in annual peak GR sales. In immunology, we have a 25 GR legacy of redefining the standard of care, and we are just getting started. With 6 products in market across 14 approved indications and many treatments in late-stage development we are expanding treatment options for patients and restoring health for millions of people around the world. From REMICADE and SYMPHONY to STELARA and TREMFYA and now exploring targeted oral peptides and future combinations, the growth potential of our immunology portfolio and pipeline continues to be significant. For immunology, I will draw your attention to 2 key areas of Q2 progress. First is TREMFYA, which has recently expanded into inflammatory bowel disease. TREMFYA grew 30% in the quarter. with strong uptake in Crohn's disease and assertive colitis, we expect it to generate at least $10 billion annually in peak GR sales. We also made important progress in our pipeline in Q2 and expect to file [ ICOTrokindra ] with the FDA in the third quarter as the first targeted oral peptide to selectively block the IL-23 receptor with similar efficacy to a biologic. As a once-a-day pill, this molecule has the potential to set a new standard in the treatment of plaque psoriasis, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months. In neuroscience, we are building on a 17-year legacy and to be the #1 company by the end of the decade. We are pushing boundaries in diseases like schizophrenia, depression and Alzheimer's, which together affect 1 in 8 people worldwide. In Q2, SPRAVATO grew 53%, delivering sustained double-digit growth and demonstrating the power of this medicine for patients living with difficult-to-treat depression. We also completed the acquisition of intracellular therapies this quarter. Intracellular CAPLYTA is approved to treat adults with schizophrenia and bipolar depression and we are excited about the anticipated major depressive disorder approval later this year. With the addition of CAPLYTA, we now have 5 neuroscience products in market across 6 approved indications and 8 treatments in late-stage development. CAPLYTA adds to Johnson & Johnson's robust lineup of therapies with $5 billion plus potential in peak year sales and further solidifies sales growth above analyst expectations through the rest of the decade. Turning to medtech and in cardiovascular, specifically, we are leaders in heart recovery circulatory restoration and electrophysiology. Cardiovascular has some of the largest unmet needs in health care and is one of the fastest-growing spaces in medicine tech. In Q2, we delivered over 22% operational sales growth over the quarter driven by new product performance in Abiomed, show with and strength in mapping in [indiscernible] Today, we're a leader in 4 of the largest and highest growth medtech segments within cardiovascular intervention, impacting more than 1 million patients each year. Now let me highlight 3 areas of important progress from Q2. First is electrophysiology, which delivered close to 10% operational sales growth over the quarter, driven by new product performance and strength in mapping. We have now completed more than 10,000 variables cases globally with a reported neurovascular event rate of less than 0.5%, consistent with published rates across other PSA platforms. Second, we continue to advance a suite of cardiovascular solutions to expand our market leadership including our dual energy Thermocool SmartTouch SF catheter, where we performed our first cases in Europe this quarter. It also includes Omni pulse where we presented strong early data that will expand our portfolio of tools for safe and streamlined ablation procedures. Third is Shockwave's unique intravascular lithotripsy technology or IVL, which has transformed the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and is driving significant growth. Shockwave is expected to be our $13 billion medtech platform by the end of the year a position that is further strengthened by a compelling body of evidence on the benefits of this technology. This includes data showing an ideal first approach can achieve excellent outcomes in female patients with complex calcified coronary artery disease. In surgery, we have spent 140 years advancing the standard of care. And today, our surgical technologies are used in most operating rooms around the world. Q2 highlights include the introduction of the Ethicon 4000 surgical stapler, the newest advancement in our surgical portfolio. featuring advanced stapling technology and reloads the Ethicon 4000 minimizes surgical leaks and bleeding, which are common and costly surgical complications for patients and hospitals. This advanced stapling technology will be harnessed for future use exclusively on the OTTAVA robotic surgery system. And as mentioned on our earnings call in April, OTTAVA completed its first clinical cases casted bypass surgeries performed in Houston. In our conversations with surgeons who have spent time on OTTAVA, they tell us that they are eager for the system's sophisticated architecture design features like twin motion the surgeon and trusted Ethicon advanced instrumentation only available in [ Notaba ] and the future connection to our open digital ecosystem polyphonic. We plan to submit for an FDA de novo approval next year. And finally, vision, where we have a deep legacy in developing transformational innovation. With quarterly growth of 4.6% across the business and 8.9% in Surgical Vision, the portfolio has a robust growth trajectory driven by our ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-day family of contact lenses and our Technics [indiscernible] intraocular lenses. And with the Q2 release of the first disposable multifocal lenses for people with astigmatism, we have high expectations. You know few other health care companies can talk about their impact across as many high-growth areas as Johnson & Johnson and non spanning both innovative medicine and medicine tech. These 6 examples are only a cross section of our cutting edge portfolio. This step and breadth is who we are at Johnson & Johnson. It's how we grow through a major loss of exclusivity, how we have reinvented ourselves time and time again and how we will deliver strong financial performance through the end of the decade and beyond. The bottom line is this, Johnson & Johnson's relentless focus on innovation yields results quarter after quarter, year after year. I will now turn the call back over to Darwin.",1621.0,856.0,41.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,3.0,0.04789719626168224,0.005841121495327103,0.005841121495327103,0.0011682242990654205,0.0011682242990654205,0.04205607476635514

Unless otherwise stated, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q2 2025 sales results. Worldwide sales were $23.7 billion for the quarter, Sales increased 4.6% despite an approximate 710 basis point headwind from STELARA. Growth in the U.S. was 7.8% and 0.6% outside of the U.S. Worldwide growth was positively impacted by 160 basis points, primarily due to the Intracellular and Shockwave acquisitions. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.5 billion with diluted earnings per share of $2.29 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.93 a year ago. [indiscernible] net earnings for the quarter were $6.7 billion, with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.77 representing a decrease of 2.1% and 1.8%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2024. The decrease is driven by interest associated with incremental debt from the Intracellular acquisition and GP erosion from STELARA. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter with a focus on the 6 areas Joaquin discussed that will drive significant growth for the enterprise. Beginning with innovative medicine, where our results demonstrate the depth of our expertise in oncology, immunology and neuroscience. Worldwide sales of $15.2 billion increased 3.8% despite an approximate 1,170 basis point headwind from STELARA demonstrating the strength of our key brands and new launches. Growth in the U.S. was 7.6% and minus 1.6% outside the U.S. Growth outside of the U.S. was negatively impacted by STELARA biosimilars and the COVID-19 vaccine. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 140 basis points on worldwide growth due to the intracellular acquisition. In oncology, starting with myeloma, [indiscernible] growth was 21.5%, primarily driven by continued strong share gains of approximately 4.1 points across all lines of therapy with close to 8 points in the frontline setting as well as market growth. CARVYKTI achieved sales of $439 million with growth of over 100%. And driven by share gains and capacity expansion. This reflects continued strong sequential growth of 17.9% as we expand outside of the U.S. TECVAYLI and [indiscernible] growth was 22.4% and 54.3%, respectively, bolstered by continued expansion into the community setting. Patient demand remains strong despite continued adoption of longer dosing intervals. In prostate cancer, a leader delivered strong growth of 21% with continued share gains and market growth. In lung cancer, RYBREVANT/LAZCLUZE delivered sales of $179 million and growth over 100%. And with sequential growth of 26.5%, driven by continued strong launch uptake. We continue to see share gains in both first and second lines of therapy. Within immunology, TREMFYA delivered growth of 30.1%, primarily driven by share gains with continued strong uptake across recently launched IBD indications and overall market growth. STELARA declined by 43.2%, driven by the impact of biosimilar competition and Part D redesign, which is in line with our expectations. In neuroscience, [indiscernible] growth of 53% was driven by continued strong demand from physicians and patients. Long-acting injectables declined by 6.3% due to the impact of Part D redesign and unfavorable patient mix. I'll now turn your attention to med tech. Worldwide sales of $8.5 billion increased 6.1%, with growth of 8% in the U.S. and 4.1% outside the U.S., driven by strong performance in 3 focus areas: cardiovascular, surgery and vision. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 200 basis points on worldwide growth primarily due to Shockwave. In Cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered growth of 9.8% versus prior year, driven by strength in competitive mapping, new product performance and procedure growth. Abiomed delivered growth of 16.9% with continued strong adoption of Impella technology and Shockwave delivered strong double-digit growth with the recent introduction of the Javelin and EA catheters. As a reminder, the acquisition benefit of Shockwave was lapped to the end of May. Surgery grew 1.8% despite divestitures negatively impacting results by approximately 60 basis points. Performance was primarily driven by technology penetration in wound closure and the strength of the portfolio in biosurgery. Growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in energy and the negative impact of China VBP across the portfolio. In vision contact lenses and other ocular products grew 2.9%, driven by strategic price actions and strong performance in the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of contact lenses, including the recent launch of OASYS Max 1-day multifocal for astigmatism. Surgical vision growth of 8.9% continues to be driven by strong performance in Tecnis Odyssey, PRC and [indiscernible] The orthopedics business declined by 1.6%, driven by competitive pressures, the transformation program and China VBP. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2025. And I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter a year ago. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 150 basis points driven by product mix and amortization related to the intracellular acquisition and Innovative Medicine as well as med tech macroeconomic factors and VBP in China. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses improved 50 basis points driven by corporate expense rationalization, partially offset by increased investment in recent acquisitions. Research and development expenses leveraged by 50 basis points primarily driven by portfolio rationalization and expense phasing in med tech. We continued our strong investment in research and development with $3.5 billion or approximately 15% of sales in Q2. Interest income and expense was a net expense of $48 million as compared to $125 million of income in the second quarter of 2024. Primarily driven by lower rates of interest and on cash balances and a higher average debt balance associated with the intracellular acquisition. Other income and expense was a net expense of $0.1 billion compared to an expense of $0.7 billion in the prior year primarily driven by lower talc litigation expense in 2025 and the $0.4 billion loss on the sale of the retained stake in [indiscernible] shares recorded in 2024. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 14.7% compared to 18.5% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 10-Q for details on the changes in taxes. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide where we have also provided the company's income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment for the quarter. In support of our efforts to increase financial transparency, you will again find GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations by segment in the supplemental schedules of our press release. Innovative Medicine margin declined from 44.6% to 42.7%, primarily driven by negative mix and cost of products sold related to STELARA. Med tech margin declined from 25.7% to 22.2%, driven by macroeconomic factors in cost of products sold as well as other income. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call, and I will now turn the call over to John.",1109.0,639.0,35.0,19.0,7.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,7.0,0.054773082942097026,0.0297339593114241,0.010954616588419406,0.001564945226917058,0.0,0.025039123630672927

I look forward to you leveraging your recent experience leading the innovative medicine finance team to benefit Johnson & Johnson's Investor Relations function. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As already highlighted, we delivered a very strong second quarter, exceeding expectations on both the top and bottom line. While our currently marketed products and platforms drove this quarter's performance, the progress across our pipeline in the first half of the year heightens our conviction to achieve and I'd be willing to bet likely beat the upper end of the growth targets we conveyed at our 2023 enterprise business review. As previously mentioned by Joaquin and Darren, the Innovative Medicine business continues to grow through STELARA loss of exclusivity and driven by our in-market portfolio. We continue to advance our pipeline, attaining significant clinical and regulatory milestones that will help drive sustained and accelerating growth through the back half of the decade. In med tech, while we still have work to do, we saw improvement over first quarter results, driven by strong performance in the cardiovascular portfolio, surgical vision and wound closure in surgery. We remain focused on higher-growth markets enhancing competitiveness to gain market share and executing against our transformation initiatives to improve margins. Let's get into some of the financial commentary starting with our cash position. Free cash flow through the first half of 2025 exceeded $6 billion, which accounts for elevated tax payments related to the final annual TCJA toll tax payment when compared to the first half of 2024. We ended the second quarter with $19 billion of cash and marketable securities and $51 billion of debt for a net debt position of $32 billion. These figures include the debt raised for the $14.5 billion intracellular acquisition, which closed on April 2. Regarding talk litigation, we expect the [ Daubert ] hearing to commence this fall and look forward to the court reexamining the junk science, the mass [indiscernible] has funded to promote baseless out claims against Johnson & Johnson. Turning to our full year guidance for 2025. Driven by the strength of our first half performance, we are increasing our operational sales guidance for the full year by approximately $900 million. We are now expecting operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 4.5% to 5%, with a midpoint of $92.9 billion or 4.8% representing a full point better when compared to prior guidance. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, our adjusted operational sales growth is now expected to be in the range of 3.2% and to 3.7% compared to 2024. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. And last quarter, we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar of $1.11. The U.S. dollar has weakened across all major currencies since April. Last week, the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar was 1.17. We estimate an incremental positive foreign currency impact of $1.1 billion versus previous guidance. As such, we now expect reported sales growth between 5.1% to 5.6%, with a midpoint of $93.4 billion or 5.4%. Currently, our guidance does not include the impact of the most favored nation concepts. With respect to MFN we share the administration's goal that American patients should pay less by addressing the real drivers of higher U.S. costs, including middlemen driving up prices and foreign markets not paying their fair share. Turning to other notable items on the P&L. At the beginning of the year, we guided to an approximate 300 basis points improvement in operating margin. Despite what you may have calculated on a year-to-date basis, we remain confident and reiterate our operating margin guide for the full year. This is due to efficiency programs designed for margin improvement as well as nonrecurring one-time IP R&D charges that occurred in the second half of 2024. This expected improvement also takes into consideration the dilution from the intracellular transaction as well as what we know today about the impact of tariffs on our business. During our first quarter conference call, we anticipated an impact from tariffs in 2025 to be approximately $400 million. Based on the current tariff landscape, we now anticipate the impact to be approximately $200 million exclusively related to our med tech business. We will look to reinvest the differential to continue to accelerate our pipeline and further power the launch of our new products, those on the market with new indications and those with near-term and painted approvals. We continue to monitor what the future years impact could be from tariffs on our business. For net interest expense, we now project between $0 and $100 million, an improvement from the previous guidance primarily driven by higher interest earned on cash balances. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 17% to 17.5% for the full year with the increase largely due to an adjustment to the company's global tax reserves. We are pleased that the 1 big beautiful Bill Act provides certainty for our previously announced $55 billion commitment to invest here in the United States. This includes provisions such as permanent expensing for domestic R&D spend, permanent bonus depreciation and 100% expensing of qualified production property, including our newly planned facility in North Carolina. We also welcome the improvements that were made to the international tax system. For your modeling, it is worth noting that the tax rate on foreign earnings, known as GILTI, is increasing by approximately 2% and from a statutory rate of 10.5% to 12.6%. This will result in an approximate 1% increase to our global effective tax rate in 2026. Turning to earnings per share. We are pleased to increase our reported adjusted earnings per share estimate by $0.25 to $10.85 or 8.7% at the midpoint for a range of $10.80 to $10.90, which is a combination of operational improvement and the favorable foreign currency dynamics I referenced earlier. Embedded in that is $0.08 of adjusted operational earnings per share, increasing our guidance to $10.68 or 7% at the midpoint. I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on phasing for your models. We continue to expect both innovative medicine and med tech operational sales growth to be higher in the second half of the year versus the first half. Regarding innovative medicine, we maintain the assumption that STELARA's large biosimilar competition will accelerate throughout the year with erosion similar to HUMIRAs in year 2, which is still our proxy with the additive unfavorable impact of Part D redesign. Turning to med tech. We anticipate an acceleration in growth to be driven by the increased adoption of newly launched products in cardiovascular, surgery and vision. We continue to expect normalized procedure volumes and typical seasonality patterns throughout the remainder of the year. Beyond our financial commitments and what Joaquin has already referenced, we are excited for the expected pipeline progress in the remainder of 2025. In innovative medicine, this includes expected approvals in TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, subcutaneous RYBREVANT for non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S. TREMFYA subcutaneous induction for ulcerative colitis and CAPLYTA for adjunctive major depressive disorder. Anticipated filings for approval include icotracindra in psoriasis and TREMFYA in psoriatic arthritis. As far as data readouts, we are planning for RYBREVANT in head and neck cancer and icotrakindra in ulcerative colitis as well as head-to-head data versus [ SETIK2 ] in psoriasis. In medtech, we continue to make progress with our clinical trials for our OTTAVA robotic surgical system. In our cardiovascular portfolio, we are planning regulatory submission for dual energy Thermocool SmartTouch SF catheter for cardiac arrhythmia in the U.S. and Impella ECP submission in heart recovery as well as Javelin and Shockwave E8 launches in circulatory restoration outside of the U.S. In Orthopedics, we will be launching a tune revision Hinge and a new plating system called Vault in the U.S. We will also be launching the Ethicon 4000 stapler with 3D reloads in surgery and the ACUVUE OASYS MAX Envision for astigmatism. In summary, I trust you agree the results delivered in the first half are evidence that our portfolio has the breadth and depth that enables us to attain growth. even in the face of a major LOE were very few, if any, other company could. The clinical advancements provide a robust base for accelerated top line growth, not just for the remainder of this year but for the back half of the decade. We're confident that the strength of our business model enables Johnson & Johnson to navigate a dynamic external environment while delivering on our financial commitments. This is directly attributable to the hard work and dedication of our 138,000 colleagues who focus daily on advancing our pipeline, increasing market share and progressing breakthrough treatments to patients that create long-term value for our shareholders.

I would say it's both are contributing in terms of the strong performance. And in fact, I would say -- this is a great opportunity for Jennifer and Tim to address some of the strength that we saw in our second quarter results, as you saw in credit to Jennifer and her team achieving the first $15 billion quarter despite $1.2 billion of year-on-year erosion in the quarter from STELARA. I don't think any other company can do that. And then, Tim, a notable improvement from what we reported in Q1 that gives us a lot of enthusiasm for the balance of this year where we -- as you heard in my earlier comments, we expect both businesses to actually continue that momentum and grow better in the second half to the first half.

And Joe, you stole my thunder on the over $15 billion in our first $15 billion quarter. Importantly, if you take a look at the 90% of our business that is not STELARA, we actually had extraordinarily robust growth of 15.5% growth, really demonstrating the strength across our portfolio. We had 13 brands that were growing double digits. And as we take a look at those, they are -- the vast majority of those are not only our growth drivers for today and tomorrow, but are also key growth drivers out through the end of the decade. A few of the notable drivers there. So first, in oncology, DARZALEX continues to perform very well. CARVYKTI performed well, [ ERLEADA. ] And we're really pleased with the launch uptake thus far on RYBREVANT/LAZCLUZE in non-small cell lung cancer. In immunology, TREMFYA is off to a great start in ulcerative colitis and also Crohn's disease and across neuroscience, both [indiscernible] and CAPLYTA had really, really strong performance for the quarter. So as I mentioned, 13 brands with double-digit growth. I won't go into all of those but really, really strong across the base of our business, and we're really excited throughout the rest of this year because we've got a number of additional catalysts that are coming through with additional approvals and such.

And Chris, to your question, I mean, for med tech, we were with our Q2 operational growth of 6.1%. This is a 4.4% sequential improvement over the first quarter. I think you know the primary contributor certainly cardiovascular, 22% growth we are, by far and away, now one of the largest and certainly the fastest-growing med tech company in cardiovascular, not only on the back of the success of the Abiomed and Shockwave but also the tremendous improvements you saw in our electrophysiology business, which, by the way, has a $5 billion base. And so tremendous performance is there. We also saw great results in vision, primarily driven by contact lenses as well as almost double-digit growth in surgical vision and then continued solid growth in surgery, especially on the back of in wound closure and biosurgery, both of those businesses, multibillion-dollar businesses, by the way, growing close to 7%. As we look to the back half, what gives us confidence in continued acceleration is a couple of things. Firstly, it's important to remember that Q1 and Q2 had difficult prior year competitors. But more importantly, what gives us confidence is the further acceleration we continue to shift our portfolio into higher-growth markets and really bring truly differentiated innovation to market in cardiovascular that will continue with Abiomed, which continues to add to our portfolio but more importantly, the evidence base around the benefits of Impella continues to impress the [indiscernible] study and the recent ACC and AH guidelines supporting Impella use in patients with cardiogenic shock. Shockwave II new products this launch, E8 as well as Javelin, which will further drive our performance specifically in the peripheral space. And then with EP, you're going to see continued performance of Vera pulse, and we'll add to that with the addition of the Dual Energy as TSF catheter in the European Union. In Vision, this is a true turnaround story. We're seeing tremendous results, especially with our Tech and PCs -- and just to put that in context, in the U.S., we had our second consecutive year of -- quarter of double-digit growth, growing 13%. And then in the back half of the year, you'll also see the launch of the ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-day multifocal for astigmatism. There's a lot there. Well, this is the world's first and only daily disposable lens for people with both the stigmatism and presbyopia. Surgery, we continue to see performance, we expect continued performance on the back of surge flow is easy and [indiscernible] And then I will call out that while our auto performance was softer than we would like, we have strong reasons to believe in continued acceleration through the remainder of the year with roughly 510(k) approvals last year, close to 40 outside of the U.S., and so big launches coming our way, especially in the areas where we face the most competition in hips and knees the [indiscernible] Hinge as well as [indiscernible] And then also in spine, we're seeing the rollout of our spine vellus robot well as trials, which we are confident that will continue to bolster our growth and competitiveness. And so I think in summary, due to easier comps as well as significant new products, we're confident in continued acceleration in the back half?",558.0,268.0,13.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.048507462686567165,0.011194029850746268,0.011194029850746268,0.0,0.0,0.03731343283582089

But if I had to point and maybe pick a couple of children. I would say TREMFYA, we're just getting started with our inflammatory bowel disease, and we grew 30% in the quarter. Those indications will provide further growth as a reminder STELARA's had 70% of their prescriptions within IBD, looking forward to getting the subcutaneous administration approval for lung cancer with RYBREVANT/LAZCLUZE. And then on the med tech side, I think the really shining star while maybe not the highest number is the EP energy that we have going forward, either maintaining or recapturing that leadership position as well as expected improvement in our contact lens business. You saw about 3% growth this quarter. with the launch of 1-day ACUVUE OASYS MAX that treats presbyopia and astigmatism.

We feel really confident in that $50 billion target for our oncology business. It's really based on the strength across the base of our business. You can take a look at multiple myeloma with DARZALEX and a lot of continued growth opportunity CARVYKTI also a $5 billion-plus brand. We've got TECVAYLI and TALVEY. We may come to it later a trispecific that we've started outlining and presenting data on -- so multiple myeloma, we anticipate to continue to be a stronghold. We've got a really nice franchise in prostate cancer right now with ERLEADA that is growing very well. You mentioned TAR-200. That is probably the asset that has the biggest disconnect between our internal forecasts and what the Street expects. We're really excited for this product and to be launching it in the second half of the year. with the ability to truly transform the treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. There has not been much innovation there in a very, very, very long time, and we think we're going to bring new hope. The data that we've presented there looks fabulous. We've really designed this product by urologists for urologists to seamlessly fit into routine clinical practice, and we really think that we've got a winner there. And if you just take a look, I think, boy, we see -- if you take a look at 2028 consensus, we actually see our numbers at least 3x higher. So that's a big disconnect. And then again, this is oncology, there's a lot to talk about last on RYBREVANT/LAZCLUZE so a quick update. The launch is going very well. As a reminder, RYBREVANT/LAZCLUZE is the first and only regimen that provides really clinically meaningful overall survival to patients greater than probably 12 months versus osimertinib. If you think about new patients, nearly diagnosed patients, they want to live longer, and they do not want to be using chemo in a first-line setting. And so we think we've really got the winning combination and are poised to become the new standard of care in that frontline lung cancer EGFR mutated lung cancer. And so this is another 1 of our $5 billion plus assets. In terms of the launch, while we're still early in it, as Joaquin had noted, the intent to prescribe has grown and we're now the #1 regimen that providers are claiming that they intend to prescribe for those frontline patients. We've done a great job of penetrating. We're already in nearly 100% of our high-priority accounts. And if we take a look really across lines of therapy, 1 out of every 4 patients across those lines of therapies now being initiated on a RYBREVANT/LAZCLUZE combination. So making really nice progress here. So key to that continued growth is the subcu dosage. And so we have responded to the agency. This was not anything where the agency required any further clinical studies or clinical data this was a manufacturing-related question or 2. So we've responded, and we're looking forward to the second half and hopefully getting approval on that.",529.0,244.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.03278688524590164,0.00819672131147541,0.02459016393442623,0.0,0.004098360655737705,0.02459016393442623

We've had really great momentum in the oncology pipeline. In the last months, last 1.5 years, I think we've had 8 what we would call proof-of-concept readouts that gave us the confidence to now move into late-stage pivotal studies across the portfolio. since you asked about RYBREVANT, I would also remind you that we're in advanced studies now for colorectal cancer, which will be a huge opportunity for patients and for our portfolio. We're now moving into head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with really exciting data there in our early development program. On the bladder cancer side, of course, TAR-200 is the star of the portfolio now, but right on its heels is to TAR-210 with a targeted therapy where we've seen complete responses north of 90%. So that is an entire platform for us, and we'll be putting other payloads in those devices in the future. And then in myeloma, we've got a trispecific now coming Romantimig. We're never satisfied with the status quo, building on tech and [indiscernible] in that if the recommended Phase II dose, for patients who had never seen a BCMA or GPRC5D 100% overall response rate. So we really see a great opportunity there to continue to elevate the standard care of myeloma. And then finally, in prostate cancer.

In terms of margin accretion, I'll reserve and keep the powder dry until we get a little bit further into this year. We still have some of the effects of Part D reline that is impacting margins this year. We'll have to see how tariffs play out.

In fact, we've met all of the milestones that we've communicated to the market, both in terms of submission late last year, approval late last year. starting the clinical trials and patients in the first quarter of this year and our expectation that we will file for de novo submission in the first quarter of next year. And so feel very confident about the progress that we're making on OTTAVA. I think you know clearly why we feel that we have strong differentiation in that program, both on the robot as well as our digital environment, and we'll continue to provide updates as that comes to fruition. I would like to touch a little on EP, and I appreciate you asking that question because when we look at our performance in the second quarter. Clearly, that was a major contributor. And it wasn't just the EP. It was the 22% that we enjoyed across the cardiovascular portfolio, which is a combination of the performance the way, double-digit growth in both Abiomed and Shockwave ahead of our deal model expectations. -- and improved performance in electrophysiology. And I have to say Shagun given that we created the EP category for us, this one is very personal. And while I know that several analysts were quick to write earlier this year. We continue to remain very confident in our ability to retain our global market leadership position over the long term. And that growth you saw in the second quarter 10% that's of a $5 billion base, and that represented a sequential growth of over 9% versus Q1 and acceleration within the quarter. And to your question, what drove this? It really was the continued adoption of [indiscernible] as we expanded in all commercial regions. We also started first cases in new markets like China, which is a major market for us and Australia. And the feedback from physicians has been phenomenal. We've now surpassed 10,000 cases globally with a reported neurovascular event rate of below 0.5. This is well below what we observed in the ADMIRE IDE trial and consistent with published rates across other competitive PFA platforms. We're also further optimizing the catheter based on real-world evidence and partnership with clinicians. In fact, we recently received FDA approval for an IFU update to incorporate and optimized flow rate, which further advances the product's performance. We are also evaluating new ways for [indiscernible] to maximize ablation efficiencies and potentially widen its therapeutic window. I will say I'll say it very bluntly, we are confident that we have a highly competitive catheter in [indiscernible] It provides excellent safety and provision and precision. It's efficient with only 4 ablations per vein and a smooth learning curve even for first-time users it's also important to mention that [ Varipulse ] accommodates competitive advantages like the only approved 0 fluoro solution and deep sedation or workflows, which we know are a major benefit to hospitals and patients. And as we look beyond variables, we are bringing to market a comprehensive portfolio of next-generation PFA catheters to address a broad range of workflows and patient needs. I think you know already that we received approval for our dual energy STSF catheter, the first catheter offer both PFA and RF technology. And we're also working on an Omnipulse large tip focal catheter and announced positive trials in the month of April. I do think it's also worth reinforcing that our strength, as we said from the very beginning, is not just down to ablation catheters, but rather the breadth of our portfolio and the end-to-end solutions we provide to our electrophysiology customers. It's our entrenched footprint and installed base of 5,000 Cardo Cardio systems, which is widely recognized that the benchmark in mapping software broad network of highly trained mappers which we continue to expand. And just to pilot this point, the strategic differentiation of Cardo and our mappers has in light of the competition we face here in the U.S. enabled us to retain our leadership in mapping U.S. PFA cases. And finally, it's our market-leading navigation and ultrasound catheters further strengthened with the recent launch of the Sound Star Crystal ultrasound earlier this year. EP is currently, I think it's fair to say probably the most exciting category in med tech. And let me be clear, we are not rolling over. We are, in fact, increasingly confident that our 30 years of experience our full portfolio of offerings positions us well to continue to retain our global leadership position over the long term.",789.0,378.0,24.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.06349206349206349,0.005291005291005291,0.005291005291005291,0.0026455026455026454,0.0026455026455026454,0.0582010582010582

So first of all, we think that there is an extraordinary opportunity here. There's 600,000 new patients that are diagnosed each year and another 400,000 that are recurrent we really see the opportunity as quite large. We'll be entering in the first indication in patients that are experienced or have failed BCG. But shortly then after, we'll be expanding into that broad non-muscle invasive space. And so we do think that there's a lot of patients that are eligible for treatment. I think this product really represents the of what J&J can bring forward. And we have capitalized not only on the strength of innovative medicine in developing this, but also the strength of medtech with everything from the engineers to development to the J&J Institute, the training that they have run really, really best-in-class, best in industry so that we can bring forward a product that will very, very quickly be able to work urologists with their practices and to help get this product out to patients.

Just a question on med tech. I mean you guys are already growing closer or in line with the broader market. You do have some underperformers still in med tech and surgery and orthopedics, but you've highlighted a few avenues from a new product launch perspective and improving execution to getting those back in line with market growth, you're weathering EP headwinds. So if we look ahead to 2026, '27 is it fair to think of the med tech business as a closer to high single-digit growth business? I mean, how do we think about the impact of these new product launches and some of the underperformers, the potential for them to reaccelerate? And what that means, given that you're already back to sort of 5-plus percent growth in med tech, even with them continuing to underperform?

There's firstly a couple of drivers that we're very confident we'll continue to perform extremely well and accelerate as we look to few years. Certainly, our performance in cardiovascular, as I mentioned, the 22% growth in the second quarter. We believe that's going to be a constant growth driver. Surgery, while you pointed out, has been, I'd say, underperforming relative to some of our new entrants in that space. We are very confident that we're going to build on our leadership position, both in open and lap surgery with the launch of OTTAVA, which you know is on the horizon. I'd say the 2 biggest growth drivers for med tech going forward will be cardiovascular and our surgery business, especially as we enter the robotic space. We believe that our vision business will continue to be a mid-single-digit to high digit single-digit performer. And then we continue, as I mentioned earlier, to look at how we continue to improve our performance in our orthopedics and getting that in-market performance. You know that in late we mentioned as part of the EBR, we would grow in that roughly 5% to 7% range at the upper range through '22 to '27 on an operational basis, and we're very confident in our ability to deliver that.

But the 48.04 studies, these are Phase IIbs, one in Crohn's disease and other colitis will be reading out sometime middle of this year. So it's nearing the time when the data made available and then based on that, we'll make decisions about next steps. As you know, in the earlier Phase IIa study, we saw really compelling data there that it looked like this combination of an IL-23 inhibitor together with a TNF inhibitor 2 products that have been in our pipeline but coming together could break through the traditional efficacy ceilings in patients with difficult-to-treat inflammatory vial disease and give perhaps more than half of those patients the chance had sustainable complete remission. So we're excited about this co-antibody therapeutic. It will be the first of many such approaches to trying to address these difficult-to-treat patients down the line. And so we're excited to be in a leadership role there, the first company to really begin this kind of foray of looking at going beyond monotherapies to dual therapies to address this really complex patients. I would say while I'm on that, though, I'm super excited about our [indiscernible] the oral targeted peptide inhibitor of the IL-23 receptor, which did achieve a compelling proof of concept and also colitis. We'll be showing those data later this year at a medical meeting. We have begun gearing up now to do a broad Phase III campaign in both UC and Crohn's disease based on those companion data.

We are looking forward to sharing our very strong third quarter results with you. They are a clear sign Johnson & Johnson is in a powerful new era of growth. The success of our portfolio and pipeline is proof that our relentless focus on innovation is doing more than fueling progress. It is accelerating it. In the third quarter, we delivered operational sales growth of 5.4% across our business. In Innovative Medicine, we reported 5.3% operational sales growth and a second consecutive quarter of sales of more than $15 billion. Some were not convinced we could grow through the loss of exclusivity of STELARA, but we were confident we have now unequivocally answered that question. How did we accomplish that when other companies have failed? In Q3, we did it by delivering double-digit growth across 11 brands, including DARZALEX, CARVICTI, TALVE, TEKVYLI, ERLIDA, DRIBREVAN, PLASLASKLUS, Caplitas, Spravato, Symphony, Remicade, and remarkable growth of 40% in TREMFYA. In MedTech, operational sales growth was even stronger, accelerating to 5.6% with improvements across all businesses. And as you have seen from this morning's news, we have announced the planned separation of our Orthopaedics business. This decision further sharpens our focus as a healthcare innovation leader and accelerates the shift of our MedTech portfolio to areas of greatest unmet need and higher growth, which includes cardiovascular and robotic surgery. I will touch more on this later. But one thing is clear, Johnson & Johnson's momentum is strong, and our achievements are multiplying. I will now focus on the progress we are making across our six priority areas: oncology, immunology, neuroscience, cardiovascular, surgery, and vision. These are areas where we have deep expertise and clear leadership positions. First, Oncology, where Q3 operational sales grew nearly 20%. You have heard me say before that we are much more than a one-shot company, and our expertise in blood cancers and solid tumors in our oncology portfolio is a great example. Take multiple myeloma, where our competitiveness is unrivaled. No other company has the expertise or success in multiple myeloma that we do. We have treatments in every line of therapy, and DARZALEX is the gold standard with more than 50% market share across all lines of therapy. Q3 operational sales of DARZALEX grew by 20%, and its potential continues to build with the approval this quarter in Europe as a treatment for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma, as well as promising new studies of DARZALEX fast in combination with TEGBYLI. I also want to say a word about Carvicti, our CAR T treatment for multiple myeloma. We have now treated more than 8,500 patients globally, making CARVICTI the most successful CAR T launch ever. With operational sales growing by more than 80% this quarter, we are increasingly confident in Carvicti's $5 billion peak year sales potential. Turning to solid tumors, we were thrilled to receive FDA approval for our bladder cancer treatment, Inlexo, last month. Inlexo highlights what is unique about Johnson & Johnson. Building on our unmatched capabilities in both Innovative Medicine and MedTech, it is the first and only drug-releasing system to provide sustained local delivery of a cancer treatment directly into the bladder. It is transformative for patients, and it is transformative for doctors. It will also contribute significantly to future growth, with a targeted release platform projected to be another blockbuster treatment with at least $5 billion in annual peak year sales. Sourced through an early-stage deal, Inlexo is also an example of our outstanding business development model. In fact, in the last eighteen months alone, we have completed more than 60 deals of this kind. And in lung cancer, we recently published results in the New England Journal of Medicine for Ryberman plus Las Cruze, showing a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death compared to osimertinib. We are now seeing the potential for patients to live significantly longer than anyone thought possible. The combination of DriverBand plus Las Cruze is another of our $5 billion big year sales assets. Next, I want to talk about immunology, where we have been leaders for twenty-five years. From REMICADE to SIMPONI and STELARA to TREMFYA, some of our biggest blockbusters have come from our immunology portfolio. We have long talked about Tremfya as the next big innovation to follow the success of Stelara. Based on this quarter's performance, it looks like it could be both bigger and better, having delivered operational sales growth of 40% driven by new indications in inflammatory bowel disease. TREMFYA is the only IL-23 inhibitor to offer a fully subcutaneous regimen across ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Even prior to the launch of our subcutaneous formulation, Tremfya was capturing approximately half of all new patient starts for IL-23 ulcerative colitis treatments in The U.S., which we achieved within one year from launch. We are confident Tremfya will become a more than $10 billion asset. And in typical J&J fashion, we are deep in the development of our next immunology innovation, ICOTROKINDA, initially for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Historically, the most effective immunology treatments have been injectables. As the first oral peptide to selectively block the IL-23 receptor, icotrokimbra has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of plaque psoriasis with a once-a-day pill. We submitted the icotokinra for plaque psoriasis to the FDA in July. And you know, this is just the beginning, as we have already presented data from our Phase two trials in ulcerative colitis. Let's now turn to neuroscience, with the Spravato operational sales growing an impressive 61% in Q3. SPRAVATO remains the only approved standalone therapy for treatments in depression, a major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation. Through Q3, we have now treated more than 180,000 patients, and I could not be prouder of the impact this team is having. Our leadership in neuropsychiatry was also strengthened by this year's acquisition of intracellular therapies, with FDA approval for CAPLYTA in major depressive disorder anticipated soon. CAPLYTA is already FDA approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, as well as depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder one and two. We project CAPLYTA to reach $5 billion annually. Now let's turn to MEDTEC, starting with our cardiovascular portfolio. In Q3, cardiovascular operational sales increased by approximately 12%. As we fortify our leadership in the fastest-growing cardiovascular interventions segment. With operational sales growth of over 20%, Shockwave's unique intravascular lithotripsy technology is helping treat more atherosclerotic cardiovascular patients than ever before. In fact, last quarter, Shockwave supported their one millionth patient. And with the recent European approval of the Javelin peripheral Lithotripsy Catheter, we expect strong momentum moving forward. We anticipate Shockwave becoming our thirteenth billion-dollar MedTech platform by year-end. In electrophysiology, we are industry leaders, and with the strength of our MAPI technology, that continues. In Q3, we again delivered close to 10% operational sales growth, and our position will further strengthen with real-world data showing variables achieved 99.7% acute effectiveness in nearly 800 patients with strong safety and no incidents of stroke. Our Abiomed business also continues to perform strongly, with more than 15% operational sales growth in the quarter. Our success reflects the impact that our Impella CP hard pump is having on the lives of patients, which you could see in the long-term survival data that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine this quarter. In the ten-year DANGER SOX study, routine use of Impella CP in patients who have had a heart attack with cardiogenic shock reduced mortality by 16.3% compared to the standard of care, with patients gaining an average of 600 additional days alive. It is a perfect example of what we mean when we say Johnson & Johnson is delivering groundbreaking innovation. In surgery, we are making progress on multiple fronts. Our surgical technologies are used in most operating rooms globally. And in Q3, delivered more than 9% growth in biosurgery and almost 7% in wound closure, driven by accelerating adoption of our latest innovations. We also continue to make positive progress with Ottava as we anticipate FDA de novo submission in early 2026. And now to vision, where we grew more than 6% last quarter. Our Technis intraocular lenses are the fastest growing in the market where we have launched, fueling our 13.8% operational sales growth in Surgical Vision. And after launching the world's first multifocal contact lens for people with astigmatism in The U.S. last quarter, we brought this latest member of the AccuView Oasis MAX one-day family to Europe and Korea in Q3, further strengthening our momentum. And finally, to this morning's orthopedics news. As you know, the healthcare industry continues to evolve rapidly, and we are constantly evaluating our overall business and portfolio to ensure Johnson & Johnson remains best positioned to truly lead where healthcare is going. We continue to invest at industry-leading levels in our pipeline and portfolio while making disciplined decisions to exit businesses that we believe will be better able to thrive outside of Johnson & Johnson. For our orthopedic business, the planned separation creates new opportunities. Operating as the Pew Synthes are led by Namal Nagwana, it would be the largest, most comprehensive orthopedics company with leading market share positions across major categories and addressing a more than CHF 50 billion and growing market opportunity. We expect Depew Synthes to benefit from a more focused business model with greater flexibility to extend its market leadership, invest in its commercial capabilities, and capitalize on profitable growth opportunities. Following the completion of the planned separation, Johnson & Johnson will retain a leadership position in our six core growth areas across Innovative Medicine and MedTech: oncology, immunology, neuroscience, cardiovascular surgery, and vision. And be able to place even greater focus in our investment towards higher growth areas where we can meaningfully extend and improve lives. We are positioning each business to win and deliver for our stakeholders. As we move forward in the separation process, we will provide additional information as appropriate, and Joe will share more details shortly. As I said at the start of the call, we are in a new era of accelerated growth at Johnson & Johnson. This is more than just another strong quarter. It is proof that our momentum is building and that our impact is accelerating. Thank you very much. And I will now turn the call back over to Darren.",1718.0,865.0,62.0,7.0,17.0,1.0,0.0,13.0,8.0,0.0,0.07167630057803469,0.008092485549132947,0.019653179190751446,0.0011560693641618498,0.0,0.06358381502890173

Unless otherwise stated, the percentages quoted represent operational results, therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q3 2025 sales results. Worldwide sales were $24 billion for the quarter. Sales increased 5.4% despite an approximate 640 basis point headwind from STELARA. Growth in The U.S. was 6.24.4% outside of The U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact on worldwide growth of 100 basis points, primarily driven by the Intracelia acquisition. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.2 billion, with diluted earnings per share of $2.12 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.11 a year ago. Adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion, with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.8, both representing an increase of 15.7% compared to 2024. As a reminder, results in 2024 were impacted by the acquired IPR and D expense of $1.25 billion associated with the NM-26 bispecific antibody. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter, focusing on the six key areas where meaningful innovation is driving our performance and fueling long-term growth. Beginning with Innovative Medicine, where our results demonstrate the depth of our expertise across oncology, immunology, and neuroscience. Worldwide sales of $15 billion increased 5.3% despite an approximate 1070 basis point headwind from STELARA, illustrating the continued strength of our key brands and new launches. Growth in The U.S. was 64.3% outside of The U.S. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 160 basis points on worldwide growth due to the Intracellular acquisition. In oncology, starting with multiple myeloma, DARZALEX growth was 19.9%, primarily driven by continued strong share gains of approximately 5.7 points across all lines of therapy, with nearly nine points in the frontline setting as well as market growth. Carvictee achieved sales of $524 million with growth of 81.4%, driven by share gains and site expansion. This reflects continued strong sequential growth of 18.5% as our expansion outside The U.S. progresses. Tekvele and Talve growth was 29.959.1% respectively, bolstered by continued expansion into the community setting. In prostate cancer, a leader delivered strong growth of 15.3% due to market growth and continued share gains, partially offset by the Part D redesign. In lung cancer, Ribrovan plus Lasclus delivered sales of $198 million and growth over 100%, driven by continued strong launch uptake. We continue to see share gains in both first and second lines of therapy. Within immunology, Tremfya delivered very strong growth of 40.1%. We continue to see share gains across all indications, with particularly robust momentum from our IBD launch. STELARA declined by 42% driven by the impact of biosimilar competition and Part D redesign, which is in line with our expectations. In neuroscience, SPRAVATO grew an impressive 60.8% driven by continued strong demand from physicians and patients. CAPLYTA, which was acquired in Q2 as part of the Intracellular acquisition, delivered sales of $204 million and reflects healthy sequential growth of 13.4%. Now moving to MedTech. Worldwide sales of $8.4 billion increased 5.6% with growth of 6.6% in The U.S. and 4.5% outside The U.S., driven by strong performance in our three focus areas: cardiovascular, surgery, and vision. Acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 10 basis points on worldwide growth. In cardiovascular, electrophysiology delivered growth of 9.7% versus prior year, driven by procedure growth, commercial execution, VariPulse, and other new products, and strength in competitive mapping. Abiomed delivered growth of 15.6% with continued strong adoption of Impella technology, and Shockwave increased 20.9% driven by double-digit growth globally in both coronary and peripheral. Surgery grew 3.3% despite divestitures negatively impacting results by approximately 50 basis points. Performance was primarily driven by technology penetration in wound closure, the strength of the portfolio, and commercial execution in biosurgery, as well as a one-time reserve adjustment in the quarter. Growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in Energy and the negative impact of China VBP across the portfolio. In Vision, contact lenses and other products grew 3.5%, driven by market growth, strong performance in the AccuView OASIS one-day family of contact lenses. This includes the recent launches of Oasis MAX one-day multifocal for astigmatism and MAX one-day for astigmatism, as well as continued strategic price actions. Surgical Vision had another strong quarter with growth of 13.8%, driven by new product innovations such as TACNES PureC, ODYSSEY, and iHance, robust demand, and strong commercial execution. These results further solidify our leadership positions in Vision. As Joaquin noted, we have today our intent to separate the Orthopedic business. Orthopedic growth this quarter is gaining momentum and increased to 2.4%. Importantly, hips and knees returned to growth this quarter, delivering 5.15.6% growth respectively. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for 2025. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter a year ago. Cost of products sold leveraged by 60 basis points driven by a reduction in amortization expense and favorable currency in the Innovative Medicine business, as well as the non-recurring fair value inventory step-up related to Shockwave in 2024. This was partially offset by unfavorable product mix in Innovative Medicine, along with 40 basis points driven by increased investment in the recent intracellular acquisition for CAPLYTA and promotional spend across the Innovative Medicine business, partially offset by expense leveraging in MedTech. Research and development expenses leveraged by 670 basis points, primarily driven by the expense of $1.25 billion to secure the global rights to the NM-26 bispecific antibody recorded in 2024. We continued our strong investment in research and development with $3.7 billion or approximately 15% of sales in Q3. Interest income and expense was a net expense of $18 million as compared to $99 million of income in 2024, primarily driven by a higher average debt balance and a lower average cash balance. Other income and expense was net income of $500 million compared to an expense of $1.8 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by a talc litigation charge in 2024 and higher gains on the sales of securities in 2025, partially offset by the monetization of royalty rights recorded in 2024. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 31.2% compared to 19.3% in the same period last year. The increase is primarily driven by the one-time $1 billion remeasurement of deferred tax balances, which are required to reflect the changes in statutory tax rates associated with the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in the third quarter. More information can be found in the company's Form 10-Q. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided the company's income before tax, net earnings, and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment for the quarter. Innovative Medicine margin improved from 37.9% to 44.3%, primarily driven by the one-time expense of $1.25 billion to secure the global rights of DNM-26 bispecific antibody recorded in 2024, partially offset by increased investment in commercial spend in 2025 and the non-recurring monetization of royalty rights in 2024. MedTech margin declined from 24.1% to 21% driven by macroeconomic factors and cost of products sold, partially offset by expense leveraging in SM and A. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the call.",1181.0,686.0,42.0,12.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,0.061224489795918366,0.01749271137026239,0.01020408163265306,0.0029154518950437317,0.0014577259475218659,0.043731778425655975
JNJ,2025-10-14,2025-10-14,,2025-10-14,2025-10-14T08:30:00-04:00,0,2025-10-14,qa,qna_heading,Joe Wolk,"Thanks, Darren. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The third quarter, we sustained momentum across our end market portfolio, delivering upon the heightened financial expectations we guided to last quarter. In Innovative Medicine, we continue to grow to the STELARA loss of exclusivity as we said we would. The progression of our pipeline, evidenced by significant regulatory milestones, adds further depth to our three focus areas of oncology, immunology, and neuroscience. We are well-positioned for the balance of the decade. In MedTech, we improved adjusted operational sales across key areas of the business. As Joaquin mentioned, we are sharpening our focus on high-growth, high-margin markets where we can improve patient outcomes, as this morning's announcement regarding the Depew Cynthesis business indicates. In a moment, I will build upon Joaquin's comments regarding that announcement. The foundation we have set, combined with the progression of our pipeline, strongly positions the company for accelerated growth. It also reinforces our conviction to deliver on the upper end of our long-term growth targets. Let me provide a brief update on the Daubert Motion's pending in the talc litigation. As you are aware, this is the judicial process by which the court will re-examine the junk science that the mass tort plaintiffs, Bart and Cox, to fuel baseless claims against Johnson & Johnson as well as many American businesses. We look forward to and expect to secure favorable rulings on the Dalbert motions, which should be rendered by 2026. Now turning to cash and capital allocation. We generated $14 billion in free cash flow through the first nine months of the year. We ended the third quarter with approximately $19 billion in cash and marketable securities, $46 billion of debt. We have a net debt position of $27 billion versus the $32 billion of net debt reported in the second quarter. We continue to utilize our free cash flow generation and strong balance sheet to invest in innovation and return capital directly to shareholders. We are often asked about our appetite for acquisitions to meet financial targets. I can be very clear on this. We rely on our thoughtful long-term approach to growing through any loss of exclusivity and won't carelessly deploy capital on speculative transactions out of desperation. Our current portfolio and pipeline have momentum, and with the Stellara loss of exclusivity increasingly in the rearview mirror, we do not need to rely on large transactions to drive our growth. We intend to remain disciplined, opportunistically pursuing strategic high-value opportunities that utilize our expertise and capabilities that deliver appropriate return for the risk that we bear on behalf of shareholders. Regarding the planned separation of our Orthopedics business, as Joaquin noted, the separation is expected to enhance the strategic and operational focus of each company, drive value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. Given that we are early in the process, there are limited details available. But we are committed to providing you with information on a timely basis. While we will, of course, communicate material developments, we don't expect to have anything newsworthy to convey until mid-next year. But what can we say at this moment? First, the separation will further strengthen our overall MedTech business and increase Johnson & Johnson's top-line growth and margins. To give that some directional context, if we just look at normalized year-to-date 2025 results, MedTech's top-line revenue growth and operating margin would both improve by at least 75 basis points. Next, we are targeting completion of the separation within eighteen to twenty-four months, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Given it is the most resource-intensive and likely longest duration, we are prioritizing and have begun the separation assuming a spin-off, with the intention for that to qualify as a tax-free separation for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. However, we will consider other avenues that optimize shareholder value. We do not expect any change to the Johnson & Johnson dividend and are mindful of any impact from stranded costs that are typically present in these types of transactions. Finally, following the separation, we would expect the Pugh Cynthies to have a strong capital structure that would allow the Orthopedics business to build on its long history of innovation, extend leadership positions through enhanced organic investment and strategic growth accretive M&A. As we pursue this separation, the orthopedics unit will operate in alignment with the business' current strategy, continuing to make investments in growth, margin improvement, and innovation. Turning now to full-year guidance for 2025. We are increasing operational sales guidance for the full year by approximately $300 million, resulting in operational sales growth for the full year in the range of 4.8% to 5.3%, with a midpoint of $93.2 billion or 5.1%. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, our adjusted operational sales growth is now expected to be in the range of 3.5% to 4% compared to 2024. As a reminder, we started the year guiding to a midpoint for 2.5% for adjusted operational sales. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements, and last quarter we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. Dollar of 1.17. The U.S. Dollar has stayed relatively flat to the euro spot rate, and as a result, we now expect reported sales growth between 5.4% to 5.9% with a midpoint of $93.7 billion or 5.7%. Turning to other notable items on the P&L. We are reiterating our operating margin guide of a 300 basis point improvement for the full year, assuming what we know today as it relates to tariffs. For net interest expense, we are now projecting between 0 and $50 million, an improvement from the previous guidance primarily driven by higher cash balances. We are expecting a higher effective tax rate to be in the range of 17.5% to 18% for the full year, with the increase largely due to the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill. We feel strongly that U.S. tax policy has enabled Johnson & Johnson to increase our manufacturing footprint in The U.S. We have more manufacturing facilities in The United States than in any other country, and we remain committed to $55 billion in U.S.-based innovation and manufacturing over the next four years. In March, we broke ground at our Wilson, North Carolina facility, and in August, we announced a $2 billion commitment to further increase our presence in North Carolina with a more than 160,000 square foot dedicated manufacturing facility at FUJIFILM's new biopharmaceutical manufacturing site in Holly Springs. Our overall U.S. investment plans also include three additional new advanced manufacturing facilities, as well as the expansion of several existing sites. Turning to earnings per share. You may recall we started the year guiding to adjusted EPS of $10.6. Today, we stand much higher, even after including dilution of $0.25 from the Intercellular acquisition. Today, we are reaffirming our elevated July earnings per share outlook, which also absorbs a higher annual effective tax rate and fourth-quarter investments that will further position the business for long-term success. As such, our expected adjusted earnings per share guidance remains $10.85 or 8.7% at the midpoint, with a range of $10.8 to $10.9. Our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance is $10.68 or 7% at the midpoint. Looking beyond our financial commitments for the year, we are on track to add to the already impressive number of milestones that we achieved across our pipeline in 2025. In Innovative Medicine, we anticipate U.S. FDA approval for subcutaneous Ribrovant for non-small cell lung cancer, as well as for CAPLYTA in adjunctive major depressive disorder. We recently filed for a label expansion on TREMFYA in psoriatic arthritis and plan to present data for Ribrovant in head and neck cancer at ESMO in the coming week. In MedTech, we continue to make progress with our clinical trial for our Ottava robotic surgical system. In our cardiovascular portfolio, we are planning regulatory submissions for the dual energy Thermo Cool SmartTouch SF catheter for cardiac arrhythmia in The U.S. And Envision we will continue to roll out AccuVue Oasis MAX for astigmatism. As we are close to year-end and with the strong caveat that we are still finalizing plans for next year and macro factors can change quickly, let me provide some preliminary thoughts to inform your modeling for 2026. For Innovative Medicine, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver accelerated growth despite STELARA loss of exclusivity. This will be driven by our in-market brands and continued progress from our recently launched products, including Tremfya in inflammatory bowel disease, Ribrovant plus Lascluse in non-small cell lung cancer, and Alexo in bladder cancer. We currently anticipate a 2026 approval for icotrokinura in psoriasis. In MedTech, we continue to expect accelerated growth off this year's levels, driven by focus on higher growth markets, as well as the continued adoption of newer products across all MedTech platforms. We also anticipate the launch of Shockwave C2 Aero Coronary IVL Catheter, the Technis Pure C intraocular lens in The U.S., as well as regulatory submission for the Ottava robotic surgical system. Again, while early, I like the way 2026 is shaping up. In fact, based on my last look at your 2026 models, it appears current revenue consensus of 4.6% growth in your models for 2026 is lower than we project, which we believe in total will exceed 5%. Similarly, with the expectation that adjusted earnings per share is commensurate with sales growth, there appears to be some upside to the current adjusted earnings per share consensus of $11.39, perhaps as much as $0.05. This commentary considers investments we will be making behind many of the new product launches I just highlighted, but you can also expect some margin improvement. It also reflects our understanding of the present legislative landscape, tariffs, foreign exchange rates, and procedural volumes. We look forward to sharing further details regarding our official guide for 2026 during our Q4 earnings call in January. In summary, the strength of our business model, with a focus on where we can have the greatest impact for patients, will enable Johnson & Johnson to deliver against our strategic objectives and financial commitments. We are as confident as we have been in recent memory about the future. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues around the world for their continued hard work and steadfast dedication that serve our patients and who make these financial results possible and sustainable. With that, we are happy to take your questions.

On the orthopedic spin-out, I'd be interested to understand the why now and also if we expect similar separations for other divisions in the future? And as a quick follow-up, how should we think about the long-term guidance in light of the separation? Should we expect J&J to revisit these forecasts in the near term?",68.0,28.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It's been a hallmark of Johnson & Johnson to be a good steward of our capital and to make decisions in our portfolio to prioritize where we think breakthrough innovation can come through. And that's exactly what we are doing. We're moving Johnson & Johnson into high-growth markets with significant medical need. And at the same time, we have the foresight to recognize when a standalone company could be better and could be in a better position to drive growth, innovation, and better margins. That's exactly what we are doing with our orthopedic separation. We are fueling the innovation within Johnson & Johnson, focusing on our six priority areas, continuing to invest as we are doing in cardiovascular with the acquisitions of Abiomed, Shockwave, and also in Pharmaceuticals with the acquisition of Intracellular, and creating a standalone company that is going to be a champion within the context of the orthopedics sector. Orthopedics is a growing market, a $50 billion market. It's fueled by the aging of the population. We have commanding market shares in the most important segments of the Orthopedics business. The company is going to be called DePuy Synthes. It's going to be led by Namal Nawana, who is an industry veteran. And I have no doubt that they are going to be better positioned to succeed, to drive innovation, to drive growth, and to become what they are: the largest orthopedics company in the world. Overall, this is a clear move to be able to manage our portfolio to position Johnson & Johnson to be able to deliver breakthrough innovation and the results that you are seeing so far with a very, very strong quarter. I want to underline, this is not only a very strong quarter, it's also an indication, a signal that Johnson & Johnson is in an accelerated cycle of growth, which we expect is going to last the balance of the decade. Moving in the right direction, I'm sure investors are going to be happy to see that Johnson & Johnson is an active portfolio manager.",362.0,149.0,18.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.12080536912751678,0.013422818791946308,0.020134228187919462,0.0,0.0,0.10738255033557047

So there were two other parts that I thought I heard from you. This is not a precursor to anything else. We look at what we have now in the clarity of our portfolio, three strongholds in Innovative Medicine serving unmet needs with transformational innovation that elevates the standard of care in oncology, neuroscience, and immunology. And likewise, now in MedTech, where we have market-leading positions, cutting-edge technology that is improving care for patients in surgery, eye health, and cardiovascular. So we're going to be real pleased with the portfolio. We think orthopedics is set up for success going forward based on their profile and their ability to compete against other singularly focused orthopedics companies. With respect to guidance revisions, so as we mentioned in the scripted comments, this will take eighteen to twenty-four months. So anything we say about 2026 will likely include the Orthopedics business in our outlooks.

Just a question on, Joe, your commentary around potential margins post the ortho spin. 75 bps, I don't want to get too greedy, but that feels a little light to me. So just curious about why, given the mix of the business, it's high growth cardio, surgical, which I think should be relatively high margin and vision.

And I think it really depends on the time period by which you're measuring. If we were just to take 2025, you're absolutely right. It would be probably closer to 100 bps both on top and bottom or margin improvement. What I would say is we looked out a couple of years given this will take a couple of years to go through the process. And as Abiomed, Shockwave, and the other businesses have higher growth profiles, margin improvements initiatives that are already underway under Tim's leadership, it will have a more muted impact as it goes forward. So I think on today's math, you're probably closer to being right. It's okay. I don't consider it greedy. Tim might, but I don't.

And Danielle, maybe just building on Joe's comments, as I'm sure there'll be a lot of questions on this topic, and we'd like to try and get them out of the way so we can focus on the broader business. I wanted to highlight why this makes sense for Johnson & Johnson MedTech. And as you heard from Joaquin and Joe, this is all about our commitment to continuous portfolio optimization and value creation. And as you know, we've been on a journey over the last couple of several years to really aggressively move our portfolio into higher growth markets and adding attractive assets such as Abiomed and Shockwave in our growth markets like cardiovascular are good examples of the bold moves we already made. This decision to separate ortho is the next major step in that direction. Ortho is a great business, but frankly, one that participates, as you know, in lower growth markets. This is all about shrinking to grow faster for MedTech. And last time I looked, you're not rewarding size, but really rather best-in-class performance, and that's the path that we're on. As you already have heard, we expect the separation would increase our top-line growth and margins following the completion.

You'll be exiting this year in a clear position of strength. Where a number of headwinds from the Stellara LOE are fading into the background, the base businesses are strong, and you've got new product cycle momentum accelerating through the Innovative Medicines portfolio, and you're also seeing a second-half improvement in MedTech. So in that context, and with the announcement of this morning to spin off Dupuy, can you just maybe double-click a little bit more on how you're going to be balancing capital allocation priorities? To sustain acceleration in innovative meds and push MedTech sustainably towards the 5% to 7% ERB targets. And then related in the Innovative Medicines business, the sales growth acceleration in 2026, like you said, Joe, that's not getting modeled by consensus.

It means we have a number of important opportunities to invest within our pipeline and portfolio. So that is our number one priority now as far as capital allocation. We're in the middle of the launch, and Tim and Jennifer will discuss that, of major blockbuster products. On the Innovative Medicines side, we are launching Tremfya in inflammatory bowel disease, Ribrevan and Lascluse in lung cancer, Inlexo in localized bladder cancer. We continue with the growth of Carbiti and Espravato. And we just filed for Aikotrokindra in Plexor IAC. So we have a wealth of opportunities to drive significant growth in our Pharmaceutical business that Jennifer will describe. Just to give you an idea of the strength of our Pharmaceutical business, excluding Stelara, the pharmaceutical business in the third quarter grew a whopping 16%. So that's a very big business, more than $50 billion business growing at 16%. So we have multiple opportunities to drive capital allocation in the Pharmaceutical business as well as in our pipeline there. I mean, we're working on biospecific prostate cancer, try specific for multiple myeloma, a wealth of opportunities to drive capital allocation. On the MedTech side, I mean, we're in the middle of major things in the MedTech side. On one hand, we are committed to remaining leaders in the electrophysiology segment with the launch of VariPulse, our dual energy catheter. We continue to work on improvements in the Cartos system, and we are determined to invest there to remain the leaders as we have been. We are working to expand our heart pumps. You guys all know about the New England Journal of Medicine publication showing the DANGER study in patients with acute myocardial infarction that had cardiogenic shock that show a 600 days improvement over a ten-year period, impressive breakthrough innovation there. We have a lot of opportunities in Shockwave with the Javelin peripheral catheter and the AERIO system in coronary that we are launching. And if I move into the second priority, which is our robotic surgery expansion, we are about to file with the FDA in the first half of the year our Ottava soft tissue robotic system. We are also determined to be a major player in robotics. I'm always telling you, we are determined to be a major player in robotics. So we continue to have opportunities for capital allocation in both businesses. And our priority now is to be able to fuel the growth in our portfolio and our pipeline. We, as Joe mentioned before, we are in a position just to be clear that we do not need large M&A to deliver in the high end of our growth targets. Let me repeat that. We do not need large M&A to deliver in the high end of our growth targets.

I think Asad, the only thing I would add to that is just the number of smaller deals we do that don't make headlines on the day of the transaction, I think 60 over the last two years. And those lead to products like Inlexo, which we acquired in 2019 for a couple of $100 million and through really tax for their craft as well as passion for meeting patients' unmet needs. Doctors Chris Coote, Doctor. Charles Drake were able to find, and their teams were able to find a bladder cancer treatment that is revolutionary. Nothing has been new in the last few decades with respect to not only ease for the patient but also ease for the administrating physician. It's deals like that. We look at next year's product for icotrakinda, where we're expecting again a couple $100 million investment will turn out to be a $1 billion platform for us because that's where our competitive advantage lies is the scientific expertise that we're able to recognize early on bringing forth a label that is most expansive, most complete, and in record time.",187.0,87.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.04597701149425287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04597701149425287

So, I'd love to double down on the fact that it really was a great quarter in 3Q, and those numbers that for 90% of our business, we actually grew 16%. And that's really driven by 11 key brands that grew double digits, brands like DARZALEX, ERLITA, BRAVATO, CARVICTI, and so on, as well as the strength that we're seeing in our new launches. And most notable there is in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with 40% growth, that is four-zero. And so we've got a lot of strength in the business right now. Those growth drivers are growing double digits are not only now in just this year, these really are our growth drivers throughout the rest of the decade, as well as the pipeline assets that are coming in and the great growth that we're seeing, and most notably, Trampfya. If we take a look versus your models in the areas where we have even or were even more bullish, a few areas to note. So first, is TREMFYA. And we think that there's a lot of strength with TREMFYA already. We're seeing in ulcerative colitis about fifty percent share of the IL-23s. This was actually before we got the subcutaneous induction dose, which we just got approval for. We're seeing really, really strong uptake there. And I think things bode real well for Tremfya. As a reminder for STELARA, about seventy-five percent of Stellara sales were in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, so in IBD. We think that, that's entirely like or may even be stronger for Tremfya. So we think that there's a lot of growth opportunity there. We believe SPRAVATO there is a bit of a disconnect. We are more bullish there as well. And we continue to expand into new treatment centers, as we expand globally. That product is offering so much value for patients with treatment-resistant depression. Throw in Riborvant Lasclus for non-small cell lung cancer. We're anxiously anticipating our launch of the subcutaneous dosage form. We think that there is a lot of runway there as a $5 billion plus asset. We're also anticipating new data coming out in head and neck cancer and also colorectal cancer. So great growth. Joaquin mentioned Inlexo, formerly known as TerrAs, and we just got approval and are in the process of launching for bladder cancer. This is one of our next $5 billion plus assets. And last but not least, I co which we have filed and are also in the midst of showing new data both in psoriasis as well as in ulcerative colitis. And so when we take a look at the business both as well as these future growth drivers, we've got a lot of bullishness there.

Joaquin mentioned our continued confidence and commitment to winning over the long term in electrophysiology. We had a standout quarter, and what really marked it was our continued improvement, especially here in The U.S., which will continue to be the largest and most attractive market. We saw a doubling of our growth rate in this quarter. We continue to build momentum. Vision, which we haven't touched on also, which had a standout quarter, 6.1% growth, 14% growth in the IOL category with significant share gains against our major competitors there. And then surgery, our largest business around 3.3% growth, but really bolstered by strong performance in wound closure at 7% and biosurgery. And once again, that launch of OTAVA next year is going to really bolster our performance there.

It's a great job by the entire Johnson & Johnson team across the globe. I think towards the 5% to 7%, obviously, we made that commitment back in 2023. We've seen significant progress with our portfolio. We've added some acquisitions that fortify that number. We are striving for something better than that, don't misconstrue our ambitions here. What I would say for the year specifically, we are still going to face significant erosion with respect to Stelar. There will be additional discounting in the Innovative Medicine portfolio. And we will still have the orthopedics business, and we will continue to make progress with electrophysiology going back to market leadership with the PFA platform. So there are things that we will obviously look to improve upon those numbers.

So yes, we did just get approval for Inlexo, and the teams are out in full launch mode. And we have a lot of confidence that this is one of our $5 billion plus assets for Johnson & Johnson. The receptivity has been very strong. We like to say that this product was really designed by urologists for urologists. And really is addressing a high unmet need. There hasn't been much advances in the way of bladder cancer for a very, very long time. And so in the initial launch, it's in BCG unresponsive, risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. And we've been able to demonstrate the highest complete response rates without a need for re-induction, and over half of responders are still cancer-free at one year. And so really, really transformational results. The product was designed to seamlessly fit into your urology practice and be relatively speaking easy on the patient compared to other therapies and like I said, seamless work into practice. And so, so far, the response from clinicians has been very positive. For our Executive Committee, we actually had one of our top investigators come and spend time with us last week. And show us on models their demonstration and talk about why he is so excited about it, both as a clinician as well as for his patients. So we've already had a number of insertions. Based on the high level of unmet need, but as you know, we're also anticipating the J code for reimbursement come April. So we think that, that will be an important catalyst for uptake as is normal and common in route buy and bill type products. So we're excited about that.

We have a broad development program underway with several Phase III studies to address the non-muscle invasive bladder cancer population high risk, that's about half of all the non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients. And our studies include both the patients who are BCG experienced in the first approval that was for BCG non-responsive. We also have studies in BCG relapsed. And then we also have head-to-head frontline studies against BCG. So really covering a broad landscape there. And just to remember that there are about 600,000 patients every year who are newly diagnosed with bladder cancer. Seventy-five percent of those have the non-muscle invasive localized, and then another twenty percent have localized, but it is muscle invasive. There too, we're also doing studies, and in fact, at the ESMO conference, in a couple of days, we'll present data. Where in the neoadjuvant context, we've used Inlexo in combination with our PD-one antibody, sotrelimab. And we'll report the data there showing that we're able to render a much higher percentage of patients completely free of any evidence of disease that you can find histologically or by other methods, what's called pathological complete response. And therefore, voting for better outcomes for these patients who already have muscle invasive disease and are having surgery to remove their bladder as a result of that risk. So really see a broad opportunity for Inlexo, particularly in the non-muscle invasive across all lines of therapy. In that high-risk non-muscle invasive, which is about half of all of those patients, as well as in some subpopulations of patients with the muscle invasive as well. And then I would just give a shout-out that that's not going to be a one-trick pony for us. We have TAR-two ten coming rapidly on the heels. This is a next-generation device that releases instead of a chemotherapy, a targeted therapy or erdafitinib drug. That inhibits receptor tyrosine kinase. That is commonly mutated in bladder cancers. It's the most common genetic mutation that occurs in bladder cancers. In there, we've seen response rates, complete response rates north of ninety percent in our next-generation device for that. Releases the medicine at a steady rate not just for three weeks like Inlexo, but for three months.

What was really attractive about this quarter and built on the tremendous performance in the second quarter was the solid performances across all businesses. And so where you saw that sequential improvement, if you'll recall, our Ortho business struggled in the first and quarter. We saw a nice improvement in Q2. Q3, we returned that business to growth with tremendous performances in categories like hips with 5.1%, knees 5.6%, strong performance in trauma, and actually returning to growth in Spine. And so Ortho was a major competitor or major contributor to that performance. And then of course, we had continued tremendous performance in our fastest-growing category in cardiovascular, solid performances in surgery, and acceleration within Vision, as I mentioned earlier, driven by our performance primarily in the intraocular space.",141.0,72.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09722222222222222,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06944444444444445

And overall, as we discussed at the beginning of this call, our focus and priority within MedTech is around our three areas, which are vision, cardiovascular, in which we already have acquired a number of companies, and also robotic surgery, where we are focusing on being able to submit our Ottava soft tissue robotic system to the FDA in 2026. We'll continue to look for opportunities there in order to enhance our portfolio and be able to make our MedTech group the best MedTech Group in the industry, which is a clear goal for me and for Johnson & Johnson.",101.0,42.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.11904761904761904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11904761904761904

And we are really excited about the opportunity for iCotra Kinra and see this as one of our next big $5 billion plus brands. And so why are we excited about it? So we believe it's really going to set the new standard of care in the treatment of plaque psoriasis. And that will be the first indication. Unprecedented combination of complete skin clearance and a favorable safety profile with the simplicity of an oral pill. We're really, really confident in what we've seen. And so not only are we studying it versus other orals, we're actually studying it head-to-head versus Stellara. And no oral agent has been able to really compete with that combination of both biologic-like efficacy and that known safety profile. And so we're really bullish. If you take a look at the despite today's treatments, they're still less than thirty of eligible patients who have moderate to severe psoriasis who are receiving advanced treatments. And so we think there is a significant market expansion opportunity to be able to bring patients into advanced therapies into that frontline setting. So we think there's a big opportunity there. We think as we move closer to the launches with the way the profiles are differentiating, there will be a unique and distinct position for icotrokinra and also a distinct and unique position for TREMFYA that will allow us to have both really continued significant growth on both assets, particularly given the high level of unmet need in the market. So more to come on that. I'm not going to give away everything on the positioning, but we think that there are really distinct places that they're going to play. AECO is going to be a really significant asset for us. And you can see how well Tromphaya is doing with the 40% growth that we achieved this quarter.",324.0,153.0,12.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0784313725490196,0.006535947712418301,0.006535947712418301,0.0,0.0,0.0718954248366013
