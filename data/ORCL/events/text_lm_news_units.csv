Given the recent macroeconomic complexities, more stringent privacy rules, discontinuation of third party cookies, and the ever-growing list of digital channels which makes customer behavior less predictable, today’s revenue and go-to-market teams are increasingly challenged to substantiate their decisions and demonstrate value in a measurable manner. In deploying Pecan, these teams can now use their massive pools of first-party data and state-of-the-art AI-based statistical algorithms to predict future customer behavior, empowering them to make non-biased, data-driven decisions that positively impact their customer journey KPIs, as well as revenue and profitability. In February 2022, Pecan announced a $66 million Series C funding round led by global private equity and venture capital firm, Insight Partners with participation from GV, as well as all previous investors. “Every organization aspires to be data-driven, but not every business team has access to sufficient advanced machine learning capabilities they need to succeed,” said Zohar Bronfman, co-founder and CEO of Pecan. “Imagine knowing on day two after acquiring a customer whether they’ll become a high-value customer within the next 30 or 45 days, how much they’re likely to spend over the next 3 months, or if they’ll churn in just a couple of weeks. Armed with this data, our clients have transformed how they make their decisions regarding acquisition and retention programs, evolving their customer experience with the level of personalization, agility, and precision never thought possible before. It’s clear that we are tapping into a need that previously had not been addressed.” In addition to record growth, Pecan has added several prominent customers to its roster, including mobile gaming companies Genesis and Beach Bum, and a popular DTC wellness brand Hydrant who tripled its revenue per customer from promotions that relied on Pecan’s predictions. These new companies join Pecan's growing list of customers that includes Johnson & Johnson, CAA Club Group, and SciPlay. This month, Pecan has also hit a major milestone of a billion monthly predictions in live production, affecting billions of dollars in revenue for its customers. “The great momentum Pecan is experiencing is incredible validation that the market demand for data science far exceeds the supply of data scientists,” said George Mathew, Managing Director at Insight Partners. “By empowering companies to accurately predict future events without requiring data science resources, Pecan enables its customers to accelerate and enhance their data literacy, empowering business teams to become more agile and deliberate with how they drive revenue and growth.” Pecan currently has a leadership team of 11, including new hires Sweeney and Gotkis. The leadership team is made up of almost 50% women. In addition to Gotkis, Limor Segev serves as SVP of Product, Riki Falah as VP of Finance, and Linat Wager as VP of builder experience. Danielle Gotkis has a long history of marketing management roles, including at Recurly, Feedzai and dLocal (NASDAQ: DLO). Chris Sweeney comes from a long history in enterprise sales leadership, including at New Relic (NYSE: NEWR) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL).

OPENING CALL Stock futures dipped on Monday as investors awaited inflation data later this week. aAdsList.push('Article'); aAdsListSize.push([300, 250]); aAdsListCA.push(null); Wednesday's inflation reading will be the last major economic data point of the year, and it could be crucial ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. Meanwhile, global advertising stocks rallied as Omnicom and Interpublic neared a long-awaited union that would reshape the industry . Interpublic surged premarket, and shares in European rivals Publicis and WPP rose. South Korean markets came under renewed pressure after the leader of the country's ruling party said embattled president Yoon Suk Yeol would no longer be involved in running the country , in a move aimed at stabilizing state affairs. Investors were also assessing developments in the Middle East, where the Assad family dictatorship collapsed over the weekend. Rebel forces claimed control of Damascus and President Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia. Also this week, central banks in Europe and Canada will meet to decide on interest rates. Premarket Movers Apollo Global Management and Workday, will be added to the S&P 500 in the index's quarterly rebalancing, replacing Qorvo and Amentum Holdings, both of which will move to the S&P Small Cap 600 index. Apollo Global was up 6.1% and Workday rose 10%. Qorvo and Amentum fell. AppLovin fell 5.4% after it wasn't added to the S&P 500. Barron's had reported Friday that AppLovin, Apollo, and Coinbase Global were leading candidates that might be added to the index because they have three of the largest market values of any companies not in the S&P 500. Coinbase declined 1.8%. Super Micro Computer said it has been granted an extension from Nasdaq that gives the server marker until Feb. 25, 2025, to file its latest annual report and that it expects to file by the deadline.

Watch For: Oracle 2Q earnings Today's Headlines/Must Reads: - Tapped-Out Private-Equity Investors Decline New Commitments - New York City's Biggest Office Landlord Offers a Glimpse of the Market's Comeback - Why Tariffs Could Really Pinch Retailers This Time MARKET WRAPS Forex: The dollar edged lower as investors bet on the Fed cutting interest rates further this month, Swissquote Bank said. Friday's nonfarm payrolls data boosted market expectations for the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points at the December 18 meeting, supporting the case for a softer dollar even as investors seek safe haven assets amid global political turmoil. The euro could fall to $1.0500 in the short-term or even lower after the U.S. inflation data and the ECB policy decision later this week, according to ING. Core inflation might have accelerated in November, bringing into question if the Fed would be right to be cutting interest rates and the ECB is likely to cut rates by 25 basis points on Thursday which might open the door to taking rates below the so-called neutral rate that neither spurs nor slows growth, ING said. Sterling rose after China's pledge for more proactive fiscal stimulus Monex Europe said. The announcement was supporting risk appetite and offering tailwinds to sterling, it said. Energy: Oil rose on greater uncertainty in the Middle East after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime fell. ""The geopolitical situation in the Middle East is likely to remain tense in the coming days following the collapse of Syria's government,"" ANZ Research said. Still, gains are capped by persistent concerns over global demand and an impending glut despite OPEC+'s decision to extend a series of production cuts. The weak demand outlook was also underscored by Saudi Arabia's decision to lower its January prices for crude grades it sells to Asia, its main market. Focus this week will be on China's Central Economic Work Conference, as well as monthly reports from OPEC, the IEA and the EIA. DNB Markets said Saudi Arabia's decision to cut official oil selling prices for Asia underscores weaker demand in the continent. Aramco will sell January loadings of its flagship Arab Light grade to Asian buyers at a premium of $0.90 a barrel to the regional Dubai/Oman benchmark, compared with $1.70 in December. ""This is the lowest premium to Dubai since the start of 2021, and at the same time as OPEC has extended its production cuts."" Metals: Gold futures rose on geopolitical risk and central bank purchases. The precious metal has gained on safe-haven demand after the Syrian rebels seized Damascus. Israel seized the demilitarized buffer zone between Israel and Syria over the weekend. A softer dollar has further enhanced gold's appeal as a safe-haven. China's central bank also resumed purchases of bullions in November after a six-month pause, which should shore up Chinese investor demand. Gold Chart Comex gold futures' bullish setup is still valid, based on the daily chart, RHB Retail Research said. Friday's price movements have reaffirmed that bears are respecting the immediate support pegged at $2,640. TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES Meet the Small AI Chip Maker Now More Valuable Than Intel Matt Murphy has no interest in running a chip company 10 times the size of his current one. It is the smarter move, and actually the more ambitious one. Murphy, who has served as chief executive officer of Marvell Technology since 2016, has been among the few names floated as potential replacements for the recently ousted Pat Gelsinger at Intel's corner office. That led to the rare sight of a CEO using his own earnings call to deny that he is on the market. Apple Tops the List of Best-Managed Companies of 2024 Technology companies continue to hold most of the top spots in the annual Management Top 250 ranking of America's best-run companies, with Apple unseating Microsoft at No. 1. Rounding out the top four are Nvidia, Microsoft-which came in at No. 1 the previous four years-and Intel. BP, Japan's JERA to Invest Up to $5.8 Billion to Create Offshore Wind JV British energy giant BP and Japanese power-generation company JERA will invest $5.8 billion to create a global offshore wind-energy joint venture. The companies said Monday that the standalone company will have 13 gigawatt of potential net generating capacity. China Adopts Crisis-Era Language as Leaders Signal More Forceful Stimulus BEIJING-China's leaders signaled a more forceful policy approach to shoring up the economy as Beijing braces for trade tensions under the incoming Trump administration, employing language they haven't used since the depths of the global financial crisis. The 24-man Politburo, China's top decision-making body, pledged Monday to implement more proactive fiscal policy and to adopt a ""moderately loose"" monetary policy next year-the first introduction of such language since 2008. Why Tariffs Could Really Pinch Retailers This Time Many retailers came through relatively unscathed by Donald Trump's tariffs imposed starting in 2018. This time around, though, tariffs have the potential to bite more. Trump has proposed a universal tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports to the U.S. and a 60% or more tariff on goods from China. Somewhat confusingly, Trump has also separately threatened 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% tariff on China over immigration and drug issues. Trump Says He Has No Plan to Remove Powell at Fed President-elect Donald Trump said he had no plans to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. During an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Trump fielded a question about whether he planned to replace Powell, who has said he would not leave the job even if asked to do so. ""No, I don't think so. I don't see it,"" Trump answered. U.S. Scrambles to Shape Post-Assad Syria but Has to Overcome Years of Disengagement WASHINGTON-The unexpectedly rapid downfall of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria has turned the country's future from a back-burner issue to a suddenly high-stakes concern for the departing Biden administration-and almost certainly for Donald Trump. U.S. officials are scrambling to assess the intentions of the rebel groups that drove Assad into exile, especially Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which is expected to play a pivotal role in whatever government emerges in Damascus but which is on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. Israeli Airstrikes Target Syrian Chemical-Weapons Systems TEL AVIV-Israel said it had struck chemical-weapons caches and other missile and air-defense systems in Syria on Monday, taking advantage of the chaos there to destroy what it sees as dangerous assets that could fall into rebel hands. Since the stunning assault by Syrian rebels that brought down the regime of President Bashar al-Assad over the weekend, Israel said it has taken immediate steps to ensure the protection of its border amid the uncertainty engulfing the country. This includes striking targets across Syria and swiftly seizing a demilitarized buffer zone with Syria as well as adjacent points. Inside Ukraine's Battle for the Skies as Russian Bombardments Hit Records POLTAVA, Ukraine-A team of soldiers sat inside a nondescript red bus with their eyes glued to a bank of screens blinking with yellow dots.

Far East Gold Ltd (ASX:FEG, OTC:FEGDF) has boosted its war chest to advance world-class gold and copper assets in Indonesia on receiving the second almost A$3.5 million tranche of a considerable investment by Xingye Gold (Hong Kong) Mining Company Limited. This follows the strategic investor, a subsidiary of A$4 billion major Chinese miner Inner Mongolia Xingye Silver & Tin Mining Co., Ltd, receiving all necessary Chinese regulatory approvals to release the A$3,498,638.40 Tranche 2 funds. Following the receipt of the first tranche of A$6.4 million early last month, Xingye has taken its investment in Far East Gold to almost A$9.9 million with a further amount of approximately $3.85 million expected in the third tranche. Far East Gold shares are 8.82% higher on the ASX to A$0.185. READ: Far East Gold receives first A$6.4 million tranche of investment by Xingye At the time of the conditional share placement agreement with Xingye in early September 2024, the investment was valued at approximately A$14 million which would give it a stake in Far East Gold of 19.9%. All tranches were priced at A$0.20 per share, which at the time represented a 47% premium to the company’s recent placement and share purchase plan and a 21% premium to the company’s last traded price. On November 28, Far East Gold advised that it had received approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) for the second and third tranches. Shareholder approval for the third tranche was granted the following day at FEG’s AGM as it exceeded the company’s existing placement capacity (Listing Rule 7.1 and Listing Rule 7.1A). READ: Far East Gold attracts major Chinese miner Xingye as strategic partner with A$14 million investment This investment is a major shot in the arm for Far East Gold as Shenzhen-listed Xingye, which has a market capitalisation of more than A$4 billion is the largest silver producer in China, one of the largest silver producers in the world and China’s second largest tin producer. Along with the significant investment, FEG, which is primarily focused on gold and copper in Indonesia, is expected to benefit from Xingye’s deep technical expertise in bringing greenfield projects through to production. Far East Gold CEO Shane Menere said: ""Partnering with one of China’s most successful precious metals producers validates the potential of FEG’s portfolio of world-class assets and gives the company a clear pathway through to project development in 2025.” Xingye’s main business is non-ferrous metal mining and smelting, operating a full mining industry chain from geological exploration, mining, mineral processing to smelting of silver and tin. In addition, it has also been actively exploring for copper and gold in Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Indonesia and Africa for the past five years. The company, which has 13 subsidiaries and 1 partnership enterprise, has diverse mineral resources and rich reserves with the main products being silver, tin, lead, zinc, copper, iron, bismuth, tungsten, antimony, gold and other non-ferrous metals, precious metals and ferrous metals. With completion of tranche 2, Xingye is also entitled to nominate one director for appointment to Far East Gold’s Board of Directors. Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL, ETR:ORC) stock plunged afterhours as the software firm’s fiscal second quarter earnings missed Wall Street forecasts. Earnings per share of $1.47 were short of the consensus of $1.48. Revenue rose 9% year-over-year to $14.1 billion, short of the consensus of $14.12 billion. Cloud services and license support revenues increased 12% from the year-ago quarter to $10.8 billion while Cloud license and on-premise licence revenues were $1.2 billion. Oracle CEO Safra Catz noted “extraordinary” growth in the AI segment of its infrastructure business during the quarter. “Growth in the AI segment of our Infrastructure business was extraordinary—GPU consumption was up 336% in the quarter—and we delivered the world's largest and fastest AI SuperComputer scaling up to 65,000 NVIDIA H200 GPUs,” Catz said. “With our remaining performance obligation (RPO) up 50% to $97 billion, we believe our already impressive growth rates will continue to climb even higher.” Oracle chief technology officer Larry Ellison highlighted that Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains generative AI models. “The Oracle Cloud trains dozens of specialized AI models and embeds hundreds of AI Agents in cloud applications,” he said. “For example, Oracle's AI Agents automate drug design, image and genomic analysis for cancer diagnostics, audio updates to electronic health records for patient care, satellite image analysis to predict and improve agricultural output, fraud and money laundering detection, dual-factor biometric computer logins, and real-time video weapons detection in schools.” Shares of Oracle traded down 6.4% post-earnings.",767.0,441.0,4.0,3.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0.009070294784580499,0.006802721088435374,0.015873015873015872,0.0022675736961451248,0.0022675736961451248,0.0022675736961451248

(AMD) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030
According to PC Gamer, “The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is simply the best gaming CPU around right now. It’s certainly the best gaming chip that AMD has ever made, but it’s also capable of outperforming Intel’s top CPU when it comes to gaming frame rates and is doing so for a lot less cash. It’s also a lot less power-thirsty, too.” Rave reviews such as this would have been considered unthinkable over a decade ago. After 50 years of playing second best to rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) surpassed it, thanks to CEO Dr. Linda Su, who took the reins in 2014 and AMD was able to unveil the Ryzen in 2017, which became a game changer. Based on a principle of multiple microscopic CPUs working in tandem, AMD’s Ryzen CPU outperformed Intel’s CPUs in speed and efficiency, and most importantly – cost only half as much. Ryzen and its later updates subsequently added tents of billions to AMD’s revenues, and in 2022, AMD surpassed Intel in market cap, although not in chip market share. Headwinds and Challenges Under Dr. Lisa Su, AMD’s Ryzen and Epyc CPUs have propelled the company to profitability and market cap superiority over longtime rival Intel. Despite AMD’s phenomenal turnaround over the past decade, not everything has been smooth sailing and concern-free. Unlike Intel, AMD does not own manufacturing facilities in the US. Dr. Su’s reputation and ties to Taiwan have created a strong relationship with manufacturing facilities owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, (NYSE: TSM). While the relationship between AMD and TSMC remains robust, geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China, whose CCP leadership continues to advocate for “reunification” with Taiwan, even if by military invasion, continues to be a supply chain risk factor. While AMD’s MI300 GPU is a viable competitor to Nvidia’s H100, industry publication Tom’s Hardware estimates that AMD’s new chips sell for just 25% of the price of Nvidia’s H100, despite their similar performance. This means less room for growth and lower margins. Additionally, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn’t standing still. In Q1, the company announced its new Blackwell platform, designed to train generative AI models at a fraction of the cost of its predecessor. Nvidia’s faster development cycle means that AMD may be stuck playing a game of catchup — putting further pressure on its pricing power, growth, and margins. US technology export restrictions require AMD, Nvidia, and other US chip makers to design lower-performance versions of their top products for export to China and the Middle East. Prior iterations from Q1 2024 were rejected by the Commerce Dept. as still being too powerful, and export licenses were withheld. The counterintuitive need to create a better device to market while simultaneously designing lower capabilities is proving to be a more delicate and difficult task than anticipated. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further-looking insights based on AMD’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article Lisa Su’s acquisitions of ZT Systems and various AI software companies are part of a comprehensive AI-focused strategy. The acquisition of ZT Systems, a cloud architecture solution provider, is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy objective, which is to provide AI in end-to-end computing. AMD’s MI300 GPU and future models will continue to compete with Nvidia for the AI graphics market. AMD’s chip architecture for Ryzen and other products will expand for installation applications beyond gaming, such as automobiles, IoT, and others. The threat of a PRC military invasion of Taiwan is still a major semiconductor supply chain threat, as AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and other tech companies all rely on Taiwan Semiconductor for its manufacturing needs.

After stints at IBM and Texas Instruments, Dr. Lisa Su became COO of AMD, assuming the CEO position in 2014. Soon afterwards, she started her overhaul of the company by splitting it into 2 divisions: Computing and Graphics, which includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. Dr. Su oversaw the release of the Radeon 300 and Fury series, the last of the Bulldozer derivatives, and then the RX 400 series of GPUs in 2016. Based on AMD’s Zen architecture, both Epyc for servers and workstations Ryzen for laptops and desktops debuted in 2017. They innovatively took multiple micro CPUs to work as a team for superior computing power and speed. Ryzen, in particular, took the computing world and Intel by surprise, as it catapulted AMD to previously uncharted levels. 2020 saw AMD announce the acquisition of Xilinx for its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). AMD would discontinue Xilinx production of its complex programmable logic devices (CPLD) in early 2024. Pensando Systems was added to AMD’s portfolio in 2022, with Mipsology to follow in 2023. On the AI front, 2023 saw AMD acquire Nod.ai, followed by Silo.AI, Europe’s largest private AI Lab, in 2024.

AMD’s MI300 GPU (Graphics Processing Units) and similar products are addressing AI workloads for cloud computing, which is stirring up interest. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) are already using the MI300. As a result, AMD is now on the radar alongside other AI related stocks. The ZT Systems acquisition for $4.9 billion is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy. By integrating ZT’s expertise in data center infrastructure, AMD will be able to offer complete AI solutions, encompassing hardware, software, and system-level integration. Therefore, AMD will soon provide a one-stop, comprehensive and integrated offering to clients seeking robust AI solutions. Data Center growth (already $2.3 billion sector revenues for AMD in Q1, +80% y-o-y), should continue to expand that area for the near and extended future. AMD 3D V-Cache chips will be an integral contributor to AMD-powered data center equipment. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating from over 40 Wall Street analysts is “buy/outperform” (31 buy, 7 outperform, 10 hold). Their average price target in 12 months is $186.91, which is 42.53% from the price today. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for AMD’s price is $205.20, which would be a 48.31% increase. We believe Dr. Su’s goal of end-to-end AI utility is already underway, with AMD competing with Nvidia in a similar fashion and strategy to how it challenged Intel: with comparable or superior speed and performance for lower prices. AMD’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook The past 10-year median P/E ratio for AMD is 34.27. 24/7 Wall Street is using a more conservative P/E ratio of 30 for the following price predictions. These prices also preclude an invasion of Taiwan from China, which would understandably devastate chip manufacturing worldwide. For 2026, we predict a price of $237.12, which would be a 15.56% gain year-over-year. AMD’s acquisition of ZT Systems will be a significant contributor to Dr. Su’s AI development agenda. She anticipates that the AI accelerator and GPU chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. AMD’s Instinct and Epyc accelerators for machine learning will see a major boost in this surge. To follow up on the AI agenda, 2027 should benefit from ZT Systems’ software boost capabilities. During 2023-24, AMD invested more than $1 billion to improve its AI software capabilities and R&amp;D activities. AMD has already made three small software AI-related acquisitions (Silo AI, Nod.ai, and Mipsology) to bolster its mid- and high-level software abstractions and help customers customize LLMs. Dr. Su and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang are blood-relative cousins, and their respective competitive drives and tech savvy make the AMD and Nvidia rivalry in AI all the more compelling when the different components are compared head-to-head. The 24/7 Wall Street price target for 2027 is $294.40. This would be a 24.16% gain year-over-year. 2028 should see AMD get an upswing from its ancillary markets. For example, AMD’s Ryzen is already a big part of the digital cockpits in the automotive market. Its partnerships with Daimler-Benz and Tesla will likely expand to other auto manufacturers as AI becomes more ubiquitous and demand escalates. Our price target is $306, a modest year-over-year gain of 3.94%. Edge computing would be another ancillary market for AMD that would benefit from AI. 2029 should see a boost in IoT applications using AMD-powered devices and digital architecture. AMD’s Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) will continue to expand, with its Epyc Milan X, the first MCM GPU, leading the way for a range of other configurations. The resulting bump would be a target price of $336, a 9.80% gain from the previous year’s price target. AMD Stock in 2030 AMD’s development of end-to-end AI computing is Dr. Lisa Su’s primary goal over the next decade. At present, no smartphone utilizes any AMD CPUs. Nevertheless, AMD has already announced the availability of Ryzen chips for mobile devices. By 2030, the growth of AI-powered mobile gaming should reach the point where the demand for Ryzen performance in smartphones by game-oriented users should see Ryzen-powered smartphones. This would be a huge boon for AMD, as the smartphone market is a major one that has long eluded it. The 24/7 Wall Street 2030 price target is $396.20.

The sixth richest person in the world is former Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) CEO Steve Ballmer. He has a net worth of $164 billion, below that of his former boss Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, at $177 billion. Ballmer left the CEO’s job at Microsoft in 2013. He wisely did not sell most of his shares when he left the company. He owns 4% of the massive tech company, which makes him Microsoft&#8217;s largest private owner. His dividends alone make him $1 billion a year. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Former Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) CEO Steve Ballmer is the sixth richest person in the world. Those on the list above him all founded huge tech companies. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The people on the list above Ballmer all started huge tech companies. These include Tesla&#8217;s Elon Musk at $368 billion, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg at $241 billion, Oracle’s Larry Ellison at $234 billion, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos at $233 billion. Ballmer joined Microsoft in 1980 and became chief executive in 2000. During his 14-year tenure, Microsoft’s revenue tripled. As Ballmer left, Eric Jackson at the hedge fund Ironfire Capital told Reuters, “I don’t see anybody else on the management team at Microsoft that I think would be much better than Ballmer.” However, he received criticism for not launching popular products like the rival Steve Jobs did at Apple. Ballmer kept 333 million shares despite leaving, about triple the number Gates has kept. Ballmer has become a major philanthropist. While not as visible as Gates and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, according to Forbes, “He has ramped up his philanthropy since 2014; to date the Ballmers have given away more than $4 billion.” Microsoft Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 The post The World&#8217;s Richest Don&#8217;t Have to Be Tech Founders, Look at Steve Ballmer appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",329.0,155.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.01935483870967742,0.0064516129032258064,0.012903225806451613,0.0,0.0,0.012903225806451613

Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) 1.08% over the past trading sessions, increasing the tech giant&#8217;s one-month gain to 4.66%. So far in 2025, the stock is up 14.73%, including 35.45% since its year-to-date low on April 8. On June 12, it was reported that Microsoft is developing a version of its AI Copilot for the Pentagon, which should be available at some point this summer. On June 5, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 33% in FY25 Q3, driven by AI services. When the company last reported earnings, it announced that total revenue rose 13% to $70.1 billion and it generated earnings of $3.46 per share, beating estimates of $3.22 per share. Despite a $800 million charge last quarter from its investment in General Motors&#8216; (NYSE:GM) Cruise robotaxi initiative that the automaker subsequently shutdown, Microsoft’s focus on AI and cloud resilience continues to fuel optimism. However, its decision earlier in May fire 6,000 employees, or 3% of its workforce, signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth. Key Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms. Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines.

It has a software stock that could ride dominance in AI to returns of 10x or more. Why Invest in Microsoft Microsoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S. Its Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon&#8216;s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. When Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20. Microsoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect Q4 capex to remain elevated at $16 billion to $17 billion to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth. Tariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&amp;D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year. Beyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft&#8217;s AI and cloud momentum. Microsoft As a Stock Earlier in June, Citi raised its price target for MSFT to $605 from $540 while maintaining its &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. The firm also added an &#8220;upside 90-day catalyst watch&#8221; on the shares. Citi says Microsoft remains its top pick in software given the company&#8217;s &#8220;relative defensiveness in a choppy macro environment,&#8221; AI product cycle and &#8220;reinforced conviction&#8221; that Street estimates on Azure may be too low for fiscal 2026. The firm believes the share catalyst will be fiscal Q4 earnings when fiscal 2026 guidance is announced and beyond as both Microsoft and OpenAI AI revenue continue to ramp. Citi says Azure has &#8220;hit an inflection&#8221; based on its exit rate math and token usage. Wall Street analysts&#8217; sentiment remains bullish, with 31 of 36 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, five assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and zero assigning it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Wall Street&#8217;s price targets cover a significant range, spanning $475 per share on the low end to $605 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $518.77, which represents 8.02% potential upside from today&#8217;s share price. Institutional ownership currently stands at 73.06%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $475 -1.09% Median $518.77 8.02% High $605 25.97% Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s 33% Azure growth and 20% cloud revenue increase in Q3 position it for AI market gains. However, $20 billion quarterly capex and tariff risks require caution. Its $80 billion cash reserve and Oracle partnership offer stability, making MSFT stock a buy for growth investors, even as valuation concerns linger. 24/7 Wall St.’s 12-month price target for Microsoft is $495.00, implying 3.07% potential upside from the stock&#8217;s current price. This cautious target reflects Azure’s strength and Q4 revenue guidance of $73.7 billion, balanced against the need for higher capex spending and potential supply chain disruptions, positioning it at a realistic estimate of its leading presence in the space.The post Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",1021.0,578.0,14.0,9.0,15.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.02422145328719723,0.015570934256055362,0.025951557093425604,0.0017301038062283738,0.005190311418685121,0.00865051903114187

The artificial intelligence (AI) industry continues to evolve, but there are worries about a market correction that could significantly impact AI stocks. Investors are seeking fairly priced stocks that still have the potential to continue growing and AI is no longer limited to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Those who invested in NVDA at the right moment have already made big gains. But if you’re looking for AI stocks to invest now, you need to be picky. Top AI stocks are either priced at a premium or face high expectations, which offer both risk and opportunities. NVIDIA failed to impress Wall Street with its Q2 earnings. Its data center revenue was slightly below consensus, and it reported a modest quarter. While the stock is up 25% in 2025, it is suffering due to elevated expectations. NVIDIA will continue to dominate the AI industry, but there are three other AI stocks worth loading up on. Here are three leveraged to AI that you should consider instead. --> --> Key Points If you&#8217;re looking for AI stocks other than Nvidia, here are the top three stocks soaring higher this year. These stocks are up over 20% in 2025 and have the potential to move upwards. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

Don&#8217;t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) --> --> Oracle Up 36% in 2025, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) stock is exchanging hands for $226. The company has benefited from the increased spending on cloud computing infrastructure and has a partnership with OpenAI. Besides the outsized gains in recent years, Oracle has had an excellent 2025. The company has turned into a complete ecosystem and is no longer restricted to a software database business. It started to build its own cloud services and offers AI powered database services. It also offers software-as-a-service for marketing, automating workflows, financial reporting, and more. A strong player in the cloud business today, Oracle is spending aggressively to capture the market. It reported a revenue of $15.9 billion in its Q4 financial results announced in June. Cloud revenue jumped 27% to $6.7 billion for the quarter, while total revenue for 2025 was up 8% to $57.4 billion. The management is aiming to achieve a 70% revenue growth in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure segment, and it is aiming for the total revenue to increase 16% to $67 billion in FY 2026. Its remaining performance obligations increased 41% to $138 billion. It shows the total value of the company’s unfulfilled contracts at the end of a period. A 41% jump is nothing but impressive. The company is already a part of the massive $500 billion Stargate project. Announced by OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and MGX, Oracle is the funder and technology partner. Stargate AI aims to invest $500 billion towards new data centres and infrastructure over the next four years. There’s a lot of space for the stock to show its strength and soar higher. Broadcom Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) supplies custom AI chips to three of the biggest tech giants- Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and TikTok owner ByteDance. Up 28% year-to-date, the stock is exchanging hands for $297 and has soared 94% in 12 months. The company makes AI and networking chips that ensure efficient and quick movement of data from one server to another. Its fundamentals are strong, and the company has seen a significant improvement in its market cap to $1.36 trillion. In the recent quarter, the AI revenue jumped 46% year-over-year to $4.4 billion, accounting for 30% of the total sales. The company&#8217;s management is aiming to generate $5.1 billion in AI revenue this quarter. Its networking division also benefits from the AI infrastructure demand. As companies continue to set aside billions of dollars for AI, Broadcom’s infrastructure becomes an integral part of their business. The scope of expansion is massive, and Broadcom is making the most of this opportunity. It is sitting at the intersection of custom chips, networking equipment, and integrated systems. While the stock isn’t cheap, it could be worth betting on. The company is set to report results on September 4, and we could see the stock rally. Analysts are bullish on the stock. Oppenheimer analyst has a price target of $325 with an Outperform rating while UBS has a price target of $345 with a Buy rating. AVGO is one of the top tech giants to keep on your radar. CoreWeave A new AI cloud services provider, CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV), has been making news after the expiration of its IPO lockup period. Up 157% in 2025, CoreWeave stock is exchanging hands for $103 and has reported robust quarterly results. The company has a market cap of $47 billion, and it rents out NVIDIA GPU-equipped servers. A fairly new name in the AI space, the stock has impressed investors, and this could be a start to a solid journey. In 2022, the company spent about $100 million to install Nvidia’s H100 GPU’s in its data centers, and then it used those as collateral to secure funding to open more data centres. The strategy impressed tech giant Nvidia, which invested $100 million in the company in 2023 and another $250 million in the IPO this year. This is NVIDIA&#8217;s single biggest investment in the stock and has garnered attention from many. CoreWeave has 33 data centers in the U.S. and Europe, and top customers include Meta, OpenAI and IBM (NYSE: IBM). The growing expenses have led to wide losses, and analysts expect the company to continue reporting net losses this year. In the recent quarter, it posted a loss of 60 cents per share versus $1.62 per share loss reported a year earlier. CoreWeave saw a 206% jump in revenue to $1.21 billion, beating expectations. For the full year, it has raised guidance by $250 million to $5.25 billion. Unlike bigger AI companies, which offer a range of computing and storage services, CoreWeave only focuses on one service- providing cloud-based GPUs for processing AI tasks. It enjoys an early mover advantage, has an impressive client base, and the potential to grow at a rapid rate.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Tuesday Wrap-up Sep 9, 2025 4:08 PM Live The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF closed Tuesday at 597.93, up 0.2%. Jobs Market Slumps -- or Slumped Sep 9, 2025 11:18 AM Live A new report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reveals that reported jobs gains from April 2024 through March 2025 were accidentally overstated by nearly 1 million. 911,000 total fewer jobs, than were described in the monthly reports, were actually created over the course of this year. This was the biggest flub in jobs numbers &#8220;since at least 2000,&#8221; reports Marketwatch. And more recent reports suggest the situation&#8217;s getting worse as 2025 progresses. Long story short, the economy&#8217;s getting weaker, and the chances of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut are getting stronger. Microsoft Has a New Friend Sep 9, 2025 10:58 AM Live Dutch tech company Nebius (Nasdaq: NBUS) announced today that it will lease a new data center in Vineland, New Jersey to Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) for five years and $17.4 billion. Nebius stock is up more than 37% on the news, albeit it says it will need to take on debt and use revenue from the contract to finance construction of the data center, which will open for business this year and expand its capacity through 2026. The Voo is now down 0.1%. Oracle Upgraded Sep 9, 2025 10:19 AM Live Speaking of Oracle, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman raised his price target on Oracle stock to $275 with an outperform rating this morning. Oracle&#8217;s alliance with with OpenAI gives the stock durable AI demand, says Bachman, which should drive growth acceleration through fiscal 2028. Oracle stock, though, is down 0.7% ahead of earnings. The Voo is still up, but only barely &#8212; 0.03%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. A Congressional Budget Office report last month predicted that if implemented fully, President Trump&#8217;s several announced tariffs on imports into the U.S. could cut the nation&#8217;s debt by a combined $4 trillion over the next 10 years. Or&#8230; not. Two U.S. courts of appeals have in recent days declared the Trump tariffs illegal, and ordered monies collected pursuant to the tariffs refunded to their payers. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says the rulings threaten to cost the U.S. Treasury as much as $1 trillion in funds through June, worsening the budget deficit and adding to U.S. debt. The White House has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on the issue. Meantime, investors seem unconcerned &#8212; maybe even a bit optimistic that repealing the tariffs, which represent a tax hike on U.S. importers and consumers &#8212; could provide a boost to the economy, a boost potentially turbocharged by expected Federal Reserve interest rate cuts later this month. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) is up 0.1% premarket. Earnings Earnings season is basically over at this point, although Yahoo! Finance lists a few well-known names scheduled to report Tuesday. Tonight after close of trading, investors will tune in for the latest earnings news from AeroVironment (Nasdaq: AVAV), GameStop (NYSE: GME), and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). Drones manufacturer AeroVironment is forecast to earn $0.34 per share in its fiscal Q1 2026 report. Oracle should do even better, earning $1.48 per share for its fiscal Q1 2026. Wall Street analysts expect GameStop, however, to report an $0.08 per share loss for its fiscal Q2 2025.

Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gained 1.07% over the past five trading sessions after slipping 1.77% the five prior. Still, MSFT is up more than 44% since its year-to-date low on April 8. The company&#8217;s reported strong Q2 earnings on July 30. The Magnificent Seven mainstay reported EPS of $3.65 versus analysts&#8217; expectations of $3.35, while quarterly revenue came in at $76.44 billion. MSFT is now up 19.42% this year. In August, Truist raised its price target on Microsoft to $675 from $650 while keeping a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. That follows price target upgrades that came in July. Citi raised its price target on Microsoft to $613 from $605 while keeping a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. Piper Sandler raised its price target for MSFT to $600 from $475 while keeping an &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating. On June 5, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 33% in FY25 Q3, driven by AI services. When the company last reported earnings, it announced that total revenue rose 13% to $70.1 billion and it generated earnings of $3.46 per share, beating estimates of $3.22 per share. Despite a $800 million charge in Q1 from its investment in General Motors&#8216; (NYSE:GM) Cruise robotaxi initiative that the automaker subsequently shutdown, Microsoft’s focus on AI and cloud resilience continues to fuel optimism. However, its decision in May fire 6,000 employees — or 3% of its workforce — signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth. --> --> Key Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms. Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines.

Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S. Its Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon&#8216;s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. When Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20. Microsoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect Q4 capex to remain elevated at $16 billion to $17 billion to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth. Tariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&amp;D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year. Beyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft&#8217;s AI and cloud momentum. Microsoft As a Stock Broadly, Wall Street analysts&#8217; remain bullish, with 33 of 34 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, one assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and zero assigning it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Wall Street&#8217;s price targets cover a significant range, spanning $550 per share on the low end to $680 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $626.88, which represents 22.60% potential upside from today&#8217;s share price. Institutional ownership currently stands at 72.93%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $550 7.57% Median $626.88 22.60% High $680 32.99% Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s 33% Azure growth and 20% cloud revenue increase in Q3 position it for AI market gains. However, $20 billion quarterly capex and tariff risks require caution. Its $80 billion cash reserve and Oracle partnership offer stability, making MSFT stock a buy for growth investors, even as valuation concerns linger. 24/7 Wall St.’s year-end price target for Microsoft is $563.64, implying upside potential of 10.24% from the stock&#8217;s current price. This cautious target reflects Azure’s strength and Q4 revenue guidance of $73.7 billion, balanced against the need for higher capex spending and potential supply chain disruptions, positioning it at a realistic estimate of its leading presence in the space.The post Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",968.0,546.0,15.0,8.0,13.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.027472527472527472,0.014652014652014652,0.023809523809523808,0.0,0.005494505494505495,0.01282051282051282
