Cloud Infrastructure revenue soared 68% and RPO exploded 438% to $523B, but heavy capex drove free cash flow negative and raised debt concerns. Management asserts capex is tied to contracted demand, with flexible funding models and near-term RPO conversion expected to support balance sheet health.",
