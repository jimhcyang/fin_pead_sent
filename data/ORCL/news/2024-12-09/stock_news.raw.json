    "text": "OPENING CALL Stock futures dipped on Monday as investors awaited inflation data later this week. aAdsList.push('Article'); aAdsListSize.push([300, 250]); aAdsListCA.push(null); Wednesday's inflation reading will be the last major economic data point of the year, and it could be crucial ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. Meanwhile, global advertising stocks rallied as Omnicom and Interpublic neared a long-awaited union that would reshape the industry . Interpublic surged premarket, and shares in European rivals Publicis and WPP rose. South Korean markets came under renewed pressure after the leader of the country's ruling party said embattled president Yoon Suk Yeol would no longer be involved in running the country , in a move aimed at stabilizing state affairs. Investors were also assessing developments in the Middle East, where the Assad family dictatorship collapsed over the weekend. Rebel forces claimed control of Damascus and President Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia. Also this week, central banks in Europe and Canada will meet to decide on interest rates. Premarket Movers Apollo Global Management and Workday, will be added to the S&P 500 in the index's quarterly rebalancing, replacing Qorvo and Amentum Holdings, both of which will move to the S&P Small Cap 600 index. Apollo Global was up 6.1% and Workday rose 10%. Qorvo and Amentum fell. AppLovin fell 5.4% after it wasn't added to the S&P 500. Barron's had reported Friday that AppLovin, Apollo, and Coinbase Global were leading candidates that might be added to the index because they have three of the largest market values of any companies not in the S&P 500. Coinbase declined 1.8%. Super Micro Computer said it has been granted an extension from Nasdaq that gives the server marker until Feb. 25, 2025, to file its latest annual report and that it expects to file by the deadline. Shares rose 9.2% Tesla was up 2.1%. Watch For: Oracle 2Q earnings Today's Headlines/Must Reads: - Tapped-Out Private-Equity Investors Decline New Commitments - New York City's Biggest Office Landlord Offers a Glimpse of the Market's Comeback - Why Tariffs Could Really Pinch Retailers This Time MARKET WRAPS Forex: The dollar edged lower as investors bet on the Fed cutting interest rates further this month, Swissquote Bank said. Friday's nonfarm payrolls data boosted market expectations for the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points at the December 18 meeting, supporting the case for a softer dollar even as investors seek safe haven assets amid global political turmoil. The euro could fall to $1.0500 in the short-term or even lower after the U.S. inflation data and the ECB policy decision later this week, according to ING. Core inflation might have accelerated in November, bringing into question if the Fed would be right to be cutting interest rates and the ECB is likely to cut rates by 25 basis points on Thursday which might open the door to taking rates below the so-called neutral rate that neither spurs nor slows growth, ING said. Sterling rose after China's pledge for more proactive fiscal stimulus Monex Europe said. The announcement was supporting risk appetite and offering tailwinds to sterling, it said. Energy: Oil rose on greater uncertainty in the Middle East after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime fell. \"The geopolitical situation in the Middle East is likely to remain tense in the coming days following the collapse of Syria's government,\" ANZ Research said. Still, gains are capped by persistent concerns over global demand and an impending glut despite OPEC+'s decision to extend a series of production cuts. The weak demand outlook was also underscored by Saudi Arabia's decision to lower its January prices for crude grades it sells to Asia, its main market. Focus this week will be on China's Central Economic Work Conference, as well as monthly reports from OPEC, the IEA and the EIA. DNB Markets said Saudi Arabia's decision to cut official oil selling prices for Asia underscores weaker demand in the continent. Aramco will sell January loadings of its flagship Arab Light grade to Asian buyers at a premium of $0.90 a barrel to the regional Dubai/Oman benchmark, compared with $1.70 in December. \"This is the lowest premium to Dubai since the start of 2021, and at the same time as OPEC has extended its production cuts.\" Metals: Gold futures rose on geopolitical risk and central bank purchases. The precious metal has gained on safe-haven demand after the Syrian rebels seized Damascus. Israel seized the demilitarized buffer zone between Israel and Syria over the weekend. A softer dollar has further enhanced gold's appeal as a safe-haven. China's central bank also resumed purchases of bullions in November after a six-month pause, which should shore up Chinese investor demand. Gold Chart Comex gold futures' bullish setup is still valid, based on the daily chart, RHB Retail Research said. Friday's price movements have reaffirmed that bears are respecting the immediate support pegged at $2,640. TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES Meet the Small AI Chip Maker Now More Valuable Than Intel Matt Murphy has no interest in running a chip company 10 times the size of his current one. It is the smarter move, and actually the more ambitious one. Murphy, who has served as chief executive officer of Marvell Technology since 2016, has been among the few names floated as potential replacements for the recently ousted Pat Gelsinger at Intel's corner office. That led to the rare sight of a CEO using his own earnings call to deny that he is on the market. Apple Tops the List of Best-Managed Companies of 2024 Technology companies continue to hold most of the top spots in the annual Management Top 250 ranking of America's best-run companies, with Apple unseating Microsoft at No. 1. Rounding out the top four are Nvidia, Microsoft-which came in at No. 1 the previous four years-and Intel. BP, Japan's JERA to Invest Up to $5.8 Billion to Create Offshore Wind JV British energy giant BP and Japanese power-generation company JERA will invest $5.8 billion to create a global offshore wind-energy joint venture. The companies said Monday that the standalone company will have 13 gigawatt of potential net generating capacity. China Adopts Crisis-Era Language as Leaders Signal More Forceful Stimulus BEIJING-China's leaders signaled a more forceful policy approach to shoring up the economy as Beijing braces for trade tensions under the incoming Trump administration, employing language they haven't used since the depths of the global financial crisis. The 24-man Politburo, China's top decision-making body, pledged Monday to implement more proactive fiscal policy and to adopt a \"moderately loose\" monetary policy next year-the first introduction of such language since 2008. Why Tariffs Could Really Pinch Retailers This Time Many retailers came through relatively unscathed by Donald Trump's tariffs imposed starting in 2018. This time around, though, tariffs have the potential to bite more. Trump has proposed a universal tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports to the U.S. and a 60% or more tariff on goods from China. Somewhat confusingly, Trump has also separately threatened 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% tariff on China over immigration and drug issues. Trump Says He Has No Plan to Remove Powell at Fed President-elect Donald Trump said he had no plans to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. During an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Trump fielded a question about whether he planned to replace Powell, who has said he would not leave the job even if asked to do so. \"No, I don't think so. I don't see it,\" Trump answered. U.S. Scrambles to Shape Post-Assad Syria but Has to Overcome Years of Disengagement WASHINGTON-The unexpectedly rapid downfall of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria has turned the country's future from a back-burner issue to a suddenly high-stakes concern for the departing Biden administration-and almost certainly for Donald Trump. U.S. officials are scrambling to assess the intentions of the rebel groups that drove Assad into exile, especially Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which is expected to play a pivotal role in whatever government emerges in Damascus but which is on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. Israeli Airstrikes Target Syrian Chemical-Weapons Systems TEL AVIV-Israel said it had struck chemical-weapons caches and other missile and air-defense systems in Syria on Monday, taking advantage of the chaos there to destroy what it sees as dangerous assets that could fall into rebel hands. Since the stunning assault by Syrian rebels that brought down the regime of President Bashar al-Assad over the weekend, Israel said it has taken immediate steps to ensure the protection of its border amid the uncertainty engulfing the country. This includes striking targets across Syria and swiftly seizing a demilitarized buffer zone with Syria as well as adjacent points. Inside Ukraine's Battle for the Skies as Russian Bombardments Hit Records POLTAVA, Ukraine-A team of soldiers sat inside a nondescript red bus with their eyes glued to a bank of screens blinking with yellow dots. The shapes represented Russian drones, missiles and planes cutting into Ukrainian skies. Soldiers from Ukraine's 164th Radiotechnical Brigade were trying to quickly identify targets and intercept them before they could sow destruction in towns and cities.

    "text": "Far East Gold Ltd (ASX:FEG, OTC:FEGDF) has boosted its war chest to advance world-class gold and copper assets in Indonesia on receiving the second almost A$3.5 million tranche of a considerable investment by Xingye Gold (Hong Kong) Mining Company Limited. This follows the strategic investor, a subsidiary of A$4 billion major Chinese miner Inner Mongolia Xingye Silver & Tin Mining Co., Ltd, receiving all necessary Chinese regulatory approvals to release the A$3,498,638.40 Tranche 2 funds. Following the receipt of the first tranche of A$6.4 million early last month, Xingye has taken its investment in Far East Gold to almost A$9.9 million with a further amount of approximately $3.85 million expected in the third tranche. Far East Gold shares are 8.82% higher on the ASX to A$0.185. READ: Far East Gold receives first A$6.4 million tranche of investment by Xingye At the time of the conditional share placement agreement with Xingye in early September 2024, the investment was valued at approximately A$14 million which would give it a stake in Far East Gold of 19.9%. All tranches were priced at A$0.20 per share, which at the time represented a 47% premium to the company’s recent placement and share purchase plan and a 21% premium to the company’s last traded price. On November 28, Far East Gold advised that it had received approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) for the second and third tranches. Shareholder approval for the third tranche was granted the following day at FEG’s AGM as it exceeded the company’s existing placement capacity (Listing Rule 7.1 and Listing Rule 7.1A). READ: Far East Gold attracts major Chinese miner Xingye as strategic partner with A$14 million investment This investment is a major shot in the arm for Far East Gold as Shenzhen-listed Xingye, which has a market capitalisation of more than A$4 billion is the largest silver producer in China, one of the largest silver producers in the world and China’s second largest tin producer. Along with the significant investment, FEG, which is primarily focused on gold and copper in Indonesia, is expected to benefit from Xingye’s deep technical expertise in bringing greenfield projects through to production. Far East Gold CEO Shane Menere said: \"Partnering with one of China’s most successful precious metals producers validates the potential of FEG’s portfolio of world-class assets and gives the company a clear pathway through to project development in 2025.” Xingye’s main business is non-ferrous metal mining and smelting, operating a full mining industry chain from geological exploration, mining, mineral processing to smelting of silver and tin. In addition, it has also been actively exploring for copper and gold in Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Indonesia and Africa for the past five years. The company, which has 13 subsidiaries and 1 partnership enterprise, has diverse mineral resources and rich reserves with the main products being silver, tin, lead, zinc, copper, iron, bismuth, tungsten, antimony, gold and other non-ferrous metals, precious metals and ferrous metals. With completion of tranche 2, Xingye is also entitled to nominate one director for appointment to Far East Gold’s Board of Directors. Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL, ETR:ORC) stock plunged afterhours as the software firm’s fiscal second quarter earnings missed Wall Street forecasts. Earnings per share of $1.47 were short of the consensus of $1.48. Revenue rose 9% year-over-year to $14.1 billion, short of the consensus of $14.12 billion. Cloud services and license support revenues increased 12% from the year-ago quarter to $10.8 billion while Cloud license and on-premise licence revenues were $1.2 billion. Oracle CEO Safra Catz noted “extraordinary” growth in the AI segment of its infrastructure business during the quarter. “Growth in the AI segment of our Infrastructure business was extraordinary—GPU consumption was up 336% in the quarter—and we delivered the world's largest and fastest AI SuperComputer scaling up to 65,000 NVIDIA H200 GPUs,” Catz said. “With our remaining performance obligation (RPO) up 50% to $97 billion, we believe our already impressive growth rates will continue to climb even higher.” Oracle chief technology officer Larry Ellison highlighted that Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains generative AI models. “The Oracle Cloud trains dozens of specialized AI models and embeds hundreds of AI Agents in cloud applications,” he said. “For example, Oracle's AI Agents automate drug design, image and genomic analysis for cancer diagnostics, audio updates to electronic health records for patient care, satellite image analysis to predict and improve agricultural output, fraud and money laundering detection, dual-factor biometric computer logins, and real-time video weapons detection in schools.” Shares of Oracle traded down 6.4% post-earnings.",

    "text": "According to PC Gamer, “The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is simply the best gaming CPU around right now. It’s certainly the best gaming chip that AMD has ever made, but it’s also capable of outperforming Intel’s top CPU when it comes to gaming frame rates and is doing so for a lot less cash. It’s also a lot less power-thirsty, too.” Rave reviews such as this would have been considered unthinkable over a decade ago. After 50 years of playing second best to rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) surpassed it, thanks to CEO Dr. Linda Su, who took the reins in 2014 and AMD was able to unveil the Ryzen in 2017, which became a game changer. Based on a principle of multiple microscopic CPUs working in tandem, AMD’s Ryzen CPU outperformed Intel’s CPUs in speed and efficiency, and most importantly – cost only half as much. Ryzen and its later updates subsequently added tents of billions to AMD’s revenues, and in 2022, AMD surpassed Intel in market cap, although not in chip market share. Headwinds and Challenges Under Dr. Lisa Su, AMD’s Ryzen and Epyc CPUs have propelled the company to profitability and market cap superiority over longtime rival Intel. Despite AMD’s phenomenal turnaround over the past decade, not everything has been smooth sailing and concern-free. Unlike Intel, AMD does not own manufacturing facilities in the US. Dr. Su’s reputation and ties to Taiwan have created a strong relationship with manufacturing facilities owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, (NYSE: TSM). While the relationship between AMD and TSMC remains robust, geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China, whose CCP leadership continues to advocate for “reunification” with Taiwan, even if by military invasion, continues to be a supply chain risk factor. While AMD’s MI300 GPU is a viable competitor to Nvidia’s H100, industry publication Tom’s Hardware estimates that AMD’s new chips sell for just 25% of the price of Nvidia’s H100, despite their similar performance. This means less room for growth and lower margins. Additionally, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn’t standing still. In Q1, the company announced its new Blackwell platform, designed to train generative AI models at a fraction of the cost of its predecessor. Nvidia’s faster development cycle means that AMD may be stuck playing a game of catchup — putting further pressure on its pricing power, growth, and margins. US technology export restrictions require AMD, Nvidia, and other US chip makers to design lower-performance versions of their top products for export to China and the Middle East. Prior iterations from Q1 2024 were rejected by the Commerce Dept. as still being too powerful, and export licenses were withheld. The counterintuitive need to create a better device to market while simultaneously designing lower capabilities is proving to be a more delicate and difficult task than anticipated. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it’s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further-looking insights based on AMD’s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers’ own research. Key Points In This Article Lisa Su’s acquisitions of ZT Systems and various AI software companies are part of a comprehensive AI-focused strategy. The acquisition of ZT Systems, a cloud architecture solution provider, is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy objective, which is to provide AI in end-to-end computing. AMD’s MI300 GPU and future models will continue to compete with Nvidia for the AI graphics market. AMD’s chip architecture for Ryzen and other products will expand for installation applications beyond gaming, such as automobiles, IoT, and others. The threat of a PRC military invasion of Taiwan is still a major semiconductor supply chain threat, as AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and other tech companies all rely on Taiwan Semiconductor for its manufacturing needs.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Advanced Micro Devices News and Updates 12/9/2024 Vivek Arya, an analyst with Bank of America, downgraded Advanced Micro Devices stock from “Buy” to “Neutral” and lowered its price target from $180 to $155. This downgrade follows Amazon’s executives reports of weak demand for AMD’s AI accelerators and led to a decline in AMD’s stock today. 12/6/2024 AMD’s stock price has gone down today. This decrease followed an Amazon executive’s report that the company hasn’t observed enough demand for AMD’s AI accelerators to warrant their sale through Amazon Web Services. 12/5/2024 Mizuho has lowered its price target for Advanced Micro Devices from $185 to $180, but still maintains a “Buy” rating on the stock. This revised target price suggests a potential upside of 26.64% from AMD’s current market price. 12/3/2024 Advanced Micro Devices stock declined 0.3% today, trading between $141.23 and $141.61. 11/27/2024 Advanced Micro Devices has solidified its commitment to Indian by inaugurating a new research and development center. This move aligns with the company’s previously announced $400 million investment in the country. 11/26/2024 Advanced Micro Devices is planning to acquire ZT Systems for $4.9 billion in a strategic move to bolster its position in the AI market and challenge Nvidia’s dominance. ZT Systems will bring expertise to AMD and encourage accelerated deployment of AI infrastructure at scale. 11/25/2024 Advanced Micro Devices is investing $400 million in India, highlighting the importance of its Bengaluru R&amp;D center to its global operations and India as a key market and vital hub for technological innovation and growth. 11/22/2024 Analysts at Zacks Research have increased their earnings estimates for Advanced Micro Devices from $2.37 to $2.47. Zacks Research also provided estimates for AMD’s earnings in the upcoming quarters and fiscal years. These estimates range from $0.81 per share in Q4 2024 to $4.63 per share in FY 2026. 11/21/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ shares decreased 1.4% today, trading as low as $134.93. 11/20/2024 Advanced Micro Devices’ stock declined slightly by 1.1% today, trading as low as $137.06. 5-10 Year Review A huge part of AMD’s success has been the Damocles sword decision to have all foundry work performed by Taiwan Semiconductor. After stints at IBM and Texas Instruments, Dr. Lisa Su became COO of AMD, assuming the CEO position in 2014. Soon afterwards, she started her overhaul of the company by splitting it into 2 divisions: Computing and Graphics, which includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. Dr. Su oversaw the release of the Radeon 300 and Fury series, the last of the Bulldozer derivatives, and then the RX 400 series of GPUs in 2016. Based on AMD’s Zen architecture, both Epyc for servers and workstations Ryzen for laptops and desktops debuted in 2017. They innovatively took multiple micro CPUs to work as a team for superior computing power and speed. Ryzen, in particular, took the computing world and Intel by surprise, as it catapulted AMD to previously uncharted levels. 2020 saw AMD announce the acquisition of Xilinx for its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). AMD would discontinue Xilinx production of its complex programmable logic devices (CPLD) in early 2024. Pensando Systems was added to AMD’s portfolio in 2022, with Mipsology to follow in 2023. On the AI front, 2023 saw AMD acquire Nod.ai, followed by Silo.AI, Europe’s largest private AI Lab, in 2024. Fiscal Year (Dec) Price Revenues Net Income 2015 $2.87 $3.991 B -($660 M) 2016 $11.34 $4.319 B -($498 M) 2017 $10.28 $5.253 B -($33 M) 2018 $18.46 $6.475 B $337 M 2019 $45.86 $6.731 B $341 M 2020 $91.71 $9.763 B $2.490 B 2021 $143.90 $16.434 B $3.162 B 2022 $64.77 $23.601 B $1.320 B 2023 $147.41 $22.680 B $864 M 2024 LTM (Jun 2024) $$162.21 $23.276 B $$1.354 B Key Drivers for AMD’s Stock in the Future Lisa Su’s release of AMD’s MI300 GPU has thrown down the gauntlet for AI to her cousin, CEO Jensen Huang of Nvidia, which controls close to 70% of the AI GPU market at present. AMD’s MI300 GPU (Graphics Processing Units) and similar products are addressing AI workloads for cloud computing, which is stirring up interest. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) are already using the MI300. As a result, AMD is now on the radar alongside other AI related stocks. The ZT Systems acquisition for $4.9 billion is a key building block of Lisa Su’s AI development strategy. By integrating ZT’s expertise in data center infrastructure, AMD will be able to offer complete AI solutions, encompassing hardware, software, and system-level integration. Therefore, AMD will soon provide a one-stop, comprehensive and integrated offering to clients seeking robust AI solutions. Data Center growth (already $2.3 billion sector revenues for AMD in Q1, +80% y-o-y), should continue to expand that area for the near and extended future. AMD 3D V-Cache chips will be an integral contributor to AMD-powered data center equipment. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating from over 40 Wall Street analysts is “buy/outperform” (31 buy, 7 outperform, 10 hold). Their average price target in 12 months is $186.91, which is 42.53% from the price today. 24/7 Wall Street’s 12-month projection for AMD’s price is $205.20, which would be a 48.31% increase. We believe Dr. Su’s goal of end-to-end AI utility is already underway, with AMD competing with Nvidia in a similar fashion and strategy to how it challenged Intel: with comparable or superior speed and performance for lower prices. AMD’s Next 5 Years’ Outlook The past 10-year median P/E ratio for AMD is 34.27. 24/7 Wall Street is using a more conservative P/E ratio of 30 for the following price predictions. These prices also preclude an invasion of Taiwan from China, which would understandably devastate chip manufacturing worldwide. For 2026, we predict a price of $237.12, which would be a 15.56% gain year-over-year. AMD’s acquisition of ZT Systems will be a significant contributor to Dr. Su’s AI development agenda. She anticipates that the AI accelerator and GPU chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. AMD’s Instinct and Epyc accelerators for machine learning will see a major boost in this surge. To follow up on the AI agenda, 2027 should benefit from ZT Systems’ software boost capabilities. During 2023-24, AMD invested more than $1 billion to improve its AI software capabilities and R&amp;D activities. AMD has already made three small software AI-related acquisitions (Silo AI, Nod.ai, and Mipsology) to bolster its mid- and high-level software abstractions and help customers customize LLMs. Dr. Su and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang are blood-relative cousins, and their respective competitive drives and tech savvy make the AMD and Nvidia rivalry in AI all the more compelling when the different components are compared head-to-head. The 24/7 Wall Street price target for 2027 is $294.40. This would be a 24.16% gain year-over-year. 2028 should see AMD get an upswing from its ancillary markets. For example, AMD’s Ryzen is already a big part of the digital cockpits in the automotive market. Its partnerships with Daimler-Benz and Tesla will likely expand to other auto manufacturers as AI becomes more ubiquitous and demand escalates. Our price target is $306, a modest year-over-year gain of 3.94%. Edge computing would be another ancillary market for AMD that would benefit from AI. 2029 should see a boost in IoT applications using AMD-powered devices and digital architecture. AMD’s Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) will continue to expand, with its Epyc Milan X, the first MCM GPU, leading the way for a range of other configurations. The resulting bump would be a target price of $336, a 9.80% gain from the previous year’s price target. AMD Stock in 2030 AMD’s development of end-to-end AI computing is Dr. Lisa Su’s primary goal over the next decade. At present, no smartphone utilizes any AMD CPUs. Nevertheless, AMD has already announced the availability of Ryzen chips for mobile devices. By 2030, the growth of AI-powered mobile gaming should reach the point where the demand for Ryzen performance in smartphones by game-oriented users should see Ryzen-powered smartphones. This would be a huge boon for AMD, as the smartphone market is a major one that has long eluded it. The 24/7 Wall Street 2030 price target is $396.20. Year EPS P/E multiple Price 2025 $6.84 30 $205.20 2026 $7.90 30 $237.12 2027 $9.81 30 $294.40 2028 $10.20 30 $306.00 2029 $11.20 30 $336.00 2030 $13.21 30 $396.20 Get Ready To Retire (Sponsored) Start by taking a quick retirement quiz from SmartAsset that will match you with up to 3 financial advisors that serve your area and beyond in 5 minutes, or less.
