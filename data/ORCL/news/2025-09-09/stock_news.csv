Investors are seeking fairly priced stocks that still have the potential to continue growing and AI is no longer limited to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Those who invested in NVDA at the right moment have already made big gains. But if you’re looking for AI stocks to invest now, you need to be picky. Top AI stocks are either priced at a premium or face high expectations, which offer both risk and opportunities. NVIDIA failed to impress Wall Street with its Q2 earnings. Its data center revenue was slightly below consensus, and it reported a modest quarter. While the stock is up 25% in 2025, it is suffering due to elevated expectations. NVIDIA will continue to dominate the AI industry, but there are three other AI stocks worth loading up on. Here are three leveraged to AI that you should consider instead. --> --> Key Points If you&#8217;re looking for AI stocks other than Nvidia, here are the top three stocks soaring higher this year. These stocks are up over 20% in 2025 and have the potential to move upwards. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

Don&#8217;t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) --> --> Oracle Up 36% in 2025, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) stock is exchanging hands for $226. The company has benefited from the increased spending on cloud computing infrastructure and has a partnership with OpenAI. Besides the outsized gains in recent years, Oracle has had an excellent 2025. The company has turned into a complete ecosystem and is no longer restricted to a software database business. It started to build its own cloud services and offers AI powered database services. It also offers software-as-a-service for marketing, automating workflows, financial reporting, and more. A strong player in the cloud business today, Oracle is spending aggressively to capture the market. It reported a revenue of $15.9 billion in its Q4 financial results announced in June. Cloud revenue jumped 27% to $6.7 billion for the quarter, while total revenue for 2025 was up 8% to $57.4 billion. The management is aiming to achieve a 70% revenue growth in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure segment, and it is aiming for the total revenue to increase 16% to $67 billion in FY 2026. Its remaining performance obligations increased 41% to $138 billion. It shows the total value of the company’s unfulfilled contracts at the end of a period. A 41% jump is nothing but impressive. The company is already a part of the massive $500 billion Stargate project. Announced by OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and MGX, Oracle is the funder and technology partner. Stargate AI aims to invest $500 billion towards new data centres and infrastructure over the next four years. There’s a lot of space for the stock to show its strength and soar higher. Broadcom Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) supplies custom AI chips to three of the biggest tech giants- Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and TikTok owner ByteDance. Up 28% year-to-date, the stock is exchanging hands for $297 and has soared 94% in 12 months. The company makes AI and networking chips that ensure efficient and quick movement of data from one server to another. Its fundamentals are strong, and the company has seen a significant improvement in its market cap to $1.36 trillion. In the recent quarter, the AI revenue jumped 46% year-over-year to $4.4 billion, accounting for 30% of the total sales. The company&#8217;s management is aiming to generate $5.1 billion in AI revenue this quarter. Its networking division also benefits from the AI infrastructure demand. As companies continue to set aside billions of dollars for AI, Broadcom’s infrastructure becomes an integral part of their business. The scope of expansion is massive, and Broadcom is making the most of this opportunity. It is sitting at the intersection of custom chips, networking equipment, and integrated systems. While the stock isn’t cheap, it could be worth betting on. The company is set to report results on September 4, and we could see the stock rally. Analysts are bullish on the stock. Oppenheimer analyst has a price target of $325 with an Outperform rating while UBS has a price target of $345 with a Buy rating. AVGO is one of the top tech giants to keep on your radar. CoreWeave A new AI cloud services provider, CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV), has been making news after the expiration of its IPO lockup period. Up 157% in 2025, CoreWeave stock is exchanging hands for $103 and has reported robust quarterly results. The company has a market cap of $47 billion, and it rents out NVIDIA GPU-equipped servers. A fairly new name in the AI space, the stock has impressed investors, and this could be a start to a solid journey. In 2022, the company spent about $100 million to install Nvidia’s H100 GPU’s in its data centers, and then it used those as collateral to secure funding to open more data centres. The strategy impressed tech giant Nvidia, which invested $100 million in the company in 2023 and another $250 million in the IPO this year. This is NVIDIA&#8217;s single biggest investment in the stock and has garnered attention from many. CoreWeave has 33 data centers in the U.S. and Europe, and top customers include Meta, OpenAI and IBM (NYSE: IBM). The growing expenses have led to wide losses, and analysts expect the company to continue reporting net losses this year. In the recent quarter, it posted a loss of 60 cents per share versus $1.62 per share loss reported a year earlier. CoreWeave saw a 206% jump in revenue to $1.21 billion, beating expectations. For the full year, it has raised guidance by $250 million to $5.25 billion. Unlike bigger AI companies, which offer a range of computing and storage services, CoreWeave only focuses on one service- providing cloud-based GPUs for processing AI tasks. It enjoys an early mover advantage, has an impressive client base, and the potential to grow at a rapid rate.

Jobs Market Slumps -- or Slumped Sep 9, 2025 11:18 AM Live A new report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reveals that reported jobs gains from April 2024 through March 2025 were accidentally overstated by nearly 1 million. 911,000 total fewer jobs, than were described in the monthly reports, were actually created over the course of this year. This was the biggest flub in jobs numbers &#8220;since at least 2000,&#8221; reports Marketwatch. And more recent reports suggest the situation&#8217;s getting worse as 2025 progresses. Long story short, the economy&#8217;s getting weaker, and the chances of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut are getting stronger. Microsoft Has a New Friend Sep 9, 2025 10:58 AM Live Dutch tech company Nebius (Nasdaq: NBUS) announced today that it will lease a new data center in Vineland, New Jersey to Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) for five years and $17.4 billion. Nebius stock is up more than 37% on the news, albeit it says it will need to take on debt and use revenue from the contract to finance construction of the data center, which will open for business this year and expand its capacity through 2026. The Voo is now down 0.1%. Oracle Upgraded Sep 9, 2025 10:19 AM Live Speaking of Oracle, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman raised his price target on Oracle stock to $275 with an outperform rating this morning. Oracle&#8217;s alliance with with OpenAI gives the stock durable AI demand, says Bachman, which should drive growth acceleration through fiscal 2028. Oracle stock, though, is down 0.7% ahead of earnings. The Voo is still up, but only barely &#8212; 0.03%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. A Congressional Budget Office report last month predicted that if implemented fully, President Trump&#8217;s several announced tariffs on imports into the U.S. could cut the nation&#8217;s debt by a combined $4 trillion over the next 10 years. Or&#8230; not. Two U.S. courts of appeals have in recent days declared the Trump tariffs illegal, and ordered monies collected pursuant to the tariffs refunded to their payers. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says the rulings threaten to cost the U.S. Treasury as much as $1 trillion in funds through June, worsening the budget deficit and adding to U.S. debt. The White House has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on the issue. Meantime, investors seem unconcerned &#8212; maybe even a bit optimistic that repealing the tariffs, which represent a tax hike on U.S. importers and consumers &#8212; could provide a boost to the economy, a boost potentially turbocharged by expected Federal Reserve interest rate cuts later this month. The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) is up 0.1% premarket. Earnings Earnings season is basically over at this point, although Yahoo! Finance lists a few well-known names scheduled to report Tuesday. Tonight after close of trading, investors will tune in for the latest earnings news from AeroVironment (Nasdaq: AVAV), GameStop (NYSE: GME), and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). Drones manufacturer AeroVironment is forecast to earn $0.34 per share in its fiscal Q1 2026 report. Oracle should do even better, earning $1.48 per share for its fiscal Q1 2026. Wall Street analysts expect GameStop, however, to report an $0.08 per share loss for its fiscal Q2 2025.

Still, MSFT is up more than 44% since its year-to-date low on April 8. The company&#8217;s reported strong Q2 earnings on July 30. The Magnificent Seven mainstay reported EPS of $3.65 versus analysts&#8217; expectations of $3.35, while quarterly revenue came in at $76.44 billion. MSFT is now up 19.42% this year. In August, Truist raised its price target on Microsoft to $675 from $650 while keeping a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. That follows price target upgrades that came in July. Citi raised its price target on Microsoft to $613 from $605 while keeping a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. Piper Sandler raised its price target for MSFT to $600 from $475 while keeping an &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating. On June 5, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 33% in FY25 Q3, driven by AI services. When the company last reported earnings, it announced that total revenue rose 13% to $70.1 billion and it generated earnings of $3.46 per share, beating estimates of $3.22 per share. Despite a $800 million charge in Q1 from its investment in General Motors&#8216; (NYSE:GM) Cruise robotaxi initiative that the automaker subsequently shutdown, Microsoft’s focus on AI and cloud resilience continues to fuel optimism. However, its decision in May fire 6,000 employees — or 3% of its workforce — signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth. --> --> Key Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms. Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines. If you’re looking for an AI stock early in the AI growth cycle, grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. It has a software stock that could ride dominance in AI to returns of 10x or more. --> --> Why Invest in Microsoft Microsoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S. Its Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon&#8216;s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. When Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20. Microsoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect Q4 capex to remain elevated at $16 billion to $17 billion to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth. Tariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&amp;D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year. Beyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft&#8217;s AI and cloud momentum. Microsoft As a Stock Broadly, Wall Street analysts&#8217; remain bullish, with 33 of 34 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, one assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and zero assigning it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Wall Street&#8217;s price targets cover a significant range, spanning $550 per share on the low end to $680 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $626.88, which represents 22.60% potential upside from today&#8217;s share price. Institutional ownership currently stands at 72.93%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $550 7.57% Median $626.88 22.60% High $680 32.99% Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s 33% Azure growth and 20% cloud revenue increase in Q3 position it for AI market gains.
