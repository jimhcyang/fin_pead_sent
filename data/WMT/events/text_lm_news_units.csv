A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 22, 2021. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience or resources. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 3 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020 founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Walmart knowingly filled prescriptions that were issued by so-called “pill-mill” prescribers; (2) Walmart filled thousands of prescriptions that showed obvious red flags, including highly-dangerous cocktails of drugs, (3) Walmart’s managers made it difficult for Walmart pharmacists to comply with their legal obligations by pressuring them to fulfill as many orders as possible; (4) hence, Walmart’s pharmacy revenues were inflated because the Company filled thousands of invalid prescriptions in violation of the Controlled Substance Act dispensing requirements; (5) the aforementioned conduct would subject Walmart to regulatory scrutiny; and (6) as a result, defendants’ statements about Walmart’s business, operations and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Walmart class action, go to http://www.rosenlegal.com/cases-register-2014.html or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email pkim@rosenlegal.com or cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--With the catastrophic storms, power outages and water shortages affecting Texas, Tennessee, Louisiana and Mississippi, Walmart, Sam’s Club and the Walmart Foundation are committing up to $1 million in cash and in-kind product donations to help with response efforts. As part of the commitment, funds will support Feeding Texas’ emergency response efforts in Houston, San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, the Rio Grande Valley and other areas across the state impacted by winter weather. Food banks in these areas are working hard to set up critical distribution locations to connect those in need with food and essential items. Additionally, funds will also support response efforts in Tennessee, Louisiana and Mississippi. “Hundreds of thousands of Texans are going to turn to food banks in the days and weeks to come, on top of the millions already struggling to feed their families during the pandemic,” said Celia Cole, CEO of Feeding Texas. “We are grateful for the Walmart Foundation’s incredible generosity during these challenging times. This donation will help Texas food banks keep their communities nourished and resilient through this crisis.” Walmart is tracking the winter weather across the country in real time and has activated its Emergency Operations Center at the Walmart Home Office to support associates in the field. During times of disaster, the company’s priority is the safety of associates, helping those displaced and affected by the storms. Walmart has also dedicated emergency support teams helping stores get much needed supplies and products in stock and on shelves as quickly as possible. “This extreme winter weather is leaving our associates, customers and communities without heat, water and electricity, the basic services we all depend on every day,” said Dan Bartlett, executive vice president of corporate affairs for Walmart Inc. “We gladly leverage our resources to help these hard-hit communities, and we stand with Texas and all those affected.” Walmart has a long history of providing aid in time of disasters, helping communities prepare and recover by donating emergency supplies, such as food and water, home, and personal products. Since FY2017, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation have donated more than $58 million in cash and in-kind donations to support disaster preparedness and relief efforts. About Walmart Walmart Inc.

Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm’s site: www.bgandg.com/wmt. This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that throughout the class period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company knowingly filled prescriptions that were issued by so-called ""pill-mill"" prescribers; (2) the Company filled thousands of prescriptions that showed obvious red flags, including highly-dangerous cocktails of drugs, (3) the Company’s managers made it difficult for Walmart pharmacists to comply with their legal obligations by pressuring them to fulfill as many orders as possible; (4) hence, the Company’s pharmacy revenues were inflated because the Company filled thousands of invalid prescriptions in violation of the Controlled Substance Act dispensing requirements; (5) the aforementioned conduct would subject the Company to regulatory scrutiny; and 6) as a result, Defendants’ statements about Walmart’s business, operations and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--To drive higher vaccination rates in vulnerable communities by improving access to the COVID-19 vaccine, Walmart is creating a series of community events to administer the COVID-19 vaccine across the country. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is providing Walmart with allocation of the vaccine for this new effort, which Walmart is launching in partnership with local community leaders and nonprofit organizations. These new events mark an expansion of Walmart’s role with the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program and are supplementing Walmart’s ongoing vaccination program at more than 1,400 pharmacies nationwide in 35 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., through federal and state efforts. Walmart selected many of the new locations after an analysis of area demographics, local health needs and gaps in critical access to medical services, to pinpoint communities where Walmart can make the greatest impact for populations most in need. The community vaccine events will take place at 43 locations across 18 states, including drive-thru locations in Walmart parking lots, in-store and across several offsite locations in partnership with community organizations such as Casa del Inmigrante/Immigrant Home Foundation, a nonprofit serving immigrants in Las Vegas, Nevada; the Indianapolis Urban League in Indiana; and Jackson Housing Authority and Wishrock at the Golden Key Envision Center in Jackson, Mississippi. “We have two goals as we administer vaccines: first, to reach as many people as possible to enable reopening efforts, and second, to ensure equitable vaccine distribution across the communities we serve. We have focused most of our events in medically underserved neighborhoods, and we are proud to play a part in increasing access to the vaccine in these communities,” Dr. Cheryl Pegus, executive vice president, Health & Wellness, said. “We will continue to engage within our communities to find new ways to reach additional customers with our vaccination programs as we work towards the eventual end of the pandemic.” Walmart plans to continue these new events over the next several weeks as vaccine allocations allow and is currently planning them in the following states: Alabama Colorado Florida Georgia Idaho Indiana Louisiana Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Nevada Oklahoma Pennsylvania South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Virginia Vaccine supply and eligibility will vary based on state and local guidelines. Eligible customers can schedule a vaccine appointment at Walmart through its digital scheduler at www.walmart.com/COVIDvaccine. Appointments are limited and will be updated as vaccine allocation allows. In addition to scheduling appointments, the digital scheduler will provide a reminder when it is time for customers to return for their second dose of the vaccine. Walmart will continue to share new updates on its role in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout at corporate.walmart.com/covid-vaccine. About Walmart Walmart Inc.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Walmart is making it easier for customers to get the items they want at the lightning-fast speed they may need them. Beginning today, the retailer is removing the $35 minimum order requirement for Express delivery. Express delivery allows customers to order items from Walmart’s food, consumables and general merchandise assortment such as produce, pantry staples, everyday essentials, toys and electronics. It relies on the retailer’s team of 170,000 trained personal shoppers who pick customers’ orders. Like Walmart’s pickup and delivery service, there is no markup on items – an item is priced the same as it is on the shelf. Express delivery costs $10 on top of the existing delivery charge. Walmart+ members simply pay the $10 Express fee. “Many customers use Express delivery for when they’re in a pinch, whether it be a missing ingredient for a weeknight dinner or a pack of diapers,” said Tom Ward, senior vice president of customer product. “Customers told us sometimes the items they needed in a hurry didn’t meet the minimum, so we’re removing it, making it even easier for customers to get what they need when they need it.” Express delivery is currently offered in nearly 3,000 Walmart stores, reaching nearly 70% of the U.S. population. It is one of several no-contact pickup and delivery options. The below options continue to carry a $35 minimum: Pickup: Free curbside pickup that lets customers reserve the time and pickup location that’s most convenient for them. Delivery: Orders from our store to a customer’s door with a per delivery fee of $7.95 or $9.95. Free Delivery with Walmart+: Delivery as soon as same day – and other benefits – for a $98 annual or $12.95 monthly fee. To get started, customers can go to walmart.com/grocery or the Walmart app and search their ZIP code to see if Express delivery is offered in their area. About Walmart Walmart Inc.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Walmart is announcing a strengthened commitment to American jobs and communities, with a goal of investing $350 billion in the future of U.S. manufacturing over the next 10 years. The retailer estimates that this spend will support more than 750,000 new American jobs.1 In 2013, Walmart made a commitment to invest $250 billion in products made, grown, or assembled in America. Walmart is on track to deliver on that commitment – and expand on it with today’s announcement. “U.S. manufacturing really matters,” said John Furner, President & CEO, Walmart U.S., who made the announcement at Techtronic Industries (TTI) in Anderson, S.C. “It matters to our suppliers, to entrepreneurs and to the environment. It matters to our customers – more than 85 percent of which have said it’s important for us to carry products made or assembled in the U.S. And most of all, because of the jobs it brings, it matters to American communities and the people who live in them.” Walmart has identified six priority categories on which to focus its investment: textiles; plastics; small electrical appliances; food processing; pharmaceutical and medical supplies; and Goods Not For Resale (GNFR). The impact of this commitment goes beyond products and jobs. It could result in an estimated reduction of as much as 100M metric tons of CO2 emissions avoided by sourcing closer to customers,2 as well as an increase in spending with diverse suppliers based in the U.S. In addition, Walmart will launch a new concept called “American Lighthouses,” with the goal of supporting U.S. manufacturing in a sustainable, long-term way. The retailer plans to unite key stakeholders in specific regions of the country to identify and overcome barriers to U.S. production. These Lighthouses will bring together participants from the supplier community, including manufacturers and NGOs, as well as others from academia, government, and local economic development groups. Walmart’s announcement drew bipartisan support from federal officials who represent states that are home to Walmart suppliers. “It is an honor to have Walmart’s CEO John Furner launch the company’s 10-year investment from TTI’s Anderson, South Carolina, facility,” said U.S. Senator Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina. “I am passionate about bolstering the American supply chain and creating more high-paying jobs in South Carolina and for folks all across the country. Congratulations and thank you to Walmart for the great impact you will continue to make on our nation’s economy.” “I want to congratulate Walmart on increasing its commitment to U.S. manufacturing,” said U.S. Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, home to Zenith Home Corp./Maytex manufacturing. “Zenith/Maytex manufactures and assembles home fashion products we can see on store shelves in our local Walmart, and the company has been able to strengthen its operations with help from the Delaware Manufacturing Extension partnership. We’re proud that Zenith’s story of investing in the U.S. is one today’s announcement aspires to replicate across the country.” About Walmart Walmart Inc.

BENTONVILLE, Ark. & ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--To help the millions of Americans who are experiencing financial hardship as a result of COVID-19, Walmart and AT&T are working together to offer eligible customers select home internet and wireless plans via AT&T PREPAID and Cricket Wireless for little or even no cost. These offers are available through the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program (EBB),1 and customers can find eligible plans on Walmart.com and in more than 2,300 Walmart stores across the country. If signing up for an eligible plan at Walmart, customers must complete their EBB enrollment with AT&T PREPAID or Cricket. EBB is a temporary federal government program that provides eligible customers a temporary benefit of up to $50/mo. on eligible home internet or wireless service. Eligible households on qualifying Tribal lands can receive a benefit of up to $75/mo. Leaders from Walmart and AT&T reiterated their commitment to making the internet more accessible to all Americans, especially those most impacted by the pandemic. “The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the digital divide in America as many underserved households were unable to afford broadband connectivity to work from home or enable their children to participate in remote learning. Through our collaboration with AT&T, we are staying true to our mission and making this important resource available to our customers at an affordable price,” said Mehrdad Akbar, vice president of wireless and photo services, at Walmart U.S. “This isn’t a problem that was created overnight, nor will it be solved quickly, but every step in the right direction helps.” “This past year dealt a financial blow to many Americans. To help address this, Walmart and the AT&T Prepaid Portfolio are teaming up to support the communities we serve and do our part in helping to bridge the digital divide that exists across the country,” said John Dwyer, President of the AT&T Prepaid Portfolio (includes Cricket Wireless). “Offering plans eligible for the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program to eligible customers is just another way we can work together to make life easier for those who have been financially impacted over the past year.” If you’ve been financially affected by COVID-19 or currently participate in financial assistance programs such as SNAP or Medicaid, you could be eligible for temporary relief on an AT&T PREPAID or Cricket Wireless plan. Customers who qualify for the EBB program have multiple options to find the best plan for their needs. Families on the move or working at home can connect to the internet with a mobile hotspot device on a data-only plan. The mobile hotspot with a data-only plan delivers internet access to up to 15 Wi-Fi enabled devices like a computer, a tablet, and more. If what you need is voice service and wireless internet access on your phone, then a smartphone plan is a great choice.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sam’s Club today announced the return of its sampling and demo program, Taste & Tips. Officially re-launching this week, Taste & Tips allows members to sample food and review products when they visit the club. Initially, Taste & Tips will take place on the weekends and in limited quantities, using new safety measures, such as sealed samples. Sam’s Club’s sampling program has been an attraction in clubs for more than 35 years, but it was paused last March out of concern for the health and safety of members and associates during COVID-19. “Over the past year, our members’ shopping behaviors have evolved,” said Megan Crozier, Chief Merchandising Officer, Sam’s Club. “Today, more than ever, members want to do more than just shop when they come to our clubs – they want to have an experience. In addition to the return of Taste & Tips, we’ve planned new, immersive sampling experiences that add even more excitement to our clubs.” One such experience is the first-ever Member’s Mark Summer Eats Food Truck. It will tour the central United States this summer, giving members a chance to experience the quality of Sam’s Club’s private brand, Member’s Mark. The event will take sampling out of the club and into the parking lot with a food truck serving up hearty helpings of popular Member’s Mark foods, like Member's Mark Angus Beef Cheeseburgers, Member’s Mark Baked Beans with Brisket and Member’s Mark Double Dipped Mini Ice Cream Bars. Additionally, Sam’s Club is testing new ways to sample items, such as roaming events that bring sampling directly to members as they checkout, visit the member services desk or use Sam’s Club Curbside Pickup. Sampling is available at all of Sam’s Club’s nearly 600 clubs in the United States. To find a location, visit www.SamsClub.com. About Sam’s Club Sam's Club®, a division of Walmart Inc.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Walmart is helping America stay healthy this flu season by making it easier than ever to get flu shots, so we can all do our part to keep our communities safe. Low-cost flu shots are now available in 4,600+ Walmart pharmacies nationwide via walk-up and community flu shot clinics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends everyone aged six months and older receive a flu shot each year. Further, the CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccination for everyone aged 12 and older, especially as cases are on the rise. Walmart pharmacies across the country offer both vaccines, and customers can receive a low-cost flu and free COVID-19 vaccine at the same time, if they choose. “It’s important we don’t let our guard down with our health this fall. Between COVID-19 vaccines and the annual flu shot, we know people may be experiencing ‘vaccine fatigue,’ but these preventive measures have never been more vital to keeping our communities healthy,” Del Sloneker, senior vice president and chief operating officer, Health and Wellness, said. “It’s on all of us to do our part and is just another way we’re making it simple to live better, healthier lives.” Walmart’s flu shots are administered by certified pharmacists and health care professionals who are trusted members of their communities and understand local health needs. In addition to just being able to walk-in, Walmart also continues to have a variety of initiatives in place to make it easy to get vaccinated while following COVID-19 safety protocols, including hosting flu shot clinics in select markets. These events will make it quick, easy and convenient for customers to get flu shots in stores nationwide. Walmart is a center of well-being in the communities it serves and has everything busy families need to live better, healthier, lives this flu season. This includes our pharmacists who can answer any medication related questions, COVID-19 tests, prescription and over-the-counter medication, as well as a variety of immunizations, including COVID-19, flu, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), varicella (chicken pox), HPV, tetanus, whooping cough (TDAP) and more. In addition, we have low-cost grocery items, ranging from immunity boosting foods to soup and comfort foods. Customers with a Walmart+ membership can also get free shipping on store purchases and reduced prices on select prescriptions.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Click here to view digital blog post and press kit By Dan Bartlett, Executive Vice President, Corporate Affairs Many of the decisions we make at Walmart require us to ask a host of complicated questions. But occasionally, we find ourselves in a position to ask one simple question: How can we help? We’ve watched with the rest of the world as events unfold in Afghanistan. There are thousands of human lives at stake. They belong to generations of Afghan people whose history and culture are inextricably tied to the American men and women who have served in Afghanistan over our decades-long involvement there. Throughout Walmart’s history, serving people and communities has been at the center of everything we do. We’re proud that our associates reflect the communities we serve, and we’ve heard from members of those communities – including Afghan and veteran associates – that they’re ready to help. Here’s how: We’re looking to the cross-cultural experience of our veteran and Afghan associates to support refugees, service members and one another, as veteran leaders at Walmart explore ways to support these efforts. We’re offering options for customers to get involved. And the Walmart Foundation is committing $1 million to three nonprofits supporting Afghan refugees entering the U.S., as well as veterans and their families. I know that for anyone who has traveled to Afghanistan, or worked with its citizens, what we’re witnessing is difficult. Afghan nationals have served alongside U.S. troops as translators, emissaries and soldiers in a fight against terror. These are people who have directly saved American lives, and now, we’re trying to help facilitate their access to some part of the freedom and future we’ve spent so long working toward together. To the thousands of our associates who have served, we’re here to listen and provide support. But we’ll also look to your proven leadership. Many of you have a unique understanding of Afghanistan and its people. It’s our hope that through a shared experience, you can help one another, as you have before. To our customers, we know that many of you are looking for opportunities to help those in need too. We’re working closely with nonprofits that are supporting the refugee crisis, and military veterans and families, to stand up registries on Walmart’s Registry for Good. Through the $1 million committed, the Walmart Foundation will support three organizations in aiding incoming refugees, as well as veterans and their families. No One Left Behind and the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service will continue their work with special immigrant visas (SIV), providing support as refugees enter the country. And the Tragedy Assistance Program For Survivors (TAPS) will increase the capacity of its National Military Survivor Helpline, which provides 24/7 support for veterans, military spouses and family members of America’s fallen heroes. We can help make a difference for Afghanistan’s refugees, our veterans and their families. Walmart’s purpose calls us to it. In moments of crisis, we support our communities – not just physical places, but the people who carry their culture. Walmart stands ready to continue that commitment in the weeks and months to come. Together, we must continue asking: How can we help?

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--By Dr. John Wig, Chief Medical Officer, Walmart For months, Walmart and Sam's Club pharmacies nationwide have been administering COVID-19 vaccines as we work to keep our communities safe and healthy. I joined Walmart at the beginning of August because of the tremendous impact the company has on supporting and caring for our communities during the pandemic. I’m proud to support the teams as we’ve expanded our vaccinations to include third doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for immunocompromised individuals, along with our low-cost flu shots. We stand ready to administer booster shots this fall once recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the coming weeks. Third Shot vs. Booster Shot: Which One Is Right for You? There are two different types of “3rd doses” of the COVID-19 vaccines: an additional vaccine dose and a booster shot. An additional vaccine dose can help increase the immune response in immunocompromised individuals who are less able to fight infections and are more vulnerable to infections like the COVID-19 virus. The Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, which both require two shots, are the only vaccines authorized at this time to be administered as a third dose to people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised. A booster shot is a dose of vaccine administered when the initial immune response has begun to fade. This booster shot is what you’re currently hearing about as likely being necessary to prolong the protections and maximize the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines. As cases of the highly contagious Delta variant and hospitalizations continue to rise, medical experts are recommending booster shots, based on data that shows waning immunity around six to eight months after the second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. More data is needed on booster shots tied to the J&J vaccine, which is expected in the next few weeks. While Walmart and Sam's Club pharmacies are currently administering third doses to immunocompromised individuals, we will only administer booster shots to eligible fully vaccinated Americans once recommendations have been issued by the CDC and FDA. Focusing on solutions As we prepare to administer millions of booster shots, we will continue to focus on solutions that make it as easy as possible for our customers to get vaccinated. We have already shown we can make a real difference in our communities through our non-profit, community-based and state and local government partnerships to improve access to the vaccine. We’ve conducted more than 600 community vaccine clinics to date in partnership with local organizations, to help us reach communities and get more shots in arms, especially for those most vulnerable and at risk. Interested customers can find more information by visiting Walmart.com/covidvaccine. More Americans than ever are getting vaccinated. We continue to see increases in new vaccinations across Walmart stores, and according to the CDC, nearly 203 million people have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, while more than 171 million are fully vaccinated. Additional vaccinations in the form of a third dose or a booster shot is standard for many other vaccines and can help extend the protections and benefits of the initial vaccination. Here to Help Our pharmacies nationwide are here to help, as we have been throughout the pandemic, and we will continue to administer vaccines. Together, we can successfully meet the challenges of the pandemic, but it’s important we don’t let our guard down as we enter this new stage. Please do your part: Get vaccinated, and get your booster shot once you are eligible. I know I and my family will, and I’ll be proudly standing with my Walmart and Sam's Club colleagues as we work to administer vaccines to our communities across the country.",651.0,334.0,5.0,6.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.014970059880239521,0.017964071856287425,0.011976047904191617,0.0,0.0029940119760479044,-0.0029940119760479044

LANCASTER, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Walmart announced plans to build two new high-tech facilities in the Dallas-Fort Worth area to support the retailer’s growing supply chain network — a 1,500,000 square-foot automated fulfillment center, set to open in 2023, and 730,000 square-foot automated grocery distribution center, set to open in 2024, are among Walmart’s largest automated fulfillment and distribution centers. The new Lancaster-based facilities will create approximately 1,000 full-time jobs across the region. 40 percent of the new jobs created will require STEM skills to support technical positions. The facilities will play a critical role in Walmart’s supply chain to deliver on the retailer’s promise to get customers the items they want when they want them. Through the combination of Walmart associates and automation technology, the high-tech facilities will move more than two times the volume of a traditional fulfillment and grocery distribution center all while improving the accuracy, quality and speed of the fulfillment and distribution of products. “Walmart is excited to welcome two new high-tech facilities in the Dallas-Fort Worth area to our expanding supply chain network,” said Joe Metzger executive vice president, supply chain operations at Walmart U.S. “These high-tech facilities will include game-changing innovations that are radically disrupting the supply chain, getting products onto store shelves and items shipped to our customers even faster, while saving time for our associates.” “We are making a significant investment in this region because of the inclusive, diverse and qualified pipeline of local talent that reflect Walmart’s values,” said Karissa Sprague, SVP of supply chain human resources at Walmart U.S. “Our investment in technologies and high-tech facilities today pave the way for jobs of the future that are supported by automation and will allow opportunities for an upskilled workforce.” Walmart’s high-tech facilities are part of a larger investment the retailer announced earlier this year to double down on the use of automation technology in its supply chain. It comes just months after the retailer announced its plans to add automation in more than half of its regional distribution centers and automated market fulfillment centers in select stores. The retailer has also made investments in drones and autonomous vehicles to support last mile deliveries. “I, along with my colleagues on the Lancaster City Council, are excited to be working with Walmart as they construct two facilities simultaneously within our community. We look forward to this project bringing more than 1,000 new jobs and helping boost our local economy with an increased daily population. This is a true example of my philosophy that “Positive, progressive partnerships, produce prosperity for all. ‘Working together in a collaborative atmosphere always benefits the whole,” said Clyde C. Hairston, Mayor of the City of Lancaster. “Walmart continues to bring economic viability to the fastest-growing industrial area in the country. We are glad that this new facility will anchor in the Dallas County Inland Port area. This investment is a boon for both Southern Dallas County and Northern Ellis County,” said John Wiley Price, Dallas County Commissioner. Walmart operates 19 distribution centers, 593 retail stores and employs 171,000+ associates in the state of Texas. In FYE 21, stores, clubs and the Walmart Foundation gave $129.2 million in cash and in-kind donations to local Texas organizations. In FY2021 (Feb. 1, 2020 – Jan. 31, 2021), Walmart sourced more than $13.10 billion in goods and services from 2,899 diverse suppliers. And, in March 2021, Walmart Supply Chain launched its Supplier Inclusion Advisory Council to reimagine the retailer’s supplier inclusion initiative. Find out more about Walmart’s diversity and inclusion efforts in the company’s FY2022 Culture, Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Mid-Year Report. Walmart supply chain positions qualify for benefits, a quarterly incentive program and access to a free college degree through Walmart’s Live Better U, which in October 2021, added three leading Historically Black Colleges and Universities in partnership with Guild Education.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sam's Club continues to deliver on its promise to Bring the Merry this holiday season. Last week, Sam’s Club, Laugh Out Loud and Kevin Hart celebrated five organizations making a big difference in children’s lives by surprising them with $100,000 each through a series of virtual and in-person announcements across the country. In addition to the monetary contribution, select families and children benefitting from the organizations were also surprised to have a unique holiday wish – from laptops to karaoke machines to dollhouses – fulfilled by the trio. The organizations that received the donations are Special Needs Network of Los Angeles, Calif., Houston Child Advocates of Houston, Texas, Boys & Girls Club of Springfield, Mo., Positive Tomorrows of Oklahoma City, Okla., and Boys & Girls Club of Central Fla in Orlando. “One of the best things you can do for yourself is believe in other people,” said Hart. “I’ve always had people in my life that believed in me, and I believe in the power of passing that onto others. The donations we made went to organizations that believe in the future of kids and their families. I’m proud we were able to work together to make a big impact.” Known for bringing laughs on the big screen, Hart brought smiles to many from coast-to-coast in just a few short hours. In each market, families and children were gathered for what they thought was just holiday party organized by Sam’s Club, but they were surprised to dial in to a virtual call and find Hart on the other side of the line. Hart delivered news of the monetary donation and individual gifts on the calls, and Sam’s Club associates were on hand to deliver the items to recipients in person. Hart ended the day by surprising 10 families from the Special Needs Network at a Sam’s Club in Oxnard, Calif. with a holiday shopping spree at Sam’s Club. “These groups have an incredible impact on the communities and families they serve,” said Tony Rogers, senior vice president and chief member officer, Sam’s Club. ""It’s been an honor for us to work together with Kevin and Laugh Out Loud to recognize their work with gifts that allow them to further their missions.” Earlier this month, Sam’s Club, Hart and Laugh Out Loud announced plans to team up and take the holidays “to an 11” this year. The trio share a commitment to doing good in local communities, making this charity component of the holiday campaign a natural fit. About Sam’s Club Sam’s Club®, a division of Walmart Inc.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of Walmart’s mission to provide accessible and affordable, human-centered care while improving health equity and outcomes, the company has renewed its commitment on helping eradicate HIV/AIDS through education, access to testing and partnerships to raise awareness of available resources. The United States has set a goal to end the AIDS pandemic by 2030. This June 5, the world marked 40 years since the first five cases of what later became known as AIDS were officially reported and at least 32 million lives were lost. Today, on World AIDS Day, Walmart is part of the solution to addressing the health inequities of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and supporting solutions to change the course of HIV in the United States. “Walmart is committed to providing affordable access to care that is human-centered and makes real progress to address inequities in health care,” said Dr. John Wigneswaran, Walmart’s chief medical officer. “For patients with HIV and populations at greatest risk, Walmart can play an important role in understanding each individual and the unique challenges they face, and our pharmacists play an important role in the treatment paradigm, especially for patients with HIV who may be on a complex medication regimen. We are dedicated to optimizing health by designing best-in-class clinical programs addressing each step of the patient’s health care journey.” As part of this renewed commitment, Walmart has launched a community centered specialty pharmacy strategy building centers of clinical excellence in specific diseases. The first three centers, referred to individually as Specialty Pharmacy of the Community, provide customers with highly specialized pharmacy teams trained in HIV/AIDS medications, clinical services to recognize potential medication-related side effects and assistance to understand the unique needs of people living with HIV/AIDS. These centers will help with all aspects of care, including industry leading clinical programs, pharmacy services provided by HIV-trained pharmacists, enhanced care coordination, healthy lifestyle recommendations and finding emotional support services from our Community Health Workers. Today, the AIDS epidemic disproportionately impacts communities of color, especially in the South, where people are more likely to be diagnosed with HIV over the course of their lifetime than Americans living in other parts of the country. The epidemic also has a significant impact on the LGBTQ+ population, with half of Black gay men and a quarter of Latino gay men projected to be diagnosed with HIV within their lifetime. There are currently 250,000 people in the U.S. southern region who are living with HIV but lack access to treatment, indicating an urgent need for HIV testing, education, prevention, and resources in the area. Walmart and the Elton John AIDS Foundation announced in June that the organizations were working together to help accelerate the end of AIDS in America. On Dec. 1, the teams will host testing events for the third time, joining forces with AIDS Healthcare Foundation and Atlanta Harm Reduction Coalition to provide free HIV testing along with education materials and resources during four parking lot testing events at Walmart locations in Atlanta. The events will focus on expanding access to testing in local communities, a vital first step at effective prevention and treatment for people living with HIV. Walmart also announced, in November, the launch of the Elton John Eyewear, a new line of stylish, accessible eyewear, at both Sam’s Club and Walmart locations. The launch of Elton John Eyewear also furthers Walmart’s support of the Elton John AIDS Foundation’s mission. Walmart Inc. will donate a minimum of $1 million annually from the Elton John Eyewear collection to support the Elton John AIDS Foundation to increase HIV education and awareness and encourage individuals to take the first steps toward a healthier future.

This game-changing low fee marks another major milestone for the retailer as it remains committed to providing more inclusive and affordable financial solutions for all customers, including unbanked or underbanked households that rely on services like wire transfers for everyday money management. “We are thrilled to offer Walmart shoppers a convenient way to send money to their loved ones in Mexico at an incredibly low price,” said Julia Unger, vice president, Walmart Financial Services. “Our low-fee strategy demonstrates our commitment to continue improving the financial well-being of our customers around the world.” Today’s announcement builds on the momentum of the original Walmart2Walmart money transfer service between the U.S. and Mexico, launched in 2016. That service paused in 2018 while the company invested in lowering prices and boosting the infrastructure to power today’s new service. With remittances to Mexico up over 27% in 2021, Walmart’s relaunch of Walmart2Walmart Mexico is timely, enabling customers to use Walmart’s large network of stores to send money quickly and inexpensively at a time when cross-border payments are rapidly growing. “We are delighted to collaborate with Walmart on this exceptional service, which provides customers price benefits and easier access to fast, safe and guaranteed money transfers to Mexico,” said Juan Bianchi, CEO of Euronet’s Money Transfer Segment. “Thanks to Ria’s scalable capabilities, coupled with Walmart’s large footprint, we can help Walmart offer unrivaled value and convenience to Mexicans living in the U.S. and their families back home in Mexico.” Visit here for more information.

BENTONVILLE, Ark. & WILMINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Symbotic LLC, a revolutionary A.I.-powered supply chain technology company, and Walmart Inc. announced an expanded commercial agreement to implement Symbotic’s robotics and software automation platform in all 42 of Walmart’s regional distribution centers over the coming years. This is an expansion of Walmart’s prior commitment to deploy Symbotic Systems in 25 regional distribution centers. The end-to-end software-enabled high-density robotics platform plays a strategic role in supporting the retailer’s goal of modernizing its vast supply chain network and allows Walmart to transform its regional distribution centers to provide faster responsiveness to store orders, increased inventory accuracy and higher capacity for receiving and shipping freight to stores. The technology’s ability to build palletized loads of department-sorted inventory ultimately enables Walmart to get products onto shelves at its more than 4,700 stores more quickly, while also making one of the toughest aspects of supply chain work – material handling – safer and simpler. It also creates new, tech-enabled jobs, such as cell operator and maintenance technician, that offer widely applicable skills in robotics and technology. “The expanded partnership with Walmart substantiates how our technology is truly reinventing the traditional warehouse and distribution of consumer goods across the supply chain,” said Rick Cohen, Chairman, President and Chief Product Officer of Symbotic. “As a technology platform with deep roots in warehousing and distribution – our system addresses some of the biggest challenges of today’s complex supply chain, such as inventory agility, transportation cost and labor availability. Modernizing the warehouse allows consumers to get what they need faster and creates benefits for everyone including workers, customers and their local communities.” “The need for accuracy and speed in the supply chain has never been more visible, and we’re confident that now is the time to move even faster by scaling Symbotic’s technology to our entire regional distribution center network,” said David Guggina, Senior Vice President of Innovation and Automation, Walmart U.S. “Using high-speed robotics and intelligent software to organize and optimize inventory, the Symbotic System helps us get products to our customers quickly and seamlessly by revolutionizing how we receive and distribute products to stores.” Walmart has already begun embedding Symbotic’s technology in select regional distribution centers throughout its network. The retrofitting process of all 42 regional distribution centers is expected to be completed over the next 8+ years. The Symbotic System The Symbotic System is a first-of-a-kind automation technology platform with a wide range of business use cases. The company reinvented the traditional warehouse with an end-to-end system powered by a fleet of fully autonomous robots and A.I.-powered software. Combined with a unique high-density physical structure the system improves efficiency, accuracy and agility while reducing costs. Intelligent Symbotic software orchestrates a team of robots to receive, store and retrieve a virtually limitless number of SKUs.

LEBANON, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--This month, Walmart will open a high-tech consolidation center in Lebanon, Pa. The new 400,000 square-foot facility, located at 1625 Heilmandale Road, will bring nearly 1,000 additional jobs to the area, 500 of which were hired in advance. Once implemented, the facility’s automated technology can enable three times more volume to flow throughout the center and help Walmart deliver the right product to the right store, so customers can find the products they need. The Lebanon consolidation center will service all 42 regional distribution centers across the U.S., with plans to service fulfillment centers in the near future. This building will be the second of its kind in Walmart’s supply chain. The first, located in Colton, Calif., opened in 2019. Consolidation centers have a specialized role in moving products quickly on their journey to store shelves, and ultimately, the customer. Each has the ability to receive general merchandise items from suppliers in smaller freight loads, known in the industry as less than a truckload (LTL) and consolidate them into larger freight loads, known as full truckloads (TL). Then the product is shipped to regional distribution centers where it is sorted for distribution to stores. Suppliers will now be able to deliver merchandise to one singular location for consolidation versus shipping separate orders for each of the 42 regional distribution centers. This automation will unlock new benefits for suppliers through simplification of purchase order fulfillment, reduction of lead times and increased speed to customers. “We’ve made continued investments in our people, facilities and technology to ensure we have the right product, in the right place, at the right time,” said Mike Gray, senior vice president, supply chain operations at Walmart. “As part of these investments, the Lebanon facility will provide even more opportunities for small to medium sized suppliers who do not ship nationwide, the ability to provide product to all 4,700 Walmart stores.” Walmart’s growing modern supply chain network These high-tech consolidation centers support a broader focus on technology within Walmart’s supply chain. This year, the retailer announced plans to renovate all 42 regional distribution centers with automated technology. “Walmart is creating the future of supply chain—a modern system that pairs the latest in software and automation technologies, with a highly trained and specialized workforce of Walmart associates—to disrupt the industry as we know it,” said David Guggina, senior vice president of innovation & automation, Walmart U.S. “It’s an exciting time to join our second high tech consolidation center in Lebanon. At this facility, we’re implementing the technologies Walmart will continue to roll out throughout our supply chain network.” High-tech consolidation center brings careers to Lebanon Once staffed, Walmart will have 1,000 associates at the Lebanon consolidation center in roles ranging from Freight Handler to Operational Manager. Full-time positions qualify for Walmart’s total rewards and benefits plans, including medical, vision and dental insurance, 401(k) matching, paid time off, stock purchase plan and access to a 100% paid college tuition and books through Walmart’s Live Better U.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT): Third-quarter highlights: Company delivered strong revenue growth globally, with strength in Walmart U.S., Sam’s Club U.S., Flipkart, and Walmex. Total revenue was $152.8 billion, up 8.7%, or 9.8% in constant currency. Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 8.2% and 17.4% on a two-year stack. eCommerce growth was 16% and 24% on a two-year stack. Continued to gain market share in grocery. Sam’s Club comp sales increased 10.0%, and 23.9% on a two-year stack. Membership income increased 8.0% with member count reaching an all-time high. Walmart International net sales were $25.3 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 7.1%, negatively affected by $1.5 billion from currency fluctuations. Segment operating income led by double-digit growth for Walmex. Global advertising business grew over 30%, led by 40% at Walmart Connect in the U.S. and strength in Flipkart Ads. Consolidated gross profit rate declined 89 basis points, primarily due to markdowns and mix of sales in the U.S., an inflation-related LIFO charge at Sam’s Club, and the timing of Flipkart’s annual event, The Big Billion Days. Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 144 basis points due to charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid legal settlements. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 75 basis points, primarily due to strong sales growth and lower Covid-related costs. Consolidated operating income was $2.7 billion, a decrease of 53.5%, including the legal charges described above. Adjusted operating income was $6.0 billion, an increase of 3.9%. Adjusted EPS of $1.50 excludes the effects, net of tax, of $1.11 from net losses on equity and other investments and $1.05 from charges related to opioid legal settlements.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Walmart announced the launch of a new giving campaign as part of its Spark Good initiative, supporting local organizations across the country with up to $5 million going to nonprofits this holiday season. Between Nov. 25 and Dec. 25, the retailer is giving customers the opportunity to round up purchases, then donate the change to a favorite charity while shopping on Walmart.com and the Walmart app. Walmart will match customer contributions 1:1, up to $1 million ($2 million total including customer donations), so every dollar goes further. Spark Good Round Up, which launched this fall, allows customers to choose the approved nonprofit they’d like to donate to and set up easy recurring Round Ups on the Walmart app or online. To incentivize customers and nonprofits to take part in the campaign, Walmart is awarding up to 3,000 nonprofits a $1,000 grant when they receive 20 or more Spark Good Round Up donations, for a total contribution of up to $3 million. Participating is easy. After a customer checks out while shopping online or in the app, they will be prompted to search for a favorite charity for their round up donations. Customers can also go to Walmart.com/SparkGood and search for the charity of their choice to receive their Round Up contributions. “Last year, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation gave more than $1.5 billion in cash and in-kind donations to organizations around the world,” said Erin Hogue, a senior director of associate and customer engagement at Walmart. “Giving is in our DNA and it’s clear our customers feel the same. With this $5 million campaign, we’re not only amplifying our customers’ acts of giving through matching donations and grants, we’re also allowing our customers to tell us where they’d like the dollars to go.” The Spark Good Round Up campaign has a number of nonprofits – big and small – for customers to choose. But if a customer can’t find the local cause they want to support, they can send a referral link directly to the 501(c)(3) of their choice. Spark Good, Walmart’s newest giving initiative, brings the retailer’s nonprofit tools together under one umbrella. From local grant opportunities to registries for their most-needed items, Spark Good gives nonprofits one convenient place to work with Walmart in making a difference in local communities. Together, we can Spark Good this holiday season. To learn more, visit Walmart.org/SparkGood. About Walmart Walmart Inc.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Walmart and CareSource, a nonprofit, nationally recognized managed care organization, announced today it has entered into a unique agreement, to address racial health inequities. The three-year deal will leverage Walmart’s position as a retailer and provider of health and wellness services, and CareSource’s role in the administration and delivery of Medicaid, Medicare and other health plan benefits and services. The two companies will aim to cultivate innovative, evidence-based solutions to improve health outcomes in under-resourced and underserved communities where racial health inequities are widespread. “Our goal is to utilize our combined assets to create healthier individuals and communities,” said Walmart Vice President of Social Determinants of Health Warren Moore. “We’re trying to close the gaps in care and promote positive health behavior change through holistic, culturally sustaining, and high-quality health and wellness solutions. CareSource is the ideal partner to help bring this vision to life,” he continued. The partnership will begin in Ohio, with a focus on cardiometabolic conditions (heart disease, stroke, diabetes, hypertension). According to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control, heart disease, stroke and diabetes were among the top 10 leading causes of death in the state.1 To address this, the partnership will utilize Walmart’s in-store Community Health Workers to facilitate the completion of state-approved health risk and social needs assessments, and connect select CareSource members to community resources, life skills support, and health literacy education. Eligible CareSource members will receive monthly funds to spend on food, a Walmart + membership for no cost delivery, and access to tele-nutrition services to aid in improving their health outcomes. CareSource members will also be able to take part in CareSource Life Services®, which includes including CareSource JobConnect™, to provide a path to financial empowerment and improve both economic mobility and health outcomes. The two entities will also work together on a maternal and child health program to support positive lifestyle behavior change and improve maternal and child health outcomes in Georgia, the state with the second-highest maternal mortality rate in the country. Under the agreement, expecting mothers or mothers that are 12-months post-partum and enrolled in CareSource’s Georgia Medicaid managed care plan will have access to Walmart in-store Community Health Workers, a “directed spend” program providing monthly funds to spend on food, tele-nutrition services, tele-doula services and will receive a Walmart+ membership. “This partnership will address the major needs our members face, which are difficulty with transportation, access to healthy food, access to care and assistance with care coordination,” said CareSource Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer Dr. David Williams. Dr. David further stated, “We know providing additional support, such as an in-store community health worker, will create another access point to ensure our members have the resources they need, within a location they frequent. As a result of this relationship, we expect an immediate, positive impact in the lives of our members.” About Walmart Walmart Inc.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sam's Club®, a division of Walmart Inc. and a leading membership warehouse club, is announcing that real-time, intelligently retargeted display advertising is now available across tens of thousands of sites on the open web through Sam’s Club Member Access Platform (MAP). This feature — provided in partnership with The Trade Desk and LiveRamp (RAMP) — leverages first-party member data, advertiser data and AI-powered, real-time behavioral insights from Sam’s Club to make advertising campaigns smarter, more effective and more personalized. Advertisers have long been challenged to better optimize retargeting, but often wind up bombarding consumers with repetitive or irrelevant ads due to inaccurate and incomplete data. Sam's Club MAP is uniquely positioned to solve this challenge because it uses real-time, accurate data from registered Sam's Club members, including exact data on purchase history, demographics, recent purchases of similar items and basket size — data not available on other retail media platforms. As a result, MAP campaigns can deliver personalized ads in real time to members who’ve expressed interest in a product but have not yet made a purchase. And MAP campaigns are smart enough to stop serving ads to members — even when they are not on Sam’s Club properties — once the member makes a related purchase. “We’re obsessed with helping our members. We’ve all had the experience of seeing ads for items we have already purchased. Our solution allows us to avoid that irritation, creating a better member experience and greater efficiencies for brands. Advertisers are now able to target based on what we know members are actually in market for, right now,” said Austin Leonard, Head of Sales, Sam’s Club Member Access Platform. “We can then stop serving these members ads once they complete their purchase at any Sam’s Club or on any device. This is a unique solution brand partners have been waiting for and an additive experience for our members.” Advertisers are already excited about the feature. “We’ve been waiting a long time to be able to retarget using the real-time data that Sam’s Club has. This allows us to automate targeting, personalize messaging and create sophisticated media workflows that maximize the efficiency of our campaigns,” said Mic Zavarella, Vice President of Marketing at PepsiCo. This solution uses leading technology to make it easier for brands to feel comfortable investing in the platform, including automated audience building, onboarding and targeting. It brings scale, uniqueness and safe data clean room technology for all members and brands. With this new integration, Sam’s Club MAP is able to use The Trade Desk’s award-winning KOA Optimization technology to leverage AI and machine learning to optimize results in flight. Integrating with LiveRamp’s industry-leading data permissioning and access controls ensure safe and secure collaboration with MAP's supplier brands. MAP retargeting automatically connects ads to membership data and member behavior, delivering tangible results, including incremental ROAS (return on ad spend), all 3rd party verified by IRI. Advertisers are able to track those results, including iROAS, right up to the point of sale, by using MAP’s reporting feature. Sam’s Club MAP offers advertisers real-time retargeting for a variety of scenarios, including: A member has browsed a specific item on samsclub.com, or placed an item in their cart, but did not complete the purchase. A member visited a specific landing page, brand page or shelf page on samsclub.com, but did not make a purchase. A member placed an order online to be picked up in club but still plans to shop the club while they’re there – like many members do. MAP’s real-time retargeting allows advertisers with complementary products to deliver relevant ads between order placement and club check out effectively allowing advertisers to “Win the Second Cart”. “Retargeting is a tried and true tactic in the ecommerce and digital media world for Nestle Purina. We’re excited to see the power of omnichannel data come to retargeting that can drive both performance and brand awareness at scale,” said Tony DiMattia, Director and Head of Shopper Marketing at Nestle Purina. By eliminating irrelevant retargeting, Sam’s Club MAP improves the experience of members as they browse the open web. It also allows advertisers to use their spend more efficiently by not targeting members who are no longer in the market for their products. With these campaigns, advertisers are able to leverage data from omnichannel conversions, including those in-club and online, delivering greater incremental sales and improving the member experiences.

NEW YORK & BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Walmart and Citi are collaborating to introduce the Bridge built by Citi platform (“Bridge”) to Walmart’s 10,000 small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in their US-based supplier network. Bridge is a digital platform that connects SMBs with a diverse group of more than 70 lenders that provide qualifying businesses with loans of up to $10 million. Through a single loan request form, Walmart suppliers can interact with a broad group of lenders located across the United States. Once a request is submitted, the platform seamlessly connects suppliers with multiple potential lenders that can evaluate their requests. This provides for a more efficient loan process for both the suppliers and lenders and empowers suppliers by offering them greater choice, convenience, and access to capital. It also provides lenders with the potential to expand their reach beyond their immediate local market and diversify their lending businesses. In preparation for this launch, the platform’s lender base has grown from 18 banks in 2021 to more than 70 lenders nationwide currently on the platform. “At Walmart, we know small- and medium-sized businesses are the engine that drives the U.S. economy and local communities. Many diverse owned businesses also fit the small- and medium-sized business profile. As such we stand to strengthen our longstanding Supplier Inclusion offering through this specific opportunity,” said Jason Fremstad, Senior Vice President of Supplier Development at Walmart. “By leveraging the platform, our suppliers can have better access to the funding they need to expand their operations to reach and surpass their goals. Greater access to capital will help our suppliers continue to provide the products that our customers are looking for.” Working capital loans, commercial mortgages and other pre-shipment financing loans are among the potential loans extended by some of the lenders on the platform. Walmart has programs that help with post-shipment financing, but Bridge built by Citi has the potential to expand options available to qualifying suppliers. Bridge was developed to provide more inclusive access to capital while supporting innovative, digital-first solutions for SMBs. “Many small and medium-sized business owners don’t have a network of existing bank relationships – especially those operating in underrepresented communities,” said Rohit Mathur, Head of the Bridge built by Citi platform. “Bridge offers a modern and efficient way for Walmart’s U.S. suppliers to navigate the lending process and cultivate relationships with multiple lenders while helping them gain access to the capital that is essential for them to grow.” In preparation for engaging Walmart’s supplier network, Citi focused on increasing the number of Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) on the platform. Of the more than 70 lenders currently participating on the Bridge built by Citi platform, more than 20 are MDIs and four are women-owned institutions. In addition, 15 of the 20 Black-owned banks in the U.S. are lenders on the platform. Citi and Walmart are proud to help introduce suppliers to financial institutions that are committed to serving their communities and promoting racial and gender equity. M&F Bank in North Carolina has used the platform to source opportunities to lend hundreds of thousands of dollars to businesses they would not have found otherwise. “We’re proud to be part of a platform that enables us to connect with our target market in a more intentional and efficient way and are excited to now extend our reach to Walmart’s extensive supplier network,” says M&F Bank CEO James Sills. “By growing and diversifying our business mix, Bridge enables us to make even more of a positive impact on the communities we serve.” In addition to the introduction of Bridge built by Citi to Walmart suppliers, Walmart and Citi will also collaborate to provide suppliers with educational content to increase financial literacy. “At Citi, we are focused on delivering innovative solutions that create value for our clients and contribute to a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem. This includes our collaborations with clients and partners such as Walmart to identify optimal paths for the solutions we are creating,” says Emily Turner, Head of Business Development, Institutional Clients Group at Citi. Walmart suppliers can access the platform and review terms of use through a dedicated website: www.bridgebuiltbyciti.com/walmart. Note: Neither Walmart nor Citi have any influence in lending decisions, nor do they participate as lenders on the platform. Bridge helps to facilitate the establishment of an independent relationship between a prospective borrower and one or more lenders. About Walmart Walmart Inc.

BENTONVILLE, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Walmart opened its first high-tech Market Fulfillment Center in Arkansas at Store 100 located at 406 S Walton Blvd in Bentonville on Monday, underlining the retailer’s strategic move toward expanding the use of its stores as fulfillment centers to enhance the shopping experience for customers everywhere. The Market Fulfillment Center (MFC) is built within the store and is powered by a proprietary storage and retrieval system – named Alphabot. Walmart believes fulfillment through digitization and connecting its store and supply chain assets end to end will transform fulfillment. And along with it, customer satisfaction and associate opportunity. “This new order fulfillment system is truly game changing,” said Ryan Simpson, the store manager at Store 100. “Not only does it enhance the customer experience through quicker, more accurate online order fulfillment, it also provides us the runway to continue growing our business now and in the future.” Customers can expect to see the benefits of the MFC almost immediately. Market fulfillment centers will significantly increase the number of orders the store is able to fulfill in a day, promising faster fulfillment with lower substitutions. Walmart+ members have even more to look forward to with free unlimited delivery. It also improves the in-store shopping experience by freeing up associates to help customers shopping in-store. In addition to improving the customer and member experience, associates will also notice benefits from the new MFC. Associates can expect more time to focus on what’s important, including serving customers and supporting each other. In addition, working with the Alphabot system presents new leadership jobs in stores, like the newly created MFC Lead, and opportunities to learn and teach new tech-forward skills. “I love the MFC. The dedicated space allows us to concentrate on picking items for our online customers,” said Gilbert Giron, an MFC digital team lead at Walmart. “I feel confident that the items our associates are looking for are going to be there when a customer wants them. That makes me feel good, because I know our team is providing our customers with great service."" At the foundation of the new MFC is Walmart’s strategic use of technology to transform its stores, making the shopping experience better for customers. It also opens door to newly created ladders of opportunity that make Walmart a place where good jobs can turn into great careers. “We’re innovating toward an even better shopping experience every day, and on every platform,” said Prathibha Rajashekar, senior vice president of Innovation and Automation at Walmart. “To help our customers and associates live better, we’re using technology to help them save time. That leads to improved experiences for everyone, no matter how they shop – and moves our entire business forward in the process.” At its core a local business, Walmart is supporting its community in more than one way. The leadership team at Store 100 celebrated the opening of the MFC with a donation of $15,000 distributed among Bentonville High School, Bentonville West High School and Bentonville Schools Ignite Professional Studies Program. Their hope? Progress toward technological and educational development. The market fulfillment center in Bentonville, Arkansas is the first in the state. It’s the second nationwide, with the first being a proof of concept located at Store #2142 in Salem, New Hampshire. Walmart plans to continue opening MFCs in select stores in the coming years.

BENTONVILLE, Ark--(BUSINESS WIRE)--By Lorraine Stomski, Senior Vice President, Associate Learning & Leadership It’s hard to believe it has already been five years since Walmart launched its education program, Live Better U (LBU). The years have flown by, and the results are clear: LBU changes lives. Two numbers stand out: First, over the past five years, the company has saved associates nearly half a billion dollars in tuition costs, reflecting our commitment to create a path for every associate to learn and grow. We never want cost to stand in the way of an associate’s desire to excel in their career – that's why we’re proud to cover 100% of the cost of tuition and books for part-time and full-time Walmart and Sam’s Club associates, starting on their first day with us. Second: We’re excited to share that since LBU launched in 2018 in partnership with Guild, more than 104,000 Walmart and Sam’s Club associates have participated in LBU in the United States. And the best part is, we’re not done. This year, Walmart will add the University of Arkansas to the LBU academic partner list and expand LBU to associates in Canada. Like all areas of our business, we’re always listening to feedback and finding ways to improve. We’ve evolved Live Better U over the last five years based on important lessons learned and by listening to our associates, expanding our LBU offerings to include more than 70 programs today. For instance, we removed the initial $1 a day fee for associates in 2021 and saw a 66% increase in enrollment year over year. We’ve also added more programs to support growth in high-demand areas, such as supply chain. At the end of the day, it’s about giving our associates the skills to succeed both today and in the future. The LBU program is designed to meet associates wherever they are on their education journey. From foundational offerings like high school completion to short-form programs, including Business Analytics and Project Management, to college degrees, associates can access academic programs from 25 of the nation’s leading academic partners (soon to be 26 with the addition of the University of Arkansas) with proven track records of serving working adults. We’re looking forward to deepening our relationship with partners in Arkansas, where Walmart was founded and is headquartered, by welcoming the state’s flagship university, the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville into our family of partners. Offerings will include three bachelor’s degrees in supply chain management, marketing, and general business, and short-form programs in areas such as data science and purchasing fundamentals. Registration opens on June 20, 2023, for these classes. ""The University of Arkansas is thrilled to partner with Walmart and Guild to provide associates in our home state and across the country access to transformational learning programs to help advance their careers,"" said Charles Robinson, chancellor of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. LBU is just one ingredient in the culture of learning and opportunity at Walmart. Whether it’s a part-time associate who wants to earn a degree, a supply chain associate looking to become a Walmart driver, or a store manager who wants to take their leadership skills to the next level, Walmart is creating a path of opportunity for every associate. “Walmart has been a trailblazer for creating career opportunity, helping to set the bar for employers across the country,” said Rachel Romer, CEO and Co-Founder of Guild. “Over the past five years, our partnership has provided associates with life-changing access to education, skilling, and career mobility, helping to propel their personal and professional growth at Walmart. We’re inspired by the impact we’ve made together through Live Better U and all the potential the future holds.” For more information on Live Better U, visit livebetteru.com.",658.0,343.0,14.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.04081632653061224,0.0,0.008746355685131196,0.0,0.0029154518950437317,0.04081632653061224

SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF, which tracks the Dow Jones Index, has gained 6.4% so far this year. While most of the stocks in the ETF portfolio have been rising this year, we have highlighted five that have been leading the way higher. These are American Express Co., Walmart Inc., Amazon.com Inc., The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Merck & Co. Inc. The blue-chip index has outperformed in recent months, with the broadening out of the stock market rally beyond the tech sector. Cyclical stocks, banks and small-cap stocks have all shown an upward trend in recent weeks, powering the blue-chip index. Bouts of stronger earnings and stronger guidance from many mega-cap stocks also propelled the index (read: ETFs to Bet on Dow Jones' Longest Winning Streak of 2024).The reconstruction of the blue-chip index is also paying off. Amazon, which joined the index on Feb 26, provided a boost to the index after it reported blockbuster first-quarter 2024 results.

Investors looking to pad their passive income streams with high-yield dividend stocks have three excellent choices. If you have an extra $100 to invest, you could set yourself up with dividends from Realty Income (NYSE: O), Altria Group (NYSE: MO), or Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). All three of these dividend payers have long histories of steady annual dividend raises. Plus, they offer yields above 5% at recent prices. Nobody's expecting huge payout bumps from these well-established businesses. With strong advantages against competitors, though, there's a good chance they can maintain their payout-raising streaks long enough to fuel your retirement dreams. Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that leases commercial property to well-established organizations such as Walmart, Dollar General, and Tractor Supply Company. At recent prices, the stock offers a 5.6% dividend yield plus a couple of features its shareholders appreciate. Realty Income makes monthly dividend payments, and you never need to wait long for a raise. This REIT raises its payout every quarter and recently announced its 125th payout bump since becoming a publicly traded company about 30 years ago. Grocery stores, dollar stores, and home improvement stores have ups and downs, but they aren't likely to go belly up during economic downturns. Plus, their physical locations are likely to remain relevant despite an ongoing shift toward online shopping. In addition to selecting tenants that can reliably pay rent, Realty Income employs net leases that transfer all the variable costs of building ownership, such as taxes and maintenance to the tenant. This makes the company's cash flows so stable that it sports an A3 credit rating from Moody's. Despite 30 years of operation, there's still plenty of independently owned commercial real estate that could fit into Realty Income's portfolio. With a credit rating that's better than the vast majority of its peers, there's a good chance this REIT can continue attracting quality tenants and raising its dividend through your retirement. Cigarette smoking has been in decline for decades but this hasn't stopped Altria Group from steadily raising its dividend. Last August, the U.S. tobacco giant behind the leading Marlboro brand announced its 58th dividend increase in 54 years. Despite a long history of consecutive annual dividend payout bumps, the market isn't expecting Altria Group's streak to continue. The stock offers an ultra-high 8.5% yield at recent prices. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned flavored e-vapor devices, even though consumers of all ages appear to prefer them. The ban led to a huge illicit market, but access to flavored vaporizers like Elf Bar will get harder to access, at least in the U.S., where Altria does business. In late 2023, the FDA began partnering with Customs and Border Protection to begin seizing shipments of illegal vaporizers. So far this year, it's also issued warning letters to 61 brick-and-mortar retailers and 22 online retailers for carrying illicit devices. Increased enforcement of the FDA's flavor ban is great news for Altria. Last year, it acquired NJOY, which is one of just three brands of FDA-authorized e-cigarettes on the market today. Shares of the pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer offer a 5.9% dividend yield at recent prices. It has the shortest streak on this list, but after raising its payout for 15 consecutive years, this is a very reliable dividend stock. Pfizer's revenue stream swelled up on sales of Comirnaty, a COVID-19 vaccine, and Paxlovid, a COVID-19 antiviral treatment. Unfortunately, demand for these two products evaporated faster than expected. The stock has been under pressure because trailing-12-month sales are down by about $50 billion from their peak in 2022. Pfizer has reinvested its COVID-19 windfall in new revenue streams, and the plan is working well. Despite the loss of most COVID-19-related sales trailing 12-month revenue is 45.5% higher now than it was at the beginning of the pandemic. Pfizer has reinvested its COVID-19 windfall in new drugs that could allow it to keep raising its payout for many years to come. In addition to acquiring Seagen and all four of its marketed cancer therapies, the FDA approved nine new drugs from Pfizer last year. Adding some shares to a diversified portfolio and holding them throughout your retirement years looks like a smart move for most income-seeking investors.

LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Achates Power, Inc. (API) showcased at ACT Expo what has been demonstrated as the cleanest and most efficient internal combustion engine (ICE) architecture to date. Demonstrations have proven ability to satisfy regulatory requirements without detriment to the fleets or economy. “In pursuit of clean technology, it’s critical to place priority on the fleets and drivers. Technology-forcing regulations with uncertainty on infrastructure, cost, and capability to ‘do the job’ make it difficult to navigate this energy transition,” said Dave Crompton, CEO of API. “For the first time, an ICE architecture has been simultaneously proven to reduce NOx, beat the most stringent regulations proposed with margin to spare, and improve real world fuel economy by as much as 20%, while demonstrating extended life compliance.” API demonstrated the opposed-piston (OP) architecture is capable of using today’s aftertreatment systems to meet tomorrow’s ultra-low NOx emissions standards with robust compliance through the 800,000 mile useful life requirements. Low-load, idle, and off-cycle emissions capability positions this to be the best combustion technology in the industry. Stringent emissions regulations in commercial trucking are to a point where aftertreatment systems’ cost and complexity may drive truck costs higher, reliability lower, and penalize fuel economy. In a joint demonstration with CALSTART and Walmart, an API 10.6 liter engine was retrofitted into a production class 8 truck to meet the proposed 2027 ultra-low NOx emissions standard and with an off-the-shelf current production one-box aftertreatment system. Testing in California achieved up to 10.8 mpg on a 389 mile delivery route averaging 10% better fuel economy than baseline with the advantage increasing to 22% on some routes. In February at Argonne National Laboratory, the Department of Energy began testing an API engine utilizing hydrogen combustion with compression ignition. The simplicity of this design enables an easier transition to hydrogen combustion over 4-stroke concepts. In joint testing with renewable diesel producer Neste, the already proven 10% greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reduction of the OP engine was amplified when using R99. Testing resulted in 4-5% GHG emissions reduction compared to fossil diesel across all test cycles - the lowest GHG level API measured to-date. Benefits of the API engines include lower heat rejection, higher power density, and fewer moving parts for better reliability and increased fuel efficiency. Every stroke is a power stroke, providing optimal thermal efficiency. This matters to fleets for 2027 and beyond emissions regulations where thermal management impacts aftertreatment cost, simplicity and functionality. API technology is obtainable without the use of exotic materials, non-conventional manufacturing, or complex aftertreatment systems - making it a ‘now’ solution for the fleets. “API has demonstrated that its technology can be put into practical use without the added complexity, cost and reliability concerns associated with stretching conventional engines and emission systems to meet the future low NOx and CO2 limits, and without the need for a fleet to redesign routes around shorter-range vehicles and sparse refueling/recharging infrastructure,” said Dr. John Wall, Board of Directors, API and former Cummins CTO. “For fleets that ultimately want to reach zero-net-carbon emissions, including renewable diesel and hydrogen, the Achates technology is a good match."" This architecture can be manufactured through sustainable assembly practices and with approximately 300 fewer parts compared to today’s 4-stroke engines. Materials can be procured through today’s supply chain efficiently supporting the manufacturing of this engine architecture without sourcing disruptions and constraints.

Target is cutting prices on 5,000 popular products in an effort to attract more customers despite ongoing financial challenges, the company announced Monday. By reducing the prices on household essentials from groceries like milk, meat, bread, soda, fresh fruit, vegetables, yogurt and coffee to diapers, paper towels and pet food, consumers will collectively save consumers millions of dollars, Target said. Target said it has already cut prices on 1,500 items and that ""thousands more price cuts"" will take effect over the course of the summer. ""Target routinely adjusts its prices to ensure it is competitive within the markets it does business,"" Target said. WALMART CFO SAYS 'MANY CONSUMER POCKETBOOKS' ARE BEING STRETCHED AS HIGH INFLATION PERSISTS It's the latest company to announce price cuts for its products in recent weeks to help consumers that are still being squeezed by inflation. Last week, Walmart executives told analysts on an earnings call that its rollback count is up. Rollbacks refer to temporary price reductions on goods. U.S. Walmart CEO John Furner specified that the company has nearly 7,000 rollbacks across the store. In April, the grocery rollback count was up 45% year over year. ALDI CUTTING PRICES ON HUNDREDS OF ITEMS TO FIGHT 'STUBBORN INFLATION' Earlier this month, discount grocer Aldi announced it was passing along $100 million in savings by slashing prices on more than 250 items through Labor Day. Inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target and continues to create severe financial pressures for most U.S. households. In April, inflation climbed 3.4% from the same time last year, down from the 3.5% reading in March. While inflation has fallen considerably from a peak of 9.1%, progress has largely flatlined since the summer. The Census Bureau reported last week that retail sales in April were unchanged from March and up 3% from the prior year.

Target (TGT) will slash prices on thousands of essential household items as inflation lingers and Walmart (WMT) emerges as a more potent competitor. Target stock fell with Walmart stock sliding back into buy range. Other notable discounters, including TJX Cos. (TJX) and Dollar General (DG), also retreated. The big-box retailer announced on Monday that it is lowering prices on roughly 5,000 everyday items ranging from milk, meat and bread to diapers, paper towels and pet food. Some 1,500 reductions have already been made, with more coming over the summer. Target said it routinely adjusts prices to stay competitive. Amid stubborn inflation, Target also faces increased competition from Walmart. That larger rival last week reported robust earnings as price-conscious shoppers continue to search for cheaper essentials. Notably, Walmart said it continues to attract more frequent and new shoppers, while it's starting to see more higher-income shoppers hit its stores. Target uses a low-pricing strategy similar to Walmart but enjoys a more upscale image. ""We know consumers are feeling pressured to make the most of their budget, and Target is here to help them save more,"" Target Executive Vice President Rick Gomez said in Monday's news release. Target reports earnings for the first quarter early Wednesday. Analysts expect the retailer to report a 3.7% decline in same-store sales. Meanwhile, nearly two dozen analysts have hiked price targets on Walmart stock since the company's Q1 earnings report, FactSet shows. Walmart ""has what all cohorts are looking for,"" Bank of America analysts said, reiterating a buy rating and raising the PT from $67 to $75. Shares of Target fell 2.1% to 156.71 on the stock market today. Target stock continues to work on a 181.86 flat-base buy point, but it's below the 50-day line and near the bottom of the consolidation. Walmart stock gave up 0.7% to 64.21, back in range from an earnings breakaway gap-up from a double-bottom base last week. Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe said on Monday that Target's price cuts may hurt margins but could improve efficiencies, driving more profitable growth ahead. Tarlowe expects Target to affirm its prior full-year guidance. The retailer's price reductions could ripple across the value-oriented and off-price merchandise chain. This week, TJX, BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) and Ross Stores (ROST) all report earnings, with investors eager to learn the latest on still-high inflation. Costco Wholesale (COST), Dollar General and Burlington Stores (BURL) report next week. Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Kroger (KR) have yet to announce dates. Amazon (AMZN) has already reported.

24/7 Insights Many believe that Walmart is the cheapest place to shop. Other retailers go out of their way to drop pricing below that of Walmart. Some of the best pricing can be found at regional grocers. Also: 2 Dividend Legends to Hold Forever When it comes to value pricing in the retail segment in the United States, there is a consistent belief that Walmart offers the best bang for your buck. While Amazon has certainly made a dent in Walmart with online sales, as far as physical stores go, the belief that Walmart is the least expensive isn’t always true. In many cases, other retail chains that compete with Walmart look at its pricing as the line in the sand. Said differently, plenty of competitors shop at Walmart and then determine in what categories they can beat Walmart’s pricing to attract customers to their stores. 8. Market Basket More In Your Basket Market Basket offers a lot of value for its customer base. Locations: 90 Known for: Being one of the least expensive groceries in the New England area with a “more for your dollar” slogan Best things to buy: New England fish items like clams, fresh seafood, maple syrup, pears, apples More In Your Basket There is something special about Market Basket pricing. According to a recent study, Market Basket’s pricing was 18% lower than other Boston-area groceries. This study found that a family spending $250 per week on groceries could save as much as $2,300 annually by shopping at Market Basket. The privately owned business heavily focuses on keeping prices down, which has helped Market Basket earn a reputation as one of the cheapest groceries in the US. 7. Food 4 Less Food 4 Less is more than living up to its name. Locations: 101 Known for: A no-frills grocery store where customers bag their groceries Best things to buy: Organic orange juice, cage-free brown eggs, vegetable chips, and organic creamy peanut butter A Kroger Brand Food 4 Less is backed by its parent company, Kroger. Located in just four states, the Kroger-owned Food 4 Less brand is quickly becoming a go-to choice for customers looking for inexpensive groceries. These locations sell dry goods, canned goods, baking supplies, and organic and non-organic produce for less. The same can be said for health and beauty items, though Walmart has a larger selection overall. 6. H-E-B H-E-B is a bonafide Texas staple. Locations: 420 Known for: Being region-specific to just Texas, with 380 stores in Texas and another few dozen in Mexico Best things to buy: Whataburger sauces, Texas-branded products, Taste of San Antonio, fajitas, tortillas, and more Better In Texas H-E-B offers food items you can’t find at your local Walmart. As Texans believe everything is better in Texas, this might be true if you shop at a H-E-B grocery store. Considered one of the best privately owned groceries in the country, H-E-B pricing compares very well to Walmart while offering things you can’t get at any Walmart location. However, where H-E-B truly wins is its low-priced yet outstanding quality meats and produce, which Walmart cannot match. 5. Lidl Lidl is attempting to enter the US market. Locations: 173 Known for: Fantastic selection of low-price items, including store-branded items, which account for 80% of the store’s inventory Best things to buy: Seafood and dairy, organic meats, organic fruits and vegetables, dairy products and fair-trade chocolates Store Branded Everything With its competitive pricing, Lidl will grow quickly in the US. Another international brand trying to carve out a niche in the United States, Lidl, is already well on its way to success. With 173 stores and growing, where Lidl beats out Walmart is the idea that over 80% of the items in Lidl stores are store-branded items. This means they are cheaper than brand-name items and even cheaper than Walmart’s private-label brands. Ultimately, Lidl is cheaper and healthier with grass-fed meats, organic fruits and vegetables, and organic dairy products. 4. WinCo Foods WinCo Foods is a surprisingly delightful place to shop due to its pricing. Locations: 141 Known for: Midwest-based employee-owned grocery store with more than 20,000 employees Best things to buy: Boxed foods, dairy products, and bulk chases are said to save customers a lot of money The Midwest Surprise You won’t be disappointed with the price when you enter WinCo Foods. With only 141 employee-owned locations in the Midwest, many Americans can’t walk into a WinCo Foods store. However, for those who can, the bulk purchase area in its stores can be vastly cheaper than Walmart. Everything from Arizona Iced Tea, soft drinks, eggs, spices, smoked and grilled items, and barbecue charcoal is cheaper than Walmart. This is a testament to the employee-owned nature of WinCo Foods, as they are focused on inexpensive pricing and not driving big profits. 3. Costco Shopping at Costco offers a unique experience compared to Walmart. Locations: 890 Known for: Bulk purchases, exclusive items under the Kirkland brand, regional inventory Best things to buy: Frozen foods, lunch items, fresh food, baking and cooking essentials Buying In Bulk Buying in bulk at Costco can be much less expensive than at Walmart. Costco’s pricing can be better than Walmart’s in multiple categories if you like to stock up on items simultaneously. It’s widely considered cheaper to purchase fresh food and frozen foods, and even some staples like milk and eggs can be less expensive at Costco. However, when you buy in bulk, Costco shines. Even though you will pay more upfront, you’ll restock less, which makes things like paper towels and toilet paper less expensive than Walmart. 2. Aldi Aldi beats Walmart in price in multiple categories, such as daily food staples. Locations: 2,443 Known for: No-frills shopping experience with numerous private-label products Best things to buy: German foods, baking ingredients, basic food staples, pre-cooked frozen foods The German Giant Aldi offers a no-frills grocery shopping experience. Aldi is expected to have close to 3,200 locations by 2028, making it a formidable competitor to Walmart’s grocery business. Compared to Walmart, there is an expectation you should be able to walk out of Aldi for at least a few dollars less than you would spend at Walmart if you took a list of the same items. Fans of the brand love it for basic food staples like milk and eggs, as well as foreign food items you can’t get at Walmart. 1. Target Target’s house brands are competitively priced compared to Walmart. Locations: 1,963 Known for: High-quality, low-priced items across food, clothing, beauty, and more Best things to buy: Up &amp; Up cleaning products, dealworthy essentials Walmart’s Biggest Competitor Target is consistently looking to beat Walmart’s pricing. When you think of Walmart and competition, it goes without saying that Target is at the very top of the competition. While Walmart is generally considered the less expensive of the two, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of items where Target beats Walmart, including bottled water and house-branded cleaning supplies. In many cases, Target’s Cat &amp; Jack brand also offers better pricing for kids’ clothing.

Today, it has over 10,000 locations worldwide and employs 2.1 million people. It is the largest employer in the United States, with 1.2 million workers.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) was supposed to put Walmart out of business. Two decades ago, e-commerce was viewed as superior to brick-and-mortar retail. Amazon has been blamed for the demise of Sears, Kmart, and J.C. Penney. Walmart used its size, created its own e-commerce business, and built a model where people can order online and pick up at stores to compete with Amazon.

Today’s market has turned decidedly negative as soured sentiment in the Dow Jones Industrial Average spills over, spoiling the S&amp;P 500’s record run. The Dow is spiraling by 500 points and is being pressured by retailer Walmart (NYSE: WMT), whose earnings results confirmed tariff-related fears. Among the few technology gainers are Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) as of early trading. Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is among the rare gainers in the Dow today. Walmart warned that its profit growth is expected to slow down amid the company’s vulnerability to the likely Mexico and Canada tariffs. Walmart’s stock is down over 6% despite beating consensus estimates on the top and bottom lines in its fiscal Q4 as Wall Street focuses on an uncertain future. Nevertheless, TD Cowen analyst Oliver Chen told Yahoo Finance that Walmart is “hitting on all cylinders” for now, pointing to a resilient consumer that continues to drive revenue. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 502.74 (-1.13) Nasdaq Composite: -165.58 (-0.80%) S&amp;P 500: Down 44.26 (-0.72%) Key Points The Dow Jones Industrial Average is spiraling by 500 points. Alibaba shares are soaring after a blowout quarterly earnings report. Big Tech stocks are mixed. Palantir is sinking on fears of U.S. defense budget cuts. Market Movers Alibaba is boosting tech sentiment today, rising 11.7% on the heels of its fiscal Q3 earnings report, which executives attributed “robust” AI momentum . The company’s results were driven by cloud technology as well as AI-product revenue, both of which have been soaring. Alibaba is also receiving tailwind’s from China’s competitive AI investments, including DeepSeek, as a result of which BABA stock has skyrocketed 50% so far in 2025. Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) is giving up some of its recent gains, falling below the psychologically sensitive $100 level today amid a 13% drop in the stock.

Here Are the Current Social Rules,"Has Tipping Gotten Out of Hand? Here Are the Current Social Rules
If you live in the United States and polled 100 people about something financial that has gotten out of hand lately, I hope tipping is the top answer. We now live in a world where businesses that would have never dreamed of asking for a tip, like a clothing retailer, ask for tips with every transaction. Key Points For better or worse, the tipping culture in America isn’t going anywhere. The reality is that the rise of digital checkouts has only made tipping more pervasive wherever you shop. There are some absolute rules and general guidelines for how much to leave as a tip. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) The massive shift in tipping culture now begs the question of what the new social rules should be. What is the proper etiquette in different establishments? When should or shouldn’t you leave a tip? Unfortunately, the answer isn’t so easy. 20. Why Has Tipping Changed? Many places seem to blame the pandemic as tipping became integral to supporting essential workers. However, one of the more logical reasons is the rise of digital payment systems, which can display a tipping option right in front of customers before they complete their transaction. This has made it easy for businesses to make tipping a focal point of every purchase. 19. What Do Americans Really Think? Most discussions around the tipping culture change point back to a 2023 Pew Research poll that indicates over one-third of all Americans feel it’s “very easy” to know when to tip. Conversely, an equal number of people also claimed that they found it “not too easy or not at all easy” when asked if they know how much to tip in certain situations. Of the 12,000 respondents, 72% indicated they were being asked to tip more frequently than in the past. 18. Is Tipping Here To Say? By all accounts, tipping isn’t going anywhere, and we shouldn’t expect it to disappear overnight. Restaurants could start building the cost of tipping into their prices to pay servers a fair wage, but then higher food prices would turn away customers, so this isn’t a solution. While other countries may not rely so heavily on tipping, expect the US to rely on it for the foreseeable future. 17. Miscellaneous Roles Unsurprisingly, there are a host of roles where a tip might be something you consider but is not required. This might be a job like an exterminator, carpet installer, or window washer. Generally, $10 or $20 is acceptable in these cases, but you don’t need to exceed this number. In the case of a camp counselor or teacher, pool together money with the rest of the parents and provide one significant gift. 16. House Movers If you are moving homes, whether down the street or across the country, these individuals are lifting a lot, and potentially even packing for you. As a result, your tip should be hefty enough to make it meaningful, which is why 15% to 20% of the total move cost is appropriate. 15. Coat Check If you are in a place where a coat check is used, the acceptable norm is likely to be between $1 per coat and $2 if you have a bag. 14. Hotel Housekeeper This isn’t one of those roles that generally gets a tip as sometimes you may never see housekeepers’ work. However, if you can tip a housekeeper in a hotel, the rule of thumb is around $5 per night. 13. Salon At the salon, whether it’s a hair stylist, manicurist, or someone who provides facials, the same general rule is likely to apply. Upwards of 15% to 20% is the socially acceptable norm for any of these roles. 12. Baggage Handler At an airport or hotel, if you are providing your luggage to someone at the curb or inside a hotel lobby, it’s appropriate to generally tip around $1 to $2 per bag, depending on the number of bags. The same rule applies if you also hand your bags to someone at a cruise port. 11. Uber Drivers This applies to both Uber and Lyft, but this is another instance where the proper etiquette would be around 20% of the ride total. You might want to up this amount during a busy time like a concert or sports game where traffic is worse. 10. Grocery Delivery If you use something like Shipt or Walmart+ and have your groceries delivered, someone took a lot of time to get everything you wanted on your list. This is why experts say that 15% or 20% of the order total is the least you can tip. 9. Meal Delivery This is a controversial one as it depends on the kind of delivery driver. Your Amazon delivery driver? No tip is required, but the argument changes if it’s someone from DoorDash or GrubHub. This role is highly dependent on tips, and, as a result, you should tip around 20% or $5, depending on whichever is greater. 8. Coffee Shops This is a tough one because it depends on whether a tip is included on a screen or, in the case of a Starbucks, in a jar sitting at the register. Ideally, experts recommend as much as 15% of the cost of your coffee or latte. Even sticking a dollar in the jar is a welcome gesture. 7. Car Valet If you need a valet for your car at a shopping mall, restaurant, or airport, tipping in this space is expected. Ideally, experts say you should plan to do between $2 and $5 when your car is returned. 6. Babysitter While babysitters might make an agreed-upon hourly wage that varies based on the age of the child and the number of children, tips are not uncommon. Parents who want to keep a babysitter returning regularly should focus on rounding up any totals to try and add a little more to the balance to show appreciation. 5. Tour Guide This is a challenging one because it really depends on how much work the tour guide puts into the tour. A full-day tour? This should have a larger tip than someone who spends an hour working with you. Still, figure between 10 and 20% of the cost. 4. Bar Tabs Generally speaking, if you tip a bartender after closing out a bar tab or even just paying for one drink, think anywhere between 15% and 20% of the total. 3. Spa Services Another important tipping location is for spa service providers, who have long depended on tips as part of their wages. In these cases, experts tend to agree that 20% of the total cost of the spa day is appropriate. 2. Group Dining This is a tough one, as not every restaurant includes a separate check. However, whether you pay as a group with cash or get checks individually, the tip should reflect the same percentage. In other words, it should be roughly 20% of your portion of the bill. 1. Restaurant Tipping In one of the few business types where tipping is not only okay but expected, the same general longstanding amount rules continue to apply. On average, it’s recommended to tip between 18% and 20% of the total bill (including tax). So a $100 restaurant check would require a $20 tip or more, depending on the level of service.

Time to Buy the Dip?,"Upstart Aced Earnings but Still Got Crushed. Time to Buy the Dip?
Investors came in to Upstart's (UPST 1.79%) first-quarter earnings report hoping the company would maintain its momentum from the end of last year. Its growth has accelerated thanks to a new artificial intelligence (AI) model, Model 18 or M18, that has significantly improved its conversion rate thanks to an even broader prediction set that includes approximately 1 million predictions per applicant, or six times its prior model. With those tailwinds behind it, Upstart's results in Q1 did not disappoint. Revenue jumped 67% to $213.4 million, which topped estimates at $201.3 million. Those results included 34% growth in revenue from fees to $185.5 million, and Upstart benefited from a decline in fair value adjustments on its loans, indicating better credit performance. Underlying growth in its business was especially impressive as loan originations rose 102% to 240,706 loans, and total originations jumped 89% to more than $2.1 billion. The conversion rate continued to improve, rising from 14% to 19.1%, all signs that adoption is growing rapidly. Its metrics on the bottom line also improved. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) improved from a loss of $20.3 million to a profit of $42.6 million. It nearly reported a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit, finishing the quarter with a loss of $2.4 million, up from a loss of $64.6 million in the quarter a year ago. It reported an adjusted per-share profit of $0.30, ahead of the consensus at $0.17, and up from an adjusted per-share loss of $0.31 in the quarter a year ago. Despite the strong Q1 earnings report, Upstart essentially reiterated its full-year guidance untouched as it guided to revenue of $225 million for Q2, below the consensus at $226.3 million. Wall Street tends to see a beat without a raise as a sign that the current momentum won't last, and investors sometimes punish growth stocks for that pattern. As a result, the stock was down 16% in after-hours trading on Tuesday. While management did acknowledge the uncertainty in the economy, there wasn't anything in the guidance to indicate weakness. Meanwhile, a number of indicators in the business showed it continuing to strengthen. Upstart has diversified its business away from unsecured consumer loans in recent years as auto loans grew by five times to $61 million in the quarter and up 42% from Q4. Home loan origination jumped six times to $41 million, and management noted on the earnings call that its lending partners greatly prefer secured loans to unsecured loans, which bodes well for continued growth in the business. Prior to the earnings release, the company announced a one-year strategic partnership with OnePay, a fintech majority owned by Walmart. Upstart said the partnership would help it market lending product to Walmart's customer base, a massive opportunity for the company. It also plans to offer co-branded products without OnePay, though it said it didn't expect the partnership to have a material impact on financial results this year. Additionally, Upstart announced a forward-flow commitment from Fortress Investment Group, which agreed to purchase up to $1.2 billion in loans originated on Upstart, which will further diversify the company's base of lending partners and help ensure adequate funding for its loans. If the after-hours sell-off holds, Upstart now trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 31 based on adjusted earnings, and that number is likely to fall as analysts up their forecasts following the strong quarter. Meanwhile, Upstart's revenue growth and the tailwinds in the large auto and home loan markets show it still has a significant growth runway in front of it. Upstart's own proprietary data even shows the macroenvironment improving modestly, and the business is less at risk of turmoil in the credit market than it was in 2022 when interest rates surged, freezing borrower demand. With interest rates already high and Upstart's business now resilient, the company seems to be in good shape no matter what happens on the macrofront. A recession could even be a positive for the company as it could lower interest rates. Overall, Upstart's business is getting stronger, its technology is improving, and the valuation looks attractive. The company also has scheduled an ""AI day"" when it will present technology updates and discuss its business model and strategy.",713.0,407.0,19.0,9.0,10.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.04668304668304668,0.022113022113022112,0.02457002457002457,0.0,0.002457002457002457,0.02457002457002457

Dividend stock investing offers a reliable path to passive income and long-term wealth creation, making it a cornerstone for many portfolios. By owning shares in companies that pay regular dividends, investors gain consistent cash flow, often from stable, high-quality firms like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Dividends provide a hedge against market volatility, as payouts persist even during downturns, and reinvesting them can compound returns significantly over time. Moreover, dividend-paying stocks historically outperform non-dividend peers, with lower volatility. 24/7 Wall St. Insights: Dividend stock investing has proven a reliable path for investors to gather immense wealth over time. Dividend ETFs bolster those results by investing in hundreds of dividend-paying stocks, offering instant diversification and minimizing single-stock risk. Sit back and let dividends do the heavy lifting for a simple, steady path to serious wealth creation over time. Grab a free copy of “2 Legendary High-Yield Dividend Stocks“ now. Dividend-paying exchange-traded funds (ETFs) enhance these benefits by pooling dozens or hundreds of such stocks, offering instant diversification, reduced single-stock risk, and low expense ratios. In 2025’s uncertain market, marked by tariffs and persistent inflation, dividend ETFs provide resilience and income stability. Pursuing this strategy ensures steady returns and growth, making it ideal for both novice and seasoned investors seeking financial security. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Any discussion of dividend ETFs must begin with Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). It is a top-tier dividend ETF, tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index with around 100 high-quality stocks like Lockheed-Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), each boasting more than 10 years of dividend growth. The ETF&#8217;s 3.7% yield and ultra-low 0.06% expense ratio make it cost-effective while limiting sector exposure to no more than 25% ensures diversification. SCHD’s 11.4% annualized return over a decade reflects its balance of income and growth. Because SCHD focuses on financially sound companies, the dividend ETF mitigates risks, offering investors stability. For those seeking high yield and reliability, SCHD stock is a must-own ETF for lifelong passive income. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSE:VYM) tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, holding 589 stocks like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), with no stock exceeding 4% of the portfolio. VYM&#8217;s 2.7% yield and 0.06% expense ratio deliver strong value, while its 13.3% five-year annualized return highlights its consistency. VYM also offers broad diversification across sectors like energy and financials, reducing volatility, making it ideal for conservative investors. With tariff&#8217;s top-of-mind for investors these days, the ETF&#8217;s U.S.-focused holdings provide resilience against global disruptions. Its proven track record and low costs makes VYM a foundational ETF for steady dividend income and long-term wealth building. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEARCA:VIG) targets companies with over 10 years of dividend increases, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and holds 338 stocks in its portfolio. The ETF&#8217;s 1.8% yield is lower, but its focus on dividend growth drives an 11.2% annualized return over the past decade. VIG&#8217;s 0.05% expense ratio is also among the lowest, maximizing investor returns.

Close Key Takeaways Retail and credit card data shows Americans continue to spend, but a few aspects of their behavior have some analysts concerned about a potential slowdown.New retail numbers and an earnings report from Walmart slated to come out this week may offer clarity on the health of the consumer.Higher-income customers have been relying more on Walmart—and its delivery service—in recent months, executives have said. Americans haven’t stopped spending despite broad economic uncertainty. But a close look at recent data and trends has fed concerns about a slowdown. The unemployment rate is relatively low, and job creation is holding steady. Retail spending shot up 6.8% year-over-year in April, the National Retail Federation said, exclusive of car and gas purchases. But Americans are increasingly uneasy, several measures suggest. Consumer sentiment fell in April for a fourth straight month, according to the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. Quick-service restaurants and companies selling everything from lunch to laundry detergent say their customers seem squeezed. And while credit and debit card spending ticked up 1% last month, according to Bank of America, there was a pullback in big splurges like trips and hotels. Two releases set for Thursday will offer fresh data: Walmart (WMT) is slated to hand in its first-quarter numbers, and the government is scheduled to publish April retail data. Trade negotiations, notably with China, ahve contributed to the uncertainty: Widespread “reciprocal” tariffs are not slated to take effect for weeks, but the NRFthinks the threat of higher import taxes has spurred consumers to stock up on some items, juicing retail spending in April. “There’s a real inconsistency in the vibe,” said Max Levchin, CEO of buy now, pay later provider Affirm (AFRM), on CNBC Friday. “People are stressed out about the economy, yet they’re shopping. They’re buying, and they’re paying their bills.” Shoppers Look for Lower Sticker Prices Oppenheimer analysts on Wednesday said Walmart has historically performed well in recessionary periods. Still, they acknowledged the current outlook can be hard to read. “We have seen potentially mixed consumer data-points lately with still healthy consumer spending trends overall,” they wrote. “But at the same time, [there has been] more downbeat [consumer packaged goods company] commentary.” Consumers have “a lot to process” and a reason to “pause,” Procter & Gamble (PG) CFO Andre Schulten said last month. The parent company of brands like Tide and Febreze recently downgraded its outlook for the full fiscal year. So did another consumer goods giant, Church & Dwight (CHD). Americans are watching their tabs at Applebee’s and IHOP and cutting back at Wendy’s (WEN) and McDonald’s (MCD), executives recently said. At grocery and convenience stores, some shoppers are focusing more on sticker prices than the cost-per-serving, which has prompted Pepsi (PEP) and Mondelēz International (MDLZ) to offer smaller packages at lower price points, executives said last month. “While two, three years ago consumers would easily pay above $4 for a pack of biscuits, we’re now seeing that we need to be below $4, and ideally below $3,” said Dirk Van de Put, CEO of Mondelēz, which counts Ritz Crackers and Oreo cookies as parts of its biscuit category. Demand hasn’t waned for international airfare or luxury clothing, companies said. Households with six-figure incomes have been flocking to Walmart’s delivery service in recent months. “We’re seeing higher engagement across income cohorts, with upper-income households continuing to account for the majority of share gains,” CFO John David Rainey said this winter.

KEY POINTS The Amex Platinum Card offers luxury perks like Centurion Lounge access and elite hotel status.The Chase Sapphire Reserve maximizes travel and dining purchases, with 3x to 10x total points in those categories.Both cards offer huge welcome bonuses for meeting minimum spend requirements. I'll never forget my first airport lounge experience. I was 26, on a work trip to Austin, when my boss waved me into the Delta Sky Club as his guest. I tried to act cool -- like I belonged there -- but inside, I was buzzing like a kid in a candy store. Free drinks, gourmet snacks, fancy bathrooms, lightning-fast wifi…it felt like a whole different world.After that trip I learned that getting into airport lounges isn't actually that hard. Holding the right credit card can get you access to more than 1,400 lounges worldwide -- no boss required.Today, two of the best cards for VIP travel perks (including lounge access) are The Platinum Card® from American Express (see rates and fees) and the Chase Sapphire Reserve® (see rates and fees). We'll break down the differences so you can determine which is best for you this year.

In my eyes, the Chase Sapphire Reserve card has higher earning opportunities for everyday spending. With its slightly lower fee of $550, it may be a better fit for those who like to stretch their travel budget a bit further.What I love about the Amex Platinum CardIf you're looking for the full VIP experience, The Platinum Card® from American Express is tough to beat. The access to Centurion Lounges alone make those long layovers actually enjoyable. Terms apply. I've eaten full meals, drunk plenty of mimosas, and even showered once before a long-haul flight -- all thanks to the airport lounge perks included with my card membership.Hotel elite status is an underrated perk. Just by having the card, you can get room upgrades, early check-ins, and late checkouts at Hilton and Marriott properties. Terms apply; enrollment may be required.One low-key perk that I love is the $100 Saks Fifth Avenue credit. Terms apply. I use this to buy my wife fancy gifts each year (one for her birthday in July and one in December for Christmas!).If you're a frequent traveler who loves a first-class vibe, consider applying for The Platinum Card® from American Express here (see rates and fees).What I love about Chase Sapphire ReserveIf you want premium perks and serious bang for your buck, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® delivers the goods. First off, the $300 annual travel credit is almost effortless to use. (Plus, it makes up for over half the annual fee.)Point redemptions are where Chase Sapphire Reserve® truly crushes it. Your points are worth 50% more when you book through Chase Travel. That's up to $900 in travel value from a welcome offer of 60,000 bonus points (after spending $5,000 in the first 3 months).And you get 10x total points on hotels and car rentals through Chase Travel℠ immediately after the first $300 is spent on travel purchases annually, 5x total points on air travel through Chase Travel℠ immediately after the first $300 is spent on travel purchases annually, and 3x points on other travel and dining. It's easy to see how everyday spending can stack up points really fast.If you want a practical card without giving up great travel perks, apply for the Chase Sapphire Reserve® here (see rates and fees).Final verdict: Which card should you pick?If you're chasing luxury experiences -- and you'll actually use lounge access, hotel upgrades, and airline credits -- the Amex Platinum Card is your ticket to a VIP summer.If you want to maximize value per dollar and score easy rewards on everything from Uber rides to steak dinners, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® probably fits your style better.",1094.0,614.0,8.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,6.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,0.013029315960912053,0.006514657980456026,0.009771986970684038,0.0016286644951140066,0.009771986970684038,0.006514657980456026

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Economy Not in the Clear: JPMorgan CEO 12:05 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Despite more optimistic forecasts from within JPMorgan Chase, CEO Jamie Dimon continues to express concerns about the economy&#8217;s resilience, cautioning that it is not yet clear of potential recession rearing its head. Dimon pointed to the unpredictable nature of tariffs as a key area of uncertainty, while the bank’s chief U.S. economist has attached a less than 50% chance of a recession. Dimon told Bloomberg, &#8220;If there’s a recession, I don’t know how big it will be or how long it will last. Hopefully we’ll avoid it, but I wouldn’t take it off the table at this point.&#8221; Shielding Consumers 11:07 am by Gerelyn Terzo While some retailers like Walmart are discussing higher prices for consumers due to tariffs, data on producer prices suggests a broader trend of cost absorption. April saw a significant 0.5% decrease in producer prices, the most substantial drop in five years. This indicates that U.S. producers are largely bearing the brunt of increased costs, protecting consumers from immediate price hikes, a finding that significantly undershot Bloomberg economist expectations of a 0.2% increase. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The stock market has opened with a cautious tone this morning, as the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P 500 are all trading lower. The SPX index is down 0.37%. Investors are reacting to concerning statements made by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at an economic forum earlier today. Powell warned of potentially higher long-term interest rates for the long term, owing in part to an uncertain monetary policy outlook. Today&#8217;s pullback follows an impressive run for the broader stock market in which the S&amp;P 500 has been retaking lost ground for a positive year-to-date performance. For its part, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has recovered 6% over the past five trading sessions. Today Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) will distribute it quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share to shareholders. Here&#8217;s the early look at market performance: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 114.29 (-0.27%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 128.16 (-0.67%) S&amp;P 500: Down 13.30 (-0.23%) Stocks in Focus Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is trading down by 4.0% following an announcement from a company executive that the retailer plans to transfer tariff costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, with these increases potentially taking effect this month. Shares of Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) have tumbled by 6.5% today after the company reported disappointing revenue figures for its fiscal fourth quarter. Networking solutions provider Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO) is also seeing downward pressure, with its stock down 4.2%. CoreWeave (Nasdaq: CRWV) is under pressure, falling by 4.4%, despite announcing strong first-quarter revenue and significant demand for its AI cloud platform,. Investors appear concerned by the company&#8217;s plans for aggressive capex plans in Q2. On the positive side, CoreWeave clinched a lucrative partnership with Google. UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) is a major drag on the markets, falling 17% today in a series of setbacks, the latest of which is a potential Medicare controversy.

Klarna reported a 15% rise in first-quarter revenue on Monday and returned to profit as the UK announced plans to tighten regulation on buy now, pay later lenders. The Swedish fintech posted $701 million in revenue and a $3 million adjusted profit, compared with a $2 million loss a year earlier, excluding the sale of its checkout business. The results follow Klarna’s decision last month to pause its planned US initial public offering, citing economic uncertainty and tariff concerns. The company made no mention of the IPO in its earnings update but said it is monitoring shifts in the business environment. The UK, one of Klarna’s key markets, said Monday it will introduce new rules from next year aimed at protecting consumers from unregulated lending. Klarna’s US revenue rose 33%, helped by partnerships with Walmart, DoorDash and eBay. StickIt Technologies Inc.

Close Key Takeaways Walmart should ""eat the tariffs"" rather than raise prices, President Donald Trump said in a recent Truth Social post.CEO Doug McMillon warned on the company's earnings call that profits could fall this year depending on the direction of trade policy.McMillon said ""the reality of narrow retail margins"" makes the tariffs, even at reduced levels, difficult to absorb. Walmart (WMT) shares slumped in early trading Monday after President Donald Trump said the retailer should absorb the cost of tariffs rather than pass it on to customers by raising prices. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,” Trump said in a Saturday message on Truth Social. “Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!” Shares of Walmart slid about 2% before the opening bell. The stock is up about 9% in 2025. Trump’s post came in response to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon warning that profits could fall this year depending on the direction of trade policy. “Given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,” McMillon said during the company’s earnings call Thursday, a transcript of which was made available by AlphaSense. McMillon credited President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for “progress” on lowering tariffs after the U.S. and China agreed to roll back import taxes for a period of 90 days. “We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible,” the CEO added.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Jamie Dimon on the Risk of Inflation and Deflation 3:23 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The markets have recouped most of their losses, with the SPX now down a modest 0.03%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon believes the risks around the threat of both inflation and deflation have yet to surface in stock market values.

I don’t think” they can&#8230;“My own view is people feel pretty good because you haven’t [yet] seen effective tariffs&#8230;The market came down 10%, [it’s] back up 10%; that’s an extraordinary amount of complacency.&#8221; Ray Dalio Comments on US Debt 11:58 am by Gerelyn Terzo Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, reportedly raised a flag that Moody&#8217;s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating misses a crucial point regarding the vulnerability of U.S. Treasuries. According to Dalio, the credit agency&#8217;s analysis fails to account for the inherent risk of the federal government resorting to money printing to service its massive debt. While Treasury yields rise, the markets remain under pressure, including a 0.17% decline in the SPX ETF. Retail Stocks in Focus 10:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo This week, the market&#8217;s focus pivots to corporate earnings, with reports due from major players like Home Depot (NYSE: HD), Target (NYSE: TGT) and TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX). Notably, TJX stock has already climbed 11% this year so far. Comparable store sales figures will be under close examination amid ongoing high interest rates as well as signs of cooling inflation. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are narrowing their declines in the face of a U.S. debt downgrade by one of the credit rating agencies. Moody&#8217;s lowered its view of U.S. debt by a single notch to to Aa1, down from the highest possible rating. Moody&#8217;s blamed the persistent budget deficit and high interest rates, a view challenged by President Trump, who affirmed global confidence in the U.S. economy. The credit downgrade adds insult to injury following a week in which the S&amp;P 500 advanced 5%. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC he predicts one interest rate cut in 2025 as the economy continues to stave off a recession. The central bank has tipped its hand to a possible two rate cuts this year. Today&#8217;s credit downgrade sent Treasury yields higher, with the 30-year Treasury surpassing the 5% threshold, and weighed heavily on equities. While the SPX ETF is currently down slightly, the three major averages are showing signs of resilience, paring back their earlier losses as the morning progresses. The broader technology sector is currently down 1.4%. The prominent Magnificent Seven stocks are mostly in the red, including a 2.8% decline in Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) stock amid ongoing regulatory scrutiny of its proposed AI partnership with China&#8217;s Alibaba. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 44.18 (-0.10%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 103.54 (-0.54%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.36 (-0.34%) Market Movers Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is down 2.3% after announcing potential price increases due to tariffs, a move countered by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent&#8217;s suggestion that the retailer will &#8220;absorb some of the tariffs.&#8221; Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) has seen a 3.8% decline but remains close to its recent high of $130.18.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Snowflake Earnings Preview 12:54 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One stock that&#8217;s on the radar of Wall Street analysts is Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) ahead of the company&#8217;s earnings this week. The cloud-based AI data storage company is largely expected to come through with flying colors.

S&amp;P 500 Earnings Outlook 11:02 am by Gerelyn Terzo Most of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported Q1 earnings already, and according to Factset data, the results are largely impressive. Of the companies that have reported already, over three-quarters (78%) of S&amp;P 500 companies have revealed a positive EPS surprise, while more than half (62%) of them have surprised to the upside on revenue.

This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets came out of the gate lower across the board this morning after managing to eke out slight gains yesterday. Yesterday&#8217;s market performance marked the sixth straight day of gains for the S&amp;P 500, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also moved higher.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended SNOW Earnings Expectations 1:45 pm by Gerelyn Terzo As earnings season rolls on, Snowflake (Nasdaq: SNOW) is certainly on the radar of Wall Street analysts, with the cloud-based AI data storage firm set to report results this week. Expectations are largely high, anticipating a strong performance from the company. Analyst firms such as Jefferies, Goldman Sachs, and Evercore ISI are all forecasting an outperformance for Snowflake, citing its demonstrated resilience even amid the recent tariff challenges. Jefferies analysts, in particular, have already taken action, boosting their price target on the stock to $200 per share, indicating a potential 20.8% upside. This sense of bullishness comes as the broader markets remain under pressure, including a 0.24% decline in the SPY ETF. Earnings Roundup 11:35 am by Gerelyn Terzo With the first-quarter earnings season still unfolding, the performance of most S&amp;P 500 companies has proven notably robust. FactSet data illustrates this strength: a significant 78% of reporting S&amp;P 500 firms delivered a positive earnings per share (EPS) surprise, and over half (62%) also exceeded revenue forecasts. Despite these strong results, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon sounded a cautionary note, suggesting that Wall Street&#8217;s current earnings estimates for S&amp;P 500 companies may still need to be adjusted downward amidst ongoing tariff uncertainty. The SPY ETF remains lower by 0.26% as of late morning trading. BofA: Stock Market Sentiment Is Looking Up 10:29 am by Gerelyn Terzo A recent report from Bank of America indicates a notable shift in broader stock market sentiment. The firm&#8217;s equity risk-love indicator has now transitioned from a state of deep panic recorded last month to a neutral reading in its latest assessment. Historically, such an improvement often signals that stocks may soon retest their previous record-high levels. The SPY ETF is currently down a slight 0.30%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets opened on a subdued note across the board this morning, with all three of the major stock market averages edging lower. If the S&amp;P 500 can turn it around like it did yesterday, it will mark its seventh-straight winning session for the broader market index. The SPY ETF remains lower by a slight 0.30%. After Moody&#8217;s cut the U.S. debt rating by one notch, Deutsche Bank responded with its assessment that the U.S. economy is experiencing a &#8220;death by a thousand cuts.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not as bad as it sounds. Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Jim Reid wrote, “Yesterday felt like we were somewhere along the line of a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ with regards to the U.S. fiscal situation. Hard to know where in that thousand we are but probably much nearer a thousand than at zero even as yesterday saw an initial sell-off reverse as the session went on.” Despite the broader market&#8217;s struggles, Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is an outlier, climbing 3% and offering some counterweight to the losses seen in the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. Tesla boss Elon Musk vowed to remain at the helm of the EV maker for the next five years. On the Dow, Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has indicated it won&#8217;t pass tariff-related costs onto consumers, a different approach compared to fellow Dow component Walmart (NYSE: WMT), which had earlier signaled price increases. Here’s a look at the performance as of mid-morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 98.87 (-0.23%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 95.66 (-0.49%) S&amp;P 500: Down 20.48 (-0.33%) Market Movers Quantum computing stocks are capturing attention. D-Wave Quantum (Nasdaq: QBTS) surged as much as 20% this morning after launching its newest quantum computing system. The company&#8217;s Advantage2 system, now accessible via the cloud, represents its most powerful offering yet, boasting enhanced energy efficiency and reduced noise. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) is adding 3.3% to its value today, nearing its 52-week high. Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE: NCLH) is shedding 3.2% of its value, and Airbnb (Nasdaq: ABNB) is down 3.1% following an order from Spain to delist tens of thousands of short-term rental properties.

Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Q1 Earnings Surprises 12:32 pm by Gerelyn Terzo The bulk of S&amp;P 500 companies have now unveiled their Q1 earnings, and the consensus from FactSet data points to a largely impressive showing. Among those that have already reported, more than three-quarters (78%) of S&amp;P 500 companies posted a positive EPS surprise, while close to two-thirds (62%) also beat their revenue projections. This positive trend, however, is tempered by a warning from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who cautions that Wall Street&#8217;s earnings estimates on S&amp;P 500 companies have further to decline given persistent tariff uncertainty. The SPX ETF remains lower by 0.42%. Stock Market Outlook: BofA 10:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Bank of America, investor sentiment regarding the wider stock market has seen an uptick. The Wall Street firm&#8217;s equity risk-love indicator, which showed deep panic just last month, has most recently registered a neutral position. Should the pattern persist, this positive change suggests that equities could soon move to challenge their all-time highs. The SPX ETF remains lower by 0.35%. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. Markets began the day on a weaker footing today, largely giving back the slight advances seen yesterday. Yesterday&#8217;s session was notable for extending the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s winning streak to six straight days, with both the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also moving into positive territory. The SPX ETF is lower by 0.35% as of mid-morning trading. Moody&#8217;s downgraded the U.S. debt rating, prompting Deutsche Bank to declare the U.S. economy is experiencing a &#8220;death by a thousand cuts.&#8221; But the outlook also suggests the U.S. economy is at the tail end of that downward spiral. Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid wrote in a note, “Yesterday felt like we were somewhere along the line of a ‘death by a thousand cuts’ with regards to the U.S. fiscal situation. Hard to know where in that thousand we are but probably much nearer a thousand than at zero even as yesterday saw an initial sell-off reverse as the session went on.” Amidst the overall declines, Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) stands out, gaining 3% and helping to cushion the drops in the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500. Dow component Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has signaled it won&#8217;t be passing on tariff-related expenses to customers, a contrasting strategy to Walmart (NYSE: WMT), another Dow component, which had previously indicated such plans before the White House urged them otherwise. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 58.88 (-0.14%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 59.95 (-0.31%) S&amp;P 500: Down 12.18 (-0.20%) Market Movers The quantum computing sector is making headlines, driven by D-Wave Quantum (Nasdaq: QBTS), which saw its shares jump by up to 20%. This surge follows the release of its latest quantum computing system, the Advantage2, now available through the cloud. The company highlights this as its most potent quantum offering to date, featuring improved energy performance and lower operational noise. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) is up 3.3% and inching closer to its 52-week high. Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE: NCLH) is losing 3.2% of its value. Airbnb (Nasdaq: ABNB) is down 3.1% after Spanish authorities mandated the removal of numerous short-term rental listings.

For many Millennials with parents approaching their late 60s and 70s, it&#8217;s time to start talking retirement planning. Undoubtedly, individuals are under no obligation to help finance their parents&#8217; retirement. But for those who have more than enough (and are perhaps already retired themselves), it can make sense to give them a bit of a boost or step in as a sort of caregiver. In this piece, we&#8217;ll check in on a specific Reddit case involving a Millennial couple who&#8217;s pulling in a respectable combined income of $160,000. With no kids in the equation, they&#8217;re effectively in the DINK (dual income, no kids) camp, with potentially enough financial flexibility to help the parents make up for lost time since they&#8217;re nearing the retirement finish line and coming up well short of an amount that&#8217;d be enough to fund a comfortable retirement. Though things can get tricky when balancing one&#8217;s own priorities with those of the parents, striving for balance can be a good thing. And in this piece, we&#8217;ll go over the Reddit user&#8217;s plan as well as pitfalls they should avoid as they attempt the ultimate balancing act of middle age. Key Points This Reddit user wants to help their parents retire. And they&#8217;re willing to do so at their own expense. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Taking the role of a retirement planner First up, our Reddit user is putting on their retirement planner hat by getting a better sense of their parents&#8217; broader financial situation. Indeed, crunching all the numbers (assets versus liabilities as well as cash inflows and outflows) and listening to wants, concerns, and expectations are all a must before lending a helping hand. After all, it&#8217;s hard to tell where one can improve their financial circumstances without carefully analyzing the balance sheet and cash flows. And though being 100% financially transparent with a child can seem like a stretch, it&#8217;s a necessary step. Otherwise, one would effectively be flying blind, and that&#8217;s never a good idea if one&#8217;s playing catch-up on retirement. Even if our Reddit user is financially literate, I think it still makes sense to bring on board a financial advisor. They can help in areas where our Reddit user can&#8217;t. Perhaps health insurance plans and investment asset allocation are areas where an advisor could bring value to the table. Trimming away at monthly expenses Our Reddit user has had all the right conversations and has decided to give their parents a bit of a financial boost well before a disaster (think a health expense) can happen. Before plowing a big chunk of one&#8217;s paycheck into the parents&#8217; retirement funds, though, I&#8217;d suggest exploring ways to trim away at monthly expenses. For many folks, housing is the loftiest expense. And it may be the one to trim away at first. If the retirement situation really is getting tight, perhaps moving the parents in (a multi-generational household) is a great way to free up extra cash to be invested in an S&amp;P 500 ETF or something of the sort for the retirement fund. If there are more generations under one household, added savings can be had from sharing a vehicle and buying in bulk at the local grocery store (think Costco). All considered, I think such a move is more of a must if our Reddit user is serious about helping their parents make up for lost time. Not compromising on one&#8217;s own retirement is vital. It&#8217;s a noble thing to help out one&#8217;s parents financially, especially if they&#8217;re due to come up short come retirement, even after Social Security and pensions are considered. That said, our Reddit user shouldn&#8217;t risk their own retirement, especially if they&#8217;re behind various milestones already. In any case, with a relatively high income and no kids to worry about, I do see the balance of saving for one&#8217;s own retirement and those of the parents as achievable, provided the right steps are taken to axe out unnecessary costs. In short, this Reddit user seems to be on the right track, but should ensure they&#8217;re not putting their parents above themselves or their partner.

(Walmart has 4,600 in the United States, and it ranked 81st.) 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Grocery retailer Trader Joe’s has topped the reputation ranking in the Axios Harris Poll 100 for 2025. It edged out Microsoft, Toyota, Costco, and others. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) The study&#8217;s methodology involved three waves of surveys. The first asked consumers to rank the best and worst companies. The second survey determined the 100 companies. The third asked about “contextual” issues, including opinions about brands and topics, including politics. These were in the field from January through mid-May. Following Trader Joe’s on the list were clothing company Patagonia, Microsoft, Toyota, and retail giant Costco. Trader Joe’s rose 12 spots from last year’s list. Trader Joe’s seems to have a cult following. It targets building local communities through grants to nonprofits, along with food and beverage donations, Trader Joe’s is known among its customers for an unusual level of transparency. This has to do with food prices, why some items are discontinued, and why prices differ from location to location. It also rarely sells products that carry another company’s brands Trader Joe’s also has several unique methods used to target customers. Its traditional direct marketing includes newsletters. Content in what it calls The Fearless Flyer is based on anecdotes and stories about products it sells. The theory behind it appears to be that it cements its relationship with shoppers. The company uses podcasts and recipes for similar reasons. Axios Harris Poll 100 produces non-traditional results. Trader Joe’s and Patagonia are niche companies. Microsoft, Toyota, and Costco are among the largest companies that do business in the United States, as well as among America’s most well-known brands. It also lists J.C.

JOLIET, IL — June 12 will mark the four-year anniversary since 50-year-old Wendy Gessing, who worked at the Crest Hill Pizzas By Marchelloni, vanished during her Saturday night work shift at the pizza parlor on Theodore Street and Raynor Avenue. She has never been seen alive since her disapperance. This week, in an unrelated investigation, Joliet police arrested her 28-year-old son, Joshua ""Josh"" Gessing, who now lives in Wilmington, according to the arrest report. Josh Gessing continues to have run-ins with Joliet police and area law enforcement in recent years. He was jailed by Joliet police for four days in 2023 in connection with driving under the influence charges. According to Joliet police spokesman Dwayne English, the 28-year-old Gessing was captured on Tuesday and put into the Will County Jail for having an outstanding Will County arrest warrant. On Tuesday, at 12:45 p.m., Joliet's officers responded to the Walmart at 2424 W. Jefferson St. regarding a retail theft investigation. Upon arrival, the officers learned that the Walmart staff had initially detained a man as part of a retail theft investigation, but determined no charges would be pursued. Officers identified the man as Gessing and determined he held an active Will County arrest warrant for possession of controlled substances, according to English. Gessing was placed into custody without incident, English noted. Will County Jail indicate the Gessing was released from the jail on Wednesday afternoon. Back in October 2021, Gessing was the subject of a Joliet Patch crime story headlined, ""Criminal Charges Dropped Against Crest Hill's Joshua Gessing."" At that time, he was 25 years old. Patch reported that Josh Gessing spent four days in the Will County jail in connection with allegations he attacked a 44-year-old male relative late on a Friday night at a house on Joliet's west side. Joliet police officers arrested Josh Gessing on charges of aggravated domestic battery causing great bodily harm. During a short phone interview at that time, Josh Gessing told Joliet Patch he was the victim of a wrongful arrest by the Joliet Police Department. ""It was a wrongful arrest,"" he said.

Shares of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) gained 16.64% over the past month, joining in the broad market&#8217;s rally that has been propelled by the announcement of a 90-day tariff pause between the U.S. and China. However, the stock is still struggling longer-term, with a year-to-date loss of 16.85% and a nearly 22% loss since hitting its one-year high on Jan. 17, 2025. Long before there was Venmo and Cash App, there was PayPal. The pioneer of online payments was founded in 1998 in San Jose, Calf. Four years later, it went public and was then acquired by eBay, Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY) later in 2022. But in 2015, eBay spun the company off to its shareholders, and PayPal has been an independent company ever since. Since then, the company&#8217;s online payments services have exploded in popularity, with its market cap peaking at $356.75 billion in July 2021. That coincided with the stock reaching its all-time high of $308.53. However, the company has endured some growing pains since then, which have resulted in its market cap being reduced to the current $60.96 billion and shares having fallen more than -80% from their all-time high in July 2021. But for prospective investors looking for growth opportunity, PayPal sits in the midst of an industry undergoing explosive growth. According to Grand View Research, the global fintech service market is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.5% from 2023 to 2030. This expected industry growth bodes very well for shareholders. And despite the stock being down significantly from its all-time high, PayPal has gained 43.68% in 2024, outpacing the S&amp;P 500 over the same period. 24/7 Wall Street has performed an analysis that suggests there is still a big-time upside potential for the fintech company before the end of the decade. Here is where prospective investors and current shareholders might expect from PayPal over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: Globally, the fintech service market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.5% from 2023 to 2030, and in the U.S. alone, that growth is forecast for 16.6% over the same time. PayPal isn&#8217;t simply processing payments between friends or businesses, but participating in a major shift that involves &#8220;fintech solution providers that consistently introduce novel technologies like AI, blockchain and data analytics, with the potential to reshape financial services and streamline operational effectiveness,&#8221; according to Grand View Research. Online payments is a segment seeing exponential growth, and that has translated into a series of successive earnings beats for PayPal, which are likely to continue as the company gains more market share. Payment service providers, or PSPs, are now being tasked with with expanded service demands, like fraud mitigation, improving collection processes and reconsidering markets where profitable growth may be possible but has previously exceeded most institutions’ risk appetite, such as the gaming industry, according to consultancy firm McKinsey &amp; Co.

PayPal&#8217;s Recent Stock Success Since officially being spun off from eBay on July 10, 2015, shares of PayPal enjoyed an incredible run before hitting their all-time high in July 2021, gaining over 789%. That surge was largely fueled from the arrival of COVID-19, which saw a dramatic shift to online buying. From its pandemic low on $86.68 on March 20, 2020, the stock rewarded shareholders with gains of 256% over the subsequent six quarters. However, the end of the pandemic coupled with increased competition began to erode the company&#8217;s market share since, which has forced PayPal to begin diversifying its business segments in order to expand customer services and differentiate itself from newcomers like Stripe, Amazon Pay, Apple Pay and Square. Year Share Price Revenue* Net Income* 2015 $36.20 $9.192 $1.551 2016 $39.47 $10.839 $1.816 2017 $73.62 $12.983 $2.281 2018 $83.26 $15.460 $2.883 2019 $109.40 $17.750 $3.654 2020 $234.20 $21.418 $4.519 2021 $188.58 $25.349 $5.466 2022 $71.22 $27.500 $4.722 2023 $61.41 $29.614 $5.521 *Revenue and net income in $billions Since 2015 when PayPal was again a publicly traded company, its total annual revenue grew by more than 222% through 2023. However, the two aforementioned headwinds beginning in 2021 — increased competition and the end of the pandemic — saw its share price careen despite steadily increased revenue and consistent net income. At the same time, PayPal became mired in debt repayment, which jumped from $361 million in 2021 to $1.05 billion in 2023. Nonetheless, as the Silicon Valley fixture looks towards the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to positively impact PayPal’s growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of PayPal&#8217;s Stock Performance 1. Demand for Digital Payments Is Exploding. Data from Statista indicates that digital payments from PSPs has exploded from $6.25 trillion in 2017 to $15.46 trillion in 2023 — a 147% increase. That figure is forecast to reach $36.75 trillion in 2029, $23.50 trillion of which will be made in mobile payments alone. PayPal&#8217;s seamless integration, which is used in 200 countries and regions and with 25 different currencies, is likely to face increased demand as merchants who rely on it look to capitalize on rapid customer onboarding and user-friendliness, both of which are expected to drive the digital payments market in the near and medium terms. The company is already well-positioned, with its digital financial network accounting for 220 million active customers each month, making it one of the world’s largest PSP in the world. 2. Strong Earnings and Revenue Has Continued. Despite the stock&#8217;s slide since midway 2021, PayPal has time and again posted strong quarterly earnings and revenue. Since the fourth quarter of 2020, the company has beat on earnings 16 out of 19 quarters. It is a similar story for reported quarterly revenue over that period. That has left the company with a healthy cash position, with free cash flow exploding in growth from $3.37 billion in 2019 to a current trailing 12-month (TTM) position of $6.71 billion. That is good for an increase of more than 99% in five years. 3. PayPal Credit and Buy Now, Pay Later Is Expanding the Company&#8217;s Breadth. Beyond being a PSP, PayPal has branched out to other business sectors that are likely to bolster revenue as they experience similar CAGRs: credit and buy now, pay later. These services are already offered at major retailers and online merchants, like Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD), Temu and eBay, for example. The site provides consumers with a line of revolving credit through Synchrony Financial (NYSE: SYF). In 2023, of PayPal&#8217;s nearly $30 billion in revenue, $27 billion came from transaction revenues, with PSP transactions representing more than 90% of the company&#8217;s total revenue. Meanwhile, revenues from its other business segments — including interest and fees through its credit offerings — were over $2.91 billion, which represented roughly 9% of the company&#8217;s revenue. However, Grand View Research projects the buy now, pay later industry to undergo CAGR of 24.3% from 2023 to 2030, meaning this business segment for PayPal could see its revenue growth outpace the company&#8217;s traditional PSP offerings by the end of this decade. PayPal (PYPL) Stock Prediction in 2025 The current median one-year price target for PayPal is $82.48, representing upside potential of 15.13% over the next 12 months from its current share price. Of the 33 analysts covering PayPal, the stock receives a consensus rating of &#8220;Moderate Buy,&#8221; with 15 analysts assigning it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, 16 assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating and two assigning it a &#8220;Sell&#8221; rating. By the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall St.&#8216;s forecast for shares of PYPL is $81.15, good for 13.27% upside potential based on an annualized EPS estimate of $4.93 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio estimate of 16. PayPal (PYPL) Stock Forecast 2025–2030 Year Revenue* EPS 2025 $33.663 $4.93 2026 $36.048 $5.44 2027 $39.631 $6.96 2028 $42.668 $7.37 2029 $48.195 $8.09 2030 $52.076 $9.59 *Revenue in $billions PayPal&#8217;s (PYPL) Price Target for 2025–2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates PayPal&#8217;s stock to be trading for $134.26 per share, representing a 73.80% increase from its current price, based on revenue of $52.076 billion and an annualized EPS of $9.59.

Risk tolerance is a very subjective topic. It is a necessary qualifying component of the KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols for financial professionals, and is implemented to establish levels of investment risk that a new customer is comfortable taking. While the ideal investment delivers big capital appreciation and AAA principal safety, the maxim “no guts no glory” applies also to investing, where the largest returns are generally the ones that are the riskiest ventures. Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) are a popular vehicle for diversified investments, as they can be bought and sold online with ease and are usually subject to lower fees than mutual funds. ETFs come in a wide range of configurations, and are generally passively managed and designed to mimic the performance of designated market indexes. Key Points Dividend growth, in the majority of cases, is a stock indicator of a company’s business success, since dividend growth usually is commensurate with profit growth.

The S&amp;P U.S. Dividend Growers Index is one such benchmark. Containing Dividend Kings (50 or more consecutive years of increased dividends) and Dividend Aristocrats (25 or more years in a row of increased dividends), this index contains Fortune 500 companies whose businesses are historically profitable enough that they can afford to continue higher dividend payouts year after year. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF (NYSE: VIG) is a popular ETF with a portfolio reflecting this exact index. Founded in 2006, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF strives for a mix of capital appreciation and income from dividend growth companies, i.e. those with a history of dividend increases accompanying growth. Its yield is 1.87% and it has a 0.05% expense ratio. The dividend increases have to be consistent for a minimum of 10 years to warrant inclusion. Surprisingly, the top 25% companies with the highest yields are excluded from the 330+ stocks on the VIG roster. VIG has a Morningstar gold ETF ranking. It had $101.79 billion assets under management (AUM) as of the time of this writing. A look at VIG’s top 10 holdings shows how its criteria differ from S&amp;P 500 Index ETFs, which are usually led by Magnificent 7 stocks, based on market cap size: Broadcom Microsoft Apple Eli Lilly JP Morgan Chase Visa, Inc. Exxon Mobil MasterCard Costco Wholesale Walmart The VIG Dividend Difference As the calculator demonstrates, a $15,000 investment in VIG back in January, 2020 would be worth $25,833.91 today, at the time of this writing, which equates to a 72.23% ROI. The total return would be $10,833.91. The annualized return equates to 10.62%. This calculation also includes compounding through reinvested dividends. The reinvested dividend value is $2,425.58. The actual cash dividends paid out from the initial 119.67 shares equates to $1,849.45. If the dividends are not reinvested, the total return would be $8,408.33. Therefore, reinvesting the dividends enabled an additional return differential of $2,425.58 over the 5 year span. The Dividend Reinvestment Advantage For Safer Returns Dividend stocks with annual payout growth can boost capital appreciation through compounding, or provide extra income in the case of emergencies. As the charts demonstrate, reinvesting dividends contributed a 22% boost to ROI, while overall capital appreciation growth still averaged over 10% annually. Dividend Reinvestment Programs (DRIP) can automatically implement purchases of additional shares without additional fees or order entries, if one is so inclined. In the case of an ETF such as VIG, investors with weaker stomachs for volatility can sleep more easily, knowing that their portfolios are still growing albeit without the roller coaster ride delivered by Nvidia, for example. Another plus to VIG is that since it contains both current and potential future Dividend King and Dividend Aristocrat stocks, the dividend amounts will continue to grow with each passing year. This will, in turn, increase the amount of additional shares that can be obtained under a DRIP agreement. This is a classic compounding model for health building that can work for the benefit of many investors. On the contingency side, the investor can always cancel the DRIP agreement if there is an emergency need for the dividend income pending, since it can always be renewed at a later date after the crisis has passed.

Key Points I swear by these three blue-chip dividend kings that have generated regular income for me. These are rock-solid businesses with the ability to increase their dividends in the future. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) I started my investment journey at a young age and my secret to investing is to buy blue-chip dividend stocks. All I wanted was steady passive income and I built a portfolio of some of the Dividend Aristocrats that never let me down. No matter where you are in your investment journey, if your goal is to make money through investments, pick dividend companies. Choose companies that have a history of rewarding shareholders and you will always have income flowing into your bank account. I’ve invested in these three dividend stocks for a decade and I’ve managed to build a resilient portfolio through dividend reinvestment. Coca-Cola A blue-chip dividend stock, Coca-Cola is a globally recognized brand. Over 100 years old, the company has expanded its offerings keeping the changing consumer preferences in mind. It owns some of the most famous brands including Coke, Minute Maid, Sprite, and Fanta. The company has a long-term growth strategy driven by successful marketing, innovation, and brand strength. In the first quarter, it reported a 6% rise in organic revenue and a 5% jump in price/mix. Coca-Cola has the pricing power to remain resilient even in times of geopolitical uncertainty. Exchanging hands for $71, KO stock is up 14% year-to-date and 11% in six months. The stock’s current dividend yield is 2.87% and it has increased dividends for 63 consecutive years which speaks a lot about the management. It has an annual dividend growth rate of 5.36% and a five-year growth rate of 4.07%. Coca-Cola’s 10-year dividend growth rate is 4.67%. When I bought the stock a decade ago, its annual dividend yield was 4.12% which remained steady until 2019. Since 2019, it has remained below 4% while the annual payout has steadily increased. The annual payout amount is currently the highest in the decade at $1.94 and the annual year-over-year payout growth is 5.43% Coca-Cola has a history of delivering steady gains despite market ups and downs. The company has remained resilient in times of a pandemic, and geopolitical tensions which makes it my top choice. Walmart Inc. When I invested in Walmart in 2015, it was the most convenient way to shop. With over 4,600 locations in the U.S., I could always find a Walmart near me. Founded 8 decades ago, the company is one of the largest retailers in terms of revenue. A blue-chip stock, Walmart has never disappointed. Despite the growing popularity of e-commerce, Walmart has retained its top spot. The company has paid a regular quarterly dividend for 51 years and it has a payout ratio of 51.04% which shows that the company is reinvesting the remaining of its earnings in the business. This also means there is a potential for a higher dividend in the coming years. Walmart’s dividend yield is 0.98% and its five-year dividend growth rate is 4.41%. Its 4-year average dividend yield is 1.39%. WMT stock’s 10-year dividend growth rate is 3.26% which is lower than the sector median of 5.93% but I like the stability Walmart brings to my investment portfolio. The Dividend King boosted the dividend by 13% recently. Exchanging hands for $95, the stock is up 6.5% year to date and 47% in the year. In the first quarter, it saw a 4.5% year-over-year jump in same-store sales, and advertising sales were up 50%. Walmart is investing in e-commerce and advertising which has helped with revenue growth. Truist Securities analyst has a price target of $111 per share and a buy rating. The business is stronger than ever and I’d hold on to the stock for at least another five years. Chevron Corporation I’ve always believed that the oil and gas sector is one of the most prominent sectors of the economy. There will never be a time when the world will not need oil and this means Chevron Corporation will never run out of business. Yes, the energy industry is volatile and the changing crude oil prices impact the stock but Chevron has managed to remain steady amid the volatility. A dividend stock, the company has increased dividends for 38 consecutive years. It has an attractive dividend yield of 4.8%, higher than the industry average of 3.6%. The company has a dividend payout ratio of 70.97% showing the management’s commitment towards rewarding shareholders. The quarterly dividends have gone from $1.07 in 2015 to $1.71 in 2025. Its 10-year dividend growth rate is 4.55% while the 3-year dividend growth rate is 6.56%. Chevron stock has never disappointed. It is up 49% in 5 years but the current market volatility and the drop in crude oil prices have impacted the stock which has lost 7.78% value year-to-date. Trading for $135, the stock is very close to the 52-week low of $132 and I consider this a solid chance to buy. Crude oil prices will rise and there will always be oil demand. Chevron has several assets that will keep generating revenue, one of the most prominent ones in the Permian basin. It is a rock-solid business with an attractive balance sheet and a steady dividend payout.

Shares of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) lost 2.29% over the past five trading sessions, halting a rally that has seen the stock gain 23.16% since its year-to-date low of $167.32 on April 21. On the year, the e-commerce giant has seen its stock lose 6.42% despite beating on EPS and revenue by 16.77% and 0.35%, respectively, in Q1. Tempered forward guidance due to President Trump&#8217;s tariffs continues to cloud Amazon&#8217;s outlook. However, with the U.S. and China agreeing to a 90-day reduction in tariffs on May 11, there is renewed hope for the consumer discretionary mainstay, who has seen its one-year gain diminished to 12.28%. In its recent earnings call, Amazon reported that Q1 revenue growth and an operating income increase. Amazon Ads generated $13.9 billion in revenue alone, representing a 19% year-over-year increase, while AWS grew by 17% year-over-year to an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. Still, the stock remains down nearly 15% in 2025, with its one-year gain having been erased in Q1, which now stands at a 0.79% loss. In early April, Piper Sandler lowered its price target for Amazon to $215 from $265; however, the firm maintained its &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating saying it is looking for Q1 revenue of $153B and within the $151B–$155B guidance range. Piper forecasts AWS growth of 17% year-over-year. For Q2, the firm anticipates a guidance range of $157B–$162B and op income guidance of $14B–$18B. Piper lowered its 2025 ads revenue growth by about 1% and online stores and 3P services. Still, while there can be little doubt about its current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. Key Points in This Article: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock.

In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,188%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Since hitting its all-time high on Feb. 4, the stock has sunk 15.15%. Note that Wall Street analysts&#8217; $240.62 consensus price target is just shy of Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year. Of the 48 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Loop Capital and Wells Fargo recently reiterated buy-equivalent ratings, and with 64.01% of shares held by institutional investors — including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 2,927 position increases versus 2,426 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $195.00 -5.02% Median $240.62 17.19% High $305.00 48.55% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumers appear to be pulling back on spending due to ongoing inflation, contracting GDP in Q1 and the possibility of a recession in 2025. Over the past month, however, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed admirably, posting a gain of 18.14%, second only to tech&#8217;s gain of 21.31% over the same period. That rebound represents a stark difference from the sector&#8217;s last-place performance among the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s 11 sectors through Q1 2025. While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.

Analysts at Oppenheimer reiterated an outperform rating on Walmart, with a price target of $115 from $110. “Following a more difficult backdrop to start the year due to unexpected tariff and expense headwinds, we believe a positive guidance revision cycle could again materialize soon,” said the firm, as also quoted by CNBC. The Nasdaq is pushing even higher. Last trading at 23,995 in premarket, it could easily test 25,000 over the next few days. Helping, inflation data was tamer than expected, cooling investor fears that tariffs are not having a substantial impact on prices.

For the full year, the company expects for revenue to range from $ 5.15 billion to $5.35 billion, which is above expectations for $5.05 billion revenue.

Shares of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) gained 3.90% over the past five trading sessions, bringing the e-commerce and cloud storage solutions stock&#8217;s year-to-date gain to 4.91%. Over the past year, it is up 29.63%. AMZN&#8217;s most recent catalyst came in mid-August when the company announced it will begin offering customers same-day grocery delivery. On July 8, it was reported that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sold nearly three million shares worth $665.8 million over two days in July as part of a plan announced earlier in 2025 that will see Bezos unload up to 25 million shares through May 2026. In its Q2 earnings call on July 31, the company reported that net sales increased 13% to $167.7 billion in the second quarter, compared with $148.0 billion in the year-prior quarter. Net income increased to $18.2 billion, or $1.68 per diluted share, compared with $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per diluted share, in Q2 2024. However, free cash flow decreased to $18.2 billion TTM, compared with $53.0 billion TTM the year prior due to Amazon&#8217;s ongoing CapEx on AI. In June and July the stock saw a series of adjusted price targets. Analysts at Stifel ($262 from $245), Barclays ($275 from $240), Bank of America ($272 from $265), Piper Sandler ($255 from $250), Capital ($270 from $233), Citi ($265 from $225), Needham ($265 from $220), Cantor Fitzgerald ($260 from $240), Truist ($250 from $226), all recently upgraded their price targets for AMZN. Amazon announced in July that it has deployed its 1 millionth robot while also deploying its new AI foundation model to power its robotic fleet. Its first twelfth generation automated fulfillment center launched in late-2024 and the robots are primarily focused on delivery station efficiencies. The robotics cycle is &#8220;early,&#8221; according to Bank of America&#8217;s analyst, who expects Amazon to leverage robots to reduce labor dependency, increase order accuracy and improve warehouse efficiency, driving material cost savings. While there can be little doubt about Amazon&#8217;s current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Amazon? In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,491%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Wall Street analysts&#8217; median price target of $265.22 is above Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year and good for potential upside of 14.79%. Of the 45 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. With 64.88% of shares held by institutional investors — including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 3,196 position increases versus 2,166 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $240 3.88% Median $265.22 14.79% High $300.00 29.85% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumer spending has rebounded in the wake of Trump&#8217;s tariff threats and subsequent pauses, which could help GDP in Q2 after it contracted GDP in Q1, raising the risks of a possible recession in 2025. Over the past three months, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed the third best, posting a gain of 6.22%. While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.

Markets are down slightly, taking a breather from a winning streak on hopes for a rate cut in September. At the moment, the Nasdaq is down about 45 points. The Dow is down about 19, with the S&amp;P 500 down about eight points. The Federal Reserve will remain in focus this week, as central bank members meet in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for their annual symposium. Investors will be listening for any clues about the future path of interest rates. As noted by Yahoo Finance, “Ahead of Powell&#8217;s speech — likely to be his last as Fed chair — markets are placing the probability the Fed will cut rates by at least 0.25% next month at around 85%. Clues from Powell about the speed and depth of the cycle the Fed is about to embark on will be the week&#8217;s biggest market-moving event.” Aside from the central bank, investors are waiting on earnings from Home Depot, Lowe’s, Target, and Walmart. All are under the microscope, with concerns about the strength of the U.S. consumer mounting. Helping, analysts at Evercore ISI just added Target to its tactical outperform list, noting that Target earnings could be better than expected. “So, in our view, a relief rally could result, especially if trends into 2H show any BTS (back to school) improvement, with potential mgmt change and stimulus proving hope into 2026. In recent days, much has been made of the Target / Ulta partnership ending, yet we believe Target is hunting for new partners and/or opportunities to scale, for example, with Warby Parker,” as quoted by CNBC. Stock Upgrades: RBC Capital Just Upgraded Sunrun RBC Capital analysts just upgraded Sunrun to an outperform rating with a price target of $16 from $12. As a catalyst, the firm pointed to guidance from the Treasury Department on how renewable projects might qualify for tax credits. “While the act terminates investment and production tax credits for solar and wind projects after 2027, projects that start construction within 12 months of the passage of the act can still claim credits beyond this deadline,” according to CNBC. Bank of America reiterated a buy rating on Apple, noting, “Services has been, and we expect will continue to be, the leading driver of y/y gross profit dollar growth. Reiterate Buy on stable cash flows, earnings resiliency, and strong capital return program.” Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating on Nvidia, giving it a $206 price target. The firm noted, “While the near-term bar is higher now, the 12-month picture across demand, supply, and competitive outlook all continue to be very favorable.” The post Nasdaq Composite Live: All Eyes are on Jackson Hole Symposium appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",452.0,237.0,11.0,4.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.046413502109704644,0.016877637130801686,0.02531645569620253,0.004219409282700422,0.0,0.029535864978902954
