The new 400,000 square-foot facility, located at 1625 Heilmandale Road, will bring nearly 1,000 additional jobs to the area, 500 of which were hired in advance. Once implemented, the facility’s automated technology can enable three times more volume to flow throughout the center and help Walmart deliver the right product to the right store, so customers can find the products they need. The Lebanon consolidation center will service all 42 regional distribution centers across the U.S., with plans to service fulfillment centers in the near future. This building will be the second of its kind in Walmart’s supply chain. The first, located in Colton, Calif., opened in 2019. Consolidation centers have a specialized role in moving products quickly on their journey to store shelves, and ultimately, the customer. Each has the ability to receive general merchandise items from suppliers in smaller freight loads, known in the industry as less than a truckload (LTL) and consolidate them into larger freight loads, known as full truckloads (TL). Then the product is shipped to regional distribution centers where it is sorted for distribution to stores. Suppliers will now be able to deliver merchandise to one singular location for consolidation versus shipping separate orders for each of the 42 regional distribution centers. This automation will unlock new benefits for suppliers through simplification of purchase order fulfillment, reduction of lead times and increased speed to customers. “We’ve made continued investments in our people, facilities and technology to ensure we have the right product, in the right place, at the right time,” said Mike Gray, senior vice president, supply chain operations at Walmart. “As part of these investments, the Lebanon facility will provide even more opportunities for small to medium sized suppliers who do not ship nationwide, the ability to provide product to all 4,700 Walmart stores.” Walmart’s growing modern supply chain network These high-tech consolidation centers support a broader focus on technology within Walmart’s supply chain. This year, the retailer announced plans to renovate all 42 regional distribution centers with automated technology. “Walmart is creating the future of supply chain—a modern system that pairs the latest in software and automation technologies, with a highly trained and specialized workforce of Walmart associates—to disrupt the industry as we know it,” said David Guggina, senior vice president of innovation & automation, Walmart U.S. “It’s an exciting time to join our second high tech consolidation center in Lebanon. At this facility, we’re implementing the technologies Walmart will continue to roll out throughout our supply chain network.” High-tech consolidation center brings careers to Lebanon Once staffed, Walmart will have 1,000 associates at the Lebanon consolidation center in roles ranging from Freight Handler to Operational Manager. Full-time positions qualify for Walmart’s total rewards and benefits plans, including medical, vision and dental insurance, 401(k) matching, paid time off, stock purchase plan and access to a 100% paid college tuition and books through Walmart’s Live Better U.

Walmart+ will soon be available for members with an added bonus – a Paramount+ Essential subscription at no extra cost. Walmart+ members will be able to stream premium entertainment as a benefit for the first time as part of their membership starting in September. The Paramount+ Essential Plan will give Walmart+ members access to Paramount+’s breadth of hugely popular content from acclaimed original dramas such as ""1883"" and ""Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,"" to the world's most popular preschool franchise, ""PAW Patrol,"" to recent blockbuster films such as ""Sonic the Hedgehog 2,"" to live sports. The streaming service benefit becomes yet another way Walmart is uniquely positioned to give members more for less with Walmart+, whether in-store, at the gas pump, on groceries, listening to music, and now when watching their favorite movies and shows. Walmart+ will remain $98 a year or $12.95 a month and include the Paramount+ Essential Plan subscription with an added $59 value. “We know Walmart+ is providing members real value in their every day – from grocery shopping to filling up their tank and more,” said Chris Cracchiolo, senior vice president and general manager of Walmart+. “With the addition of Paramount+, we are demonstrating our unique ability to help members save even more and live better by delivering entertainment for less, too. 85 percent of U.S. households use streaming services[1] and Paramount+ has the premium content and broad appeal that our members are looking for – like Walmart, they have something for everyone. We’re excited about the launch and what comes next for Walmart+.” “Paramount has enjoyed a close relationship with Walmart for years, and Walmart customers connect with Paramount's beloved brands, content, and characters every day through a range of consumer products available throughout Walmart stores,"" said Jeff Shultz, chief strategy officer and chief business development officer, Paramount Streaming. “Now, pairing Walmart’s expansive reach across the country with Paramount+'s broad and popular content that offers something for everyone is a unique opportunity to expand our partnership. Together we will bring Walmart+ members the full breadth of Paramount+ programming.” Walmart is consistently evolving to deliver against what’s most important for members – as a result, Walmart+ has had positive member growth every month since its launch in September 2020. Most recently, the retailer combined its InHome service into Walmart+ to create efficiency for members. As members seek more ways to save money, they can now consolidate a portion of their subscriptions and get entertainment through the membership.
