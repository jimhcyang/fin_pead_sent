    "text": "Walmart (NYSE: WMT) has a big problem. Tariffs of what could be 10% on some Chinese goods imported to the US will increase Walmart’s overall expenses substantially. The king of low priced retail may struggle to keep the title. About three quarters of Walmart’s suppliers are located in China. The world’s largest retailer counts on low cost manufacturing in China to allow it to offer its low retail prices while retaining good margins. Walmart has an expensive problem if tariffs bite. If it raises its merchandise prices customers may cut back spending, or shop elsewhere. Walmart has started to attack the tariff problem, although there is no certainty its plans will allow it to keep merchandise prices at current levels. According to Bloomberg, Walmart may be able to overcome a portions of the challenges. “Some suppliers, including producers of kitchenware and clothing, have been asked to lower their prices by as much as 10% per round of tariffs, essentially shouldering the full cost of Trump’s duties…”, the news service reports. However, another point is that Walmart’s China’s suppliers are already operating on razor thin margins. Walmart’s request may put China suppliers in the red. Walmart operates on thin margins already as well. In the most recent quarter, Walmart had revenue of $180.6 billion, and operation income of $7.9 billion. The operation margin is only 4.3%. The US Walmart margin is slightly better. Revenue was $125.3 billion and operating income of $6.5 billion which is 5.3%. Walmart will not get all of its suppliers to cut prices. That leaves it with a difficult choice. Should it risk charging higher prices and potentially losing customers? Or, should it keep prices the same and risk lower operating margins?

    "text": "With inflation already weighing heavily on American families, new tariffs on imported goods are set to intensify financial strain, particularly for low-income households. The impact of these levies—targeting everyday items like clothing, electronics, and groceries—will ripple through consumer spending habits and drive up costs in sectors where affordability is already a concern.Economists from Bank of America and BNP Paribas expect the February Consumer Price Index (CPI) report to provide the first clear indications of these tariffs&#8217; effect, with further increases anticipated in the coming months. As US retailers, including Target and Best Buy, brace for higher costs, long-term inflation expectations have climbed to near 30-year highs. The burden will fall hardest on those already struggling with rising living expenses, as businesses pass higher import costs onto consumers.Low-income consumers hit hardest by rising costsFamilies with tighter budgets, who typically allocate a larger share of their income to necessities, are particularly vulnerable to these price hikes. Goods sourced from China, Mexico, and Canada—such as furniture, fresh produce, and energy supplies—are becoming more expensive, compounding financial pressures on low-income consumers who have been dealing with high inflation and borrowing costs.Retail giants have already signaled that price increases are inevitable. Target CEO Brian Cornell has warned that tariffs on key imports, such as Mexican fruits and vegetables, will make it challenging to maintain stable pricing.Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, has also noted growing &#8220;stress behaviors&#8221; among budget-conscious shoppers, with some switching to smaller pack sizes or opting for less expensive alternatives. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, Walmart has begun negotiating with Chinese suppliers, requesting price cuts of up to 10% to mitigate the effects of tariffs. However, such efforts may not be enough to shield customers from rising costs.Inflation concerns escalate as consumer spending slowsHigher import duties are expected to act as a hidden tax on consumers, further slowing already tepid spending growth. The Federal Reserve’s latest Beige Book report has highlighted increased price sensitivity among shoppers, particularly for non-essential items.This shift in consumer behavior suggests that inflationary pressures are reshaping purchasing decisions, leading to a decline in demand for discretionary goods.David French, executive vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, has pointed out that these tariffs function as a &#8220;consumption tax,&#8221; disproportionately affecting lower-income families. Unlike traditional tax policies, these trade levies increase the cost of essential goods, making it harder for vulnerable households to maintain their standard of living.The economic consequences of these tariffs are particularly stark for households at the lower end of the income spectrum. Between February 2020 and June 2024, the poorest 20% of US households experienced an 8.3% faster rise in consumer prices compared to the wealthiest segment, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.This divergence in inflation rates has contributed to broader economic discontent, influencing voter sentiment in the 2024 election cycle.Trump’s tariff strategyDonald Trump’s current trade policies mark a significant shift from his first-term tariff approach, which initially focused on industrial materials like steel and aluminum. This time, the measures are far more aggressive, pushing average US tariff rates to their highest levels since World War II.The latest round of levies includes a broad array of consumer goods, raising concerns about prolonged inflationary effects.Despite the financial strain on households, the White House has defended the policy, arguing that tariffs will ultimately benefit American workers and businesses. A White House spokesperson stated that the administration’s strategy aims to &#8220;raise wages, create jobs, and expand investment,&#8221; dismissing concerns about short-term price increases as a &#8220;little disturbance&#8221; that the economy can absorb.However, for many American families already facing financial hardship, the reality is far more immediate. The combination of tariffs, stagnant wages, and existing economic pressures is making it increasingly difficult for some households to afford basic necessities.As the effects of these tariffs take hold, the question remains: how will struggling consumers navigate an economy where the cost of living continues to climb?The post US tariffs fuel inflation, putting pressure on low-income households appeared first on Invezz",

    "text": "In the history of the business world, it should go without saying that far more companies fail than succeed. This is an unfortunate truth, with as many as 20% of new businesses failing in their first year, 50% within 5 years and 65% within 10 years. Only 35% of companies, or around one-third according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, can celebrate a ten-year mark. Key Points It&#8217;s an unfortunate truth that more startups fail than succeed. The hope is that you don&#8217;t expand too quickly without ensuring a solid business foundation. Sometimes, ideas are too early to market, as Webvan shows, as grocery delivery is now widespread. 4 million Americans are set to retire this year. If you want to join them, click here now to see if you’re behind, or ahead. It only takes a minute. (Sponsor) The most challenging point for some businesses, especially founders and CEOs, is that their failures are very public. It’s one thing to fail and disappoint yourself and your family, but it’s an entirely different thing to fail on a global scale, let go of employees, and see yourself in headlines worldwide. 10. Pets.com Founded: 1998 Defunct: 2000 Amount lost: $110 million Why it failed: An unsustainable business model based on too high shipping costs The Dot-Com Burst The poster child for the dot-com era going bust, Pets.com was a company born in 1998 and with its massive war chest of startup money, it looked to conquer the pet product delivery market. On the positive side, Pets.com saw an influx of customer activity and orders, but company management spent too much on advertising before the company was bringing in enough revenue. As a result, the company went defunct after just two short years and while it may not be the most expensive failed startup, it’s one of the most memorable. 9. Anki Founded: 2010 Defunct: 2019 Amount lost: $205 million Why it failed: High-profile promise that was unable to meet customer expectations Robots For All The promise of Anki was a welcome one as an American robotics and AI startup that manufactured small robots for children. After receiving over $200 million in investments, the hope was that robots like Cozmo and Vector had emotional intelligence, making them a more ideal play “toy” for children. Unfortunately, the company failed to secure its last round of financing and its only place on the market was a palm-size toy that provided gibberish chitchat with children. 8. Abound Solar Founded: 2007 Defunct: 2012 Amount lost: $614 million Why it failed: Unproven technology and high costs were too much for the solar industry Affordable Solar Panels One of two solar startups to rank among the most expensive failed startups of all time, Abound Solar lost its investors almost $614 million over five years. In an industry where price is everything, Abound Solar didn’t have the right technology or at least reliable enough technology to reduce costs low enough to meet customer demand. Separately, this company should be a lesson on not relying too heavily on government subsidies that don’t help businesses avoid marketplace realities. 7. Webvan Founded: 1996 Defunct: 2001 Amount lost: $800 million Why it failed: Didn’t have the correct scale to match an overly ambitious delivery rollout service Groceries To Your Door The idea of door-to-door grocery delivery is a fantastic one that hits all the right spots today with services like Instacart, Shipt, and Walmart+. However, before these services, Webvan tried out a similar business starting in 1999, but it expanded too fast without building up the right amount of demand. Unfortunately, it spent a ton of money without a solid customer base and profits to sustain its quick growth. In other words, Webvan should have tested demand in a few markets before expanding. 6. Theranos Founded: 2003 Defunct: 2018 Amount invested: $700 million &#8211; $1.4 billion Why it failed: Inaccurate and misleading claims about technology Total Fraud Arguably the best-known name on this list, Theranos has become something of the poster-child for failed startups. With hundreds of millions in investments from some of the world’s wealthiest families like the Waltons, Carlos Slim, Betsy Devos, and more, Theranos promised a revolutionary blood-test process. Unfortunately, the technology wasn’t real and the company that was at one time worth $9 billion went up in smoke leaving investors holding the bag on everything and its CEO in jail. 5. Jawbone Founded: 1999 Defunct: 2017 Amount lost: $900 million Why it failed: Failure to properly market and sell its products Not So Wearable Before the Apple Watch helped solidify the wearable market once and for all, Jawbone attempted to do the same thing. Established in 1999, the company was heavily focused on wearables, Bluetooth headphones, and wireless speakers. Venture capitalists poured money into the company, giving it a $3.2 billion evaluation at its peak, but the best Jawbone could manage was only capturing 3% of the market by 2015 before it wound itself down in 2017. 4. Better Place Founded: 2007 Defunct: 2013 Amount lost: $850 &#8211; $900 million Why it failed: Mismanagement, increasing infrastructure costs The Pre-Tesla An electric vehicle startup founded by entrepreneur Shai Agassi in 2007, Better Place was poised to look as big, if not bigger, than Tesla. Raising between $850 and $900 million in capital, the company looked to build battery-swapping stations so users could extend the range of their cars. Unfortunately, infrastructure costs were high and the company couldn’t keep operations going indefinitely. 3. Solyndra Founded: 2005 Defunct: 2011 Amount lost: $1.2 billion Why it failed: Could not compete with conventional solar panel manufacturers The Solar Flare Out One of the most heavily promoted startups of all time, Solyndra seemed so promising that even the Obama administration offered them $535 million in loans alongside $1.2 billion in private fundraising. Unfortunately, timing is everything in the startup world, and Solyndra’s timing couldn’t have been worse in 2011, as prices tanked for many of the materials it needed to make its panels. As a result, the company folded and the hope for widespread solar technology along with it. 2. LeSports Founded: 2014 Defunct: 2017 Amount lost: $1.7 billion Why it failed: LeSports faced financial mismanagement while overpaying for broadcasting rights Streaming Failures With an investment of $1.7 billion, LeSports was poised to dominate the Hong Kong sports streaming industry. Backed by a cadre of big investors, the company suffered from poor management and aggressive expansion that left it unable to pay rent on its buildings at one point. The biggest lesson here is to ensure a sustainable revenue model before going to market and not to expand too quickly without ensuring profitability first. 1. Quibi Founded: 2018 Defunct: 2020 Amount lost: $1.75 billion Why it failed: Niche, mobile-only content didn’t resonate with the audience Most Expensive Of All-Time Widely considered the most expensive failed start-up of all time, Quibi couldn’t have been in a better place to succeed. With more than $1.75 billion invested, two massively well-known entertainment and business co-founders, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman, the mobile-only short-form content didn’t resonate with audiences. Quibi was too early to market with 10-minute episodes. Unlike TikTok, which is creator-focused, Quibi was too close to traditional television, which was its ultimate downfall.

    "text": "Retirement doesn&#8217;t have to be someone&#8217;s number-one priority as they get started on their professional journeys in their early-20s. That said, after one has settled into a new career, starting the retirement saving journey can put your head and shoulders above the crowd, as you aim to retire more comfortably. Furthermore, if you&#8217;re miles ahead in the game, perhaps the door to an early retirement (think the FIRE movements) could open, giving you more options as you shoot to achieve financial freedom. Of course, there are numerous early retirement success stories on Reddit, with a number of Millennials and Gen X&#8217;ers boasting nest eggs sizeable enough to retire well before the traditional (think Social Security-eligible age) finish line. Of course, an earlier retirement will be &#8220;leaner&#8221; (think less extravagant spending) than if you&#8217;d retired later. Either way, the key is staying ahead and taking advantage of any 401(k) matches an employer may offer. In this piece, we&#8217;ll explore the case of a 27-year-old who&#8217;s faring quite well, with $33,000 saved up in a Roth and close to $50,000 in the 401(k), comprising an impressive net worth of just north of the $100,000 mark. This relatively young over-achiever shared their biggest wins on Reddit. For the young readers striving to get ahead at a young age, here are the most important takeaways, at least in my view. Key Points This 27-year-old over-achiever is off to a hot start. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s in their well-balanced $100k portfolio. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Keeping contributions consistent and investing in the steady blue-chips Having a look at their portfolio, it&#8217;s clear they&#8217;re not investing like many people in their age group. Indeed, someone in their late-20s would probably be likelier to speculate on the hot tech stock of the day in search of the next timely double. Instead, the Reddit user seems to have opted for &#8220;boring&#8221; stocks that, I believe, are more common in the portfolio of a much older investor (think a retiree). Indeed, investing with such a balanced approach at a young age can be a wise long-term move, given stocks don&#8217;t always go up — something many market newcomers discovered in the Trump 2.0 term. So, what&#8217;s at the core of their portfolio? First, there&#8217;s quite a bit of index funds in there, with low-cost S&amp;P 500 ETFs topping the list. Pretty solid blue chips make up the core of this portfolio With a bit of Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) sprinkled on top, the Reddit user has a nice balance of growth and stability. Looking further under the hood, we see some rock-solid blue-chip names like Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) — staples for many retirees. However, it&#8217;s not all boring retiree-friendly stocks. The Reddit user has a mix of &#8220;growthier&#8221; Magnificent Seven names — like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) — to balance things out. Overall, it&#8217;s a very well-rounded and balanced portfolio that looks like it can hold up in this market hailstorm. As the market turns lower, here&#8217;s hoping the Reddit user adds to fallen positions on weakness. Indeed, the first $100,000 is just the start, as they embark on a multi-decade journey towards (early) retirement. Personally, I&#8217;d suggest adding more to index funds (S&amp;P 500 or the QQQ) on further weakness to simplify things. A correction has struck, making it a great time to top-up on low-cost index funds, especially since the market is moving faster than one can keep up with a rather long list of individual names. As for the other names, I&#8217;d encourage the investor to do their own homework and pare positions that have become overbought. For instance, 3M and CAT stand out as names that may make sense to take profits in. The bottom line This self-guided Reddit user acts as a great example for how new investors should go about beginning their retirement journeys. They&#8217;ve got a balanced portfolio and seem well-equipped to win at the long-term game! Though they&#8217;re a tad light on tech compared to most other young people, I do think they&#8217;re well-insulated from a bursting of an AI bubble — that is, if one even exists.The post I&#8217;m 27 and have I have $33,000 in a Roth and $48,000 in my 401K.
