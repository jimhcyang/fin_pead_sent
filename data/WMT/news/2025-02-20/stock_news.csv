(NYSE WMT) founder Sam Walton, has lost $600 million of their net worth so far this year. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Jim, Bob, and Alice Walton have each lost over $600 million in net worth so far this year. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Jim, Bob, and Alice Walton have each lost $609 million since January 1. However, each still has $124 billion. The family still owns 45% of Walmart’s stock, which is America’s largest company based on revenue. Sam Walton died in 1992. Walmart was started in 1962 by Sam Walton. Today, it has over 10,000 locations worldwide and employs 2.1 million people. It is the largest employer in the United States, with 1.2 million workers. Last year, the global revenue total was $650 billion. Walmart claims that in the U.S., where it has over 4,000 stores, 90% of the population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart location. Walmart’s shares have been good to the family. They are up 164% in the past five years and 85% in the past year. Its current market cap is $850 billion. Interestingly, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) was supposed to put Walmart out of business. Two decades ago, e-commerce was viewed as superior to brick-and-mortar retail. Amazon has been blamed for the demise of Sears, Kmart, and J.C. Penney. Walmart used its size, created its own e-commerce business, and built a model where people can order online and pick up at stores to compete with Amazon.

That makes him the eighth wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: The net worth of Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates has increased by $9 billion so far this year to $168 billion. That makes him the eighth-wealthiest person in the world. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) He will not top any billionaire lists again. Several people are too far ahead of him, including Elon Musk. His net worth is nearly $450 billion, and he has topped the billionaire list for several months. Gates was the richest man in the world from 1995 to 2017 (except for 2008). Gates was chief executive officer of Microsoft from 1975 to 2000. He left primarily to pursue his philanthropic interests. He and his ex-wife started their foundation, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, in 2000. As of 2023, the foundation had given away $78 billion, primarily to environmental causes and gender inequality. Unlike many of the richest people in the world, Gates’s wealth is spread across many investments. His 1.3% ownership of Microsoft is worth about $60 billion. He has followed the example of his close friend Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Gates’s diversification runs across many public companies, including Buffett’s. He also owns stock in Walmart and FedEx. Gates also has tens of billions of dollars in Cascade Investment, which holds his stake in private companies, ranging from Ritz Carlton to nuclear energy startup TerraPower. He and his wife, Melinda French Gates, divorced in 2021. It is rumored that Melinda received $76 billion.

The Dow is spiraling by 500 points and is being pressured by retailer Walmart (NYSE: WMT), whose earnings results confirmed tariff-related fears. Among the few technology gainers are Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) as of early trading. Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is among the rare gainers in the Dow today. Walmart warned that its profit growth is expected to slow down amid the company’s vulnerability to the likely Mexico and Canada tariffs. Walmart’s stock is down over 6% despite beating consensus estimates on the top and bottom lines in its fiscal Q4 as Wall Street focuses on an uncertain future. Nevertheless, TD Cowen analyst Oliver Chen told Yahoo Finance that Walmart is “hitting on all cylinders” for now, pointing to a resilient consumer that continues to drive revenue. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 502.74 (-1.13) Nasdaq Composite: -165.58 (-0.80%) S&amp;P 500: Down 44.26 (-0.72%) Key Points The Dow Jones Industrial Average is spiraling by 500 points. Alibaba shares are soaring after a blowout quarterly earnings report. Big Tech stocks are mixed. Palantir is sinking on fears of U.S. defense budget cuts. Market Movers Alibaba is boosting tech sentiment today, rising 11.7% on the heels of its fiscal Q3 earnings report, which executives attributed “robust” AI momentum . The company’s results were driven by cloud technology as well as AI-product revenue, both of which have been soaring. Alibaba is also receiving tailwind’s from China’s competitive AI investments, including DeepSeek, as a result of which BABA stock has skyrocketed 50% so far in 2025. Palantir Technologies (Nasdaq: PLTR) is giving up some of its recent gains, falling below the psychologically sensitive $100 level today amid a 13% drop in the stock. The Trump Administration is defense budget cuts, the industry for which Palantir creates AI-powered software solutions. Toy company Hasbro (NYSE: HAS) is among the winners in today’s session, gaining 11% on the heels of a quarterly earnings and revenue beat. Hasbro has also launched a new line of PLAY-DOH Barbie dolls in a licensing partnership with Mattel that is set to hit the store shelves at Target (NYSE: TGT). Apple shares are posting fractional gains a day after introducing the lower-priced iPhone 16. Citi analysts expect this model will represent 10% of the company’s units sold in 2025.

Here Are the Current Social Rules,"If you live in the United States and polled 100 people about something financial that has gotten out of hand lately, I hope tipping is the top answer. We now live in a world where businesses that would have never dreamed of asking for a tip, like a clothing retailer, ask for tips with every transaction. Key Points For better or worse, the tipping culture in America isn’t going anywhere. The reality is that the rise of digital checkouts has only made tipping more pervasive wherever you shop. There are some absolute rules and general guidelines for how much to leave as a tip. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) The massive shift in tipping culture now begs the question of what the new social rules should be. What is the proper etiquette in different establishments? When should or shouldn’t you leave a tip? Unfortunately, the answer isn’t so easy. 20. Why Has Tipping Changed? Many places seem to blame the pandemic as tipping became integral to supporting essential workers. However, one of the more logical reasons is the rise of digital payment systems, which can display a tipping option right in front of customers before they complete their transaction. This has made it easy for businesses to make tipping a focal point of every purchase. 19. What Do Americans Really Think? Most discussions around the tipping culture change point back to a 2023 Pew Research poll that indicates over one-third of all Americans feel it’s “very easy” to know when to tip. Conversely, an equal number of people also claimed that they found it “not too easy or not at all easy” when asked if they know how much to tip in certain situations. Of the 12,000 respondents, 72% indicated they were being asked to tip more frequently than in the past. 18. Is Tipping Here To Say? By all accounts, tipping isn’t going anywhere, and we shouldn’t expect it to disappear overnight. Restaurants could start building the cost of tipping into their prices to pay servers a fair wage, but then higher food prices would turn away customers, so this isn’t a solution. While other countries may not rely so heavily on tipping, expect the US to rely on it for the foreseeable future. 17. Miscellaneous Roles Unsurprisingly, there are a host of roles where a tip might be something you consider but is not required. This might be a job like an exterminator, carpet installer, or window washer. Generally, $10 or $20 is acceptable in these cases, but you don’t need to exceed this number. In the case of a camp counselor or teacher, pool together money with the rest of the parents and provide one significant gift. 16. House Movers If you are moving homes, whether down the street or across the country, these individuals are lifting a lot, and potentially even packing for you. As a result, your tip should be hefty enough to make it meaningful, which is why 15% to 20% of the total move cost is appropriate. 15. Coat Check If you are in a place where a coat check is used, the acceptable norm is likely to be between $1 per coat and $2 if you have a bag. 14. Hotel Housekeeper This isn’t one of those roles that generally gets a tip as sometimes you may never see housekeepers’ work. However, if you can tip a housekeeper in a hotel, the rule of thumb is around $5 per night. 13. Salon At the salon, whether it’s a hair stylist, manicurist, or someone who provides facials, the same general rule is likely to apply. Upwards of 15% to 20% is the socially acceptable norm for any of these roles. 12. Baggage Handler At an airport or hotel, if you are providing your luggage to someone at the curb or inside a hotel lobby, it’s appropriate to generally tip around $1 to $2 per bag, depending on the number of bags. The same rule applies if you also hand your bags to someone at a cruise port. 11. Uber Drivers This applies to both Uber and Lyft, but this is another instance where the proper etiquette would be around 20% of the ride total. You might want to up this amount during a busy time like a concert or sports game where traffic is worse. 10. Grocery Delivery If you use something like Shipt or Walmart+ and have your groceries delivered, someone took a lot of time to get everything you wanted on your list. This is why experts say that 15% or 20% of the order total is the least you can tip. 9. Meal Delivery This is a controversial one as it depends on the kind of delivery driver. Your Amazon delivery driver? No tip is required, but the argument changes if it’s someone from DoorDash or GrubHub. This role is highly dependent on tips, and, as a result, you should tip around 20% or $5, depending on whichever is greater. 8. Coffee Shops This is a tough one because it depends on whether a tip is included on a screen or, in the case of a Starbucks, in a jar sitting at the register. Ideally, experts recommend as much as 15% of the cost of your coffee or latte. Even sticking a dollar in the jar is a welcome gesture. 7. Car Valet If you need a valet for your car at a shopping mall, restaurant, or airport, tipping in this space is expected. Ideally, experts say you should plan to do between $2 and $5 when your car is returned. 6. Babysitter While babysitters might make an agreed-upon hourly wage that varies based on the age of the child and the number of children, tips are not uncommon. Parents who want to keep a babysitter returning regularly should focus on rounding up any totals to try and add a little more to the balance to show appreciation. 5. Tour Guide This is a challenging one because it really depends on how much work the tour guide puts into the tour. A full-day tour? This should have a larger tip than someone who spends an hour working with you. Still, figure between 10 and 20% of the cost. 4. Bar Tabs Generally speaking, if you tip a bartender after closing out a bar tab or even just paying for one drink, think anywhere between 15% and 20% of the total. 3. Spa Services Another important tipping location is for spa service providers, who have long depended on tips as part of their wages. In these cases, experts tend to agree that 20% of the total cost of the spa day is appropriate. 2. Group Dining This is a tough one, as not every restaurant includes a separate check. However, whether you pay as a group with cash or get checks individually, the tip should reflect the same percentage. In other words, it should be roughly 20% of your portion of the bill. 1. Restaurant Tipping In one of the few business types where tipping is not only okay but expected, the same general longstanding amount rules continue to apply. On average, it’s recommended to tip between 18% and 20% of the total bill (including tax). So a $100 restaurant check would require a $20 tip or more, depending on the level of service.
