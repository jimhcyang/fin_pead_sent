This acquisition marks a significant milestone for Virtus Diversified REIT as it continues to strengthen its retail presence with reliable anchor tenants in strong markets across Canada. “This acquisition is a great example of our ‘make the money on the buy' strategy,” said Aurelio Baglione, CEO of Virtus. “We originally tied up this property for $5.25 million, we walked away from the deal because I thought we could do better. I was re-approached by the broker 4 months ago and was able to negotiate a purchase price of $3.95 million. I'm thrilled to announce that the purchase has closed.”",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Express Co. (AXP Quick QuoteAXP - Free Report) , Walmart Inc. (WMT Quick QuoteWMT - Free Report) , Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN Quick QuoteAMZN - Free Report) , The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS Quick QuoteGS - Free Report) and Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK Quick QuoteMRK - Free Report) .Stocks Powering the Dow ETF Year to DateThe Dow Jones Industrial Average touched the milestone of 40,000 for the first time on strong corporate earnings and renewed bets for rate cuts. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF, which tracks the Dow Jones Index, has gained 6.4% so far this year. While most of the stocks in the ETF portfolio have been rising this year, we have highlighted five that have been leading the way higher. These are American Express Co., Walmart Inc., Amazon.com Inc., The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Merck & Co. Inc. The blue-chip index has outperformed in recent months, with the broadening out of the stock market rally beyond the tech sector. Cyclical stocks, banks and small-cap stocks have all shown an upward trend in recent weeks, powering the blue-chip index. Bouts of stronger earnings and stronger guidance from many mega-cap stocks also propelled the index (read: ETFs to Bet on Dow Jones' Longest Winning Streak of 2024).The reconstruction of the blue-chip index is also paying off. Amazon, which joined the index on Feb 26, provided a boost to the index after it reported blockbuster first-quarter 2024 results. The e-commerce giant beat both earnings and revenue estimates driven by growth in its advertising and AI-powered cloud computing units.Inflation in the United States cooled down for the first time in six months, sparking new bets on Fed rate cuts as soon as September. Low rates are favorable for stocks as they reduce the cost of borrowing, often needed to finance the expansion of companies. Lower rates typically reduce the attractiveness of fixed-income investments like bonds, leading investors to seek higher returns in the equity markets. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, around 70% of traders now expect at least one cut by the September meeting, a notable increase from a week ago.DIA in FocusSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with AUM of $33.3 billion and an average daily volume of 3.7 million shares. It tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, holding 30 stocks in its basket, with each making up for less than 8.6% share. Financials (23.2%), information technology (18.8%), healthcare (18.5%), consumer discretionary (14.7%) and industrials (13.9%) are the top five sectors (read: ETFs to Make the Most of the Sector Rotation).SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF charges 16 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.Best-Performing Stocks of DIAAmerican Express is a diversified financial services company offering charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services worldwide. Shares of AXP have risen 28.8% so far this year. American Express earnings are expected to grow 15% this year. It makes up for 3.97% share in DIA portfolio.

All three of these dividend payers have long histories of steady annual dividend raises. Plus, they offer yields above 5% at recent prices. Nobody's expecting huge payout bumps from these well-established businesses. With strong advantages against competitors, though, there's a good chance they can maintain their payout-raising streaks long enough to fuel your retirement dreams. Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that leases commercial property to well-established organizations such as Walmart, Dollar General, and Tractor Supply Company. At recent prices, the stock offers a 5.6% dividend yield plus a couple of features its shareholders appreciate. Realty Income makes monthly dividend payments, and you never need to wait long for a raise. This REIT raises its payout every quarter and recently announced its 125th payout bump since becoming a publicly traded company about 30 years ago. Grocery stores, dollar stores, and home improvement stores have ups and downs, but they aren't likely to go belly up during economic downturns. Plus, their physical locations are likely to remain relevant despite an ongoing shift toward online shopping. In addition to selecting tenants that can reliably pay rent, Realty Income employs net leases that transfer all the variable costs of building ownership, such as taxes and maintenance to the tenant. This makes the company's cash flows so stable that it sports an A3 credit rating from Moody's. Despite 30 years of operation, there's still plenty of independently owned commercial real estate that could fit into Realty Income's portfolio. With a credit rating that's better than the vast majority of its peers, there's a good chance this REIT can continue attracting quality tenants and raising its dividend through your retirement. Cigarette smoking has been in decline for decades but this hasn't stopped Altria Group from steadily raising its dividend. Last August, the U.S. tobacco giant behind the leading Marlboro brand announced its 58th dividend increase in 54 years. Despite a long history of consecutive annual dividend payout bumps, the market isn't expecting Altria Group's streak to continue. The stock offers an ultra-high 8.5% yield at recent prices. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned flavored e-vapor devices, even though consumers of all ages appear to prefer them. The ban led to a huge illicit market, but access to flavored vaporizers like Elf Bar will get harder to access, at least in the U.S., where Altria does business. In late 2023, the FDA began partnering with Customs and Border Protection to begin seizing shipments of illegal vaporizers. So far this year, it's also issued warning letters to 61 brick-and-mortar retailers and 22 online retailers for carrying illicit devices. Increased enforcement of the FDA's flavor ban is great news for Altria. Last year, it acquired NJOY, which is one of just three brands of FDA-authorized e-cigarettes on the market today. Shares of the pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer offer a 5.9% dividend yield at recent prices. It has the shortest streak on this list, but after raising its payout for 15 consecutive years, this is a very reliable dividend stock. Pfizer's revenue stream swelled up on sales of Comirnaty, a COVID-19 vaccine, and Paxlovid, a COVID-19 antiviral treatment. Unfortunately, demand for these two products evaporated faster than expected. The stock has been under pressure because trailing-12-month sales are down by about $50 billion from their peak in 2022. Pfizer has reinvested its COVID-19 windfall in new revenue streams, and the plan is working well. Despite the loss of most COVID-19-related sales trailing 12-month revenue is 45.5% higher now than it was at the beginning of the pandemic. Pfizer has reinvested its COVID-19 windfall in new drugs that could allow it to keep raising its payout for many years to come. In addition to acquiring Seagen and all four of its marketed cancer therapies, the FDA approved nine new drugs from Pfizer last year. Adding some shares to a diversified portfolio and holding them throughout your retirement years looks like a smart move for most income-seeking investors.

    "text": "LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Achates Power, Inc. (API) showcased at ACT Expo what has been demonstrated as the cleanest and most efficient internal combustion engine (ICE) architecture to date. Demonstrations have proven ability to satisfy regulatory requirements without detriment to the fleets or economy. “In pursuit of clean technology, it’s critical to place priority on the fleets and drivers. Technology-forcing regulations with uncertainty on infrastructure, cost, and capability to ‘do the job’ make it difficult to navigate this energy transition,” said Dave Crompton, CEO of API. “For the first time, an ICE architecture has been simultaneously proven to reduce NOx, beat the most stringent regulations proposed with margin to spare, and improve real world fuel economy by as much as 20%, while demonstrating extended life compliance.” API demonstrated the opposed-piston (OP) architecture is capable of using today’s aftertreatment systems to meet tomorrow’s ultra-low NOx emissions standards with robust compliance through the 800,000 mile useful life requirements. Low-load, idle, and off-cycle emissions capability positions this to be the best combustion technology in the industry. Stringent emissions regulations in commercial trucking are to a point where aftertreatment systems’ cost and complexity may drive truck costs higher, reliability lower, and penalize fuel economy. In a joint demonstration with CALSTART and Walmart, an API 10.6 liter engine was retrofitted into a production class 8 truck to meet the proposed 2027 ultra-low NOx emissions standard and with an off-the-shelf current production one-box aftertreatment system. Testing in California achieved up to 10.8 mpg on a 389 mile delivery route averaging 10% better fuel economy than baseline with the advantage increasing to 22% on some routes. In February at Argonne National Laboratory, the Department of Energy began testing an API engine utilizing hydrogen combustion with compression ignition. The simplicity of this design enables an easier transition to hydrogen combustion over 4-stroke concepts. In joint testing with renewable diesel producer Neste, the already proven 10% greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reduction of the OP engine was amplified when using R99. Testing resulted in 4-5% GHG emissions reduction compared to fossil diesel across all test cycles - the lowest GHG level API measured to-date. Benefits of the API engines include lower heat rejection, higher power density, and fewer moving parts for better reliability and increased fuel efficiency. Every stroke is a power stroke, providing optimal thermal efficiency. This matters to fleets for 2027 and beyond emissions regulations where thermal management impacts aftertreatment cost, simplicity and functionality. API technology is obtainable without the use of exotic materials, non-conventional manufacturing, or complex aftertreatment systems - making it a ‘now’ solution for the fleets. “API has demonstrated that its technology can be put into practical use without the added complexity, cost and reliability concerns associated with stretching conventional engines and emission systems to meet the future low NOx and CO2 limits, and without the need for a fleet to redesign routes around shorter-range vehicles and sparse refueling/recharging infrastructure,” said Dr. John Wall, Board of Directors, API and former Cummins CTO. “For fleets that ultimately want to reach zero-net-carbon emissions, including renewable diesel and hydrogen, the Achates technology is a good match.\" This architecture can be manufactured through sustainable assembly practices and with approximately 300 fewer parts compared to today’s 4-stroke engines. Materials can be procured through today’s supply chain efficiently supporting the manufacturing of this engine architecture without sourcing disruptions and constraints.

By reducing the prices on household essentials from groceries like milk, meat, bread, soda, fresh fruit, vegetables, yogurt and coffee to diapers, paper towels and pet food, consumers will collectively save consumers millions of dollars, Target said. Target said it has already cut prices on 1,500 items and that \"thousands more price cuts\" will take effect over the course of the summer. \"Target routinely adjusts its prices to ensure it is competitive within the markets it does business,\" Target said. WALMART CFO SAYS 'MANY CONSUMER POCKETBOOKS' ARE BEING STRETCHED AS HIGH INFLATION PERSISTS It's the latest company to announce price cuts for its products in recent weeks to help consumers that are still being squeezed by inflation. Last week, Walmart executives told analysts on an earnings call that its rollback count is up. Rollbacks refer to temporary price reductions on goods. U.S. Walmart CEO John Furner specified that the company has nearly 7,000 rollbacks across the store. In April, the grocery rollback count was up 45% year over year. ALDI CUTTING PRICES ON HUNDREDS OF ITEMS TO FIGHT 'STUBBORN INFLATION' Earlier this month, discount grocer Aldi announced it was passing along $100 million in savings by slashing prices on more than 250 items through Labor Day. Inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target and continues to create severe financial pressures for most U.S. households. In April, inflation climbed 3.4% from the same time last year, down from the 3.5% reading in March. While inflation has fallen considerably from a peak of 9.1%, progress has largely flatlined since the summer. The Census Bureau reported last week that retail sales in April were unchanged from March and up 3% from the prior year.

    "text": "Target (TGT) will slash prices on thousands of essential household items as inflation lingers and Walmart (WMT) emerges as a more potent competitor. Target stock fell with Walmart stock sliding back into buy range. Other notable discounters, including TJX Cos. (TJX) and Dollar General (DG), also retreated. The big-box retailer announced on Monday that it is lowering prices on roughly 5,000 everyday items ranging from milk, meat and bread to diapers, paper towels and pet food. Some 1,500 reductions have already been made, with more coming over the summer. Target said it routinely adjusts prices to stay competitive. Amid stubborn inflation, Target also faces increased competition from Walmart. That larger rival last week reported robust earnings as price-conscious shoppers continue to search for cheaper essentials. Notably, Walmart said it continues to attract more frequent and new shoppers, while it's starting to see more higher-income shoppers hit its stores. Target uses a low-pricing strategy similar to Walmart but enjoys a more upscale image. \"We know consumers are feeling pressured to make the most of their budget, and Target is here to help them save more,\" Target Executive Vice President Rick Gomez said in Monday's news release. Target reports earnings for the first quarter early Wednesday. Analysts expect the retailer to report a 3.7% decline in same-store sales. Meanwhile, nearly two dozen analysts have hiked price targets on Walmart stock since the company's Q1 earnings report, FactSet shows. Walmart \"has what all cohorts are looking for,\" Bank of America analysts said, reiterating a buy rating and raising the PT from $67 to $75. Shares of Target fell 2.1% to 156.71 on the stock market today. Target stock continues to work on a 181.86 flat-base buy point, but it's below the 50-day line and near the bottom of the consolidation. Walmart stock gave up 0.7% to 64.21, back in range from an earnings breakaway gap-up from a double-bottom base last week. Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe said on Monday that Target's price cuts may hurt margins but could improve efficiencies, driving more profitable growth ahead. Tarlowe expects Target to affirm its prior full-year guidance. The retailer's price reductions could ripple across the value-oriented and off-price merchandise chain. This week, TJX, BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) and Ross Stores (ROST) all report earnings, with investors eager to learn the latest on still-high inflation. Costco Wholesale (COST), Dollar General and Burlington Stores (BURL) report next week. Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Kroger (KR) have yet to announce dates. Amazon (AMZN) has already reported. The e-commerce giant said its customers continue to shop though they are cautious, trading down to lower-price items and seeking out deals. Off-price giant TJX fell roughly 2.4% with earnings expected Wednesday, while peers Ross and Burlington edged lower. Dollar General stock sank 3% while Dollar Tree retreated 3.3% to a six-month low. Warehouse membership chain Costco nudged lower and BJ's edged higher. Grocery giant Kroger and Amazon lost a fraction apiece.
